the health experts of chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives and their coalition partners from the social democrats have met on various occasions only to see their compromises unraveled by inner-party critics and from outside .
now they 've come up with obligatory health insurance for all in germany as a panacea for the ailing healthcare system .
ulla schmidt described the new plan as an historic move capable of resolving a series of current problems . " as a result of rising health costs even the more affluent germans have no longer been able to pay treatment costs without insurance , " she said on friday " and an obligatory health insurance scheme is also the best protection against abuse , because individual health costs can no longer be passed on to society as a whole . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt obligatory health insurance was schmidt 's idea in her attempt to break an impasse in the talks over the future of private insurance companies .
in contrast to public health insurance funds in which the majority of germans are insured , the wealthiest 10 percent of the population can get private insurance which offers better services .
insurance regardless of health or age until thursday night there had been a huge dispute about whether or not private insurance companies must open themselves to uninsured people without being allowed to check on an applicant 's health .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- were strongly in favor of the plan , saying it was a contribution to national solidarity .
the conservatives rejected it , arguing it would ruin private insurance companies .
the spd finally dropped their demand , putting off a decision for later . " i 'm convinced the agreement we 've reached no longer threatens the existence of the private insurance companies , " wolfgang zöllner , the conservatives ' chief negotiator , said .
" they will remain an essential part of the german healthcare system . "
a reform only for now ?
experts estimate that 200,000 to 300,000 people in germany do not have health insurance .

" it is not acceptable when there are no consultations about such moves , " said merkel . " that repeatedly destroys confidence and you can not build cooperation based on true mutual trust in this way .

dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning says that it is up to the european union to uphold the banner of human rights in the world . it seems as if conditions at the us prison camp in guantanamo could be lending a fatal kind of pseudo-legitimacy to the " treatment " of despots , dictators and their helpers : if the most powerful democracy in the world - the usa - debases the standards of human rights or , in the case of torture , seems to be ignoring them altogether , one wonders why anybody else would bother to observe them . human rights - and this is what the human rights watch report clearly shows - are endangered all over the world .
peaceful coexistence , human progress and the overcoming of unworthy living conditions are , however , possible only if human rights are constitutionally guaranteed through civil society .
this is what europe has learned from its centuries of conflicts and wars . today , the countries of the european union would like to contribute to peace , security , globally sustainable development and mutual respect among nations .
this is , among other things , what the eu formulated in the draft of its constitution .
europe , however , can take over the vacant leading role in the area of human rights only if the political will for such a project prevails . that 's why we must put an end to secret prisons and secret transfers of prisoners without any rights !
the primacy of human rights for the eu 's anti-terror policy must be re-established on all levels .
but other human rights should also be guaranteed better in the future , for example in the context of protecting refugees , asylum procedures , and in the fights against human trafficking and against racism and anti-semitism . strengthening human rights through foreign policy is also important .
it could , for instance , take the shape of exerting more pressure on russia , china and the usa to rectify their current human rights deficits .
that and an engaged commitment to the newly established un human rights council would create a chance for human rights to again become the measure of political action worldwide . only if europe improves its human rights credibility in action , both internally and externally , can the registered erosion of human rights be stopped and a new path forged .

dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning says that it is up to the european union to uphold the banner of human rights in the world . it seems as if conditions at the us prison camp in guantanamo could be lending a fatal kind of pseudo-legitimacy to the " treatment " of despots , dictators and their helpers : if the most powerful democracy in the world - the usa - debases the standards of human rights or , in the case of torture , seems to be ignoring them altogether , one wonders why anybody else would bother to observe them . human rights - and this is what the human rights watch report clearly shows - are endangered all over the world .
peaceful coexistence , human progress and the overcoming of unworthy living conditions are , however , possible only if human rights are constitutionally guaranteed through civil society .
this is what europe has learned from its centuries of conflicts and wars . today , the countries of the european union would like to contribute to peace , security , globally sustainable development and mutual respect among nations .
this is , among other things , what the eu formulated in the draft of its constitution .
europe , however , can take over the vacant leading role in the area of human rights only if the political will for such a project prevails . that 's why we must put an end to secret prisons and secret transfers of prisoners without any rights !
the primacy of human rights for the eu 's anti-terror policy must be re-established on all levels .
but other human rights should also be guaranteed better in the future , for example in the context of protecting refugees , asylum procedures , and in the fights against human trafficking and against racism and anti-semitism . strengthening human rights through foreign policy is also important .
it could , for instance , take the shape of exerting more pressure on russia , china and the usa to rectify their current human rights deficits .
that and an engaged commitment to the newly established un human rights council would create a chance for human rights to again become the measure of political action worldwide . only if europe improves its human rights credibility in action , both internally and externally , can the registered erosion of human rights be stopped and a new path forged .

dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning says that it is up to the european union to uphold the banner of human rights in the world . it seems as if conditions at the us prison camp in guantanamo could be lending a fatal kind of pseudo-legitimacy to the " treatment " of despots , dictators and their helpers : if the most powerful democracy in the world - the usa - debases the standards of human rights or , in the case of torture , seems to be ignoring them altogether , one wonders why anybody else would bother to observe them . human rights - and this is what the human rights watch report clearly shows - are endangered all over the world .
peaceful coexistence , human progress and the overcoming of unworthy living conditions are , however , possible only if human rights are constitutionally guaranteed through civil society .
this is what europe has learned from its centuries of conflicts and wars . today , the countries of the european union would like to contribute to peace , security , globally sustainable development and mutual respect among nations .
this is , among other things , what the eu formulated in the draft of its constitution .
europe , however , can take over the vacant leading role in the area of human rights only if the political will for such a project prevails . that 's why we must put an end to secret prisons and secret transfers of prisoners without any rights !
the primacy of human rights for the eu 's anti-terror policy must be re-established on all levels .
but other human rights should also be guaranteed better in the future , for example in the context of protecting refugees , asylum procedures , and in the fights against human trafficking and against racism and anti-semitism . strengthening human rights through foreign policy is also important .
it could , for instance , take the shape of exerting more pressure on russia , china and the usa to rectify their current human rights deficits .
that and an engaged commitment to the newly established un human rights council would create a chance for human rights to again become the measure of political action worldwide . only if europe improves its human rights credibility in action , both internally and externally , can the registered erosion of human rights be stopped and a new path forged .

the health experts of chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives and their coalition partners from the social democrats have met on various occasions only to see their compromises unraveled by inner-party critics and from outside .
now they 've come up with obligatory health insurance for all in germany as a panacea for the ailing healthcare system .
ulla schmidt described the new plan as an historic move capable of resolving a series of current problems . " as a result of rising health costs even the more affluent germans have no longer been able to pay treatment costs without insurance , " she said on friday " and an obligatory health insurance scheme is also the best protection against abuse , because individual health costs can no longer be passed on to society as a whole . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt obligatory health insurance was schmidt 's idea in her attempt to break an impasse in the talks over the future of private insurance companies .
in contrast to public health insurance funds in which the majority of germans are insured , the wealthiest 10 percent of the population can get private insurance which offers better services .
insurance regardless of health or age until thursday night there had been a huge dispute about whether or not private insurance companies must open themselves to uninsured people without being allowed to check on an applicant 's health .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- were strongly in favor of the plan , saying it was a contribution to national solidarity .
the conservatives rejected it , arguing it would ruin private insurance companies .
the spd finally dropped their demand , putting off a decision for later . " i 'm convinced the agreement we 've reached no longer threatens the existence of the private insurance companies , " wolfgang zöllner , the conservatives ' chief negotiator , said .
" they will remain an essential part of the german healthcare system . "
a reform only for now ?
experts estimate that 200,000 to 300,000 people in germany do not have health insurance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , doctors protested the changes already made to the healthcare system for months the health experts from both the social democrats and the conservatives expect the reform to pass parliament in a vote in february and get approval in the upper house of parliament , which represents the federal states , soon thereafter .
critics of the reform say that in spite of parliamentary support , the proposals are unlikely to remedy the health system 's chronic cash-shortage .
it will do little to reign in spiraling health costs , they say , and increase health fund revenues in view of a dwindling and ageing german population .

the only question remaining is when . poland and other new eu members are on their way to the euro zone . as a part of joining the european union , all new member states have agreed to the goal of introducing the euro as their own currency . but in order to enter the euro zone , poland and the other members must fulfill two general conditions .
first , they must meet the requirements of the maastricht treaty , and second , they must take part in the european exchange rate mechanism .
that means their exchange rates must not fluctuate more than 15 percent against the euro over a period of two years . so the question is not whether poland and other new eu members will introduce the currency but when . poland and the euro bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many polish people remain skeptical about the euro as it stands now , malta and cyprus will join the euro zone next year , with slovakia following in 2009 .
but for the other new member states , the timing is still unknown . poland has already met three of the four economic conditions for entering the euro zone . its inflation and interests rates are below the maximum level allowed , and the country 's debt does not cross the limit .
but the country 's budget deficit is still too high for eu standards . " poland must follow through on some financial reforms , " marek zuber , an economy advisor to prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , has said .
" the most important and highest priority for us is the social welfare contributions , which are too high . " an anti-euro government ? since joining the european union in 2004 , public and governmental support for the euro has been mixed . support is high in the cities and lower in the countryside . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski -lrb- right -rrb- with brother lech are skeptical of the euro " i am skeptical , " kaczynski told a news conference in november .
" i think haste in this matter could seriously hurt us . " the law and justice party , led by the prime minister and his twin brother , president lech kaczynski , has repeatedly stated its uncertainty about any rush to join the euro zone since taking over the government in 2005 . in november , the polish government announced plans for a referendum concerning the adoption of the euro , stating the need to educate the public and to allow more time for the polish economy to develop .
the projected date for the referendum is 2010 . " we have to join the euro , but there 's no fixed deadline , so we can do it when the levels of economic development in poland and the euro zone are closer than they are now , " kaczynski said . no " opting out " of euro new eu states would be joining 13 counties now using the euro , including germany , france and the currency 's newest member , slovenia , which officially adopted the currency on jan .
1 . new member states may not opt out of the euro , as long-time members britain and denmark have . those two countries negotiated for opt-out clauses in the maastricht treaty .
denmark rejected joining the euro zone by referendum in 2000 . in announcing a referendum , poland has cited the example of sweden , which rejected the adoption of the euro by referendum in 2003 and has since showed no interest in revisiting the issue . old versus new europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro has been rising strongly against the dollar " i think that the old european countries fear the political balance of the european central bank will begin to waver with the accession of the new countries , " said former polish finance minister dariusz rossati , who is now a member of the european parliament . rossati believes fears that more euro zone members will weaken the currency are unfounded . " on the contrary , these countries can strengthen it -lrb- the euro -rrb- because the new countries have much less debt than the old , " he said . discussion over the euro comes at a time when the european currency has been gaining strongly , rising 35 percent against the dollar over the past three years . justyna bronska -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de major euro zone expansion now on hold slovenia , adopting the euro on jan .

the only question remaining is when . poland and other new eu members are on their way to the euro zone . as a part of joining the european union , all new member states have agreed to the goal of introducing the euro as their own currency . but in order to enter the euro zone , poland and the other members must fulfill two general conditions .
first , they must meet the requirements of the maastricht treaty , and second , they must take part in the european exchange rate mechanism .
that means their exchange rates must not fluctuate more than 15 percent against the euro over a period of two years . so the question is not whether poland and other new eu members will introduce the currency but when . poland and the euro bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many polish people remain skeptical about the euro as it stands now , malta and cyprus will join the euro zone next year , with slovakia following in 2009 .
but for the other new member states , the timing is still unknown . poland has already met three of the four economic conditions for entering the euro zone . its inflation and interests rates are below the maximum level allowed , and the country 's debt does not cross the limit .
but the country 's budget deficit is still too high for eu standards . " poland must follow through on some financial reforms , " marek zuber , an economy advisor to prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , has said .
" the most important and highest priority for us is the social welfare contributions , which are too high .

" i think haste in this matter could seriously hurt us . " the law and justice party , led by the prime minister and his twin brother , president lech kaczynski , has repeatedly stated its uncertainty about any rush to join the euro zone since taking over the government in 2005 . in november , the polish government announced plans for a referendum concerning the adoption of the euro , stating the need to educate the public and to allow more time for the polish economy to develop .
the projected date for the referendum is 2010 . " we have to join the euro , but there 's no fixed deadline , so we can do it when the levels of economic development in poland and the euro zone are closer than they are now , " kaczynski said . no " opting out " of euro new eu states would be joining 13 counties now using the euro , including germany , france and the currency 's newest member , slovenia , which officially adopted the currency on jan .
1 . new member states may not opt out of the euro , as long-time members britain and denmark have . those two countries negotiated for opt-out clauses in the maastricht treaty .
denmark rejected joining the euro zone by referendum in 2000 . in announcing a referendum , poland has cited the example of sweden , which rejected the adoption of the euro by referendum in 2003 and has since showed no interest in revisiting the issue . old versus new europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the euro has been rising strongly against the dollar " i think that the old european countries fear the political balance of the european central bank will begin to waver with the accession of the new countries , " said former polish finance minister dariusz rossati , who is now a member of the european parliament . rossati believes fears that more euro zone members will weaken the currency are unfounded . " on the contrary , these countries can strengthen it -lrb- the euro -rrb- because the new countries have much less debt than the old , " he said . discussion over the euro comes at a time when the european currency has been gaining strongly , rising 35 percent against the dollar over the past three years . justyna bronska -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de major euro zone expansion now on hold slovenia , adopting the euro on jan .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 13.01.2007 germany to introduce health care for all großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a compromise on healthcare reform was like pulling teeth health insurance will become obligatory for all german citizens in the wake of a landmark reform of the country 's healthcare system to come into effect in april . the breakthrough announced by health minister ulla schmidt on friday was n't the first , and maybe is n't the last , in the seemingly never-ending saga of germany 's health reform .
the health experts of chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives and their coalition partners from the social democrats have met on various occasions only to see their compromises unraveled by inner-party critics and from outside .
now they 've come up with obligatory health insurance for all in germany as a panacea for the ailing healthcare system .
ulla schmidt described the new plan as an historic move capable of resolving a series of current problems . " as a result of rising health costs even the more affluent germans have no longer been able to pay treatment costs without insurance , " she said on friday " and an obligatory health insurance scheme is also the best protection against abuse , because individual health costs can no longer be passed on to society as a whole . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt obligatory health insurance was schmidt 's idea in her attempt to break an impasse in the talks over the future of private insurance companies .
in contrast to public health insurance funds in which the majority of germans are insured , the wealthiest 10 percent of the population can get private insurance which offers better services .
insurance regardless of health or age until thursday night there had been a huge dispute about whether or not private insurance companies must open themselves to uninsured people without being allowed to check on an applicant 's health .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- were strongly in favor of the plan , saying it was a contribution to national solidarity .
the conservatives rejected it , arguing it would ruin private insurance companies .
the spd finally dropped their demand , putting off a decision for later . " i 'm convinced the agreement we 've reached no longer threatens the existence of the private insurance companies , " wolfgang zöllner , the conservatives ' chief negotiator , said .
" they will remain an essential part of the german healthcare system . "
a reform only for now ?
experts estimate that 200,000 to 300,000 people in germany do not have health insurance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , doctors protested the changes already made to the healthcare system for months the health experts from both the social democrats and the conservatives expect the reform to pass parliament in a vote in february and get approval in the upper house of parliament , which represents the federal states , soon thereafter .
critics of the reform say that in spite of parliamentary support , the proposals are unlikely to remedy the health system 's chronic cash-shortage .
it will do little to reign in spiraling health costs , they say , and increase health fund revenues in view of a dwindling and ageing german population .
they believe that in less than 10 years , the latest healthcare talks will turn into emergency sessions . uwe hessler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts testing electronic health records germany started testing electronic health insurance cards which will eventually contain the patients ' complete health history in digital format .

dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning says that it is up to the european union to uphold the banner of human rights in the world . it seems as if conditions at the us prison camp in guantanamo could be lending a fatal kind of pseudo-legitimacy to the " treatment " of despots , dictators and their helpers : if the most powerful democracy in the world - the usa - debases the standards of human rights or , in the case of torture , seems to be ignoring them altogether , one wonders why anybody else would bother to observe them . human rights - and this is what the human rights watch report clearly shows - are endangered all over the world .
peaceful coexistence , human progress and the overcoming of unworthy living conditions are , however , possible only if human rights are constitutionally guaranteed through civil society .
this is what europe has learned from its centuries of conflicts and wars . today , the countries of the european union would like to contribute to peace , security , globally sustainable development and mutual respect among nations .
this is , among other things , what the eu formulated in the draft of its constitution .
europe , however , can take over the vacant leading role in the area of human rights only if the political will for such a project prevails . that 's why we must put an end to secret prisons and secret transfers of prisoners without any rights !
the primacy of human rights for the eu 's anti-terror policy must be re-established on all levels .
but other human rights should also be guaranteed better in the future , for example in the context of protecting refugees , asylum procedures , and in the fights against human trafficking and against racism and anti-semitism . strengthening human rights through foreign policy is also important .
it could , for instance , take the shape of exerting more pressure on russia , china and the usa to rectify their current human rights deficits .
that and an engaged commitment to the newly established un human rights council would create a chance for human rights to again become the measure of political action worldwide . only if europe improves its human rights credibility in action , both internally and externally , can the registered erosion of human rights be stopped and a new path forged .
a leading role in this process belongs at the moment to germany - in its presidency of the european council , at the g8 summit and in the un human rights council . ulrike mast-kirschning is an editor at dw-radio -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stiff eu opposition to death penalty ahead of iraq executions as the eu underlined its opposition to the death penalty in the wake of the botched killing of saddam hussein , a pan-european human rights watchdog has appealed to iraq to stop all further executions .

a small number of protesters were also there , one of whom held a sign reading " brainwashing , no thank you . " scientology , whose followers include powerful hollywood film stars tom cruise and john travolta , remodeled a six-storey , 4,000-square-meter -lrb- 43,000-square-foot -rrb- building to boost its profile in the german capital . opponents say the group , which has rapidly expanded in europe in recent years , tries to lure impressionable young people with aggressive recruitment methods and harasses critics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small group of protesters showed up saturday an internal church of scientology document about the gleaming new center in berlin obtained by afp indicated that the group sought not only new members but also political influence in germany . " in order to implement our planetary salvation campaigns , we must have access to the highest levels of the german government in berlin , " it said . founded in the united states in 1954 by science-fiction writer l. ron hubbard , scientology was accorded the status of religion there in 1993 and enjoys exemption from paying taxes .
under observation but it is regarded with suspicion in many european countries - including belgium , france , germany and greece - where authorities contend its leaders seek economic gain and use totalitarian methods to keep supporters in line .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : l. ron hubbard german authorities say between 5,000 and 6,000 scientologists live in the country while the los angeles-based organization cites 30,000 . the group is under observation by the federal office for the protection of the constitution and several state security watchdogs , although not by the berlin authorities following a successful court challenge by the group . the secretary general of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , ronald pofalla , said the left-leaning government in berlin had made a serious mistake by allowing the new center to open . " it is intolerable that scientology can throw its weight around in the capital of germany , " he said . the chairman of the lutheran church in germany , wolfgang huber , said scientology had nothing to do with religion " and certainly nothing to do with christianity , " and should not enjoy the protection of the state .
" they want to pressure people and do business under the cloak of religion , " he told the berlin daily b.z. , adding that scientology aimed to make its followers into " perfect machines . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an image from a commercial for scientology a scientology expert with the hamburg interior ministry , ursula caberta , said the group aimed to undermine german democracy with a " cynical ideology . " " they want to be represented in all the capitals of europe , " caberta said , noting that the organization has already established centers in madrid , london and brussels .
citizens , not the state should decide , some say a scientology spokesman in berlin , however , denied in a brief statement that the group planned to meddle in political affairs . and the us state department has frequently criticized the policies of belgium , france and germany for its " discrimination against minority religions , " including scientology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom cruise is a scientologist despite deep skepticism about scientology in germany , some observers have argued against state suppression of the group , saying that german citizens should be trusted to discover any faults of the organization on their own . " if , for example , school children are being targeted for indoctrination with tutoring courses offered by scientology then the state must protect the weak , " berlin 's daily tagesspiegel wrote in an editorial this week .

the health experts of chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives and their coalition partners from the social democrats have met on various occasions only to see their compromises unraveled by inner-party critics and from outside .
now they 've come up with obligatory health insurance for all in germany as a panacea for the ailing healthcare system .
ulla schmidt described the new plan as an historic move capable of resolving a series of current problems . " as a result of rising health costs even the more affluent germans have no longer been able to pay treatment costs without insurance , " she said on friday " and an obligatory health insurance scheme is also the best protection against abuse , because individual health costs can no longer be passed on to society as a whole . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt obligatory health insurance was schmidt 's idea in her attempt to break an impasse in the talks over the future of private insurance companies .
in contrast to public health insurance funds in which the majority of germans are insured , the wealthiest 10 percent of the population can get private insurance which offers better services .
insurance regardless of health or age until thursday night there had been a huge dispute about whether or not private insurance companies must open themselves to uninsured people without being allowed to check on an applicant 's health .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- were strongly in favor of the plan , saying it was a contribution to national solidarity .
the conservatives rejected it , arguing it would ruin private insurance companies .
the spd finally dropped their demand , putting off a decision for later . " i 'm convinced the agreement we 've reached no longer threatens the existence of the private insurance companies , " wolfgang zöllner , the conservatives ' chief negotiator , said .
" they will remain an essential part of the german healthcare system . "
a reform only for now ?
experts estimate that 200,000 to 300,000 people in germany do not have health insurance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , doctors protested the changes already made to the healthcare system for months the health experts from both the social democrats and the conservatives expect the reform to pass parliament in a vote in february and get approval in the upper house of parliament , which represents the federal states , soon thereafter .
critics of the reform say that in spite of parliamentary support , the proposals are unlikely to remedy the health system 's chronic cash-shortage .
it will do little to reign in spiraling health costs , they say , and increase health fund revenues in view of a dwindling and ageing german population .

the health experts of chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives and their coalition partners from the social democrats have met on various occasions only to see their compromises unraveled by inner-party critics and from outside .
now they 've come up with obligatory health insurance for all in germany as a panacea for the ailing healthcare system .
ulla schmidt described the new plan as an historic move capable of resolving a series of current problems . " as a result of rising health costs even the more affluent germans have no longer been able to pay treatment costs without insurance , " she said on friday " and an obligatory health insurance scheme is also the best protection against abuse , because individual health costs can no longer be passed on to society as a whole . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt obligatory health insurance was schmidt 's idea in her attempt to break an impasse in the talks over the future of private insurance companies .
in contrast to public health insurance funds in which the majority of germans are insured , the wealthiest 10 percent of the population can get private insurance which offers better services .
insurance regardless of health or age until thursday night there had been a huge dispute about whether or not private insurance companies must open themselves to uninsured people without being allowed to check on an applicant 's health .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- were strongly in favor of the plan , saying it was a contribution to national solidarity .
the conservatives rejected it , arguing it would ruin private insurance companies .
the spd finally dropped their demand , putting off a decision for later . " i 'm convinced the agreement we 've reached no longer threatens the existence of the private insurance companies , " wolfgang zöllner , the conservatives ' chief negotiator , said .
" they will remain an essential part of the german healthcare system . "
a reform only for now ?
experts estimate that 200,000 to 300,000 people in germany do not have health insurance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , doctors protested the changes already made to the healthcare system for months the health experts from both the social democrats and the conservatives expect the reform to pass parliament in a vote in february and get approval in the upper house of parliament , which represents the federal states , soon thereafter .
critics of the reform say that in spite of parliamentary support , the proposals are unlikely to remedy the health system 's chronic cash-shortage .
it will do little to reign in spiraling health costs , they say , and increase health fund revenues in view of a dwindling and ageing german population .

the health experts of chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives and their coalition partners from the social democrats have met on various occasions only to see their compromises unraveled by inner-party critics and from outside .
now they 've come up with obligatory health insurance for all in germany as a panacea for the ailing healthcare system .
ulla schmidt described the new plan as an historic move capable of resolving a series of current problems . " as a result of rising health costs even the more affluent germans have no longer been able to pay treatment costs without insurance , " she said on friday " and an obligatory health insurance scheme is also the best protection against abuse , because individual health costs can no longer be passed on to society as a whole .

in contrast to public health insurance funds in which the majority of germans are insured , the wealthiest 10 percent of the population can get private insurance which offers better services .
insurance regardless of health or age until thursday night there had been a huge dispute about whether or not private insurance companies must open themselves to uninsured people without being allowed to check on an applicant 's health .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- were strongly in favor of the plan , saying it was a contribution to national solidarity .
the conservatives rejected it , arguing it would ruin private insurance companies .
the spd finally dropped their demand , putting off a decision for later . " i 'm convinced the agreement we 've reached no longer threatens the existence of the private insurance companies , " wolfgang zöllner , the conservatives ' chief negotiator , said .
" they will remain an essential part of the german healthcare system . "
a reform only for now ?
experts estimate that 200,000 to 300,000 people in germany do not have health insurance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , doctors protested the changes already made to the healthcare system for months the health experts from both the social democrats and the conservatives expect the reform to pass parliament in a vote in february and get approval in the upper house of parliament , which represents the federal states , soon thereafter .
critics of the reform say that in spite of parliamentary support , the proposals are unlikely to remedy the health system 's chronic cash-shortage .
it will do little to reign in spiraling health costs , they say , and increase health fund revenues in view of a dwindling and ageing german population .

the health experts of chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives and their coalition partners from the social democrats have met on various occasions only to see their compromises unraveled by inner-party critics and from outside .
now they 've come up with obligatory health insurance for all in germany as a panacea for the ailing healthcare system .
ulla schmidt described the new plan as an historic move capable of resolving a series of current problems . " as a result of rising health costs even the more affluent germans have no longer been able to pay treatment costs without insurance , " she said on friday " and an obligatory health insurance scheme is also the best protection against abuse , because individual health costs can no longer be passed on to society as a whole .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , doctors protested the changes already made to the healthcare system for months the health experts from both the social democrats and the conservatives expect the reform to pass parliament in a vote in february and get approval in the upper house of parliament , which represents the federal states , soon thereafter .
critics of the reform say that in spite of parliamentary support , the proposals are unlikely to remedy the health system 's chronic cash-shortage .

dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning says that it is up to the european union to uphold the banner of human rights in the world . it seems as if conditions at the us prison camp in guantanamo could be lending a fatal kind of pseudo-legitimacy to the " treatment " of despots , dictators and their helpers : if the most powerful democracy in the world - the usa - debases the standards of human rights or , in the case of torture , seems to be ignoring them altogether , one wonders why anybody else would bother to observe them . human rights - and this is what the human rights watch report clearly shows - are endangered all over the world .
peaceful coexistence , human progress and the overcoming of unworthy living conditions are , however , possible only if human rights are constitutionally guaranteed through civil society .
this is what europe has learned from its centuries of conflicts and wars . today , the countries of the european union would like to contribute to peace , security , globally sustainable development and mutual respect among nations .
this is , among other things , what the eu formulated in the draft of its constitution .
europe , however , can take over the vacant leading role in the area of human rights only if the political will for such a project prevails . that 's why we must put an end to secret prisons and secret transfers of prisoners without any rights !
the primacy of human rights for the eu 's anti-terror policy must be re-established on all levels .
but other human rights should also be guaranteed better in the future , for example in the context of protecting refugees , asylum procedures , and in the fights against human trafficking and against racism and anti-semitism . strengthening human rights through foreign policy is also important .
it could , for instance , take the shape of exerting more pressure on russia , china and the usa to rectify their current human rights deficits .
that and an engaged commitment to the newly established un human rights council would create a chance for human rights to again become the measure of political action worldwide . only if europe improves its human rights credibility in action , both internally and externally , can the registered erosion of human rights be stopped and a new path forged .

" it is not acceptable when there are no consultations about such moves , " said merkel . " that repeatedly destroys confidence and you can not build cooperation based on true mutual trust in this way . " many consider this move a sharp shift from the largely uncritical stance toward russia and president putin taken by former chancellor gerhard schröder . german business daily handelsblatt welcomed what it saw as a new approach towards russia . " at last !
the new tone the chancellor is taking towards the kremlin sounds a little like liberation from the vice grip of schröder 's stance , " it said in an editorial on wednesday . a friend of putin 's before leaving office in 2005 , schröder pushed through a deal to construct a natural gas pipeline from russia to western europe via the baltic sea .

" aside from the official relationship between the two leaders , a personal connection also developed .

the only question remaining is when . poland and other new eu members are on their way to the euro zone . as a part of joining the european union , all new member states have agreed to the goal of introducing the euro as their own currency . but in order to enter the euro zone , poland and the other members must fulfill two general conditions .
first , they must meet the requirements of the maastricht treaty , and second , they must take part in the european exchange rate mechanism .
that means their exchange rates must not fluctuate more than 15 percent against the euro over a period of two years . so the question is not whether poland and other new eu members will introduce the currency but when . poland and the euro bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many polish people remain skeptical about the euro as it stands now , malta and cyprus will join the euro zone next year , with slovakia following in 2009 .
but for the other new member states , the timing is still unknown . poland has already met three of the four economic conditions for entering the euro zone . its inflation and interests rates are below the maximum level allowed , and the country 's debt does not cross the limit .
but the country 's budget deficit is still too high for eu standards . " poland must follow through on some financial reforms , " marek zuber , an economy advisor to prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , has said .
" the most important and highest priority for us is the social welfare contributions , which are too high . " an anti-euro government ? since joining the european union in 2004 , public and governmental support for the euro has been mixed . support is high in the cities and lower in the countryside . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski -lrb- right -rrb- with brother lech are skeptical of the euro " i am skeptical , " kaczynski told a news conference in november .
" i think haste in this matter could seriously hurt us . " the law and justice party , led by the prime minister and his twin brother , president lech kaczynski , has repeatedly stated its uncertainty about any rush to join the euro zone since taking over the government in 2005 . in november , the polish government announced plans for a referendum concerning the adoption of the euro , stating the need to educate the public and to allow more time for the polish economy to develop .
the projected date for the referendum is 2010 .

a small number of protesters were also there , one of whom held a sign reading " brainwashing , no thank you . " scientology , whose followers include powerful hollywood film stars tom cruise and john travolta , remodeled a six-storey , 4,000-square-meter -lrb- 43,000-square-foot -rrb- building to boost its profile in the german capital . opponents say the group , which has rapidly expanded in europe in recent years , tries to lure impressionable young people with aggressive recruitment methods and harasses critics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small group of protesters showed up saturday an internal church of scientology document about the gleaming new center in berlin obtained by afp indicated that the group sought not only new members but also political influence in germany . " in order to implement our planetary salvation campaigns , we must have access to the highest levels of the german government in berlin , " it said . founded in the united states in 1954 by science-fiction writer l. ron hubbard , scientology was accorded the status of religion there in 1993 and enjoys exemption from paying taxes .
under observation but it is regarded with suspicion in many european countries - including belgium , france , germany and greece - where authorities contend its leaders seek economic gain and use totalitarian methods to keep supporters in line .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : l. ron hubbard german authorities say between 5,000 and 6,000 scientologists live in the country while the los angeles-based organization cites 30,000 . the group is under observation by the federal office for the protection of the constitution and several state security watchdogs , although not by the berlin authorities following a successful court challenge by the group . the secretary general of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , ronald pofalla , said the left-leaning government in berlin had made a serious mistake by allowing the new center to open . " it is intolerable that scientology can throw its weight around in the capital of germany , " he said . the chairman of the lutheran church in germany , wolfgang huber , said scientology had nothing to do with religion " and certainly nothing to do with christianity , " and should not enjoy the protection of the state .
" they want to pressure people and do business under the cloak of religion , " he told the berlin daily b.z. , adding that scientology aimed to make its followers into " perfect machines . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an image from a commercial for scientology a scientology expert with the hamburg interior ministry , ursula caberta , said the group aimed to undermine german democracy with a " cynical ideology . " " they want to be represented in all the capitals of europe , " caberta said , noting that the organization has already established centers in madrid , london and brussels .
citizens , not the state should decide , some say a scientology spokesman in berlin , however , denied in a brief statement that the group planned to meddle in political affairs . and the us state department has frequently criticized the policies of belgium , france and germany for its " discrimination against minority religions , " including scientology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom cruise is a scientologist despite deep skepticism about scientology in germany , some observers have argued against state suppression of the group , saying that german citizens should be trusted to discover any faults of the organization on their own . " if , for example , school children are being targeted for indoctrination with tutoring courses offered by scientology then the state must protect the weak , " berlin 's daily tagesspiegel wrote in an editorial this week . " otherwise the public 's most powerful weapon is democracy .

dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning says that it is up to the european union to uphold the banner of human rights in the world . it seems as if conditions at the us prison camp in guantanamo could be lending a fatal kind of pseudo-legitimacy to the " treatment " of despots , dictators and their helpers : if the most powerful democracy in the world - the usa - debases the standards of human rights or , in the case of torture , seems to be ignoring them altogether , one wonders why anybody else would bother to observe them . human rights - and this is what the human rights watch report clearly shows - are endangered all over the world .
peaceful coexistence , human progress and the overcoming of unworthy living conditions are , however , possible only if human rights are constitutionally guaranteed through civil society .
this is what europe has learned from its centuries of conflicts and wars . today , the countries of the european union would like to contribute to peace , security , globally sustainable development and mutual respect among nations .
this is , among other things , what the eu formulated in the draft of its constitution .
europe , however , can take over the vacant leading role in the area of human rights only if the political will for such a project prevails . that 's why we must put an end to secret prisons and secret transfers of prisoners without any rights !
the primacy of human rights for the eu 's anti-terror policy must be re-established on all levels .
but other human rights should also be guaranteed better in the future , for example in the context of protecting refugees , asylum procedures , and in the fights against human trafficking and against racism and anti-semitism . strengthening human rights through foreign policy is also important .
it could , for instance , take the shape of exerting more pressure on russia , china and the usa to rectify their current human rights deficits .
that and an engaged commitment to the newly established un human rights council would create a chance for human rights to again become the measure of political action worldwide . only if europe improves its human rights credibility in action , both internally and externally , can the registered erosion of human rights be stopped and a new path forged .
a leading role in this process belongs at the moment to germany - in its presidency of the european council , at the g8 summit and in the un human rights council . ulrike mast-kirschning is an editor at dw-radio -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stiff eu opposition to death penalty ahead of iraq executions as the eu underlined its opposition to the death penalty in the wake of the botched killing of saddam hussein , a pan-european human rights watchdog has appealed to iraq to stop all further executions .

" it is not acceptable when there are no consultations about such moves , " said merkel . " that repeatedly destroys confidence and you can not build cooperation based on true mutual trust in this way . " many consider this move a sharp shift from the largely uncritical stance toward russia and president putin taken by former chancellor gerhard schröder . german business daily handelsblatt welcomed what it saw as a new approach towards russia . " at last !
the new tone the chancellor is taking towards the kremlin sounds a little like liberation from the vice grip of schröder 's stance , " it said in an editorial on wednesday . a friend of putin 's before leaving office in 2005 , schröder pushed through a deal to construct a natural gas pipeline from russia to western europe via the baltic sea .
then , after leaving office , schröder accepted a position as chairman of the north european gas pipeline , a subsidiary of russian gas giant gazprom .

" we all want to see a strong , prosperous and democratic russia , " then chancellor schröder told time magazine in 2005 , " i think president putin is on the right path to get there . " aside from the official relationship between the two leaders , a personal connection also developed .
putin , who speaks fluent german , helped schröder and his wife , doris köpf , adopt two children from putin 's hometown of st. petersburg . jury out on merkel with germany holding the dual presidencies of the european union and the g8 , chancellor angela merkel 's comments toward russia are especially potent according to an editorial in the kieler nachrichten newspaper . " her words carry weight because she speaks as president of the eu , which is the biggest importer of russian oil and gas , and as chairwoman of the g8 , of which russia would like to become a permanent member .

" schröder would immediately have called putin or the other way around ... and the problem would have been resolved rapidly , " alexander rahr , the director of the russian affairs program with the german council on foreign relations told afp . rahr said the shift in relations with russia was the result of " a revival of trans-atlanticism " under merkel , who has actively sought to repair ties with the united states that were strained under schröder . following the oil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has made europe nervous on the energy front on thursday , russia and belarus reached an agreement to reopen the shipments of oil to europe . russia cut all oil flowing through the druzhba -lrb- friendship -rrb- pipeline to belarus on tuesday because of a dispute over transfer fees . the pipeline is one of the main channels of oil from russia to germany , poland and the czech republic . the move added to the eu 's energy jitters toward russia following last year 's dispute between ukraine and russian gas giant gazprom . about half of europe 's oil supplies come from russia , with the majority of it piped through belarus and ukraine . dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia turns europe 's oil tap back on russia and belarus have resolved a three-day dispute over oil transports in a key pipeline that provides fuel to europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 13.01.2007 germany to introduce health care for all großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a compromise on healthcare reform was like pulling teeth health insurance will become obligatory for all german citizens in the wake of a landmark reform of the country 's healthcare system to come into effect in april . the breakthrough announced by health minister ulla schmidt on friday was n't the first , and maybe is n't the last , in the seemingly never-ending saga of germany 's health reform .
the health experts of chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives and their coalition partners from the social democrats have met on various occasions only to see their compromises unraveled by inner-party critics and from outside .
now they 've come up with obligatory health insurance for all in germany as a panacea for the ailing healthcare system .
ulla schmidt described the new plan as an historic move capable of resolving a series of current problems . " as a result of rising health costs even the more affluent germans have no longer been able to pay treatment costs without insurance , " she said on friday " and an obligatory health insurance scheme is also the best protection against abuse , because individual health costs can no longer be passed on to society as a whole . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt obligatory health insurance was schmidt 's idea in her attempt to break an impasse in the talks over the future of private insurance companies .
in contrast to public health insurance funds in which the majority of germans are insured , the wealthiest 10 percent of the population can get private insurance which offers better services .
insurance regardless of health or age until thursday night there had been a huge dispute about whether or not private insurance companies must open themselves to uninsured people without being allowed to check on an applicant 's health .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- were strongly in favor of the plan , saying it was a contribution to national solidarity .
the conservatives rejected it , arguing it would ruin private insurance companies .
the spd finally dropped their demand , putting off a decision for later . " i 'm convinced the agreement we 've reached no longer threatens the existence of the private insurance companies , " wolfgang zöllner , the conservatives ' chief negotiator , said .
" they will remain an essential part of the german healthcare system . "
a reform only for now ?
experts estimate that 200,000 to 300,000 people in germany do not have health insurance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , doctors protested the changes already made to the healthcare system for months the health experts from both the social democrats and the conservatives expect the reform to pass parliament in a vote in february and get approval in the upper house of parliament , which represents the federal states , soon thereafter .
critics of the reform say that in spite of parliamentary support , the proposals are unlikely to remedy the health system 's chronic cash-shortage .
it will do little to reign in spiraling health costs , they say , and increase health fund revenues in view of a dwindling and ageing german population .
they believe that in less than 10 years , the latest healthcare talks will turn into emergency sessions . uwe hessler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts testing electronic health records germany started testing electronic health insurance cards which will eventually contain the patients ' complete health history in digital format .

" as a result of rising health costs even the more affluent germans have no longer been able to pay treatment costs without insurance , " she said on friday " and an obligatory health insurance scheme is also the best protection against abuse , because individual health costs can no longer be passed on to society as a whole .

" it is not acceptable when there are no consultations about such moves , " said merkel . " that repeatedly destroys confidence and you can not build cooperation based on true mutual trust in this way .

a small number of protesters were also there , one of whom held a sign reading " brainwashing , no thank you . " scientology , whose followers include powerful hollywood film stars tom cruise and john travolta , remodeled a six-storey , 4,000-square-meter -lrb- 43,000-square-foot -rrb- building to boost its profile in the german capital . opponents say the group , which has rapidly expanded in europe in recent years , tries to lure impressionable young people with aggressive recruitment methods and harasses critics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small group of protesters showed up saturday an internal church of scientology document about the gleaming new center in berlin obtained by afp indicated that the group sought not only new members but also political influence in germany . " in order to implement our planetary salvation campaigns , we must have access to the highest levels of the german government in berlin , " it said . founded in the united states in 1954 by science-fiction writer l. ron hubbard , scientology was accorded the status of religion there in 1993 and enjoys exemption from paying taxes .
under observation but it is regarded with suspicion in many european countries - including belgium , france , germany and greece - where authorities contend its leaders seek economic gain and use totalitarian methods to keep supporters in line .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : l. ron hubbard german authorities say between 5,000 and 6,000 scientologists live in the country while the los angeles-based organization cites 30,000 . the group is under observation by the federal office for the protection of the constitution and several state security watchdogs , although not by the berlin authorities following a successful court challenge by the group . the secretary general of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , ronald pofalla , said the left-leaning government in berlin had made a serious mistake by allowing the new center to open . " it is intolerable that scientology can throw its weight around in the capital of germany , " he said . the chairman of the lutheran church in germany , wolfgang huber , said scientology had nothing to do with religion " and certainly nothing to do with christianity , " and should not enjoy the protection of the state .
" they want to pressure people and do business under the cloak of religion , " he told the berlin daily b.z. , adding that scientology aimed to make its followers into " perfect machines . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an image from a commercial for scientology a scientology expert with the hamburg interior ministry , ursula caberta , said the group aimed to undermine german democracy with a " cynical ideology . " " they want to be represented in all the capitals of europe , " caberta said , noting that the organization has already established centers in madrid , london and brussels .
citizens , not the state should decide , some say a scientology spokesman in berlin , however , denied in a brief statement that the group planned to meddle in political affairs . and the us state department has frequently criticized the policies of belgium , france and germany for its " discrimination against minority religions , " including scientology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom cruise is a scientologist despite deep skepticism about scientology in germany , some observers have argued against state suppression of the group , saying that german citizens should be trusted to discover any faults of the organization on their own . " if , for example , school children are being targeted for indoctrination with tutoring courses offered by scientology then the state must protect the weak , " berlin 's daily tagesspiegel wrote in an editorial this week .

" it is not acceptable when there are no consultations about such moves , " said merkel . " that repeatedly destroys confidence and you can not build cooperation based on true mutual trust in this way . " many consider this move a sharp shift from the largely uncritical stance toward russia and president putin taken by former chancellor gerhard schröder . german business daily handelsblatt welcomed what it saw as a new approach towards russia . " at last !
the new tone the chancellor is taking towards the kremlin sounds a little like liberation from the vice grip of schröder 's stance , " it said in an editorial on wednesday . a friend of putin 's before leaving office in 2005 , schröder pushed through a deal to construct a natural gas pipeline from russia to western europe via the baltic sea .
then , after leaving office , schröder accepted a position as chairman of the north european gas pipeline , a subsidiary of russian gas giant gazprom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and schröder had a close political and personal friendship throughout his seven years in office , schröder was reluctant to criticize putin and russia , once calling his russian counterpart a " flawless democrat " and urging patience concerning russia 's democratic development . " we all want to see a strong , prosperous and democratic russia , " then chancellor schröder told time magazine in 2005 , " i think president putin is on the right path to get there . " aside from the official relationship between the two leaders , a personal connection also developed .
putin , who speaks fluent german , helped schröder and his wife , doris köpf , adopt two children from putin 's hometown of st. petersburg . jury out on merkel with germany holding the dual presidencies of the european union and the g8 , chancellor angela merkel 's comments toward russia are especially potent according to an editorial in the kieler nachrichten newspaper . " her words carry weight because she speaks as president of the eu , which is the biggest importer of russian oil and gas , and as chairwoman of the g8 , of which russia would like to become a permanent member . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's words bear more weight these days merkel made these statements ahead of a planned meeting with putin in moscow on jan .

" it is not acceptable when there are no consultations about such moves , " said merkel . " that repeatedly destroys confidence and you can not build cooperation based on true mutual trust in this way . " many consider this move a sharp shift from the largely uncritical stance toward russia and president putin taken by former chancellor gerhard schröder . german business daily handelsblatt welcomed what it saw as a new approach towards russia . " at last !
the new tone the chancellor is taking towards the kremlin sounds a little like liberation from the vice grip of schröder 's stance , " it said in an editorial on wednesday . a friend of putin 's before leaving office in 2005 , schröder pushed through a deal to construct a natural gas pipeline from russia to western europe via the baltic sea .
then , after leaving office , schröder accepted a position as chairman of the north european gas pipeline , a subsidiary of russian gas giant gazprom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and schröder had a close political and personal friendship throughout his seven years in office , schröder was reluctant to criticize putin and russia , once calling his russian counterpart a " flawless democrat " and urging patience concerning russia 's democratic development . " we all want to see a strong , prosperous and democratic russia , " then chancellor schröder told time magazine in 2005 , " i think president putin is on the right path to get there . " aside from the official relationship between the two leaders , a personal connection also developed .
putin , who speaks fluent german , helped schröder and his wife , doris köpf , adopt two children from putin 's hometown of st. petersburg . jury out on merkel with germany holding the dual presidencies of the european union and the g8 , chancellor angela merkel 's comments toward russia are especially potent according to an editorial in the kieler nachrichten newspaper . " her words carry weight because she speaks as president of the eu , which is the biggest importer of russian oil and gas , and as chairwoman of the g8 , of which russia would like to become a permanent member . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's words bear more weight these days merkel made these statements ahead of a planned meeting with putin in moscow on jan .
21 when the eu and russia will discuss energy policy . while some observers have praised merkel 's criticism , others see it as complicating the way germany and the eu deal with russia . " schröder would immediately have called putin or the other way around ... and the problem would have been resolved rapidly , " alexander rahr , the director of the russian affairs program with the german council on foreign relations told afp . rahr said the shift in relations with russia was the result of " a revival of trans-atlanticism " under merkel , who has actively sought to repair ties with the united states that were strained under schröder . following the oil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has made europe nervous on the energy front on thursday , russia and belarus reached an agreement to reopen the shipments of oil to europe . russia cut all oil flowing through the druzhba -lrb- friendship -rrb- pipeline to belarus on tuesday because of a dispute over transfer fees . the pipeline is one of the main channels of oil from russia to germany , poland and the czech republic . the move added to the eu 's energy jitters toward russia following last year 's dispute between ukraine and russian gas giant gazprom . about half of europe 's oil supplies come from russia , with the majority of it piped through belarus and ukraine . dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia turns europe 's oil tap back on russia and belarus have resolved a three-day dispute over oil transports in a key pipeline that provides fuel to europe .

dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning says that it is up to the european union to uphold the banner of human rights in the world . it seems as if conditions at the us prison camp in guantanamo could be lending a fatal kind of pseudo-legitimacy to the " treatment " of despots , dictators and their helpers : if the most powerful democracy in the world - the usa - debases the standards of human rights or , in the case of torture , seems to be ignoring them altogether , one wonders why anybody else would bother to observe them . human rights - and this is what the human rights watch report clearly shows - are endangered all over the world .
peaceful coexistence , human progress and the overcoming of unworthy living conditions are , however , possible only if human rights are constitutionally guaranteed through civil society .
this is what europe has learned from its centuries of conflicts and wars . today , the countries of the european union would like to contribute to peace , security , globally sustainable development and mutual respect among nations .
this is , among other things , what the eu formulated in the draft of its constitution .
europe , however , can take over the vacant leading role in the area of human rights only if the political will for such a project prevails . that 's why we must put an end to secret prisons and secret transfers of prisoners without any rights !
the primacy of human rights for the eu 's anti-terror policy must be re-established on all levels .
but other human rights should also be guaranteed better in the future , for example in the context of protecting refugees , asylum procedures , and in the fights against human trafficking and against racism and anti-semitism . strengthening human rights through foreign policy is also important .
it could , for instance , take the shape of exerting more pressure on russia , china and the usa to rectify their current human rights deficits .
that and an engaged commitment to the newly established un human rights council would create a chance for human rights to again become the measure of political action worldwide . only if europe improves its human rights credibility in action , both internally and externally , can the registered erosion of human rights be stopped and a new path forged .
a leading role in this process belongs at the moment to germany - in its presidency of the european council , at the g8 summit and in the un human rights council . ulrike mast-kirschning is an editor at dw-radio -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stiff eu opposition to death penalty ahead of iraq executions as the eu underlined its opposition to the death penalty in the wake of the botched killing of saddam hussein , a pan-european human rights watchdog has appealed to iraq to stop all further executions .

" it is not acceptable when there are no consultations about such moves , " said merkel . " that repeatedly destroys confidence and you can not build cooperation based on true mutual trust in this way . " many consider this move a sharp shift from the largely uncritical stance toward russia and president putin taken by former chancellor gerhard schröder . german business daily handelsblatt welcomed what it saw as a new approach towards russia . " at last !
the new tone the chancellor is taking towards the kremlin sounds a little like liberation from the vice grip of schröder 's stance , " it said in an editorial on wednesday . a friend of putin 's before leaving office in 2005 , schröder pushed through a deal to construct a natural gas pipeline from russia to western europe via the baltic sea .
then , after leaving office , schröder accepted a position as chairman of the north european gas pipeline , a subsidiary of russian gas giant gazprom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and schröder had a close political and personal friendship throughout his seven years in office , schröder was reluctant to criticize putin and russia , once calling his russian counterpart a " flawless democrat " and urging patience concerning russia 's democratic development . " we all want to see a strong , prosperous and democratic russia , " then chancellor schröder told time magazine in 2005 , " i think president putin is on the right path to get there . " aside from the official relationship between the two leaders , a personal connection also developed .
putin , who speaks fluent german , helped schröder and his wife , doris köpf , adopt two children from putin 's hometown of st. petersburg . jury out on merkel with germany holding the dual presidencies of the european union and the g8 , chancellor angela merkel 's comments toward russia are especially potent according to an editorial in the kieler nachrichten newspaper . " her words carry weight because she speaks as president of the eu , which is the biggest importer of russian oil and gas , and as chairwoman of the g8 , of which russia would like to become a permanent member . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's words bear more weight these days merkel made these statements ahead of a planned meeting with putin in moscow on jan .
21 when the eu and russia will discuss energy policy . while some observers have praised merkel 's criticism , others see it as complicating the way germany and the eu deal with russia . " schröder would immediately have called putin or the other way around ... and the problem would have been resolved rapidly , " alexander rahr , the director of the russian affairs program with the german council on foreign relations told afp . rahr said the shift in relations with russia was the result of " a revival of trans-atlanticism " under merkel , who has actively sought to repair ties with the united states that were strained under schröder . following the oil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has made europe nervous on the energy front on thursday , russia and belarus reached an agreement to reopen the shipments of oil to europe . russia cut all oil flowing through the druzhba -lrb- friendship -rrb- pipeline to belarus on tuesday because of a dispute over transfer fees . the pipeline is one of the main channels of oil from russia to germany , poland and the czech republic . the move added to the eu 's energy jitters toward russia following last year 's dispute between ukraine and russian gas giant gazprom . about half of europe 's oil supplies come from russia , with the majority of it piped through belarus and ukraine . dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia turns europe 's oil tap back on russia and belarus have resolved a three-day dispute over oil transports in a key pipeline that provides fuel to europe .

the only question remaining is when . poland and other new eu members are on their way to the euro zone . as a part of joining the european union , all new member states have agreed to the goal of introducing the euro as their own currency . but in order to enter the euro zone , poland and the other members must fulfill two general conditions .
first , they must meet the requirements of the maastricht treaty , and second , they must take part in the european exchange rate mechanism .
that means their exchange rates must not fluctuate more than 15 percent against the euro over a period of two years . so the question is not whether poland and other new eu members will introduce the currency but when . poland and the euro bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many polish people remain skeptical about the euro as it stands now , malta and cyprus will join the euro zone next year , with slovakia following in 2009 .
but for the other new member states , the timing is still unknown . poland has already met three of the four economic conditions for entering the euro zone . its inflation and interests rates are below the maximum level allowed , and the country 's debt does not cross the limit .
but the country 's budget deficit is still too high for eu standards . " poland must follow through on some financial reforms , " marek zuber , an economy advisor to prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , has said .
" the most important and highest priority for us is the social welfare contributions , which are too high . " an anti-euro government ? since joining the european union in 2004 , public and governmental support for the euro has been mixed . support is high in the cities and lower in the countryside . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski -lrb- right -rrb- with brother lech are skeptical of the euro " i am skeptical , " kaczynski told a news conference in november .
" i think haste in this matter could seriously hurt us . " the law and justice party , led by the prime minister and his twin brother , president lech kaczynski , has repeatedly stated its uncertainty about any rush to join the euro zone since taking over the government in 2005 . in november , the polish government announced plans for a referendum concerning the adoption of the euro , stating the need to educate the public and to allow more time for the polish economy to develop .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 13.01.2007 opinion : the eu must lead the global fight for human rights großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 2006 human rights watch report paints a bleak picture of human rights abuses all over the world .
dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning says that it is up to the european union to uphold the banner of human rights in the world . it seems as if conditions at the us prison camp in guantanamo could be lending a fatal kind of pseudo-legitimacy to the " treatment " of despots , dictators and their helpers : if the most powerful democracy in the world - the usa - debases the standards of human rights or , in the case of torture , seems to be ignoring them altogether , one wonders why anybody else would bother to observe them . human rights - and this is what the human rights watch report clearly shows - are endangered all over the world .
peaceful coexistence , human progress and the overcoming of unworthy living conditions are , however , possible only if human rights are constitutionally guaranteed through civil society .
this is what europe has learned from its centuries of conflicts and wars . today , the countries of the european union would like to contribute to peace , security , globally sustainable development and mutual respect among nations .
this is , among other things , what the eu formulated in the draft of its constitution .
europe , however , can take over the vacant leading role in the area of human rights only if the political will for such a project prevails . that 's why we must put an end to secret prisons and secret transfers of prisoners without any rights !

" it is not acceptable when there are no consultations about such moves , " said merkel . " that repeatedly destroys confidence and you can not build cooperation based on true mutual trust in this way . " many consider this move a sharp shift from the largely uncritical stance toward russia and president putin taken by former chancellor gerhard schröder . german business daily handelsblatt welcomed what it saw as a new approach towards russia . " at last !
the new tone the chancellor is taking towards the kremlin sounds a little like liberation from the vice grip of schröder 's stance , " it said in an editorial on wednesday . a friend of putin 's before leaving office in 2005 , schröder pushed through a deal to construct a natural gas pipeline from russia to western europe via the baltic sea .
then , after leaving office , schröder accepted a position as chairman of the north european gas pipeline , a subsidiary of russian gas giant gazprom .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin and schröder had a close political and personal friendship throughout his seven years in office , schröder was reluctant to criticize putin and russia , once calling his russian counterpart a " flawless democrat " and urging patience concerning russia 's democratic development . " we all want to see a strong , prosperous and democratic russia , " then chancellor schröder told time magazine in 2005 , " i think president putin is on the right path to get there . " aside from the official relationship between the two leaders , a personal connection also developed .
putin , who speaks fluent german , helped schröder and his wife , doris köpf , adopt two children from putin 's hometown of st. petersburg . jury out on merkel with germany holding the dual presidencies of the european union and the g8 , chancellor angela merkel 's comments toward russia are especially potent according to an editorial in the kieler nachrichten newspaper . " her words carry weight because she speaks as president of the eu , which is the biggest importer of russian oil and gas , and as chairwoman of the g8 , of which russia would like to become a permanent member . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's words bear more weight these days merkel made these statements ahead of a planned meeting with putin in moscow on jan .
21 when the eu and russia will discuss energy policy . while some observers have praised merkel 's criticism , others see it as complicating the way germany and the eu deal with russia . " schröder would immediately have called putin or the other way around ... and the problem would have been resolved rapidly , " alexander rahr , the director of the russian affairs program with the german council on foreign relations told afp . rahr said the shift in relations with russia was the result of " a revival of trans-atlanticism " under merkel , who has actively sought to repair ties with the united states that were strained under schröder . following the oil bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has made europe nervous on the energy front on thursday , russia and belarus reached an agreement to reopen the shipments of oil to europe . russia cut all oil flowing through the druzhba -lrb- friendship -rrb- pipeline to belarus on tuesday because of a dispute over transfer fees . the pipeline is one of the main channels of oil from russia to germany , poland and the czech republic . the move added to the eu 's energy jitters toward russia following last year 's dispute between ukraine and russian gas giant gazprom . about half of europe 's oil supplies come from russia , with the majority of it piped through belarus and ukraine . dw staff -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de russia turns europe 's oil tap back on russia and belarus have resolved a three-day dispute over oil transports in a key pipeline that provides fuel to europe .

but other human rights should also be guaranteed better in the future , for example in the context of protecting refugees , asylum procedures , and in the fights against human trafficking and against racism and anti-semitism . strengthening human rights through foreign policy is also important .

that and an engaged commitment to the newly established un human rights council would create a chance for human rights to again become the measure of political action worldwide . only if europe improves its human rights credibility in action , both internally and externally , can the registered erosion of human rights be stopped and a new path forged .
a leading role in this process belongs at the moment to germany - in its presidency of the european council , at the g8 summit and in the un human rights council . ulrike mast-kirschning is an editor at dw-radio -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stiff eu opposition to death penalty ahead of iraq executions as the eu underlined its opposition to the death penalty in the wake of the botched killing of saddam hussein , a pan-european human rights watchdog has appealed to iraq to stop all further executions .

a german man who had shoplifted from a small store in norway in 1970 and been plagued by it ever since finally got some psychological relief . the man , whose name has not been released , finally confronted the demons that had plagued him for over three decades by writing a letter to the mayor of the small town of lom , located about 250 kilometers -lrb- 155 miles -rrb- north of oslo .
he confessed that during a trip taken there with his younger brother and girlfriend , now his wife , he had stolen about $ 15 -lrb- 11.50 euros -rrb- worth of goods from a local store . " for many years , my conscience has bothered me .
with the enclosed check , i hope to free myself from that and request your help , " wrote the german man .
" i would also like to ask for forgiveness for the wrong i did so long ago . " the incident lay so far in the past , the former thief was n't even sure of the name of the store .
he recalled it only as " a souvenir shop with a big parking lot . " in his letter to mayor simen bjoergen , the german man included a check for $ 375 -lrb- apparently figuring in a pretty high inflation right -rrb- and asked for absolution .
he requesting that the mayor track down the former shop owner and give him the check .
if that was not possible , he wrote , he wanted the money to go to a good cause . bjoergen did end up finding the now elderly shopkeeper , 78-year-old gabriel lund , who owned the fjoset gift shop in 1970 . the mayor wrote the german back , saying lund had indeed forgiven him and given the money to the local retirement home to do something nice for its residents . let 's hope the repentant thief is sleeping better now . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is certainly facing serious problems , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 13.01.2007 germany to introduce health care for all großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : finding a compromise on healthcare reform was like pulling teeth health insurance will become obligatory for all german citizens in the wake of a landmark reform of the country 's healthcare system to come into effect in april . the breakthrough announced by health minister ulla schmidt on friday was n't the first , and maybe is n't the last , in the seemingly never-ending saga of germany 's health reform .
the health experts of chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives and their coalition partners from the social democrats have met on various occasions only to see their compromises unraveled by inner-party critics and from outside .
now they 've come up with obligatory health insurance for all in germany as a panacea for the ailing healthcare system .
ulla schmidt described the new plan as an historic move capable of resolving a series of current problems . " as a result of rising health costs even the more affluent germans have no longer been able to pay treatment costs without insurance , " she said on friday " and an obligatory health insurance scheme is also the best protection against abuse , because individual health costs can no longer be passed on to society as a whole . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt obligatory health insurance was schmidt 's idea in her attempt to break an impasse in the talks over the future of private insurance companies .
in contrast to public health insurance funds in which the majority of germans are insured , the wealthiest 10 percent of the population can get private insurance which offers better services .
insurance regardless of health or age until thursday night there had been a huge dispute about whether or not private insurance companies must open themselves to uninsured people without being allowed to check on an applicant 's health .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- were strongly in favor of the plan , saying it was a contribution to national solidarity .
the conservatives rejected it , arguing it would ruin private insurance companies .
the spd finally dropped their demand , putting off a decision for later . " i 'm convinced the agreement we 've reached no longer threatens the existence of the private insurance companies , " wolfgang zöllner , the conservatives ' chief negotiator , said .
" they will remain an essential part of the german healthcare system . "
a reform only for now ?
experts estimate that 200,000 to 300,000 people in germany do not have health insurance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , doctors protested the changes already made to the healthcare system for months the health experts from both the social democrats and the conservatives expect the reform to pass parliament in a vote in february and get approval in the upper house of parliament , which represents the federal states , soon thereafter .
critics of the reform say that in spite of parliamentary support , the proposals are unlikely to remedy the health system 's chronic cash-shortage .
it will do little to reign in spiraling health costs , they say , and increase health fund revenues in view of a dwindling and ageing german population .
they believe that in less than 10 years , the latest healthcare talks will turn into emergency sessions . uwe hessler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts testing electronic health records germany started testing electronic health insurance cards which will eventually contain the patients ' complete health history in digital format .

the health experts of chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives and their coalition partners from the social democrats have met on various occasions only to see their compromises unraveled by inner-party critics and from outside .
now they 've come up with obligatory health insurance for all in germany as a panacea for the ailing healthcare system .
ulla schmidt described the new plan as an historic move capable of resolving a series of current problems . " as a result of rising health costs even the more affluent germans have no longer been able to pay treatment costs without insurance , " she said on friday " and an obligatory health insurance scheme is also the best protection against abuse , because individual health costs can no longer be passed on to society as a whole . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt obligatory health insurance was schmidt 's idea in her attempt to break an impasse in the talks over the future of private insurance companies .
in contrast to public health insurance funds in which the majority of germans are insured , the wealthiest 10 percent of the population can get private insurance which offers better services .
insurance regardless of health or age until thursday night there had been a huge dispute about whether or not private insurance companies must open themselves to uninsured people without being allowed to check on an applicant 's health .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- were strongly in favor of the plan , saying it was a contribution to national solidarity .
the conservatives rejected it , arguing it would ruin private insurance companies .
the spd finally dropped their demand , putting off a decision for later . " i 'm convinced the agreement we 've reached no longer threatens the existence of the private insurance companies , " wolfgang zöllner , the conservatives ' chief negotiator , said .
" they will remain an essential part of the german healthcare system . "
a reform only for now ?
experts estimate that 200,000 to 300,000 people in germany do not have health insurance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , doctors protested the changes already made to the healthcare system for months the health experts from both the social democrats and the conservatives expect the reform to pass parliament in a vote in february and get approval in the upper house of parliament , which represents the federal states , soon thereafter .
critics of the reform say that in spite of parliamentary support , the proposals are unlikely to remedy the health system 's chronic cash-shortage .
it will do little to reign in spiraling health costs , they say , and increase health fund revenues in view of a dwindling and ageing german population .
they believe that in less than 10 years , the latest healthcare talks will turn into emergency sessions . uwe hessler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts testing electronic health records germany started testing electronic health insurance cards which will eventually contain the patients ' complete health history in digital format .

dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning says that it is up to the european union to uphold the banner of human rights in the world . it seems as if conditions at the us prison camp in guantanamo could be lending a fatal kind of pseudo-legitimacy to the " treatment " of despots , dictators and their helpers : if the most powerful democracy in the world - the usa - debases the standards of human rights or , in the case of torture , seems to be ignoring them altogether , one wonders why anybody else would bother to observe them . human rights - and this is what the human rights watch report clearly shows - are endangered all over the world .
peaceful coexistence , human progress and the overcoming of unworthy living conditions are , however , possible only if human rights are constitutionally guaranteed through civil society .
this is what europe has learned from its centuries of conflicts and wars . today , the countries of the european union would like to contribute to peace , security , globally sustainable development and mutual respect among nations .
this is , among other things , what the eu formulated in the draft of its constitution .
europe , however , can take over the vacant leading role in the area of human rights only if the political will for such a project prevails . that 's why we must put an end to secret prisons and secret transfers of prisoners without any rights !
the primacy of human rights for the eu 's anti-terror policy must be re-established on all levels .
but other human rights should also be guaranteed better in the future , for example in the context of protecting refugees , asylum procedures , and in the fights against human trafficking and against racism and anti-semitism . strengthening human rights through foreign policy is also important .
it could , for instance , take the shape of exerting more pressure on russia , china and the usa to rectify their current human rights deficits .
that and an engaged commitment to the newly established un human rights council would create a chance for human rights to again become the measure of political action worldwide . only if europe improves its human rights credibility in action , both internally and externally , can the registered erosion of human rights be stopped and a new path forged .

dw 's ulrike mast-kirschning says that it is up to the european union to uphold the banner of human rights in the world . it seems as if conditions at the us prison camp in guantanamo could be lending a fatal kind of pseudo-legitimacy to the " treatment " of despots , dictators and their helpers : if the most powerful democracy in the world - the usa - debases the standards of human rights or , in the case of torture , seems to be ignoring them altogether , one wonders why anybody else would bother to observe them . human rights - and this is what the human rights watch report clearly shows - are endangered all over the world .
peaceful coexistence , human progress and the overcoming of unworthy living conditions are , however , possible only if human rights are constitutionally guaranteed through civil society .
this is what europe has learned from its centuries of conflicts and wars . today , the countries of the european union would like to contribute to peace , security , globally sustainable development and mutual respect among nations .
this is , among other things , what the eu formulated in the draft of its constitution .
europe , however , can take over the vacant leading role in the area of human rights only if the political will for such a project prevails . that 's why we must put an end to secret prisons and secret transfers of prisoners without any rights !
the primacy of human rights for the eu 's anti-terror policy must be re-established on all levels .
but other human rights should also be guaranteed better in the future , for example in the context of protecting refugees , asylum procedures , and in the fights against human trafficking and against racism and anti-semitism . strengthening human rights through foreign policy is also important .
it could , for instance , take the shape of exerting more pressure on russia , china and the usa to rectify their current human rights deficits .
that and an engaged commitment to the newly established un human rights council would create a chance for human rights to again become the measure of political action worldwide . only if europe improves its human rights credibility in action , both internally and externally , can the registered erosion of human rights be stopped and a new path forged .
a leading role in this process belongs at the moment to germany - in its presidency of the european council , at the g8 summit and in the un human rights council . ulrike mast-kirschning is an editor at dw-radio -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stiff eu opposition to death penalty ahead of iraq executions as the eu underlined its opposition to the death penalty in the wake of the botched killing of saddam hussein , a pan-european human rights watchdog has appealed to iraq to stop all further executions .
-lrb- 05.01.2007 -rrb- european officials slam us secret prisons european lawmakers and human rights officials bashed the us government thursday after president bush admitted for the first time to the existence of secret cia prisons in europe .
-lrb- 07.09.2006 -rrb- new un human rights council kicks off the new un human rights council began its first-ever session in geneva with high hopes that it will do more for the victims of abuses and avoid the political horse-trading of the past .

" it is not acceptable when there are no consultations about such moves , " said merkel . " that repeatedly destroys confidence and you can not build cooperation based on true mutual trust in this way . " many consider this move a sharp shift from the largely uncritical stance toward russia and president putin taken by former chancellor gerhard schröder . german business daily handelsblatt welcomed what it saw as a new approach towards russia . " at last !
the new tone the chancellor is taking towards the kremlin sounds a little like liberation from the vice grip of schröder 's stance , " it said in an editorial on wednesday . a friend of putin 's before leaving office in 2005 , schröder pushed through a deal to construct a natural gas pipeline from russia to western europe via the baltic sea .

" it is not acceptable when there are no consultations about such moves , " said merkel . " that repeatedly destroys confidence and you can not build cooperation based on true mutual trust in this way . " many consider this move a sharp shift from the largely uncritical stance toward russia and president putin taken by former chancellor gerhard schröder . german business daily handelsblatt welcomed what it saw as a new approach towards russia .

the new tone the chancellor is taking towards the kremlin sounds a little like liberation from the vice grip of schröder 's stance , " it said in an editorial on wednesday . a friend of putin 's before leaving office in 2005 , schröder pushed through a deal to construct a natural gas pipeline from russia to western europe via the baltic sea .

a small number of protesters were also there , one of whom held a sign reading " brainwashing , no thank you . " scientology , whose followers include powerful hollywood film stars tom cruise and john travolta , remodeled a six-storey , 4,000-square-meter -lrb- 43,000-square-foot -rrb- building to boost its profile in the german capital . opponents say the group , which has rapidly expanded in europe in recent years , tries to lure impressionable young people with aggressive recruitment methods and harasses critics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small group of protesters showed up saturday an internal church of scientology document about the gleaming new center in berlin obtained by afp indicated that the group sought not only new members but also political influence in germany . " in order to implement our planetary salvation campaigns , we must have access to the highest levels of the german government in berlin , " it said . founded in the united states in 1954 by science-fiction writer l. ron hubbard , scientology was accorded the status of religion there in 1993 and enjoys exemption from paying taxes .
under observation but it is regarded with suspicion in many european countries - including belgium , france , germany and greece - where authorities contend its leaders seek economic gain and use totalitarian methods to keep supporters in line .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : l. ron hubbard german authorities say between 5,000 and 6,000 scientologists live in the country while the los angeles-based organization cites 30,000 . the group is under observation by the federal office for the protection of the constitution and several state security watchdogs , although not by the berlin authorities following a successful court challenge by the group . the secretary general of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , ronald pofalla , said the left-leaning government in berlin had made a serious mistake by allowing the new center to open . " it is intolerable that scientology can throw its weight around in the capital of germany , " he said . the chairman of the lutheran church in germany , wolfgang huber , said scientology had nothing to do with religion " and certainly nothing to do with christianity , " and should not enjoy the protection of the state .
" they want to pressure people and do business under the cloak of religion , " he told the berlin daily b.z. , adding that scientology aimed to make its followers into " perfect machines . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an image from a commercial for scientology a scientology expert with the hamburg interior ministry , ursula caberta , said the group aimed to undermine german democracy with a " cynical ideology .

a small number of protesters were also there , one of whom held a sign reading " brainwashing , no thank you . " scientology , whose followers include powerful hollywood film stars tom cruise and john travolta , remodeled a six-storey , 4,000-square-meter -lrb- 43,000-square-foot -rrb- building to boost its profile in the german capital . opponents say the group , which has rapidly expanded in europe in recent years , tries to lure impressionable young people with aggressive recruitment methods and harasses critics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small group of protesters showed up saturday an internal church of scientology document about the gleaming new center in berlin obtained by afp indicated that the group sought not only new members but also political influence in germany . " in order to implement our planetary salvation campaigns , we must have access to the highest levels of the german government in berlin , " it said . founded in the united states in 1954 by science-fiction writer l. ron hubbard , scientology was accorded the status of religion there in 1993 and enjoys exemption from paying taxes .
under observation but it is regarded with suspicion in many european countries - including belgium , france , germany and greece - where authorities contend its leaders seek economic gain and use totalitarian methods to keep supporters in line .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : l. ron hubbard german authorities say between 5,000 and 6,000 scientologists live in the country while the los angeles-based organization cites 30,000 . the group is under observation by the federal office for the protection of the constitution and several state security watchdogs , although not by the berlin authorities following a successful court challenge by the group . the secretary general of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , ronald pofalla , said the left-leaning government in berlin had made a serious mistake by allowing the new center to open . " it is intolerable that scientology can throw its weight around in the capital of germany , " he said . the chairman of the lutheran church in germany , wolfgang huber , said scientology had nothing to do with religion " and certainly nothing to do with christianity , " and should not enjoy the protection of the state .
" they want to pressure people and do business under the cloak of religion , " he told the berlin daily b.z. , adding that scientology aimed to make its followers into " perfect machines . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an image from a commercial for scientology a scientology expert with the hamburg interior ministry , ursula caberta , said the group aimed to undermine german democracy with a " cynical ideology . " " they want to be represented in all the capitals of europe , " caberta said , noting that the organization has already established centers in madrid , london and brussels .
citizens , not the state should decide , some say a scientology spokesman in berlin , however , denied in a brief statement that the group planned to meddle in political affairs . and the us state department has frequently criticized the policies of belgium , france and germany for its " discrimination against minority religions , " including scientology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom cruise is a scientologist despite deep skepticism about scientology in germany , some observers have argued against state suppression of the group , saying that german citizens should be trusted to discover any faults of the organization on their own . " if , for example , school children are being targeted for indoctrination with tutoring courses offered by scientology then the state must protect the weak , " berlin 's daily tagesspiegel wrote in an editorial this week . " otherwise the public 's most powerful weapon is democracy .

the health experts of chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives and their coalition partners from the social democrats have met on various occasions only to see their compromises unraveled by inner-party critics and from outside .
now they 've come up with obligatory health insurance for all in germany as a panacea for the ailing healthcare system .
ulla schmidt described the new plan as an historic move capable of resolving a series of current problems . " as a result of rising health costs even the more affluent germans have no longer been able to pay treatment costs without insurance , " she said on friday " and an obligatory health insurance scheme is also the best protection against abuse , because individual health costs can no longer be passed on to society as a whole . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt obligatory health insurance was schmidt 's idea in her attempt to break an impasse in the talks over the future of private insurance companies .
in contrast to public health insurance funds in which the majority of germans are insured , the wealthiest 10 percent of the population can get private insurance which offers better services .
insurance regardless of health or age until thursday night there had been a huge dispute about whether or not private insurance companies must open themselves to uninsured people without being allowed to check on an applicant 's health .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- were strongly in favor of the plan , saying it was a contribution to national solidarity .
the conservatives rejected it , arguing it would ruin private insurance companies .
the spd finally dropped their demand , putting off a decision for later . " i 'm convinced the agreement we 've reached no longer threatens the existence of the private insurance companies , " wolfgang zöllner , the conservatives ' chief negotiator , said .
" they will remain an essential part of the german healthcare system . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , doctors protested the changes already made to the healthcare system for months the health experts from both the social democrats and the conservatives expect the reform to pass parliament in a vote in february and get approval in the upper house of parliament , which represents the federal states , soon thereafter .
critics of the reform say that in spite of parliamentary support , the proposals are unlikely to remedy the health system 's chronic cash-shortage .
it will do little to reign in spiraling health costs , they say , and increase health fund revenues in view of a dwindling and ageing german population .

the health experts of chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives and their coalition partners from the social democrats have met on various occasions only to see their compromises unraveled by inner-party critics and from outside .
now they 've come up with obligatory health insurance for all in germany as a panacea for the ailing healthcare system .
ulla schmidt described the new plan as an historic move capable of resolving a series of current problems . " as a result of rising health costs even the more affluent germans have no longer been able to pay treatment costs without insurance , " she said on friday " and an obligatory health insurance scheme is also the best protection against abuse , because individual health costs can no longer be passed on to society as a whole . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulla schmidt obligatory health insurance was schmidt 's idea in her attempt to break an impasse in the talks over the future of private insurance companies .
in contrast to public health insurance funds in which the majority of germans are insured , the wealthiest 10 percent of the population can get private insurance which offers better services .
insurance regardless of health or age until thursday night there had been a huge dispute about whether or not private insurance companies must open themselves to uninsured people without being allowed to check on an applicant 's health .
the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- were strongly in favor of the plan , saying it was a contribution to national solidarity .
the conservatives rejected it , arguing it would ruin private insurance companies .
the spd finally dropped their demand , putting off a decision for later . " i 'm convinced the agreement we 've reached no longer threatens the existence of the private insurance companies , " wolfgang zöllner , the conservatives ' chief negotiator , said .
" they will remain an essential part of the german healthcare system . "
a reform only for now ?
experts estimate that 200,000 to 300,000 people in germany do not have health insurance .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year , doctors protested the changes already made to the healthcare system for months the health experts from both the social democrats and the conservatives expect the reform to pass parliament in a vote in february and get approval in the upper house of parliament , which represents the federal states , soon thereafter .
critics of the reform say that in spite of parliamentary support , the proposals are unlikely to remedy the health system 's chronic cash-shortage .
it will do little to reign in spiraling health costs , they say , and increase health fund revenues in view of a dwindling and ageing german population .
they believe that in less than 10 years , the latest healthcare talks will turn into emergency sessions . uwe hessler -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany starts testing electronic health records germany started testing electronic health insurance cards which will eventually contain the patients ' complete health history in digital format .

a small number of protesters were also there , one of whom held a sign reading " brainwashing , no thank you . " scientology , whose followers include powerful hollywood film stars tom cruise and john travolta , remodeled a six-storey , 4,000-square-meter -lrb- 43,000-square-foot -rrb- building to boost its profile in the german capital . opponents say the group , which has rapidly expanded in europe in recent years , tries to lure impressionable young people with aggressive recruitment methods and harasses critics .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a small group of protesters showed up saturday an internal church of scientology document about the gleaming new center in berlin obtained by afp indicated that the group sought not only new members but also political influence in germany . " in order to implement our planetary salvation campaigns , we must have access to the highest levels of the german government in berlin , " it said . founded in the united states in 1954 by science-fiction writer l. ron hubbard , scientology was accorded the status of religion there in 1993 and enjoys exemption from paying taxes .
under observation but it is regarded with suspicion in many european countries - including belgium , france , germany and greece - where authorities contend its leaders seek economic gain and use totalitarian methods to keep supporters in line .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : l. ron hubbard german authorities say between 5,000 and 6,000 scientologists live in the country while the los angeles-based organization cites 30,000 . the group is under observation by the federal office for the protection of the constitution and several state security watchdogs , although not by the berlin authorities following a successful court challenge by the group . the secretary general of chancellor angela merkel 's conservative christian democrats , ronald pofalla , said the left-leaning government in berlin had made a serious mistake by allowing the new center to open . " it is intolerable that scientology can throw its weight around in the capital of germany , " he said . the chairman of the lutheran church in germany , wolfgang huber , said scientology had nothing to do with religion " and certainly nothing to do with christianity , " and should not enjoy the protection of the state .
" they want to pressure people and do business under the cloak of religion , " he told the berlin daily b.z. , adding that scientology aimed to make its followers into " perfect machines . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an image from a commercial for scientology a scientology expert with the hamburg interior ministry , ursula caberta , said the group aimed to undermine german democracy with a " cynical ideology . " " they want to be represented in all the capitals of europe , " caberta said , noting that the organization has already established centers in madrid , london and brussels .
citizens , not the state should decide , some say a scientology spokesman in berlin , however , denied in a brief statement that the group planned to meddle in political affairs . and the us state department has frequently criticized the policies of belgium , france and germany for its " discrimination against minority religions , " including scientology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom cruise is a scientologist despite deep skepticism about scientology in germany , some observers have argued against state suppression of the group , saying that german citizens should be trusted to discover any faults of the organization on their own . " if , for example , school children are being targeted for indoctrination with tutoring courses offered by scientology then the state must protect the weak , " berlin 's daily tagesspiegel wrote in an editorial this week .

belarus will now pay $ 53 a tonne for oil it imports , instead of the $ 180 russia had previously demanded , russian prime minister mikhail fradkov said .
it will also share with russia profits from the refined oil products it exports to other countries .
disputes between the two states led to russia halting the flow of oil through belarus to elsewhere in europe .
the agreement came after about 10 hours of negotiations between mr fradkov and his belarussian counterpart , sergei sidorsky .
all is well that ends well mikhail fradkov russian pm the presidents of the two countries , vladimir putin and alexander lukashenko , also held talks .
officials from the two countries reached " a balanced solution , corresponding to the interests of both countries " , mr fradkov said in televised comments , adding that the talks had been " hard " .
" all is well that ends well , " he added .
supplies sent through the druzhba pipeline were halted for three days after minsk increased the transit tax for oil which passed through the country .
tense talks the dispute between the two former soviet countries came after moscow forced belarus to accept a major increase in the cost of gas supplies to the country in late december .
russia later imposed a hefty duty on oil exports to belarus , claiming its neighbour was costing it up to $ 4bn in lost revenues each year .
in retaliation , belarus slapped a $ 45-per-tonne transit tax on oil shipments from russia , but withdrew it earlier on wednesday after tense top-level government talks between both sides .
at its height , the dispute hit russian oil supplies to germany , poland , ukraine and other european countries via the druzhba pipeline .
the closure of the pipe was condemned by the international energy agency as a " grave " incident .
agency boss claude mandil said the supply cut-off undermined faith in russia as an oil exporter and was " something that should never have happened " .

the leaders of the association of south east asian nations -lrb- asean -rrb- agreed to form a closer political unit and to bring in a free trade zone by 2015 .
they agreed to consider plans which would replace asean 's consensus politics with a tougher stance .
the counter-terrorism pact they signed obliges them to share information .
the asean leaders who came to the central philippines island of cebu were undeterred by a series of bombs on wednesday in the southern island of mindanao that killed seven people .
but some 8,000 police and soldiers are on duty for the weekend summit .
' maturity ' in the past , asean has been portrayed as little more than a talking shop .
association of south east asian nations brunei burma cambodia indonesia laos malaysia philippines singapore thailand vietnam however , on saturday its leaders signed a commitment to create asean 's first-ever charter , aimed at turning it into a european union-style entity with binding rules and regulations .
" asean has matured into a regional organisation and is expanding its role as an integrated regional economy and a dynamic force in maintaining regional peace and stability , " the signed statement said .
the charter would , the leaders said , be the " crowning achievement of 40 years of asean " .
philippine president gloria macapagal arroyo said that asean was committed to " expanding its trade forum to become the largest in the world " .
the counter-terrorism pact signed also allows for joint training aimed at stemming terrorism and cross-border crime .
and a statement was signed on protection for millions of migrant workers .
china , south korea , india , japan , australia and new zealand will hold meetings with the asean leaders on cebu over the next two days .

but she was told to remove it by teachers at the robert napier school .
samantha said she should be allowed to wear a symbol of christian belief , but the school insisted it had a no jewellery policy for her age group .

" if i 've got a problem , i always get it -lsb- the crucifix -rsb- and talk to it , and i feel that helps me . "
paul jackson , deputy head teacher at the non-denominational school , said it was a health and safety issue .
" we have n't told her she ca n't wear the crucifix ... she could wear a lapel badge to show her commitment to her religion , " he said .
kent mp ann widdecombe , herself a devout christian who wears a cross , said she found that to be a " reasonable compromise " .
" the school has said she can wear her symbol ... so it 's not actually preventing her from displaying a cross or a crucifix , " ms widdecombe said .

the case refers to an article about religious jokes which appeared in their magazine , nichane , and judges are soon to deliver their verdict .
courtroom number eight in the casablanca high court is an imposing place .
two portraits hang on the wood panelled walls above the seats reserved for the presiding judges .
the pictures are of the king of morocco , mohammed vi and his now deceased father , hassan ii .
the one of mohammed , a shy but fairly genial young man , shows him smiling .
the one of hassan shows him frowning .
the pictures tell the story of morocco over the last half century .
while the seven years of mohammed vi 's rule have seen modernisation , liberalisation and reform of the media , the days of king hassan were ones of fear .
they are known in morocco as the " years of lead " - lead because of the heaviness in people 's hearts , the lead of the darkness they saw around them and the lead of the bullets that shot them .
blasphemy trial king hassan was not a man who tolerated dissent .
thousands of people disappeared in those days .
even today , very little is known about what really happened to them .
they were simply airbrushed out of history .
it is thought many of them died lonely deaths in secret prisons and interrogation centres .
in the " years of lead " no one spoke out of turn and everyone had respect for their monarch ... but not many people laughed .
humour and jokes were in short supply .
but on monday the judge did something incredible .
he read out a joke about king hassan .
it went along the lines of : " did you hear the one about the king , god and heaven and hell ... "
the joke was written down by sanaa al-aji and edited by driss ksikes , but they did not invent the joke .
it has been heard in streets and cafes up and down the country .
this and other gags were the evidence presented against the two journalists in what is in effect a blasphemy trial .
" what made you want to write this joke ? " asked the examining judge .
" is nothing sacred ?
do you not love your country ? "
defending laughter in morocco there are two things that are potentially risky to comment on : the king and religion .
by telling jokes about both , the journalists are pushing the boundaries of their newly-won press freedom . "
if these jokes are already well known , is it not hypocritical to punish us for merely recording them ? "
defendants but once you let the genie of freedom of speech out of the bottle , it is impossible to put it back in .
morocco has come a long way since the time of hassan ii and the fact that these jokes are made at all suggests that society has changed irrevocably , whether the courts like it or not .
the editor and his reporter faced the panel of judges and told the court that laughter was permissible again in morocco .
to make jokes was not something to be ashamed of , they said .
" people laugh and they go to pray , " they continued , " there is no contradiction in that .
there is a time to be serious and a time to have fun .
" if these jokes are already well known , is it not hypocritical to punish us for merely recording them ? " they asked .
" we are journalists , we simply look at what goes on and try to understand ourselves better through what makes moroccans laugh , but the jokes do not reflect our personal beliefs . "
joking aside driss ksikes said that laughter told us a lot about what made a society tick .
it revealed its neuroses , its fears and its aspirations .
besides , he said , morocco was a funny place .
it was at this point that something changed in the atmosphere of the court room : grim looking security guards leaned forward with a glint in their eyes , the previously bored clerks looked up from their files , and the judge himself could not suppress his own laughter .
the room suddenly seemed a lot lighter and less imposing .
the journalists had let the laughter back in .
but the prosecuting lawyer did not see the funny side .
he curbed the laughter with a voice that boomed off the wooden walls and concrete ceiling .
he reminded the court that there must be limits to freedom of speech , that some things are better left unsaid .
in short , what was sacred should not appear in magazines .
in the koran it says there should be no image or personification of allah .
the jokes were doing just that , he said .
national dilemma he recommended prison sentences of five years , a £ 6,000 fine -lrb- $ 11,500 -rrb- and for the journalists to be banned from their profession for life .
so now the judges in particular and morocco in general have a choice .
and it is not an easy one .
do they side with liberal values and win the admiration of western democracies , or do they uphold their islamic traditions and receive the backing of most of the arab world ?
but laughter , like freedom , the journalists said , could not be suppressed .
if it was , that might take morocco back to the " years of lead " , to the days of the king who would not smile and his subjects who dared not laugh .

in the northern city of bilbao , most people are shocked by the apparent end to the dialogue between basque nationalists and the madrid government .
miren azkarate is one of these female politicians that you meet in virtually every western democracy these days .
bright , articulate , well briefed , immaculately dressed and perfectly coiffured .
the necessary pre-requisites - i suppose - for being the chief spokesperson for the basque government .
when i walked into the spartan office where miren had agreed to meet me , she was pacing the floor , arms folded .
fair enough , i thought .
after all , i was 40 minutes late due to underestimating the drive from bilbao to san sebastian .
addressing the issues " old and young , male and female all thought the era of violence in spanish society had ended with the madrid train bombings of 2004 " we sat down at a bare functional table and miren began to reveal her utter exasperation at eta 's bomb blast in madrid a few days earlier .
yes , like every other politician in the basque country she had been warning that the peace process was in crisis .
yes , the spanish government should have moved some of eta 's prisoners to local jails from elsewhere in spain .
and yes , eta 's political wing , batasuna , should have been legalised .
but exploding a bomb in a car park at madrid airport - killing two people - was no way to address these issues .
' disappointment and weariness ' " the attack was a road to nowhere , " proclaimed miren .
it was a sentiment that was expressed to me over and over .
it was lunchtime , so the bar was not too busy .
eta timeline 1959 : eta founded 1968 : eta kills san sebastian secret police chief meliton manzanas , its first victim 1973 : pm luis carrero blanco assassinated 1978 : political wing herri batasuna formed 1980:118 people killed in bloodiest year sept 1998 : indefinite ceasefire nov 1999 : end of ceasefire , followed by more bomb attacks in january and february 2000 dec 2001 : eu declares eta a terrorist organisation march 2003 : batasuna banned by supreme court may 2003 : two police killed in eta 's last deadly attack nov 2005:56 alleged eta activists on trial in the largest prosecution of its kind march 2006 : eta declares permanent ceasefire key events the producer of a phone-in programme on basque radio said that people were calling in , in tears when they heard of the bombing .
on the streets of the beautiful crescent-shaped city of san sebastian , where waves gently washed its white sandy beach , there were no tears to be seen - just a deep sense of disappointment and weariness .
old and young , male and female , all thought the era of violence in spanish society had ended with the madrid train bombings of 2004 .
nobody could surely think , they kept telling me , that bombings would achieve anything .
for eta to operate , they must of course ignore the views of the vast majority of people in the basque country .
they need to focus on the much smaller - and diminishing - pool of people who will at the very least implicitly support their actions .
the easiest way to hear a justification for eta 's actions is to talk to their political leaders , but as they would not speak , i headed for a bar i was told was popular with hard-line basque nationalists .
' cannabis fog ' the place was not busy .
on one wall was a large poster showing the faces of scores of eta members who had been killed over the years .
in a corner of an annex was a large picture of a current eta militant who is being force-fed by the spanish authorities after he went on hunger strike .
the paper napkins had a map of a nominal basque state , an area straddling the spanish-french border .
at a table sat a group of about six or seven people , smoking some of the strongest cannabis i have ever smelt .
the odour hit me as soon as i entered the bar , but no police officer would dare to come into such an anti-spanish establishment and arrest the smokers .
the cannabis fog may have clouded the bar , but its patrons ' thinking remained crystal clear : eta 's bombing had been wholly justified .
the spanish government had given nothing to the militants over the past nine months .
they had continued to persecute the basque people and arrest eta members .
eta had done their bit and they had been let down .
new bodyguards it is very much a minority view , but then so is the opinion of the main opposition party in spain , who argue that eta continued to extort and blackmail , and re-arm and retrain during its nine month ceasefire , and that the only long-term solution to the problem is to use the spanish security services to eradicate the militants .
but even they admit that it does not take many people to shoot someone or plant a bomb .
which brings me back to miren azkarate . "
many of those who had got rid of their security people during the eta ceasefire have been busy re-hiring them " despite her frustration and anger over eta 's actions , she like the majority of basques , believes that the only viable way forward - in time of course - is dialogue .
" talks will eventually have to take place between eta and the spanish government , " she confidently stated .
" otherwise " , continues miren , " we are saying that everything is over , everything is broken , accepting that eta is deciding for us .
we can not accept that . "
for miren this is not just a political problem .
eta has assassinated scores of politicians over the decades , and their return to arms has increased nervousness among basque politicians of all levels .
many of those who had got rid of their security people during the eta ceasefire have been busy re-hiring them .
as i had entered miren 's office i had noticed her bodyguard , and as i was leaving i asked her , as the basque government spokesperson , if she was personally afraid of what might happen to her .
" of course i am , " she said .

the case refers to an article about religious jokes which appeared in their magazine , nichane , and judges are soon to deliver their verdict .
king mohammed vi -lrb- r -rrb- succeeded his father hassan ii -lrb- l -rrb- in 1999 courtroom number eight in the casablanca high court is an imposing place .
two portraits hang on the wood panelled walls above the seats reserved for the presiding judges .
the pictures are of the king of morocco , mohammed vi and his now deceased father , hassan ii .
the one of mohammed , a shy but fairly genial young man , shows him smiling .
the one of hassan shows him frowning .
the pictures tell the story of morocco over the last half century .
while the seven years of mohammed vi 's rule have seen modernisation , liberalisation and reform of the media , the days of king hassan were ones of fear .
they are known in morocco as the " years of lead " - lead because of the heaviness in people 's hearts , the lead of the darkness they saw around them and the lead of the bullets that shot them .
blasphemy trial king hassan was not a man who tolerated dissent .
thousands of people disappeared in those days .
even today , very little is known about what really happened to them .
they were simply airbrushed out of history .
mr ksikes -lrb- l -rrb- and ms al-aji -lrb- r -rrb- with their publisher -lrb- c -rrb- in court it is thought many of them died lonely deaths in secret prisons and interrogation centres .
in the " years of lead " no one spoke out of turn and everyone had respect for their monarch ... but not many people laughed .
humour and jokes were in short supply .
but on monday the judge did something incredible .
he read out a joke about king hassan .
it went along the lines of : " did you hear the one about the king , god and heaven and hell ... "
the joke was written down by sanaa al-aji and edited by driss ksikes , but they did not invent the joke .
it has been heard in streets and cafes up and down the country .
this and other gags were the evidence presented against the two journalists in what is in effect a blasphemy trial .
" what made you want to write this joke ? " asked the examining judge .
" is nothing sacred ?
do you not love your country ? "
defending laughter in morocco there are two things that are potentially risky to comment on : the king and religion .
by telling jokes about both , the journalists are pushing the boundaries of their newly-won press freedom .
if these jokes are already well known , is it not hypocritical to punish us for merely recording them ?
defendants but once you let the genie of freedom of speech out of the bottle , it is impossible to put it back in .
morocco has come a long way since the time of hassan ii and the fact that these jokes are made at all suggests that society has changed irrevocably , whether the courts like it or not .
the editor and his reporter faced the panel of judges and told the court that laughter was permissible again in morocco .
to make jokes was not something to be ashamed of , they said .
" people laugh and they go to pray , " they continued , " there is no contradiction in that .
there is a time to be serious and a time to have fun .
" if these jokes are already well known , is it not hypocritical to punish us for merely recording them ? " they asked .
" we are journalists , we simply look at what goes on and try to understand ourselves better through what makes moroccans laugh , but the jokes do not reflect our personal beliefs . "
joking aside driss ksikes said that laughter told us a lot about what made a society tick .
it revealed its neuroses , its fears and its aspirations .

in the northern city of bilbao , most people are shocked by the apparent end to the dialogue between basque nationalists and the madrid government .
miren azkarate is one of these female politicians that you meet in virtually every western democracy these days .
bright , articulate , well briefed , immaculately dressed and perfectly coiffured .
the necessary pre-requisites - i suppose - for being the chief spokesperson for the basque government .
when i walked into the spartan office where miren had agreed to meet me , she was pacing the floor , arms folded .
fair enough , i thought .
after all , i was 40 minutes late due to underestimating the drive from bilbao to san sebastian .
addressing the issues old and young , male and female all thought the era of violence in spanish society had ended with the madrid train bombings of 2004 we sat down at a bare functional table and miren began to reveal her utter exasperation at eta 's bomb blast in madrid a few days earlier .
yes , like every other politician in the basque country she had been warning that the peace process was in crisis .
yes , the spanish government should have moved some of eta 's prisoners to local jails from elsewhere in spain .
and yes , eta 's political wing , batasuna , should have been legalised .
but exploding a bomb in a car park at madrid airport - killing two people - was no way to address these issues .
' disappointment and weariness ' " the attack was a road to nowhere , " proclaimed miren .
it was a sentiment that was expressed to me over and over .
it was lunchtime , so the bar was not too busy .
eta timeline 1959 : eta founded 1968 : eta kills san sebastian secret police chief meliton manzanas , its first victim 1973 : pm luis carrero blanco assassinated 1978 : political wing herri batasuna formed 1980:118 people killed in bloodiest year sept 1998 : indefinite ceasefire nov 1999 : end of ceasefire , followed by more bomb attacks in january and february 2000 dec 2001 : eu declares eta a terrorist organisation march 2003 : batasuna banned by supreme court may 2003 : two police killed in eta 's last deadly attack nov 2005:56 alleged eta activists on trial in the largest prosecution of its kind march 2006 : eta declares permanent ceasefire key events the producer of a phone-in programme on basque radio said that people were calling in , in tears when they heard of the bombing .
on the streets of the beautiful crescent-shaped city of san sebastian , where waves gently washed its white sandy beach , there were no tears to be seen - just a deep sense of disappointment and weariness .
old and young , male and female , all thought the era of violence in spanish society had ended with the madrid train bombings of 2004 .
nobody could surely think , they kept telling me , that bombings would achieve anything .
for eta to operate , they must of course ignore the views of the vast majority of people in the basque country .
they need to focus on the much smaller - and diminishing - pool of people who will at the very least implicitly support their actions .
the easiest way to hear a justification for eta 's actions is to talk to their political leaders , but as they would not speak , i headed for a bar i was told was popular with hard-line basque nationalists .
' cannabis fog ' the place was not busy .
on one wall was a large poster showing the faces of scores of eta members who had been killed over the years .
in a corner of an annex was a large picture of a current eta militant who is being force-fed by the spanish authorities after he went on hunger strike .
the paper napkins had a map of a nominal basque state , an area straddling the spanish-french border .
at a table sat a group of about six or seven people , smoking some of the strongest cannabis i have ever smelt .
the odour hit me as soon as i entered the bar , but no police officer would dare to come into such an anti-spanish establishment and arrest the smokers .
the cannabis fog may have clouded the bar , but its patrons ' thinking remained crystal clear : eta 's bombing had been wholly justified .
the spanish government had given nothing to the militants over the past nine months .
they had continued to persecute the basque people and arrest eta members .
eta had done their bit and they had been let down .
new bodyguards it is very much a minority view , but then so is the opinion of the main opposition party in spain , who argue that eta continued to extort and blackmail , and re-arm and retrain during its nine month ceasefire , and that the only long-term solution to the problem is to use the spanish security services to eradicate the militants .
but even they admit that it does not take many people to shoot someone or plant a bomb .
which brings me back to miren azkarate .
many of those who had got rid of their security people during the eta ceasefire have been busy re-hiring them despite her frustration and anger over eta 's actions , she like the majority of basques , believes that the only viable way forward - in time of course - is dialogue .
" talks will eventually have to take place between eta and the spanish government , " she confidently stated .
" otherwise " , continues miren , " we are saying that everything is over , everything is broken , accepting that eta is deciding for us .
we can not accept that . "
for miren this is not just a political problem .
eta has assassinated scores of politicians over the decades , and their return to arms has increased nervousness among basque politicians of all levels .
many of those who had got rid of their security people during the eta ceasefire have been busy re-hiring them .
as i had entered miren 's office i had noticed her bodyguard , and as i was leaving i asked her , as the basque government spokesperson , if she was personally afraid of what might happen to her .
" of course i am , " she said .

miren azkarate is one of these female politicians that you meet in virtually every western democracy these days .
bright , articulate , well briefed , immaculately dressed and perfectly coiffured .
the necessary pre-requisites - i suppose - for being the chief spokesperson for the basque government .
when i walked into the spartan office where miren had agreed to meet me , she was pacing the floor , arms folded .
fair enough , i thought .
after all , i was 40 minutes late due to underestimating the drive from bilbao to san sebastian .
addressing the issues old and young , male and female all thought the era of violence in spanish society had ended with the madrid train bombings of 2004 we sat down at a bare functional table and miren began to reveal her utter exasperation at eta 's bomb blast in madrid a few days earlier .
yes , like every other politician in the basque country she had been warning that the peace process was in crisis .
yes , the spanish government should have moved some of eta 's prisoners to local jails from elsewhere in spain .
and yes , eta 's political wing , batasuna , should have been legalised .
but exploding a bomb in a car park at madrid airport - killing two people - was no way to address these issues .
' disappointment and weariness ' " the attack was a road to nowhere , " proclaimed miren .
it was a sentiment that was expressed to me over and over .
it was lunchtime , so the bar was not too busy .

on the streets of the beautiful crescent-shaped city of san sebastian , where waves gently washed its white sandy beach , there were no tears to be seen - just a deep sense of disappointment and weariness .
old and young , male and female , all thought the era of violence in spanish society had ended with the madrid train bombings of 2004 .
nobody could surely think , they kept telling me , that bombings would achieve anything .
for eta to operate , they must of course ignore the views of the vast majority of people in the basque country .
they need to focus on the much smaller - and diminishing - pool of people who will at the very least implicitly support their actions .
the easiest way to hear a justification for eta 's actions is to talk to their political leaders , but as they would not speak , i headed for a bar i was told was popular with hard-line basque nationalists .
' cannabis fog ' the place was not busy .
on one wall was a large poster showing the faces of scores of eta members who had been killed over the years .
in a corner of an annex was a large picture of a current eta militant who is being force-fed by the spanish authorities after he went on hunger strike .
the paper napkins had a map of a nominal basque state , an area straddling the spanish-french border .
at a table sat a group of about six or seven people , smoking some of the strongest cannabis i have ever smelt .
the odour hit me as soon as i entered the bar , but no police officer would dare to come into such an anti-spanish establishment and arrest the smokers .
the cannabis fog may have clouded the bar , but its patrons ' thinking remained crystal clear : eta 's bombing had been wholly justified .
the spanish government had given nothing to the militants over the past nine months .
they had continued to persecute the basque people and arrest eta members .
eta had done their bit and they had been let down .
new bodyguards it is very much a minority view , but then so is the opinion of the main opposition party in spain , who argue that eta continued to extort and blackmail , and re-arm and retrain during its nine month ceasefire , and that the only long-term solution to the problem is to use the spanish security services to eradicate the militants .
but even they admit that it does not take many people to shoot someone or plant a bomb .
which brings me back to miren azkarate .
many of those who had got rid of their security people during the eta ceasefire have been busy re-hiring them despite her frustration and anger over eta 's actions , she like the majority of basques , believes that the only viable way forward - in time of course - is dialogue .
" talks will eventually have to take place between eta and the spanish government , " she confidently stated .
" otherwise " , continues miren , " we are saying that everything is over , everything is broken , accepting that eta is deciding for us .
we can not accept that . "
for miren this is not just a political problem .
eta has assassinated scores of politicians over the decades , and their return to arms has increased nervousness among basque politicians of all levels .
many of those who had got rid of their security people during the eta ceasefire have been busy re-hiring them .
as i had entered miren 's office i had noticed her bodyguard , and as i was leaving i asked her , as the basque government spokesperson , if she was personally afraid of what might happen to her .
" of course i am , " she said .

the case refers to an article about religious jokes which appeared in their magazine , nichane , and judges are soon to deliver their verdict .
king mohammed vi -lrb- r -rrb- succeeded his father hassan ii -lrb- l -rrb- in 1999 courtroom number eight in the casablanca high court is an imposing place .
two portraits hang on the wood panelled walls above the seats reserved for the presiding judges .
the pictures are of the king of morocco , mohammed vi and his now deceased father , hassan ii .
the one of mohammed , a shy but fairly genial young man , shows him smiling .
the one of hassan shows him frowning .
the pictures tell the story of morocco over the last half century .
while the seven years of mohammed vi 's rule have seen modernisation , liberalisation and reform of the media , the days of king hassan were ones of fear .
they are known in morocco as the " years of lead " - lead because of the heaviness in people 's hearts , the lead of the darkness they saw around them and the lead of the bullets that shot them .
blasphemy trial king hassan was not a man who tolerated dissent .
thousands of people disappeared in those days .
even today , very little is known about what really happened to them .
they were simply airbrushed out of history .
mr ksikes -lrb- l -rrb- and ms al-aji -lrb- r -rrb- with their publisher -lrb- c -rrb- in court it is thought many of them died lonely deaths in secret prisons and interrogation centres .
in the " years of lead " no one spoke out of turn and everyone had respect for their monarch ... but not many people laughed .
humour and jokes were in short supply .
but on monday the judge did something incredible .
he read out a joke about king hassan .
it went along the lines of : " did you hear the one about the king , god and heaven and hell ... "
the joke was written down by sanaa al-aji and edited by driss ksikes , but they did not invent the joke .
it has been heard in streets and cafes up and down the country .
this and other gags were the evidence presented against the two journalists in what is in effect a blasphemy trial .
" what made you want to write this joke ? " asked the examining judge .
" is nothing sacred ?
do you not love your country ? "
defending laughter in morocco there are two things that are potentially risky to comment on : the king and religion .
by telling jokes about both , the journalists are pushing the boundaries of their newly-won press freedom .
if these jokes are already well known , is it not hypocritical to punish us for merely recording them ?
defendants but once you let the genie of freedom of speech out of the bottle , it is impossible to put it back in .
morocco has come a long way since the time of hassan ii and the fact that these jokes are made at all suggests that society has changed irrevocably , whether the courts like it or not .
the editor and his reporter faced the panel of judges and told the court that laughter was permissible again in morocco .
to make jokes was not something to be ashamed of , they said .
" people laugh and they go to pray , " they continued , " there is no contradiction in that .
there is a time to be serious and a time to have fun .
" if these jokes are already well known , is it not hypocritical to punish us for merely recording them ? " they asked .
" we are journalists , we simply look at what goes on and try to understand ourselves better through what makes moroccans laugh , but the jokes do not reflect our personal beliefs . "
joking aside driss ksikes said that laughter told us a lot about what made a society tick .
it revealed its neuroses , its fears and its aspirations .
besides , he said , morocco was a funny place .
it was at this point that something changed in the atmosphere of the court room : grim looking security guards leaned forward with a glint in their eyes , the previously bored clerks looked up from their files , and the judge himself could not suppress his own laughter .
the room suddenly seemed a lot lighter and less imposing .
the journalists had let the laughter back in .
but the prosecuting lawyer did not see the funny side .
he curbed the laughter with a voice that boomed off the wooden walls and concrete ceiling .
he reminded the court that there must be limits to freedom of speech , that some things are better left unsaid .
in short , what was sacred should not appear in magazines .
in the koran it says there should be no image or personification of allah .
the jokes were doing just that , he said .
national dilemma he recommended prison sentences of five years , a £ 6,000 fine -lrb- $ 11,500 -rrb- and for the journalists to be banned from their profession for life .
so now the judges in particular and morocco in general have a choice .
and it is not an easy one .
do they side with liberal values and win the admiration of western democracies , or do they uphold their islamic traditions and receive the backing of most of the arab world ?
but laughter , like freedom , the journalists said , could not be suppressed .
if it was , that might take morocco back to the " years of lead " , to the days of the king who would not smile and his subjects who dared not laugh .

they are known in morocco as the " years of lead " - lead because of the heaviness in people 's hearts , the lead of the darkness they saw around them and the lead of the bullets that shot them .
blasphemy trial king hassan was not a man who tolerated dissent .
thousands of people disappeared in those days .
even today , very little is known about what really happened to them .
they were simply airbrushed out of history .
mr ksikes -lrb- l -rrb- and ms al-aji -lrb- r -rrb- with their publisher -lrb- c -rrb- in court it is thought many of them died lonely deaths in secret prisons and interrogation centres .
in the " years of lead " no one spoke out of turn and everyone had respect for their monarch ... but not many people laughed .
humour and jokes were in short supply .
but on monday the judge did something incredible .
he read out a joke about king hassan .
it went along the lines of : " did you hear the one about the king , god and heaven and hell ... "
the joke was written down by sanaa al-aji and edited by driss ksikes , but they did not invent the joke .
it has been heard in streets and cafes up and down the country .
this and other gags were the evidence presented against the two journalists in what is in effect a blasphemy trial .
" what made you want to write this joke ? " asked the examining judge .
" is nothing sacred ?
do you not love your country ? "
defending laughter in morocco there are two things that are potentially risky to comment on : the king and religion .
by telling jokes about both , the journalists are pushing the boundaries of their newly-won press freedom .
if these jokes are already well known , is it not hypocritical to punish us for merely recording them ?
defendants but once you let the genie of freedom of speech out of the bottle , it is impossible to put it back in .
morocco has come a long way since the time of hassan ii and the fact that these jokes are made at all suggests that society has changed irrevocably , whether the courts like it or not .
the editor and his reporter faced the panel of judges and told the court that laughter was permissible again in morocco .
to make jokes was not something to be ashamed of , they said .
" people laugh and they go to pray , " they continued , " there is no contradiction in that .
there is a time to be serious and a time to have fun .
" if these jokes are already well known , is it not hypocritical to punish us for merely recording them ? " they asked .
" we are journalists , we simply look at what goes on and try to understand ourselves better through what makes moroccans laugh , but the jokes do not reflect our personal beliefs . "
joking aside driss ksikes said that laughter told us a lot about what made a society tick .
it revealed its neuroses , its fears and its aspirations .
besides , he said , morocco was a funny place .
it was at this point that something changed in the atmosphere of the court room : grim looking security guards leaned forward with a glint in their eyes , the previously bored clerks looked up from their files , and the judge himself could not suppress his own laughter .
the room suddenly seemed a lot lighter and less imposing .
the journalists had let the laughter back in .
but the prosecuting lawyer did not see the funny side .
he curbed the laughter with a voice that boomed off the wooden walls and concrete ceiling .
he reminded the court that there must be limits to freedom of speech , that some things are better left unsaid .
in short , what was sacred should not appear in magazines .
in the koran it says there should be no image or personification of allah .
the jokes were doing just that , he said .
national dilemma he recommended prison sentences of five years , a £ 6,000 fine -lrb- $ 11,500 -rrb- and for the journalists to be banned from their profession for life .
so now the judges in particular and morocco in general have a choice .
and it is not an easy one .
do they side with liberal values and win the admiration of western democracies , or do they uphold their islamic traditions and receive the backing of most of the arab world ?
but laughter , like freedom , the journalists said , could not be suppressed .
if it was , that might take morocco back to the " years of lead " , to the days of the king who would not smile and his subjects who dared not laugh .

the former player from dc united had been hailed as the new pele .
for the following months , no other news related to soccer made the american headlines .
that all changed suddenly this week , after the announcement that david beckham had signed a deal worth £ 128m to play in america 's major league soccer .
beckham might be no pele , but his arrival in the us to play for the la galaxy might spark an even greater interest in soccer than the one that was seen when the brazilian player was brought to america by the now defunct new york cosmos , in 1975 .
david hirshey is the executive editor of harper collins books and was starting his career as a sports journalist when pele came to play in america .
popularity the author , who reported that period in his book pele 's new world , says that the climate is far more favourable to the english player than it was to the brazilian .
" thanks in part to pele , beckham comes along when soccer 's tv profile and popularity amongst young people is much bigger than it was at that time .
" now , there are 18 million kids who practise the sport and who have seen beckham 's commercials , his changing hairstyles , his hollywood life and his glamorous wife . "
billionaire backing pele 's finest hour had passed a few years earlier .
but , unlike the english player , who was sacked from the national squad and who is currently on the bench at real madrid , the brazilian willingly retired from his national team and chose not to play in the 1974 world cup . "
soon you probably could see the arrival of players like ronaldo " john haydon washington times when pele signed for the cosmos for what was an unbelievable sum at the time , he not only resurrected his career , but also paved the way for many worldwide quality players to come to cosmos and to the us , such as franz beckenbauer , carlos alberto , giorgio chinaglia , bobby moore , geoff hurst and george best .
that phenomenon could be repeated in the foreseeable future , since current major league soccer not only has the money to invest , but is also better run than its predecessor , the north american soccer league , that collapsed in the 1984 , mainly due to overspending and mismanagement .
that is the view of john haydon , a soccer writer for the washington times .
" soon you probably could see the arrival of players like ronaldo , who still have playing time ahead .
the league is appealing for those like him .
you have some billionaires behind it and it is very financially stable . "
the glamour is also likely to come back .
if in the 70s , pele became a nationwide celebrity , a poster-boy for a wide range of products and even made his way to hollywood , working alongside sylvester stallone and michael caine .
with beckham it could go even further .
" beckham definitely wants to conquer america and he 's going to la , which is the place to be , with its movie stars .
and he 'll be bringing to the stadiums his friends , like tom cruise and katie holmes .
you will definitely see more glitz in the la galaxy , " says haydon .
female interest although the us has already hosted a world cup , in 1994 , the sport has n't yet managed to reach the masses , as it has in most countries in the world .
in america , it is predominantly practised by kids from white middle-class backgrounds and its audience is concentrated on the latino community .
in spite of that , its tv ratings and stadium attendances are growing .
some believe beckham could play a part in attracting americans who do n't rank soccer among their top priorities .
" i think women , for instance , who have never seen a soccer game , out of curiosity would certainly attend several of beckham 's initial games and maybe they 'll become hooked on the sport , not just on his well-toned physique " , says david hirshey .
john haydon says the former english captain could change the make-up of us football crowds .
" in pele 's days , most of the crowds came from ethnic backgrounds .
you did n't have average americans .
now you will , because they know who beckham is and he can also bring the crossover fans " - those who watch international soccer games , but turn their noses up at the national soccer league . "
although david hirshey stresses that as players there is quite a distance separating beckham from pele , of the pitch both athletes have much in common and a similar gift of charming the crowds .
" both of them are extremely polite , affable and love children , " he says .
" when david beckham says : ' i 'm not coming here for the money ' , you have to laugh , but when he says : ' i 'm doing it for the children ' , i believe him . "

beckham has struggled to hold a first-team place at madrid the former player from dc united had been hailed as the new pele .
for the following months , no other news related to soccer made the american headlines .
that all changed suddenly this week , after the announcement that david beckham had signed a deal worth £ 128m to play in america 's major league soccer .
beckham might be no pele , but his arrival in the us to play for the la galaxy might spark an even greater interest in soccer than the one that was seen when the brazilian player was brought to america by the now defunct new york cosmos , in 1975 .
david hirshey is the executive editor of harper collins books and was starting his career as a sports journalist when pele came to play in america .
popularity the author , who reported that period in his book pele 's new world , says that the climate is far more favourable to the english player than it was to the brazilian .
" thanks in part to pele , beckham comes along when soccer 's tv profile and popularity amongst young people is much bigger than it was at that time .
" now , there are 18 million kids who practise the sport and who have seen beckham 's commercials , his changing hairstyles , his hollywood life and his glamorous wife . "
billionaire backing pele 's finest hour had passed a few years earlier .
but , unlike the english player , who was sacked from the national squad and who is currently on the bench at real madrid , the brazilian willingly retired from his national team and chose not to play in the 1974 world cup .
soon you probably could see the arrival of players like ronaldo john haydon washington times when pele signed for the cosmos for what was an unbelievable sum at the time , he not only resurrected his career , but also paved the way for many worldwide quality players to come to cosmos and to the us , such as franz beckenbauer , carlos alberto , giorgio chinaglia , bobby moore , geoff hurst and george best .
that phenomenon could be repeated in the foreseeable future , since current major league soccer not only has the money to invest , but is also better run than its predecessor , the north american soccer league , that collapsed in the 1984 , mainly due to overspending and mismanagement .
that is the view of john haydon , a soccer writer for the washington times .
" soon you probably could see the arrival of players like ronaldo , who still have playing time ahead .
the league is appealing for those like him .
you have some billionaires behind it and it is very financially stable . "
the glamour is also likely to come back .
if in the 70s , pele became a nationwide celebrity , a poster-boy for a wide range of products and even made his way to hollywood , working alongside sylvester stallone and michael caine .
with beckham it could go even further .
" beckham definitely wants to conquer america and he 's going to la , which is the place to be , with its movie stars .
and he 'll be bringing to the stadiums his friends , like tom cruise and katie holmes .
you will definitely see more glitz in the la galaxy , " says haydon .
female interest although the us has already hosted a world cup , in 1994 , the sport has n't yet managed to reach the masses , as it has in most countries in the world .
in america , it is predominantly practised by kids from white middle-class backgrounds and its audience is concentrated on the latino community .
in spite of that , its tv ratings and stadium attendances are growing .
pele was a success at the new york cosmos some believe beckham could play a part in attracting americans who do n't rank soccer among their top priorities .
" i think women , for instance , who have never seen a soccer game , out of curiosity would certainly attend several of beckham 's initial games and maybe they 'll become hooked on the sport , not just on his well-toned physique " , says david hirshey .
john haydon says the former english captain could change the make-up of us football crowds .
" in pele 's days , most of the crowds came from ethnic backgrounds .
you did n't have average americans .
now you will , because they know who beckham is and he can also bring the crossover fans " - those who watch international soccer games , but turn their noses up at the national soccer league . "
although david hirshey stresses that as players there is quite a distance separating beckham from pele , of the pitch both athletes have much in common and a similar gift of charming the crowds .
" both of them are extremely polite , affable and love children , " he says .
" when david beckham says : ' i 'm not coming here for the money ' , you have to laugh , but when he says : ' i 'm doing it for the children ' , i believe him . "

beckham has struggled to hold a first-team place at madrid the former player from dc united had been hailed as the new pele .
for the following months , no other news related to soccer made the american headlines .
that all changed suddenly this week , after the announcement that david beckham had signed a deal worth £ 128m to play in america 's major league soccer .
beckham might be no pele , but his arrival in the us to play for the la galaxy might spark an even greater interest in soccer than the one that was seen when the brazilian player was brought to america by the now defunct new york cosmos , in 1975 .
david hirshey is the executive editor of harper collins books and was starting his career as a sports journalist when pele came to play in america .
popularity the author , who reported that period in his book pele 's new world , says that the climate is far more favourable to the english player than it was to the brazilian .
" thanks in part to pele , beckham comes along when soccer 's tv profile and popularity amongst young people is much bigger than it was at that time .
" now , there are 18 million kids who practise the sport and who have seen beckham 's commercials , his changing hairstyles , his hollywood life and his glamorous wife . "
billionaire backing pele 's finest hour had passed a few years earlier .
but , unlike the english player , who was sacked from the national squad and who is currently on the bench at real madrid , the brazilian willingly retired from his national team and chose not to play in the 1974 world cup .
soon you probably could see the arrival of players like ronaldo john haydon washington times when pele signed for the cosmos for what was an unbelievable sum at the time , he not only resurrected his career , but also paved the way for many worldwide quality players to come to cosmos and to the us , such as franz beckenbauer , carlos alberto , giorgio chinaglia , bobby moore , geoff hurst and george best .
that phenomenon could be repeated in the foreseeable future , since current major league soccer not only has the money to invest , but is also better run than its predecessor , the north american soccer league , that collapsed in the 1984 , mainly due to overspending and mismanagement .
that is the view of john haydon , a soccer writer for the washington times .
" soon you probably could see the arrival of players like ronaldo , who still have playing time ahead .
the league is appealing for those like him .
you have some billionaires behind it and it is very financially stable . "
the glamour is also likely to come back .
if in the 70s , pele became a nationwide celebrity , a poster-boy for a wide range of products and even made his way to hollywood , working alongside sylvester stallone and michael caine .
with beckham it could go even further .
" beckham definitely wants to conquer america and he 's going to la , which is the place to be , with its movie stars .
and he 'll be bringing to the stadiums his friends , like tom cruise and katie holmes .
you will definitely see more glitz in the la galaxy , " says haydon .
female interest although the us has already hosted a world cup , in 1994 , the sport has n't yet managed to reach the masses , as it has in most countries in the world .
in america , it is predominantly practised by kids from white middle-class backgrounds and its audience is concentrated on the latino community .
in spite of that , its tv ratings and stadium attendances are growing .
pele was a success at the new york cosmos some believe beckham could play a part in attracting americans who do n't rank soccer among their top priorities .
" i think women , for instance , who have never seen a soccer game , out of curiosity would certainly attend several of beckham 's initial games and maybe they 'll become hooked on the sport , not just on his well-toned physique " , says david hirshey .
john haydon says the former english captain could change the make-up of us football crowds .
" in pele 's days , most of the crowds came from ethnic backgrounds .
you did n't have average americans .
now you will , because they know who beckham is and he can also bring the crossover fans " - those who watch international soccer games , but turn their noses up at the national soccer league . "
although david hirshey stresses that as players there is quite a distance separating beckham from pele , of the pitch both athletes have much in common and a similar gift of charming the crowds .
" both of them are extremely polite , affable and love children , " he says .
" when david beckham says : ' i 'm not coming here for the money ' , you have to laugh , but when he says : ' i 'm doing it for the children ' , i believe him . "

but the decision to impose media censorship gets short shrift .
dainik dinkal " it is noteworthy that the state of emergency has brought back a sense of normality to public life .
the people have heaved a sigh of relief following the announcement of the state of emergency . "
inqilab " the wind of normalcy has already begun to blow in public life .
but many do not like the censorship that has been imposed in the press and electronic media .
we can not deny the necessity of censorship , even if , as a member of the media , we do not like it . "
bhorer kagoj " the country again faces an unnatural situation following the president 's declaration of a state of emergency .
a state of emergency was issued 17 years ago by the then military dictator .
no-one expected that a caretaker government would do the same .
the backgrounds of the two regimes are totally different , but it is understood that a state of emergency violates all basic rights of the people . "
abdul gaffar choudhury in shamokal " at last the president has issued a state of emergency in order to rectify his mistakes .
we will not enter the debate as to whether issuing a state of emergency was necessary or not , but we will give the president some praise for his bold step in standing down as chief adviser to the caretaker government .
