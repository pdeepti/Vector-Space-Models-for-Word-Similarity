" much more was achieved than expected given the different interests at stake , " the minister said in bali where he represented germany at the talks .
at the same time , the result that came out of the tough negotiations was less than what germany and the european union had hoped for , he said .
gabriel said the important thing was that there was now a roadmap for a new climate treaty with " considerably stronger " commitments to climate protection from all industrial nations , including the united states .
the un conference was also a success inasmuch as it included developing nations in climate protection measures for the first time , he said .
the talks ended on saturday with an agreement on a " roadmap " for a two-year process of negotiations designed to set new targets for greenhouse gas emissions to replace those in the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
marathon talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will all the polar bear activits be happy with the outcome of the conference ?
the " roadmap " deal was reached following a dramatic final session of the marathon talks which saw the us delegation drop its objections to the final document .
head of the us delegation paula dobriansky said that 20 hours after the scheduled end of the conference , her country did not want to stand in the way of agreement .
environmentalist groups said that political leaders meeting in bali hammered out a deal which launches formal negotiations with a 2009 end date , but the deal falls short in its ambition .
" the bush administration has unscrupulously taken a monkey wrench to the level of action on climate change that the science demands , " said gerd leipold , executive director of greenpeace international .
" they 're relegated the science to a footnote . "
developing countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head of the us delegation , undersecretary of state paula dobriansky -lrb- right -rrb- before nailing down the agreement , developing countries including india and china had expressed concern that they might be forced to accept binding emissions reduction standards .
they are not required to accept emission reduction commitments under the kyoto protocol , and say that any such commitments would cramp economic growth and curb poverty reduction efforts .
the agreement was reached after indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono and un secretary-general ban ki-moon urged the delegates to reach a breakthrough .
ban said he was disappointed by the level of progress at the conference and urged delegates to quickly approve a compromise plan to launch negotiations for a new global warming pact .
" too much is at stake , " he had said . " the alternative to a breakthrough in our efforts here and now is not acceptable . "
the negotiations snagged early saturday over demands by developing nations that their need for technological help from rich nations and other issues receive greater recognition in the document .
joining consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 180 countries took part in the un climate conference the us delegation had initially rejected these demands , but relented after delegates criticised the us stand and urged a reconsideration .
" i think we have come a long way here , " said dobriansky .
" in this , the united states is very committed to this effort and just wants to really ensure we all act together .
we will go forward and join consensus . "
the decision agreed upon includes a clear agenda for the key issues to be negotiated up to 2009 ; action for adapting to the negative consequences of climate change - including droughts and floods - along with ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , to widely deploy climate-friendly technologies and to finance both adoption and mitigation measures .
concluding negotiations in 2009 will ensure that the new deal can enter into force by 2013 , following the expiry of the first phase of the kyoto protocol .
" this is a real breakthrough , a real opportunity for the international community to successfully fight climate change , " said indonesian environment minister and president of the conference , rachmat witoelar .

15 . the report , which the german weekly der spiegel released in advance of its publication on monday , said the man was ordered to leave the country in july , but the case had not been disclosed until now .
the german foreign ministry declined to comment on the report .
the diplomat , an attaché at iran 's embassy in berlin , was reported to have been in contact with a specialist firm in the southern german state of bavaria .
" the consular attaché mohraramalai d. made contact with a bavarian firm of specialists , apparently trying to buy a piece of equipment which could also be used in uranium enrichment , " the magazine said . what kind of enrichment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran claims it wants to use its nuclear reactors for peaceful purposes the magazine did not say whether the component could have been used for high-grade enrichment , for bomb material , or low-grade enrichment , which iran says it carries out to make power plant fuel .
but it quoted a german government report which said that iran " keeps trying intensively to procure military goods and technology of all kinds from western industrial states . "
uranium exists naturally as an ore .
for it to be used as a source of nuclear energy or in atomic explosions , scientists need to separate out two of its isotopes , uranium-238 and uranium-235 , and boost the concentration of the latter , highly fissile , isotope .
this process is called enrichment .
western nations have been calling on iran to halt uranium enrichment , which they fear could lead to it making atomic weapons .
tehran , on the other hand , claims its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes .
renewed sanctions warning bildunterschrift : the un security council voted unanimously to expand sanctions against iran in march eu leaders reiterated on friday their support for possible additional sanctions against iran if it fails to give up nuclear enrichment work .
a joint statement from leaders of the 27-member block meeting in brussels called on iran to provide " full , clear and credible answers " to the u.n. international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to resolve questions about its nuclear activity .
they added that the council of member states " reiterates its full support to the work in the un security council to adopt further measures " and said a decision would be taken at the next meeting of eu foreign ministers due on jan .
28 , in the light of upcoming decisions in the un security council .
the eu warning came despite a us national intelligence estimate -lrb- nie -rrb- report earlier this month claiming iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in late 2003 .
nie cited " moderate confidence " that the program had not been restarted as of mid-2007 .
tehran could have the technical ability to build a nuclear weapon between 2010 and 2015 , but " we do not know if it currently intends to develop nuclear weapons , " the report stated . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 . the report , which the german weekly der spiegel released in advance of its publication on monday , said the man was ordered to leave the country in july , but the case had not been disclosed until now .
the german foreign ministry declined to comment on the report .
the diplomat , an attaché at iran 's embassy in berlin , was reported to have been in contact with a specialist firm in the southern german state of bavaria .
" the consular attaché mohraramalai d. made contact with a bavarian firm of specialists , apparently trying to buy a piece of equipment which could also be used in uranium enrichment , " the magazine said . what kind of enrichment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran claims it wants to use its nuclear reactors for peaceful purposes the magazine did not say whether the component could have been used for high-grade enrichment , for bomb material , or low-grade enrichment , which iran says it carries out to make power plant fuel .
but it quoted a german government report which said that iran " keeps trying intensively to procure military goods and technology of all kinds from western industrial states . "
uranium exists naturally as an ore .
for it to be used as a source of nuclear energy or in atomic explosions , scientists need to separate out two of its isotopes , uranium-238 and uranium-235 , and boost the concentration of the latter , highly fissile , isotope .
this process is called enrichment .
western nations have been calling on iran to halt uranium enrichment , which they fear could lead to it making atomic weapons .
tehran , on the other hand , claims its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes .
renewed sanctions warning bildunterschrift : the un security council voted unanimously to expand sanctions against iran in march eu leaders reiterated on friday their support for possible additional sanctions against iran if it fails to give up nuclear enrichment work .
a joint statement from leaders of the 27-member block meeting in brussels called on iran to provide " full , clear and credible answers " to the u.n. international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to resolve questions about its nuclear activity .
they added that the council of member states " reiterates its full support to the work in the un security council to adopt further measures " and said a decision would be taken at the next meeting of eu foreign ministers due on jan .
28 , in the light of upcoming decisions in the un security council .
the eu warning came despite a us national intelligence estimate -lrb- nie -rrb- report earlier this month claiming iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in late 2003 .
nie cited " moderate confidence " that the program had not been restarted as of mid-2007 .
tehran could have the technical ability to build a nuclear weapon between 2010 and 2015 , but " we do not know if it currently intends to develop nuclear weapons , " the report stated . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de germany calls for continued pressure on iran the german government said wednesday that the international community needed to continue pressing iran to halt its uranium enrichment program as tehran remained in violation of international law .

it was a favorite of nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels , who had funded it .
" the film is an overwhelming success , " he gloated in his diary in 1940 .
" the audience was seething .
this is the first really anti-semitic film . "
the movie , a remake of a story that had previously had a pro-jewish slant , depicts a jewish businessman , joseph süss , manipulating the government of a german ducal state , raping a german girl and being condemned .
unlike the nazi pseudo-documentary " der ewige jude " -lrb- the eternal jew -rrb- , which came out in the same year and which blatantly exploited racist stereotypes , " jud süss " was commissioned to get the nazi chauvinistic message across in the more subtle guise of a familiar hollywood-style historical drama . it will be shown at the baden-württemberg history museum in stuttgart , the city where the real joseph süss oppenheimer was executed on trumped-up charges in 1738 . nazi propaganda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition explores the visual language of nazi ideology paula lutum-lenger , the curator , said the museum exhibition , open till august 3 next year , explains the tricks used by the nazis to make the film audience hate jews . the one-hour movie was seen by 20 million people in nazi germany and paramilitary chief heinrich himmler made it compulsory for all police and ss members to see it . jewish concentration camp inmates say they received extra rough treatment on the day after nazi guards had been to screenings . the movie is banned from general screening in germany today and can only be shown with a commentary explaining its falsehoods .
at the exhibition , six scenes from the film run continuously as video . documenting the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goebbels described movies as weapons of " total war " the 600-square-meter show , which opened on friday , dec .
15 , includes film posters , the script , old cameras from babelsberg studios near berlin and facsimile documents about the real süss , who modern stuttgart people are curious to learn more about . the 16 full screenings will be preceded by lectures and followed by panel discussions . the real joseph süss oppenheimer -lrb- 1698-1738 -rrb- was chief financial adviser to the duke of württemberg .
his opponents used the vilest anti-semitic claims to execute him after his patron duke karl alexander died . his life was fictionalized in a german novella by wilhelm hauff in 1827 and a best-selling 1925 novel by lion feuchtwanger , but the plot was only rewritten into a hate script in the nazi film directed by veit harlan -lrb- 1899-1964 -rrb- . films were one of göbbels ' key instruments in manipulating public opinion : he described movies as a " weapon " of " total war . " the exhibition also details how harlan and the cast tried to wriggle out of blame after the war . harlan was tried in hamburg for crimes against humanity , but acquitted after judges said they could not establish a causal linkage in law between the film and the holocaust . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , when benefits for stay-at-home parents were increased , and the end of september , 394,000 people registered for the program , family affairs minister ursula von der leyen told reporters on friday , dec .
14 . the measures allow one parent to take up a year of leave from work after the birth of a child while receiving two-thirds of their net pay from the state .
benefits are extended to a maximum of 14 months if both parents take at least two months leave . von der leyen said the policy , which caps benefits at 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,600 -rrb- per month , came at the same time the federal statistics office announced the first increase in recorded births in germany in a decade . numbers could increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most recipients have one child " i know this is just a beginning but i hope it will lead to a stable trend , " she said .
" you see in these figures that younger people have begun to have some faith in the government but also in society and the business community that they can reliably plan a future with children . " she said incentives for men to take a few months of paternity leave had proven attractive to new fathers , with 9.6 percent taking advantage of the policy - more than experts had forecast . parents have to file for leave with their employers seven weeks ahead of their date of departure , leaving open the possibility that some parents intend to take part in the scheme but have not yet filed their petition to do so . " three-quarters of those fathers were working before the birth of their child , " she said , hailing the " great support " the business community had offered to men who take time off to care for their children . added funding next year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interest among fathers caused the progam to run overbudget , von der leyen said she said surveys showed that 34 percent of men who became fathers in 2007 said they were interested in taking parental leave .
half of the recipients are under 30 and 56 percent have one child . parents ' response to the measures meant that the program 's budget of 3.5 billion euros has been overdrawn by 130 million euros . " fathers blew the budget for 2007 , " von der leyen said , adding that she was calling for the budget to increase to 4 billion euros .
" i think it 's the best thing that could have happened to our country . " the family ministry said the new law exceeded its forecasted budget because men tend to earn more than their partners and it was more expensive for the state if they chose to stay at home with their children . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" much more was achieved than expected given the different interests at stake , " the minister said in bali where he represented germany at the talks .
at the same time , the result that came out of the tough negotiations was less than what germany and the european union had hoped for , he said .
gabriel said the important thing was that there was now a roadmap for a new climate treaty with " considerably stronger " commitments to climate protection from all industrial nations , including the united states .
the un conference was also a success inasmuch as it included developing nations in climate protection measures for the first time , he said .
the talks ended on saturday with an agreement on a " roadmap " for a two-year process of negotiations designed to set new targets for greenhouse gas emissions to replace those in the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
marathon talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will all the polar bear activits be happy with the outcome of the conference ?
the " roadmap " deal was reached following a dramatic final session of the marathon talks which saw the us delegation drop its objections to the final document .
head of the us delegation paula dobriansky said that 20 hours after the scheduled end of the conference , her country did not want to stand in the way of agreement .
environmentalist groups said that political leaders meeting in bali hammered out a deal which launches formal negotiations with a 2009 end date , but the deal falls short in its ambition .
" the bush administration has unscrupulously taken a monkey wrench to the level of action on climate change that the science demands , " said gerd leipold , executive director of greenpeace international .
" they 're relegated the science to a footnote . "
developing countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head of the us delegation , undersecretary of state paula dobriansky -lrb- right -rrb- before nailing down the agreement , developing countries including india and china had expressed concern that they might be forced to accept binding emissions reduction standards .
they are not required to accept emission reduction commitments under the kyoto protocol , and say that any such commitments would cramp economic growth and curb poverty reduction efforts .
the agreement was reached after indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono and un secretary-general ban ki-moon urged the delegates to reach a breakthrough .
ban said he was disappointed by the level of progress at the conference and urged delegates to quickly approve a compromise plan to launch negotiations for a new global warming pact .
" too much is at stake , " he had said . " the alternative to a breakthrough in our efforts here and now is not acceptable . "
the negotiations snagged early saturday over demands by developing nations that their need for technological help from rich nations and other issues receive greater recognition in the document .
joining consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 180 countries took part in the un climate conference the us delegation had initially rejected these demands , but relented after delegates criticised the us stand and urged a reconsideration .
" i think we have come a long way here , " said dobriansky .
" in this , the united states is very committed to this effort and just wants to really ensure we all act together .
we will go forward and join consensus . "
the decision agreed upon includes a clear agenda for the key issues to be negotiated up to 2009 ; action for adapting to the negative consequences of climate change - including droughts and floods - along with ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , to widely deploy climate-friendly technologies and to finance both adoption and mitigation measures .
concluding negotiations in 2009 will ensure that the new deal can enter into force by 2013 , following the expiry of the first phase of the kyoto protocol .
" this is a real breakthrough , a real opportunity for the international community to successfully fight climate change , " said indonesian environment minister and president of the conference , rachmat witoelar .

" much more was achieved than expected given the different interests at stake , " the minister said in bali where he represented germany at the talks .
at the same time , the result that came out of the tough negotiations was less than what germany and the european union had hoped for , he said .
gabriel said the important thing was that there was now a roadmap for a new climate treaty with " considerably stronger " commitments to climate protection from all industrial nations , including the united states .
the un conference was also a success inasmuch as it included developing nations in climate protection measures for the first time , he said .
the talks ended on saturday with an agreement on a " roadmap " for a two-year process of negotiations designed to set new targets for greenhouse gas emissions to replace those in the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
marathon talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will all the polar bear activits be happy with the outcome of the conference ?
the " roadmap " deal was reached following a dramatic final session of the marathon talks which saw the us delegation drop its objections to the final document .
head of the us delegation paula dobriansky said that 20 hours after the scheduled end of the conference , her country did not want to stand in the way of agreement .
environmentalist groups said that political leaders meeting in bali hammered out a deal which launches formal negotiations with a 2009 end date , but the deal falls short in its ambition .

they are not required to accept emission reduction commitments under the kyoto protocol , and say that any such commitments would cramp economic growth and curb poverty reduction efforts .
the agreement was reached after indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono and un secretary-general ban ki-moon urged the delegates to reach a breakthrough .
ban said he was disappointed by the level of progress at the conference and urged delegates to quickly approve a compromise plan to launch negotiations for a new global warming pact .
" too much is at stake , " he had said . " the alternative to a breakthrough in our efforts here and now is not acceptable . "
the negotiations snagged early saturday over demands by developing nations that their need for technological help from rich nations and other issues receive greater recognition in the document .

" in this , the united states is very committed to this effort and just wants to really ensure we all act together .
we will go forward and join consensus . "
the decision agreed upon includes a clear agenda for the key issues to be negotiated up to 2009 ; action for adapting to the negative consequences of climate change - including droughts and floods - along with ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , to widely deploy climate-friendly technologies and to finance both adoption and mitigation measures .
concluding negotiations in 2009 will ensure that the new deal can enter into force by 2013 , following the expiry of the first phase of the kyoto protocol .

15 . the report , which the german weekly der spiegel released in advance of its publication on monday , said the man was ordered to leave the country in july , but the case had not been disclosed until now .
the german foreign ministry declined to comment on the report .
the diplomat , an attaché at iran 's embassy in berlin , was reported to have been in contact with a specialist firm in the southern german state of bavaria .
" the consular attaché mohraramalai d. made contact with a bavarian firm of specialists , apparently trying to buy a piece of equipment which could also be used in uranium enrichment , " the magazine said . what kind of enrichment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran claims it wants to use its nuclear reactors for peaceful purposes the magazine did not say whether the component could have been used for high-grade enrichment , for bomb material , or low-grade enrichment , which iran says it carries out to make power plant fuel .
but it quoted a german government report which said that iran " keeps trying intensively to procure military goods and technology of all kinds from western industrial states . "
uranium exists naturally as an ore .
for it to be used as a source of nuclear energy or in atomic explosions , scientists need to separate out two of its isotopes , uranium-238 and uranium-235 , and boost the concentration of the latter , highly fissile , isotope .
this process is called enrichment .
western nations have been calling on iran to halt uranium enrichment , which they fear could lead to it making atomic weapons .
tehran , on the other hand , claims its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes .
renewed sanctions warning bildunterschrift : the un security council voted unanimously to expand sanctions against iran in march eu leaders reiterated on friday their support for possible additional sanctions against iran if it fails to give up nuclear enrichment work .
a joint statement from leaders of the 27-member block meeting in brussels called on iran to provide " full , clear and credible answers " to the u.n. international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to resolve questions about its nuclear activity .
they added that the council of member states " reiterates its full support to the work in the un security council to adopt further measures " and said a decision would be taken at the next meeting of eu foreign ministers due on jan .
28 , in the light of upcoming decisions in the un security council .
the eu warning came despite a us national intelligence estimate -lrb- nie -rrb- report earlier this month claiming iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in late 2003 .
nie cited " moderate confidence " that the program had not been restarted as of mid-2007 .
tehran could have the technical ability to build a nuclear weapon between 2010 and 2015 , but " we do not know if it currently intends to develop nuclear weapons , " the report stated . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was a favorite of nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels , who had funded it .
" the film is an overwhelming success , " he gloated in his diary in 1940 .
" the audience was seething .
this is the first really anti-semitic film . "
the movie , a remake of a story that had previously had a pro-jewish slant , depicts a jewish businessman , joseph süss , manipulating the government of a german ducal state , raping a german girl and being condemned .
unlike the nazi pseudo-documentary " der ewige jude " -lrb- the eternal jew -rrb- , which came out in the same year and which blatantly exploited racist stereotypes , " jud süss " was commissioned to get the nazi chauvinistic message across in the more subtle guise of a familiar hollywood-style historical drama . it will be shown at the baden-württemberg history museum in stuttgart , the city where the real joseph süss oppenheimer was executed on trumped-up charges in 1738 . nazi propaganda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition explores the visual language of nazi ideology paula lutum-lenger , the curator , said the museum exhibition , open till august 3 next year , explains the tricks used by the nazis to make the film audience hate jews . the one-hour movie was seen by 20 million people in nazi germany and paramilitary chief heinrich himmler made it compulsory for all police and ss members to see it . jewish concentration camp inmates say they received extra rough treatment on the day after nazi guards had been to screenings . the movie is banned from general screening in germany today and can only be shown with a commentary explaining its falsehoods .
at the exhibition , six scenes from the film run continuously as video . documenting the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goebbels described movies as weapons of " total war " the 600-square-meter show , which opened on friday , dec .
15 , includes film posters , the script , old cameras from babelsberg studios near berlin and facsimile documents about the real süss , who modern stuttgart people are curious to learn more about . the 16 full screenings will be preceded by lectures and followed by panel discussions . the real joseph süss oppenheimer -lrb- 1698-1738 -rrb- was chief financial adviser to the duke of württemberg .
his opponents used the vilest anti-semitic claims to execute him after his patron duke karl alexander died . his life was fictionalized in a german novella by wilhelm hauff in 1827 and a best-selling 1925 novel by lion feuchtwanger , but the plot was only rewritten into a hate script in the nazi film directed by veit harlan -lrb- 1899-1964 -rrb- . films were one of göbbels ' key instruments in manipulating public opinion : he described movies as a " weapon " of " total war . " the exhibition also details how harlan and the cast tried to wriggle out of blame after the war . harlan was tried in hamburg for crimes against humanity , but acquitted after judges said they could not establish a causal linkage in law between the film and the holocaust . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

benefits are extended to a maximum of 14 months if both parents take at least two months leave . von der leyen said the policy , which caps benefits at 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,600 -rrb- per month , came at the same time the federal statistics office announced the first increase in recorded births in germany in a decade . numbers could increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most recipients have one child " i know this is just a beginning but i hope it will lead to a stable trend , " she said .

" much more was achieved than expected given the different interests at stake , " the minister said in bali where he represented germany at the talks .
at the same time , the result that came out of the tough negotiations was less than what germany and the european union had hoped for , he said .
gabriel said the important thing was that there was now a roadmap for a new climate treaty with " considerably stronger " commitments to climate protection from all industrial nations , including the united states .
the un conference was also a success inasmuch as it included developing nations in climate protection measures for the first time , he said .
the talks ended on saturday with an agreement on a " roadmap " for a two-year process of negotiations designed to set new targets for greenhouse gas emissions to replace those in the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
marathon talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will all the polar bear activits be happy with the outcome of the conference ?
the " roadmap " deal was reached following a dramatic final session of the marathon talks which saw the us delegation drop its objections to the final document .
head of the us delegation paula dobriansky said that 20 hours after the scheduled end of the conference , her country did not want to stand in the way of agreement .
environmentalist groups said that political leaders meeting in bali hammered out a deal which launches formal negotiations with a 2009 end date , but the deal falls short in its ambition .
" the bush administration has unscrupulously taken a monkey wrench to the level of action on climate change that the science demands , " said gerd leipold , executive director of greenpeace international .
" they 're relegated the science to a footnote . "
developing countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head of the us delegation , undersecretary of state paula dobriansky -lrb- right -rrb- before nailing down the agreement , developing countries including india and china had expressed concern that they might be forced to accept binding emissions reduction standards .
they are not required to accept emission reduction commitments under the kyoto protocol , and say that any such commitments would cramp economic growth and curb poverty reduction efforts .
the agreement was reached after indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono and un secretary-general ban ki-moon urged the delegates to reach a breakthrough .
ban said he was disappointed by the level of progress at the conference and urged delegates to quickly approve a compromise plan to launch negotiations for a new global warming pact .
" too much is at stake , " he had said . " the alternative to a breakthrough in our efforts here and now is not acceptable . "
the negotiations snagged early saturday over demands by developing nations that their need for technological help from rich nations and other issues receive greater recognition in the document .
joining consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 180 countries took part in the un climate conference the us delegation had initially rejected these demands , but relented after delegates criticised the us stand and urged a reconsideration .
" i think we have come a long way here , " said dobriansky .
" in this , the united states is very committed to this effort and just wants to really ensure we all act together .
we will go forward and join consensus . "
the decision agreed upon includes a clear agenda for the key issues to be negotiated up to 2009 ; action for adapting to the negative consequences of climate change - including droughts and floods - along with ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , to widely deploy climate-friendly technologies and to finance both adoption and mitigation measures .
concluding negotiations in 2009 will ensure that the new deal can enter into force by 2013 , following the expiry of the first phase of the kyoto protocol .
" this is a real breakthrough , a real opportunity for the international community to successfully fight climate change , " said indonesian environment minister and president of the conference , rachmat witoelar .
not nearly enough ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general ban ki-moon -lrb- left -rrb- made a plea to all the delagates to reach a compromise environmental activist , however , were less optimistic . the bali roadmap does not ensure that all developed countries will negotiate on binding reduction commitments , and leaves open the possibility for voluntarily actions by developed countries as well , said oxfam international . despite the scientific evidence , there is " no clear goal for global emissions cuts " in the bali roadmap or even a range of emissions targets for developed countries with a guideline for reduction of 25-40 per cent below 1990 by 2020 , the group said . during an emotional showdown in the final hours of the meeting , the us delegation , under intense of pressure , decided to join in the global talks .
the price of us participation , however , was a deal weak on substance , said the world wide for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- . " the us administration was asked to get out of the way , and in the end they bowed to pressure , " said hans verolme , director of wwf 's global climate change program . " the bali roadmap leaves a seat at the table for the next us president to make a real contribution to the global fight to stop dangerous climate change , " he said . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 . the report , which the german weekly der spiegel released in advance of its publication on monday , said the man was ordered to leave the country in july , but the case had not been disclosed until now .
the german foreign ministry declined to comment on the report .
the diplomat , an attaché at iran 's embassy in berlin , was reported to have been in contact with a specialist firm in the southern german state of bavaria .
" the consular attaché mohraramalai d. made contact with a bavarian firm of specialists , apparently trying to buy a piece of equipment which could also be used in uranium enrichment , " the magazine said . what kind of enrichment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran claims it wants to use its nuclear reactors for peaceful purposes the magazine did not say whether the component could have been used for high-grade enrichment , for bomb material , or low-grade enrichment , which iran says it carries out to make power plant fuel .
but it quoted a german government report which said that iran " keeps trying intensively to procure military goods and technology of all kinds from western industrial states . "
uranium exists naturally as an ore .
for it to be used as a source of nuclear energy or in atomic explosions , scientists need to separate out two of its isotopes , uranium-238 and uranium-235 , and boost the concentration of the latter , highly fissile , isotope .
this process is called enrichment .
western nations have been calling on iran to halt uranium enrichment , which they fear could lead to it making atomic weapons .
tehran , on the other hand , claims its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes .
renewed sanctions warning bildunterschrift : the un security council voted unanimously to expand sanctions against iran in march eu leaders reiterated on friday their support for possible additional sanctions against iran if it fails to give up nuclear enrichment work .
a joint statement from leaders of the 27-member block meeting in brussels called on iran to provide " full , clear and credible answers " to the u.n. international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to resolve questions about its nuclear activity .
they added that the council of member states " reiterates its full support to the work in the un security council to adopt further measures " and said a decision would be taken at the next meeting of eu foreign ministers due on jan .
28 , in the light of upcoming decisions in the un security council .
the eu warning came despite a us national intelligence estimate -lrb- nie -rrb- report earlier this month claiming iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in late 2003 .
nie cited " moderate confidence " that the program had not been restarted as of mid-2007 .
tehran could have the technical ability to build a nuclear weapon between 2010 and 2015 , but " we do not know if it currently intends to develop nuclear weapons , " the report stated . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the success comes with a price tag . between jan .
1 , when benefits for stay-at-home parents were increased , and the end of september , 394,000 people registered for the program , family affairs minister ursula von der leyen told reporters on friday , dec .
14 . the measures allow one parent to take up a year of leave from work after the birth of a child while receiving two-thirds of their net pay from the state .
benefits are extended to a maximum of 14 months if both parents take at least two months leave . von der leyen said the policy , which caps benefits at 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,600 -rrb- per month , came at the same time the federal statistics office announced the first increase in recorded births in germany in a decade . numbers could increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most recipients have one child " i know this is just a beginning but i hope it will lead to a stable trend , " she said .
" you see in these figures that younger people have begun to have some faith in the government but also in society and the business community that they can reliably plan a future with children . " she said incentives for men to take a few months of paternity leave had proven attractive to new fathers , with 9.6 percent taking advantage of the policy - more than experts had forecast . parents have to file for leave with their employers seven weeks ahead of their date of departure , leaving open the possibility that some parents intend to take part in the scheme but have not yet filed their petition to do so . " three-quarters of those fathers were working before the birth of their child , " she said , hailing the " great support " the business community had offered to men who take time off to care for their children . added funding next year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interest among fathers caused the progam to run overbudget , von der leyen said she said surveys showed that 34 percent of men who became fathers in 2007 said they were interested in taking parental leave .
half of the recipients are under 30 and 56 percent have one child . parents ' response to the measures meant that the program 's budget of 3.5 billion euros has been overdrawn by 130 million euros . " fathers blew the budget for 2007 , " von der leyen said , adding that she was calling for the budget to increase to 4 billion euros .
" i think it 's the best thing that could have happened to our country . " the family ministry said the new law exceeded its forecasted budget because men tend to earn more than their partners and it was more expensive for the state if they chose to stay at home with their children . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 . the report , which the german weekly der spiegel released in advance of its publication on monday , said the man was ordered to leave the country in july , but the case had not been disclosed until now .
the german foreign ministry declined to comment on the report .
the diplomat , an attaché at iran 's embassy in berlin , was reported to have been in contact with a specialist firm in the southern german state of bavaria .
" the consular attaché mohraramalai d. made contact with a bavarian firm of specialists , apparently trying to buy a piece of equipment which could also be used in uranium enrichment , " the magazine said . what kind of enrichment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran claims it wants to use its nuclear reactors for peaceful purposes the magazine did not say whether the component could have been used for high-grade enrichment , for bomb material , or low-grade enrichment , which iran says it carries out to make power plant fuel .
but it quoted a german government report which said that iran " keeps trying intensively to procure military goods and technology of all kinds from western industrial states . "
uranium exists naturally as an ore .
for it to be used as a source of nuclear energy or in atomic explosions , scientists need to separate out two of its isotopes , uranium-238 and uranium-235 , and boost the concentration of the latter , highly fissile , isotope .
this process is called enrichment .
western nations have been calling on iran to halt uranium enrichment , which they fear could lead to it making atomic weapons .
tehran , on the other hand , claims its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes .
renewed sanctions warning bildunterschrift : the un security council voted unanimously to expand sanctions against iran in march eu leaders reiterated on friday their support for possible additional sanctions against iran if it fails to give up nuclear enrichment work .
a joint statement from leaders of the 27-member block meeting in brussels called on iran to provide " full , clear and credible answers " to the u.n. international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to resolve questions about its nuclear activity .
they added that the council of member states " reiterates its full support to the work in the un security council to adopt further measures " and said a decision would be taken at the next meeting of eu foreign ministers due on jan .
28 , in the light of upcoming decisions in the un security council .
the eu warning came despite a us national intelligence estimate -lrb- nie -rrb- report earlier this month claiming iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in late 2003 .
nie cited " moderate confidence " that the program had not been restarted as of mid-2007 .
tehran could have the technical ability to build a nuclear weapon between 2010 and 2015 , but " we do not know if it currently intends to develop nuclear weapons , " the report stated . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was a favorite of nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels , who had funded it .
" the film is an overwhelming success , " he gloated in his diary in 1940 .
" the audience was seething .
this is the first really anti-semitic film . "
the movie , a remake of a story that had previously had a pro-jewish slant , depicts a jewish businessman , joseph süss , manipulating the government of a german ducal state , raping a german girl and being condemned .
unlike the nazi pseudo-documentary " der ewige jude " -lrb- the eternal jew -rrb- , which came out in the same year and which blatantly exploited racist stereotypes , " jud süss " was commissioned to get the nazi chauvinistic message across in the more subtle guise of a familiar hollywood-style historical drama . it will be shown at the baden-württemberg history museum in stuttgart , the city where the real joseph süss oppenheimer was executed on trumped-up charges in 1738 . nazi propaganda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition explores the visual language of nazi ideology paula lutum-lenger , the curator , said the museum exhibition , open till august 3 next year , explains the tricks used by the nazis to make the film audience hate jews . the one-hour movie was seen by 20 million people in nazi germany and paramilitary chief heinrich himmler made it compulsory for all police and ss members to see it . jewish concentration camp inmates say they received extra rough treatment on the day after nazi guards had been to screenings . the movie is banned from general screening in germany today and can only be shown with a commentary explaining its falsehoods .
at the exhibition , six scenes from the film run continuously as video . documenting the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goebbels described movies as weapons of " total war " the 600-square-meter show , which opened on friday , dec .
15 , includes film posters , the script , old cameras from babelsberg studios near berlin and facsimile documents about the real süss , who modern stuttgart people are curious to learn more about . the 16 full screenings will be preceded by lectures and followed by panel discussions . the real joseph süss oppenheimer -lrb- 1698-1738 -rrb- was chief financial adviser to the duke of württemberg .
his opponents used the vilest anti-semitic claims to execute him after his patron duke karl alexander died . his life was fictionalized in a german novella by wilhelm hauff in 1827 and a best-selling 1925 novel by lion feuchtwanger , but the plot was only rewritten into a hate script in the nazi film directed by veit harlan -lrb- 1899-1964 -rrb- . films were one of göbbels ' key instruments in manipulating public opinion : he described movies as a " weapon " of " total war . " the exhibition also details how harlan and the cast tried to wriggle out of blame after the war . harlan was tried in hamburg for crimes against humanity , but acquitted after judges said they could not establish a causal linkage in law between the film and the holocaust . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the success comes with a price tag . between jan .
1 , when benefits for stay-at-home parents were increased , and the end of september , 394,000 people registered for the program , family affairs minister ursula von der leyen told reporters on friday , dec .
14 . the measures allow one parent to take up a year of leave from work after the birth of a child while receiving two-thirds of their net pay from the state .
benefits are extended to a maximum of 14 months if both parents take at least two months leave . von der leyen said the policy , which caps benefits at 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,600 -rrb- per month , came at the same time the federal statistics office announced the first increase in recorded births in germany in a decade . numbers could increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most recipients have one child " i know this is just a beginning but i hope it will lead to a stable trend , " she said .
" you see in these figures that younger people have begun to have some faith in the government but also in society and the business community that they can reliably plan a future with children . " she said incentives for men to take a few months of paternity leave had proven attractive to new fathers , with 9.6 percent taking advantage of the policy - more than experts had forecast . parents have to file for leave with their employers seven weeks ahead of their date of departure , leaving open the possibility that some parents intend to take part in the scheme but have not yet filed their petition to do so . " three-quarters of those fathers were working before the birth of their child , " she said , hailing the " great support " the business community had offered to men who take time off to care for their children . added funding next year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interest among fathers caused the progam to run overbudget , von der leyen said she said surveys showed that 34 percent of men who became fathers in 2007 said they were interested in taking parental leave .
half of the recipients are under 30 and 56 percent have one child . parents ' response to the measures meant that the program 's budget of 3.5 billion euros has been overdrawn by 130 million euros . " fathers blew the budget for 2007 , " von der leyen said , adding that she was calling for the budget to increase to 4 billion euros .
" i think it 's the best thing that could have happened to our country . " the family ministry said the new law exceeded its forecasted budget because men tend to earn more than their partners and it was more expensive for the state if they chose to stay at home with their children . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 . the report , which the german weekly der spiegel released in advance of its publication on monday , said the man was ordered to leave the country in july , but the case had not been disclosed until now .
the german foreign ministry declined to comment on the report .
the diplomat , an attaché at iran 's embassy in berlin , was reported to have been in contact with a specialist firm in the southern german state of bavaria .
" the consular attaché mohraramalai d. made contact with a bavarian firm of specialists , apparently trying to buy a piece of equipment which could also be used in uranium enrichment , " the magazine said . what kind of enrichment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran claims it wants to use its nuclear reactors for peaceful purposes the magazine did not say whether the component could have been used for high-grade enrichment , for bomb material , or low-grade enrichment , which iran says it carries out to make power plant fuel .
but it quoted a german government report which said that iran " keeps trying intensively to procure military goods and technology of all kinds from western industrial states . "
uranium exists naturally as an ore .
for it to be used as a source of nuclear energy or in atomic explosions , scientists need to separate out two of its isotopes , uranium-238 and uranium-235 , and boost the concentration of the latter , highly fissile , isotope .
this process is called enrichment .
western nations have been calling on iran to halt uranium enrichment , which they fear could lead to it making atomic weapons .
tehran , on the other hand , claims its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes .
renewed sanctions warning bildunterschrift : the un security council voted unanimously to expand sanctions against iran in march eu leaders reiterated on friday their support for possible additional sanctions against iran if it fails to give up nuclear enrichment work .
a joint statement from leaders of the 27-member block meeting in brussels called on iran to provide " full , clear and credible answers " to the u.n. international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to resolve questions about its nuclear activity .
they added that the council of member states " reiterates its full support to the work in the un security council to adopt further measures " and said a decision would be taken at the next meeting of eu foreign ministers due on jan .
28 , in the light of upcoming decisions in the un security council .
the eu warning came despite a us national intelligence estimate -lrb- nie -rrb- report earlier this month claiming iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in late 2003 .
nie cited " moderate confidence " that the program had not been restarted as of mid-2007 .
tehran could have the technical ability to build a nuclear weapon between 2010 and 2015 , but " we do not know if it currently intends to develop nuclear weapons , " the report stated . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" much more was achieved than expected given the different interests at stake , " the minister said in bali where he represented germany at the talks .
at the same time , the result that came out of the tough negotiations was less than what germany and the european union had hoped for , he said .
gabriel said the important thing was that there was now a roadmap for a new climate treaty with " considerably stronger " commitments to climate protection from all industrial nations , including the united states .
the un conference was also a success inasmuch as it included developing nations in climate protection measures for the first time , he said .
the talks ended on saturday with an agreement on a " roadmap " for a two-year process of negotiations designed to set new targets for greenhouse gas emissions to replace those in the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
marathon talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will all the polar bear activits be happy with the outcome of the conference ?
the " roadmap " deal was reached following a dramatic final session of the marathon talks which saw the us delegation drop its objections to the final document .
head of the us delegation paula dobriansky said that 20 hours after the scheduled end of the conference , her country did not want to stand in the way of agreement .
environmentalist groups said that political leaders meeting in bali hammered out a deal which launches formal negotiations with a 2009 end date , but the deal falls short in its ambition .
" the bush administration has unscrupulously taken a monkey wrench to the level of action on climate change that the science demands , " said gerd leipold , executive director of greenpeace international .
" they 're relegated the science to a footnote . "
developing countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head of the us delegation , undersecretary of state paula dobriansky -lrb- right -rrb- before nailing down the agreement , developing countries including india and china had expressed concern that they might be forced to accept binding emissions reduction standards .
they are not required to accept emission reduction commitments under the kyoto protocol , and say that any such commitments would cramp economic growth and curb poverty reduction efforts .
the agreement was reached after indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono and un secretary-general ban ki-moon urged the delegates to reach a breakthrough .
ban said he was disappointed by the level of progress at the conference and urged delegates to quickly approve a compromise plan to launch negotiations for a new global warming pact .
" too much is at stake , " he had said . " the alternative to a breakthrough in our efforts here and now is not acceptable . "
the negotiations snagged early saturday over demands by developing nations that their need for technological help from rich nations and other issues receive greater recognition in the document .
joining consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 180 countries took part in the un climate conference the us delegation had initially rejected these demands , but relented after delegates criticised the us stand and urged a reconsideration .
" i think we have come a long way here , " said dobriansky .
" in this , the united states is very committed to this effort and just wants to really ensure we all act together .
we will go forward and join consensus . "
the decision agreed upon includes a clear agenda for the key issues to be negotiated up to 2009 ; action for adapting to the negative consequences of climate change - including droughts and floods - along with ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , to widely deploy climate-friendly technologies and to finance both adoption and mitigation measures .
concluding negotiations in 2009 will ensure that the new deal can enter into force by 2013 , following the expiry of the first phase of the kyoto protocol .
" this is a real breakthrough , a real opportunity for the international community to successfully fight climate change , " said indonesian environment minister and president of the conference , rachmat witoelar .
not nearly enough ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general ban ki-moon -lrb- left -rrb- made a plea to all the delagates to reach a compromise environmental activist , however , were less optimistic . the bali roadmap does not ensure that all developed countries will negotiate on binding reduction commitments , and leaves open the possibility for voluntarily actions by developed countries as well , said oxfam international . despite the scientific evidence , there is " no clear goal for global emissions cuts " in the bali roadmap or even a range of emissions targets for developed countries with a guideline for reduction of 25-40 per cent below 1990 by 2020 , the group said . during an emotional showdown in the final hours of the meeting , the us delegation , under intense of pressure , decided to join in the global talks .
the price of us participation , however , was a deal weak on substance , said the world wide for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- . " the us administration was asked to get out of the way , and in the end they bowed to pressure , " said hans verolme , director of wwf 's global climate change program . " the bali roadmap leaves a seat at the table for the next us president to make a real contribution to the global fight to stop dangerous climate change , " he said . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 . the report , which the german weekly der spiegel released in advance of its publication on monday , said the man was ordered to leave the country in july , but the case had not been disclosed until now .
the german foreign ministry declined to comment on the report .
the diplomat , an attaché at iran 's embassy in berlin , was reported to have been in contact with a specialist firm in the southern german state of bavaria .
" the consular attaché mohraramalai d. made contact with a bavarian firm of specialists , apparently trying to buy a piece of equipment which could also be used in uranium enrichment , " the magazine said . what kind of enrichment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran claims it wants to use its nuclear reactors for peaceful purposes the magazine did not say whether the component could have been used for high-grade enrichment , for bomb material , or low-grade enrichment , which iran says it carries out to make power plant fuel .
but it quoted a german government report which said that iran " keeps trying intensively to procure military goods and technology of all kinds from western industrial states . "
uranium exists naturally as an ore .
for it to be used as a source of nuclear energy or in atomic explosions , scientists need to separate out two of its isotopes , uranium-238 and uranium-235 , and boost the concentration of the latter , highly fissile , isotope .
this process is called enrichment .
western nations have been calling on iran to halt uranium enrichment , which they fear could lead to it making atomic weapons .
tehran , on the other hand , claims its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes .
renewed sanctions warning bildunterschrift : the un security council voted unanimously to expand sanctions against iran in march eu leaders reiterated on friday their support for possible additional sanctions against iran if it fails to give up nuclear enrichment work .
a joint statement from leaders of the 27-member block meeting in brussels called on iran to provide " full , clear and credible answers " to the u.n. international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to resolve questions about its nuclear activity .
they added that the council of member states " reiterates its full support to the work in the un security council to adopt further measures " and said a decision would be taken at the next meeting of eu foreign ministers due on jan .
28 , in the light of upcoming decisions in the un security council .
the eu warning came despite a us national intelligence estimate -lrb- nie -rrb- report earlier this month claiming iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in late 2003 .
nie cited " moderate confidence " that the program had not been restarted as of mid-2007 .
tehran could have the technical ability to build a nuclear weapon between 2010 and 2015 , but " we do not know if it currently intends to develop nuclear weapons , " the report stated . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de germany calls for continued pressure on iran the german government said wednesday that the international community needed to continue pressing iran to halt its uranium enrichment program as tehran remained in violation of international law .

it was a favorite of nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels , who had funded it .
" the film is an overwhelming success , " he gloated in his diary in 1940 .
" the audience was seething .
this is the first really anti-semitic film . "
the movie , a remake of a story that had previously had a pro-jewish slant , depicts a jewish businessman , joseph süss , manipulating the government of a german ducal state , raping a german girl and being condemned .
unlike the nazi pseudo-documentary " der ewige jude " -lrb- the eternal jew -rrb- , which came out in the same year and which blatantly exploited racist stereotypes , " jud süss " was commissioned to get the nazi chauvinistic message across in the more subtle guise of a familiar hollywood-style historical drama . it will be shown at the baden-württemberg history museum in stuttgart , the city where the real joseph süss oppenheimer was executed on trumped-up charges in 1738 . nazi propaganda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition explores the visual language of nazi ideology paula lutum-lenger , the curator , said the museum exhibition , open till august 3 next year , explains the tricks used by the nazis to make the film audience hate jews . the one-hour movie was seen by 20 million people in nazi germany and paramilitary chief heinrich himmler made it compulsory for all police and ss members to see it . jewish concentration camp inmates say they received extra rough treatment on the day after nazi guards had been to screenings . the movie is banned from general screening in germany today and can only be shown with a commentary explaining its falsehoods .
at the exhibition , six scenes from the film run continuously as video . documenting the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goebbels described movies as weapons of " total war " the 600-square-meter show , which opened on friday , dec .
15 , includes film posters , the script , old cameras from babelsberg studios near berlin and facsimile documents about the real süss , who modern stuttgart people are curious to learn more about . the 16 full screenings will be preceded by lectures and followed by panel discussions . the real joseph süss oppenheimer -lrb- 1698-1738 -rrb- was chief financial adviser to the duke of württemberg .
his opponents used the vilest anti-semitic claims to execute him after his patron duke karl alexander died . his life was fictionalized in a german novella by wilhelm hauff in 1827 and a best-selling 1925 novel by lion feuchtwanger , but the plot was only rewritten into a hate script in the nazi film directed by veit harlan -lrb- 1899-1964 -rrb- . films were one of göbbels ' key instruments in manipulating public opinion : he described movies as a " weapon " of " total war . " the exhibition also details how harlan and the cast tried to wriggle out of blame after the war . harlan was tried in hamburg for crimes against humanity , but acquitted after judges said they could not establish a causal linkage in law between the film and the holocaust . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" much more was achieved than expected given the different interests at stake , " the minister said in bali where he represented germany at the talks .
at the same time , the result that came out of the tough negotiations was less than what germany and the european union had hoped for , he said .
gabriel said the important thing was that there was now a roadmap for a new climate treaty with " considerably stronger " commitments to climate protection from all industrial nations , including the united states .
the un conference was also a success inasmuch as it included developing nations in climate protection measures for the first time , he said .
the talks ended on saturday with an agreement on a " roadmap " for a two-year process of negotiations designed to set new targets for greenhouse gas emissions to replace those in the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
marathon talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will all the polar bear activits be happy with the outcome of the conference ?
the " roadmap " deal was reached following a dramatic final session of the marathon talks which saw the us delegation drop its objections to the final document .
head of the us delegation paula dobriansky said that 20 hours after the scheduled end of the conference , her country did not want to stand in the way of agreement .
environmentalist groups said that political leaders meeting in bali hammered out a deal which launches formal negotiations with a 2009 end date , but the deal falls short in its ambition .
" the bush administration has unscrupulously taken a monkey wrench to the level of action on climate change that the science demands , " said gerd leipold , executive director of greenpeace international .
" they 're relegated the science to a footnote . "
developing countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head of the us delegation , undersecretary of state paula dobriansky -lrb- right -rrb- before nailing down the agreement , developing countries including india and china had expressed concern that they might be forced to accept binding emissions reduction standards .
they are not required to accept emission reduction commitments under the kyoto protocol , and say that any such commitments would cramp economic growth and curb poverty reduction efforts .
the agreement was reached after indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono and un secretary-general ban ki-moon urged the delegates to reach a breakthrough .
ban said he was disappointed by the level of progress at the conference and urged delegates to quickly approve a compromise plan to launch negotiations for a new global warming pact .
" too much is at stake , " he had said . " the alternative to a breakthrough in our efforts here and now is not acceptable . "
the negotiations snagged early saturday over demands by developing nations that their need for technological help from rich nations and other issues receive greater recognition in the document .
joining consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 180 countries took part in the un climate conference the us delegation had initially rejected these demands , but relented after delegates criticised the us stand and urged a reconsideration .
" i think we have come a long way here , " said dobriansky .
" in this , the united states is very committed to this effort and just wants to really ensure we all act together .
we will go forward and join consensus . "
the decision agreed upon includes a clear agenda for the key issues to be negotiated up to 2009 ; action for adapting to the negative consequences of climate change - including droughts and floods - along with ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , to widely deploy climate-friendly technologies and to finance both adoption and mitigation measures .
concluding negotiations in 2009 will ensure that the new deal can enter into force by 2013 , following the expiry of the first phase of the kyoto protocol .
" this is a real breakthrough , a real opportunity for the international community to successfully fight climate change , " said indonesian environment minister and president of the conference , rachmat witoelar .
not nearly enough ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general ban ki-moon -lrb- left -rrb- made a plea to all the delagates to reach a compromise environmental activist , however , were less optimistic . the bali roadmap does not ensure that all developed countries will negotiate on binding reduction commitments , and leaves open the possibility for voluntarily actions by developed countries as well , said oxfam international . despite the scientific evidence , there is " no clear goal for global emissions cuts " in the bali roadmap or even a range of emissions targets for developed countries with a guideline for reduction of 25-40 per cent below 1990 by 2020 , the group said . during an emotional showdown in the final hours of the meeting , the us delegation , under intense of pressure , decided to join in the global talks .

gabriel said the important thing was that there was now a roadmap for a new climate treaty with " considerably stronger " commitments to climate protection from all industrial nations , including the united states .
the un conference was also a success inasmuch as it included developing nations in climate protection measures for the first time , he said .
the talks ended on saturday with an agreement on a " roadmap " for a two-year process of negotiations designed to set new targets for greenhouse gas emissions to replace those in the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
marathon talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will all the polar bear activits be happy with the outcome of the conference ?
the " roadmap " deal was reached following a dramatic final session of the marathon talks which saw the us delegation drop its objections to the final document .
head of the us delegation paula dobriansky said that 20 hours after the scheduled end of the conference , her country did not want to stand in the way of agreement .
environmentalist groups said that political leaders meeting in bali hammered out a deal which launches formal negotiations with a 2009 end date , but the deal falls short in its ambition .
" the bush administration has unscrupulously taken a monkey wrench to the level of action on climate change that the science demands , " said gerd leipold , executive director of greenpeace international .
" they 're relegated the science to a footnote . "
developing countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head of the us delegation , undersecretary of state paula dobriansky -lrb- right -rrb- before nailing down the agreement , developing countries including india and china had expressed concern that they might be forced to accept binding emissions reduction standards .
they are not required to accept emission reduction commitments under the kyoto protocol , and say that any such commitments would cramp economic growth and curb poverty reduction efforts .
the agreement was reached after indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono and un secretary-general ban ki-moon urged the delegates to reach a breakthrough .
ban said he was disappointed by the level of progress at the conference and urged delegates to quickly approve a compromise plan to launch negotiations for a new global warming pact .
" too much is at stake , " he had said . " the alternative to a breakthrough in our efforts here and now is not acceptable . "
the negotiations snagged early saturday over demands by developing nations that their need for technological help from rich nations and other issues receive greater recognition in the document .
joining consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 180 countries took part in the un climate conference the us delegation had initially rejected these demands , but relented after delegates criticised the us stand and urged a reconsideration .
" i think we have come a long way here , " said dobriansky .
" in this , the united states is very committed to this effort and just wants to really ensure we all act together .
we will go forward and join consensus . "
the decision agreed upon includes a clear agenda for the key issues to be negotiated up to 2009 ; action for adapting to the negative consequences of climate change - including droughts and floods - along with ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , to widely deploy climate-friendly technologies and to finance both adoption and mitigation measures .
concluding negotiations in 2009 will ensure that the new deal can enter into force by 2013 , following the expiry of the first phase of the kyoto protocol .

it was a favorite of nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels , who had funded it .
" the film is an overwhelming success , " he gloated in his diary in 1940 .
" the audience was seething .
this is the first really anti-semitic film . "
the movie , a remake of a story that had previously had a pro-jewish slant , depicts a jewish businessman , joseph süss , manipulating the government of a german ducal state , raping a german girl and being condemned .
unlike the nazi pseudo-documentary " der ewige jude " -lrb- the eternal jew -rrb- , which came out in the same year and which blatantly exploited racist stereotypes , " jud süss " was commissioned to get the nazi chauvinistic message across in the more subtle guise of a familiar hollywood-style historical drama . it will be shown at the baden-württemberg history museum in stuttgart , the city where the real joseph süss oppenheimer was executed on trumped-up charges in 1738 . nazi propaganda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition explores the visual language of nazi ideology paula lutum-lenger , the curator , said the museum exhibition , open till august 3 next year , explains the tricks used by the nazis to make the film audience hate jews . the one-hour movie was seen by 20 million people in nazi germany and paramilitary chief heinrich himmler made it compulsory for all police and ss members to see it . jewish concentration camp inmates say they received extra rough treatment on the day after nazi guards had been to screenings . the movie is banned from general screening in germany today and can only be shown with a commentary explaining its falsehoods .
at the exhibition , six scenes from the film run continuously as video . documenting the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goebbels described movies as weapons of " total war " the 600-square-meter show , which opened on friday , dec .
15 , includes film posters , the script , old cameras from babelsberg studios near berlin and facsimile documents about the real süss , who modern stuttgart people are curious to learn more about . the 16 full screenings will be preceded by lectures and followed by panel discussions . the real joseph süss oppenheimer -lrb- 1698-1738 -rrb- was chief financial adviser to the duke of württemberg .

it was a favorite of nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels , who had funded it .
" the film is an overwhelming success , " he gloated in his diary in 1940 .
" the audience was seething .
this is the first really anti-semitic film . "
the movie , a remake of a story that had previously had a pro-jewish slant , depicts a jewish businessman , joseph süss , manipulating the government of a german ducal state , raping a german girl and being condemned .
unlike the nazi pseudo-documentary " der ewige jude " -lrb- the eternal jew -rrb- , which came out in the same year and which blatantly exploited racist stereotypes , " jud süss " was commissioned to get the nazi chauvinistic message across in the more subtle guise of a familiar hollywood-style historical drama . it will be shown at the baden-württemberg history museum in stuttgart , the city where the real joseph süss oppenheimer was executed on trumped-up charges in 1738 . nazi propaganda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition explores the visual language of nazi ideology paula lutum-lenger , the curator , said the museum exhibition , open till august 3 next year , explains the tricks used by the nazis to make the film audience hate jews . the one-hour movie was seen by 20 million people in nazi germany and paramilitary chief heinrich himmler made it compulsory for all police and ss members to see it . jewish concentration camp inmates say they received extra rough treatment on the day after nazi guards had been to screenings . the movie is banned from general screening in germany today and can only be shown with a commentary explaining its falsehoods .
at the exhibition , six scenes from the film run continuously as video . documenting the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goebbels described movies as weapons of " total war " the 600-square-meter show , which opened on friday , dec .
15 , includes film posters , the script , old cameras from babelsberg studios near berlin and facsimile documents about the real süss , who modern stuttgart people are curious to learn more about . the 16 full screenings will be preceded by lectures and followed by panel discussions . the real joseph süss oppenheimer -lrb- 1698-1738 -rrb- was chief financial adviser to the duke of württemberg .
his opponents used the vilest anti-semitic claims to execute him after his patron duke karl alexander died . his life was fictionalized in a german novella by wilhelm hauff in 1827 and a best-selling 1925 novel by lion feuchtwanger , but the plot was only rewritten into a hate script in the nazi film directed by veit harlan -lrb- 1899-1964 -rrb- . films were one of göbbels ' key instruments in manipulating public opinion : he described movies as a " weapon " of " total war .

" much more was achieved than expected given the different interests at stake , " the minister said in bali where he represented germany at the talks .
at the same time , the result that came out of the tough negotiations was less than what germany and the european union had hoped for , he said .
gabriel said the important thing was that there was now a roadmap for a new climate treaty with " considerably stronger " commitments to climate protection from all industrial nations , including the united states .
the un conference was also a success inasmuch as it included developing nations in climate protection measures for the first time , he said .
the talks ended on saturday with an agreement on a " roadmap " for a two-year process of negotiations designed to set new targets for greenhouse gas emissions to replace those in the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
marathon talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will all the polar bear activits be happy with the outcome of the conference ?
the " roadmap " deal was reached following a dramatic final session of the marathon talks which saw the us delegation drop its objections to the final document .
head of the us delegation paula dobriansky said that 20 hours after the scheduled end of the conference , her country did not want to stand in the way of agreement .
environmentalist groups said that political leaders meeting in bali hammered out a deal which launches formal negotiations with a 2009 end date , but the deal falls short in its ambition .
" the bush administration has unscrupulously taken a monkey wrench to the level of action on climate change that the science demands , " said gerd leipold , executive director of greenpeace international .
" they 're relegated the science to a footnote . "
developing countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head of the us delegation , undersecretary of state paula dobriansky -lrb- right -rrb- before nailing down the agreement , developing countries including india and china had expressed concern that they might be forced to accept binding emissions reduction standards .
they are not required to accept emission reduction commitments under the kyoto protocol , and say that any such commitments would cramp economic growth and curb poverty reduction efforts .
the agreement was reached after indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono and un secretary-general ban ki-moon urged the delegates to reach a breakthrough .
ban said he was disappointed by the level of progress at the conference and urged delegates to quickly approve a compromise plan to launch negotiations for a new global warming pact .
" too much is at stake , " he had said . " the alternative to a breakthrough in our efforts here and now is not acceptable . "
the negotiations snagged early saturday over demands by developing nations that their need for technological help from rich nations and other issues receive greater recognition in the document .
joining consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 180 countries took part in the un climate conference the us delegation had initially rejected these demands , but relented after delegates criticised the us stand and urged a reconsideration .
" i think we have come a long way here , " said dobriansky .
" in this , the united states is very committed to this effort and just wants to really ensure we all act together .
we will go forward and join consensus . "
the decision agreed upon includes a clear agenda for the key issues to be negotiated up to 2009 ; action for adapting to the negative consequences of climate change - including droughts and floods - along with ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , to widely deploy climate-friendly technologies and to finance both adoption and mitigation measures .
concluding negotiations in 2009 will ensure that the new deal can enter into force by 2013 , following the expiry of the first phase of the kyoto protocol .
" this is a real breakthrough , a real opportunity for the international community to successfully fight climate change , " said indonesian environment minister and president of the conference , rachmat witoelar .

it was a favorite of nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels , who had funded it .
" the film is an overwhelming success , " he gloated in his diary in 1940 .
" the audience was seething .
this is the first really anti-semitic film . "
the movie , a remake of a story that had previously had a pro-jewish slant , depicts a jewish businessman , joseph süss , manipulating the government of a german ducal state , raping a german girl and being condemned .
unlike the nazi pseudo-documentary " der ewige jude " -lrb- the eternal jew -rrb- , which came out in the same year and which blatantly exploited racist stereotypes , " jud süss " was commissioned to get the nazi chauvinistic message across in the more subtle guise of a familiar hollywood-style historical drama . it will be shown at the baden-württemberg history museum in stuttgart , the city where the real joseph süss oppenheimer was executed on trumped-up charges in 1738 . nazi propaganda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition explores the visual language of nazi ideology paula lutum-lenger , the curator , said the museum exhibition , open till august 3 next year , explains the tricks used by the nazis to make the film audience hate jews . the one-hour movie was seen by 20 million people in nazi germany and paramilitary chief heinrich himmler made it compulsory for all police and ss members to see it . jewish concentration camp inmates say they received extra rough treatment on the day after nazi guards had been to screenings . the movie is banned from general screening in germany today and can only be shown with a commentary explaining its falsehoods .
at the exhibition , six scenes from the film run continuously as video . documenting the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goebbels described movies as weapons of " total war " the 600-square-meter show , which opened on friday , dec .
15 , includes film posters , the script , old cameras from babelsberg studios near berlin and facsimile documents about the real süss , who modern stuttgart people are curious to learn more about . the 16 full screenings will be preceded by lectures and followed by panel discussions . the real joseph süss oppenheimer -lrb- 1698-1738 -rrb- was chief financial adviser to the duke of württemberg .
his opponents used the vilest anti-semitic claims to execute him after his patron duke karl alexander died . his life was fictionalized in a german novella by wilhelm hauff in 1827 and a best-selling 1925 novel by lion feuchtwanger , but the plot was only rewritten into a hate script in the nazi film directed by veit harlan -lrb- 1899-1964 -rrb- . films were one of göbbels ' key instruments in manipulating public opinion : he described movies as a " weapon " of " total war . " the exhibition also details how harlan and the cast tried to wriggle out of blame after the war . harlan was tried in hamburg for crimes against humanity , but acquitted after judges said they could not establish a causal linkage in law between the film and the holocaust . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was a favorite of nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels , who had funded it .
" the film is an overwhelming success , " he gloated in his diary in 1940 .
" the audience was seething .
this is the first really anti-semitic film . "
the movie , a remake of a story that had previously had a pro-jewish slant , depicts a jewish businessman , joseph süss , manipulating the government of a german ducal state , raping a german girl and being condemned .
unlike the nazi pseudo-documentary " der ewige jude " -lrb- the eternal jew -rrb- , which came out in the same year and which blatantly exploited racist stereotypes , " jud süss " was commissioned to get the nazi chauvinistic message across in the more subtle guise of a familiar hollywood-style historical drama . it will be shown at the baden-württemberg history museum in stuttgart , the city where the real joseph süss oppenheimer was executed on trumped-up charges in 1738 . nazi propaganda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition explores the visual language of nazi ideology paula lutum-lenger , the curator , said the museum exhibition , open till august 3 next year , explains the tricks used by the nazis to make the film audience hate jews . the one-hour movie was seen by 20 million people in nazi germany and paramilitary chief heinrich himmler made it compulsory for all police and ss members to see it . jewish concentration camp inmates say they received extra rough treatment on the day after nazi guards had been to screenings . the movie is banned from general screening in germany today and can only be shown with a commentary explaining its falsehoods .
at the exhibition , six scenes from the film run continuously as video . documenting the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goebbels described movies as weapons of " total war " the 600-square-meter show , which opened on friday , dec .
15 , includes film posters , the script , old cameras from babelsberg studios near berlin and facsimile documents about the real süss , who modern stuttgart people are curious to learn more about . the 16 full screenings will be preceded by lectures and followed by panel discussions . the real joseph süss oppenheimer -lrb- 1698-1738 -rrb- was chief financial adviser to the duke of württemberg .
his opponents used the vilest anti-semitic claims to execute him after his patron duke karl alexander died . his life was fictionalized in a german novella by wilhelm hauff in 1827 and a best-selling 1925 novel by lion feuchtwanger , but the plot was only rewritten into a hate script in the nazi film directed by veit harlan -lrb- 1899-1964 -rrb- . films were one of göbbels ' key instruments in manipulating public opinion : he described movies as a " weapon " of " total war . " the exhibition also details how harlan and the cast tried to wriggle out of blame after the war . harlan was tried in hamburg for crimes against humanity , but acquitted after judges said they could not establish a causal linkage in law between the film and the holocaust . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but it quoted a german government report which said that iran " keeps trying intensively to procure military goods and technology of all kinds from western industrial states . "
uranium exists naturally as an ore .
for it to be used as a source of nuclear energy or in atomic explosions , scientists need to separate out two of its isotopes , uranium-238 and uranium-235 , and boost the concentration of the latter , highly fissile , isotope .
this process is called enrichment .

the eu warning came despite a us national intelligence estimate -lrb- nie -rrb- report earlier this month claiming iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in late 2003 .
nie cited " moderate confidence " that the program had not been restarted as of mid-2007 .
tehran could have the technical ability to build a nuclear weapon between 2010 and 2015 , but " we do not know if it currently intends to develop nuclear weapons , " the report stated . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

14 . the measures allow one parent to take up a year of leave from work after the birth of a child while receiving two-thirds of their net pay from the state .
benefits are extended to a maximum of 14 months if both parents take at least two months leave . von der leyen said the policy , which caps benefits at 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,600 -rrb- per month , came at the same time the federal statistics office announced the first increase in recorded births in germany in a decade . numbers could increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most recipients have one child " i know this is just a beginning but i hope it will lead to a stable trend , " she said .

" she said incentives for men to take a few months of paternity leave had proven attractive to new fathers , with 9.6 percent taking advantage of the policy - more than experts had forecast . parents have to file for leave with their employers seven weeks ahead of their date of departure , leaving open the possibility that some parents intend to take part in the scheme but have not yet filed their petition to do so .

" fathers blew the budget for 2007 , " von der leyen said , adding that she was calling for the budget to increase to 4 billion euros .
" i think it 's the best thing that could have happened to our country .

it was a favorite of nazi propaganda minister joseph goebbels , who had funded it .
" the film is an overwhelming success , " he gloated in his diary in 1940 .
" the audience was seething .
this is the first really anti-semitic film . "
the movie , a remake of a story that had previously had a pro-jewish slant , depicts a jewish businessman , joseph süss , manipulating the government of a german ducal state , raping a german girl and being condemned .
unlike the nazi pseudo-documentary " der ewige jude " -lrb- the eternal jew -rrb- , which came out in the same year and which blatantly exploited racist stereotypes , " jud süss " was commissioned to get the nazi chauvinistic message across in the more subtle guise of a familiar hollywood-style historical drama . it will be shown at the baden-württemberg history museum in stuttgart , the city where the real joseph süss oppenheimer was executed on trumped-up charges in 1738 . nazi propaganda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the exhibition explores the visual language of nazi ideology paula lutum-lenger , the curator , said the museum exhibition , open till august 3 next year , explains the tricks used by the nazis to make the film audience hate jews . the one-hour movie was seen by 20 million people in nazi germany and paramilitary chief heinrich himmler made it compulsory for all police and ss members to see it . jewish concentration camp inmates say they received extra rough treatment on the day after nazi guards had been to screenings . the movie is banned from general screening in germany today and can only be shown with a commentary explaining its falsehoods .
at the exhibition , six scenes from the film run continuously as video . documenting the past bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : goebbels described movies as weapons of " total war " the 600-square-meter show , which opened on friday , dec .

his opponents used the vilest anti-semitic claims to execute him after his patron duke karl alexander died . his life was fictionalized in a german novella by wilhelm hauff in 1827 and a best-selling 1925 novel by lion feuchtwanger , but the plot was only rewritten into a hate script in the nazi film directed by veit harlan -lrb- 1899-1964 -rrb- . films were one of göbbels ' key instruments in manipulating public opinion : he described movies as a " weapon " of " total war . " the exhibition also details how harlan and the cast tried to wriggle out of blame after the war . harlan was tried in hamburg for crimes against humanity , but acquitted after judges said they could not establish a causal linkage in law between the film and the holocaust . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" much more was achieved than expected given the different interests at stake , " the minister said in bali where he represented germany at the talks .
at the same time , the result that came out of the tough negotiations was less than what germany and the european union had hoped for , he said .
gabriel said the important thing was that there was now a roadmap for a new climate treaty with " considerably stronger " commitments to climate protection from all industrial nations , including the united states .
the un conference was also a success inasmuch as it included developing nations in climate protection measures for the first time , he said .
the talks ended on saturday with an agreement on a " roadmap " for a two-year process of negotiations designed to set new targets for greenhouse gas emissions to replace those in the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
marathon talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will all the polar bear activits be happy with the outcome of the conference ?
the " roadmap " deal was reached following a dramatic final session of the marathon talks which saw the us delegation drop its objections to the final document .
head of the us delegation paula dobriansky said that 20 hours after the scheduled end of the conference , her country did not want to stand in the way of agreement .
environmentalist groups said that political leaders meeting in bali hammered out a deal which launches formal negotiations with a 2009 end date , but the deal falls short in its ambition .
" the bush administration has unscrupulously taken a monkey wrench to the level of action on climate change that the science demands , " said gerd leipold , executive director of greenpeace international .
" they 're relegated the science to a footnote . "
developing countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head of the us delegation , undersecretary of state paula dobriansky -lrb- right -rrb- before nailing down the agreement , developing countries including india and china had expressed concern that they might be forced to accept binding emissions reduction standards .
they are not required to accept emission reduction commitments under the kyoto protocol , and say that any such commitments would cramp economic growth and curb poverty reduction efforts .
the agreement was reached after indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono and un secretary-general ban ki-moon urged the delegates to reach a breakthrough .
ban said he was disappointed by the level of progress at the conference and urged delegates to quickly approve a compromise plan to launch negotiations for a new global warming pact .
" too much is at stake , " he had said . " the alternative to a breakthrough in our efforts here and now is not acceptable . "
the negotiations snagged early saturday over demands by developing nations that their need for technological help from rich nations and other issues receive greater recognition in the document .
joining consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 180 countries took part in the un climate conference the us delegation had initially rejected these demands , but relented after delegates criticised the us stand and urged a reconsideration .
" i think we have come a long way here , " said dobriansky .
" in this , the united states is very committed to this effort and just wants to really ensure we all act together .
we will go forward and join consensus . "
the decision agreed upon includes a clear agenda for the key issues to be negotiated up to 2009 ; action for adapting to the negative consequences of climate change - including droughts and floods - along with ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , to widely deploy climate-friendly technologies and to finance both adoption and mitigation measures .
concluding negotiations in 2009 will ensure that the new deal can enter into force by 2013 , following the expiry of the first phase of the kyoto protocol .
" this is a real breakthrough , a real opportunity for the international community to successfully fight climate change , " said indonesian environment minister and president of the conference , rachmat witoelar .

" much more was achieved than expected given the different interests at stake , " the minister said in bali where he represented germany at the talks .
at the same time , the result that came out of the tough negotiations was less than what germany and the european union had hoped for , he said .
gabriel said the important thing was that there was now a roadmap for a new climate treaty with " considerably stronger " commitments to climate protection from all industrial nations , including the united states .
the un conference was also a success inasmuch as it included developing nations in climate protection measures for the first time , he said .
the talks ended on saturday with an agreement on a " roadmap " for a two-year process of negotiations designed to set new targets for greenhouse gas emissions to replace those in the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
marathon talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will all the polar bear activits be happy with the outcome of the conference ?
the " roadmap " deal was reached following a dramatic final session of the marathon talks which saw the us delegation drop its objections to the final document .
head of the us delegation paula dobriansky said that 20 hours after the scheduled end of the conference , her country did not want to stand in the way of agreement .
environmentalist groups said that political leaders meeting in bali hammered out a deal which launches formal negotiations with a 2009 end date , but the deal falls short in its ambition .
" the bush administration has unscrupulously taken a monkey wrench to the level of action on climate change that the science demands , " said gerd leipold , executive director of greenpeace international .
" they 're relegated the science to a footnote . "
developing countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head of the us delegation , undersecretary of state paula dobriansky -lrb- right -rrb- before nailing down the agreement , developing countries including india and china had expressed concern that they might be forced to accept binding emissions reduction standards .
they are not required to accept emission reduction commitments under the kyoto protocol , and say that any such commitments would cramp economic growth and curb poverty reduction efforts .
the agreement was reached after indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono and un secretary-general ban ki-moon urged the delegates to reach a breakthrough .
ban said he was disappointed by the level of progress at the conference and urged delegates to quickly approve a compromise plan to launch negotiations for a new global warming pact .
" too much is at stake , " he had said . " the alternative to a breakthrough in our efforts here and now is not acceptable . "
the negotiations snagged early saturday over demands by developing nations that their need for technological help from rich nations and other issues receive greater recognition in the document .
joining consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 180 countries took part in the un climate conference the us delegation had initially rejected these demands , but relented after delegates criticised the us stand and urged a reconsideration .
" i think we have come a long way here , " said dobriansky .
" in this , the united states is very committed to this effort and just wants to really ensure we all act together .
we will go forward and join consensus . "
the decision agreed upon includes a clear agenda for the key issues to be negotiated up to 2009 ; action for adapting to the negative consequences of climate change - including droughts and floods - along with ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , to widely deploy climate-friendly technologies and to finance both adoption and mitigation measures .
concluding negotiations in 2009 will ensure that the new deal can enter into force by 2013 , following the expiry of the first phase of the kyoto protocol .
" this is a real breakthrough , a real opportunity for the international community to successfully fight climate change , " said indonesian environment minister and president of the conference , rachmat witoelar .
not nearly enough ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general ban ki-moon -lrb- left -rrb- made a plea to all the delagates to reach a compromise environmental activist , however , were less optimistic . the bali roadmap does not ensure that all developed countries will negotiate on binding reduction commitments , and leaves open the possibility for voluntarily actions by developed countries as well , said oxfam international . despite the scientific evidence , there is " no clear goal for global emissions cuts " in the bali roadmap or even a range of emissions targets for developed countries with a guideline for reduction of 25-40 per cent below 1990 by 2020 , the group said . during an emotional showdown in the final hours of the meeting , the us delegation , under intense of pressure , decided to join in the global talks .
the price of us participation , however , was a deal weak on substance , said the world wide for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- . " the us administration was asked to get out of the way , and in the end they bowed to pressure , " said hans verolme , director of wwf 's global climate change program . " the bali roadmap leaves a seat at the table for the next us president to make a real contribution to the global fight to stop dangerous climate change , " he said . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 . the report , which the german weekly der spiegel released in advance of its publication on monday , said the man was ordered to leave the country in july , but the case had not been disclosed until now .
the german foreign ministry declined to comment on the report .
the diplomat , an attaché at iran 's embassy in berlin , was reported to have been in contact with a specialist firm in the southern german state of bavaria .
" the consular attaché mohraramalai d. made contact with a bavarian firm of specialists , apparently trying to buy a piece of equipment which could also be used in uranium enrichment , " the magazine said . what kind of enrichment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran claims it wants to use its nuclear reactors for peaceful purposes the magazine did not say whether the component could have been used for high-grade enrichment , for bomb material , or low-grade enrichment , which iran says it carries out to make power plant fuel .
but it quoted a german government report which said that iran " keeps trying intensively to procure military goods and technology of all kinds from western industrial states . "
uranium exists naturally as an ore .
for it to be used as a source of nuclear energy or in atomic explosions , scientists need to separate out two of its isotopes , uranium-238 and uranium-235 , and boost the concentration of the latter , highly fissile , isotope .
this process is called enrichment .
western nations have been calling on iran to halt uranium enrichment , which they fear could lead to it making atomic weapons .
tehran , on the other hand , claims its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes .
renewed sanctions warning bildunterschrift : the un security council voted unanimously to expand sanctions against iran in march eu leaders reiterated on friday their support for possible additional sanctions against iran if it fails to give up nuclear enrichment work .
a joint statement from leaders of the 27-member block meeting in brussels called on iran to provide " full , clear and credible answers " to the u.n. international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to resolve questions about its nuclear activity .
they added that the council of member states " reiterates its full support to the work in the un security council to adopt further measures " and said a decision would be taken at the next meeting of eu foreign ministers due on jan .
28 , in the light of upcoming decisions in the un security council .
the eu warning came despite a us national intelligence estimate -lrb- nie -rrb- report earlier this month claiming iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in late 2003 .
nie cited " moderate confidence " that the program had not been restarted as of mid-2007 .
tehran could have the technical ability to build a nuclear weapon between 2010 and 2015 , but " we do not know if it currently intends to develop nuclear weapons , " the report stated . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de germany calls for continued pressure on iran the german government said wednesday that the international community needed to continue pressing iran to halt its uranium enrichment program as tehran remained in violation of international law .
-lrb- 05.12.2007 -rrb- european press review : iran report could impact elections some european papers saw the us iran report as a danger to israel , while others took it as hope for diplomacy .
in any case , world war three has been avoided - at least for now .

but the success comes with a price tag . between jan .
1 , when benefits for stay-at-home parents were increased , and the end of september , 394,000 people registered for the program , family affairs minister ursula von der leyen told reporters on friday , dec .
14 . the measures allow one parent to take up a year of leave from work after the birth of a child while receiving two-thirds of their net pay from the state .
benefits are extended to a maximum of 14 months if both parents take at least two months leave . von der leyen said the policy , which caps benefits at 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,600 -rrb- per month , came at the same time the federal statistics office announced the first increase in recorded births in germany in a decade . numbers could increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most recipients have one child " i know this is just a beginning but i hope it will lead to a stable trend , " she said .
" you see in these figures that younger people have begun to have some faith in the government but also in society and the business community that they can reliably plan a future with children . " she said incentives for men to take a few months of paternity leave had proven attractive to new fathers , with 9.6 percent taking advantage of the policy - more than experts had forecast . parents have to file for leave with their employers seven weeks ahead of their date of departure , leaving open the possibility that some parents intend to take part in the scheme but have not yet filed their petition to do so . " three-quarters of those fathers were working before the birth of their child , " she said , hailing the " great support " the business community had offered to men who take time off to care for their children . added funding next year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interest among fathers caused the progam to run overbudget , von der leyen said she said surveys showed that 34 percent of men who became fathers in 2007 said they were interested in taking parental leave .
half of the recipients are under 30 and 56 percent have one child . parents ' response to the measures meant that the program 's budget of 3.5 billion euros has been overdrawn by 130 million euros . " fathers blew the budget for 2007 , " von der leyen said , adding that she was calling for the budget to increase to 4 billion euros .
" i think it 's the best thing that could have happened to our country . " the family ministry said the new law exceeded its forecasted budget because men tend to earn more than their partners and it was more expensive for the state if they chose to stay at home with their children . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" much more was achieved than expected given the different interests at stake , " the minister said in bali where he represented germany at the talks .
at the same time , the result that came out of the tough negotiations was less than what germany and the european union had hoped for , he said .
gabriel said the important thing was that there was now a roadmap for a new climate treaty with " considerably stronger " commitments to climate protection from all industrial nations , including the united states .
the un conference was also a success inasmuch as it included developing nations in climate protection measures for the first time , he said .
the talks ended on saturday with an agreement on a " roadmap " for a two-year process of negotiations designed to set new targets for greenhouse gas emissions to replace those in the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
marathon talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will all the polar bear activits be happy with the outcome of the conference ?
the " roadmap " deal was reached following a dramatic final session of the marathon talks which saw the us delegation drop its objections to the final document .
head of the us delegation paula dobriansky said that 20 hours after the scheduled end of the conference , her country did not want to stand in the way of agreement .
environmentalist groups said that political leaders meeting in bali hammered out a deal which launches formal negotiations with a 2009 end date , but the deal falls short in its ambition .
" the bush administration has unscrupulously taken a monkey wrench to the level of action on climate change that the science demands , " said gerd leipold , executive director of greenpeace international .
" they 're relegated the science to a footnote . "
developing countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head of the us delegation , undersecretary of state paula dobriansky -lrb- right -rrb- before nailing down the agreement , developing countries including india and china had expressed concern that they might be forced to accept binding emissions reduction standards .
they are not required to accept emission reduction commitments under the kyoto protocol , and say that any such commitments would cramp economic growth and curb poverty reduction efforts .
the agreement was reached after indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono and un secretary-general ban ki-moon urged the delegates to reach a breakthrough .
ban said he was disappointed by the level of progress at the conference and urged delegates to quickly approve a compromise plan to launch negotiations for a new global warming pact .
" too much is at stake , " he had said . " the alternative to a breakthrough in our efforts here and now is not acceptable . "
the negotiations snagged early saturday over demands by developing nations that their need for technological help from rich nations and other issues receive greater recognition in the document .
joining consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 180 countries took part in the un climate conference the us delegation had initially rejected these demands , but relented after delegates criticised the us stand and urged a reconsideration .
" i think we have come a long way here , " said dobriansky .
" in this , the united states is very committed to this effort and just wants to really ensure we all act together .
we will go forward and join consensus . "
the decision agreed upon includes a clear agenda for the key issues to be negotiated up to 2009 ; action for adapting to the negative consequences of climate change - including droughts and floods - along with ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , to widely deploy climate-friendly technologies and to finance both adoption and mitigation measures .
concluding negotiations in 2009 will ensure that the new deal can enter into force by 2013 , following the expiry of the first phase of the kyoto protocol .
" this is a real breakthrough , a real opportunity for the international community to successfully fight climate change , " said indonesian environment minister and president of the conference , rachmat witoelar .
not nearly enough ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general ban ki-moon -lrb- left -rrb- made a plea to all the delagates to reach a compromise environmental activist , however , were less optimistic . the bali roadmap does not ensure that all developed countries will negotiate on binding reduction commitments , and leaves open the possibility for voluntarily actions by developed countries as well , said oxfam international . despite the scientific evidence , there is " no clear goal for global emissions cuts " in the bali roadmap or even a range of emissions targets for developed countries with a guideline for reduction of 25-40 per cent below 1990 by 2020 , the group said . during an emotional showdown in the final hours of the meeting , the us delegation , under intense of pressure , decided to join in the global talks .
the price of us participation , however , was a deal weak on substance , said the world wide for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- . " the us administration was asked to get out of the way , and in the end they bowed to pressure , " said hans verolme , director of wwf 's global climate change program . " the bali roadmap leaves a seat at the table for the next us president to make a real contribution to the global fight to stop dangerous climate change , " he said . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 . the report , which the german weekly der spiegel released in advance of its publication on monday , said the man was ordered to leave the country in july , but the case had not been disclosed until now .
the german foreign ministry declined to comment on the report .
the diplomat , an attaché at iran 's embassy in berlin , was reported to have been in contact with a specialist firm in the southern german state of bavaria .
" the consular attaché mohraramalai d. made contact with a bavarian firm of specialists , apparently trying to buy a piece of equipment which could also be used in uranium enrichment , " the magazine said . what kind of enrichment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran claims it wants to use its nuclear reactors for peaceful purposes the magazine did not say whether the component could have been used for high-grade enrichment , for bomb material , or low-grade enrichment , which iran says it carries out to make power plant fuel .
but it quoted a german government report which said that iran " keeps trying intensively to procure military goods and technology of all kinds from western industrial states . "
uranium exists naturally as an ore .
for it to be used as a source of nuclear energy or in atomic explosions , scientists need to separate out two of its isotopes , uranium-238 and uranium-235 , and boost the concentration of the latter , highly fissile , isotope .
this process is called enrichment .
western nations have been calling on iran to halt uranium enrichment , which they fear could lead to it making atomic weapons .

15 . the report , which the german weekly der spiegel released in advance of its publication on monday , said the man was ordered to leave the country in july , but the case had not been disclosed until now .
the german foreign ministry declined to comment on the report .
the diplomat , an attaché at iran 's embassy in berlin , was reported to have been in contact with a specialist firm in the southern german state of bavaria .
" the consular attaché mohraramalai d. made contact with a bavarian firm of specialists , apparently trying to buy a piece of equipment which could also be used in uranium enrichment , " the magazine said . what kind of enrichment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran claims it wants to use its nuclear reactors for peaceful purposes the magazine did not say whether the component could have been used for high-grade enrichment , for bomb material , or low-grade enrichment , which iran says it carries out to make power plant fuel .
but it quoted a german government report which said that iran " keeps trying intensively to procure military goods and technology of all kinds from western industrial states . "
uranium exists naturally as an ore .
for it to be used as a source of nuclear energy or in atomic explosions , scientists need to separate out two of its isotopes , uranium-238 and uranium-235 , and boost the concentration of the latter , highly fissile , isotope .
this process is called enrichment .
western nations have been calling on iran to halt uranium enrichment , which they fear could lead to it making atomic weapons .

14 . the measures allow one parent to take up a year of leave from work after the birth of a child while receiving two-thirds of their net pay from the state .
benefits are extended to a maximum of 14 months if both parents take at least two months leave . von der leyen said the policy , which caps benefits at 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,600 -rrb- per month , came at the same time the federal statistics office announced the first increase in recorded births in germany in a decade . numbers could increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most recipients have one child " i know this is just a beginning but i hope it will lead to a stable trend , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 15.12.2007 germany hails bali outcome as better than expected großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the conference outcome is an important step forward , according to sigmar gabriel german environment minister sigmar gabriel welcomed the outcome of the un climate change conference on saturday after a grueling all-night finish in which the negotiating countries ironed out a last-minute compromise . " much more was achieved than expected given the different interests at stake , " the minister said in bali where he represented germany at the talks .
at the same time , the result that came out of the tough negotiations was less than what germany and the european union had hoped for , he said .
gabriel said the important thing was that there was now a roadmap for a new climate treaty with " considerably stronger " commitments to climate protection from all industrial nations , including the united states .
the un conference was also a success inasmuch as it included developing nations in climate protection measures for the first time , he said .
the talks ended on saturday with an agreement on a " roadmap " for a two-year process of negotiations designed to set new targets for greenhouse gas emissions to replace those in the kyoto protocol , which expires in 2012 .
marathon talks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will all the polar bear activits be happy with the outcome of the conference ?
the " roadmap " deal was reached following a dramatic final session of the marathon talks which saw the us delegation drop its objections to the final document .
head of the us delegation paula dobriansky said that 20 hours after the scheduled end of the conference , her country did not want to stand in the way of agreement .
environmentalist groups said that political leaders meeting in bali hammered out a deal which launches formal negotiations with a 2009 end date , but the deal falls short in its ambition .
" the bush administration has unscrupulously taken a monkey wrench to the level of action on climate change that the science demands , " said gerd leipold , executive director of greenpeace international .
" they 're relegated the science to a footnote . "
developing countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head of the us delegation , undersecretary of state paula dobriansky -lrb- right -rrb- before nailing down the agreement , developing countries including india and china had expressed concern that they might be forced to accept binding emissions reduction standards .
they are not required to accept emission reduction commitments under the kyoto protocol , and say that any such commitments would cramp economic growth and curb poverty reduction efforts .
the agreement was reached after indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono and un secretary-general ban ki-moon urged the delegates to reach a breakthrough .
ban said he was disappointed by the level of progress at the conference and urged delegates to quickly approve a compromise plan to launch negotiations for a new global warming pact .
" too much is at stake , " he had said . " the alternative to a breakthrough in our efforts here and now is not acceptable . "
the negotiations snagged early saturday over demands by developing nations that their need for technological help from rich nations and other issues receive greater recognition in the document .
joining consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 180 countries took part in the un climate conference the us delegation had initially rejected these demands , but relented after delegates criticised the us stand and urged a reconsideration .
" i think we have come a long way here , " said dobriansky .
" in this , the united states is very committed to this effort and just wants to really ensure we all act together .
we will go forward and join consensus . "
the decision agreed upon includes a clear agenda for the key issues to be negotiated up to 2009 ; action for adapting to the negative consequences of climate change - including droughts and floods - along with ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , to widely deploy climate-friendly technologies and to finance both adoption and mitigation measures .
concluding negotiations in 2009 will ensure that the new deal can enter into force by 2013 , following the expiry of the first phase of the kyoto protocol .
" this is a real breakthrough , a real opportunity for the international community to successfully fight climate change , " said indonesian environment minister and president of the conference , rachmat witoelar .
not nearly enough ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general ban ki-moon -lrb- left -rrb- made a plea to all the delagates to reach a compromise environmental activist , however , were less optimistic . the bali roadmap does not ensure that all developed countries will negotiate on binding reduction commitments , and leaves open the possibility for voluntarily actions by developed countries as well , said oxfam international . despite the scientific evidence , there is " no clear goal for global emissions cuts " in the bali roadmap or even a range of emissions targets for developed countries with a guideline for reduction of 25-40 per cent below 1990 by 2020 , the group said . during an emotional showdown in the final hours of the meeting , the us delegation , under intense of pressure , decided to join in the global talks .
the price of us participation , however , was a deal weak on substance , said the world wide for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- . " the us administration was asked to get out of the way , and in the end they bowed to pressure , " said hans verolme , director of wwf 's global climate change program . " the bali roadmap leaves a seat at the table for the next us president to make a real contribution to the global fight to stop dangerous climate change , " he said . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 . the report , which the german weekly der spiegel released in advance of its publication on monday , said the man was ordered to leave the country in july , but the case had not been disclosed until now .
the german foreign ministry declined to comment on the report .
the diplomat , an attaché at iran 's embassy in berlin , was reported to have been in contact with a specialist firm in the southern german state of bavaria .
" the consular attaché mohraramalai d. made contact with a bavarian firm of specialists , apparently trying to buy a piece of equipment which could also be used in uranium enrichment , " the magazine said . what kind of enrichment ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran claims it wants to use its nuclear reactors for peaceful purposes the magazine did not say whether the component could have been used for high-grade enrichment , for bomb material , or low-grade enrichment , which iran says it carries out to make power plant fuel .
but it quoted a german government report which said that iran " keeps trying intensively to procure military goods and technology of all kinds from western industrial states . "
uranium exists naturally as an ore .
for it to be used as a source of nuclear energy or in atomic explosions , scientists need to separate out two of its isotopes , uranium-238 and uranium-235 , and boost the concentration of the latter , highly fissile , isotope .
this process is called enrichment .
western nations have been calling on iran to halt uranium enrichment , which they fear could lead to it making atomic weapons .
tehran , on the other hand , claims its nuclear program is for peaceful purposes .
renewed sanctions warning bildunterschrift : the un security council voted unanimously to expand sanctions against iran in march eu leaders reiterated on friday their support for possible additional sanctions against iran if it fails to give up nuclear enrichment work .
a joint statement from leaders of the 27-member block meeting in brussels called on iran to provide " full , clear and credible answers " to the u.n. international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- to resolve questions about its nuclear activity .
they added that the council of member states " reiterates its full support to the work in the un security council to adopt further measures " and said a decision would be taken at the next meeting of eu foreign ministers due on jan .
28 , in the light of upcoming decisions in the un security council .
the eu warning came despite a us national intelligence estimate -lrb- nie -rrb- report earlier this month claiming iran had halted its nuclear weapons program in late 2003 .
nie cited " moderate confidence " that the program had not been restarted as of mid-2007 .
tehran could have the technical ability to build a nuclear weapon between 2010 and 2015 , but " we do not know if it currently intends to develop nuclear weapons , " the report stated . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the bush administration has unscrupulously taken a monkey wrench to the level of action on climate change that the science demands , " said gerd leipold , executive director of greenpeace international .
" they 're relegated the science to a footnote . "
developing countries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : head of the us delegation , undersecretary of state paula dobriansky -lrb- right -rrb- before nailing down the agreement , developing countries including india and china had expressed concern that they might be forced to accept binding emissions reduction standards .
they are not required to accept emission reduction commitments under the kyoto protocol , and say that any such commitments would cramp economic growth and curb poverty reduction efforts .
the agreement was reached after indonesian president susilo bambang yudhoyono and un secretary-general ban ki-moon urged the delegates to reach a breakthrough .
ban said he was disappointed by the level of progress at the conference and urged delegates to quickly approve a compromise plan to launch negotiations for a new global warming pact .
" too much is at stake , " he had said . " the alternative to a breakthrough in our efforts here and now is not acceptable . "
the negotiations snagged early saturday over demands by developing nations that their need for technological help from rich nations and other issues receive greater recognition in the document .
joining consensus bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 180 countries took part in the un climate conference the us delegation had initially rejected these demands , but relented after delegates criticised the us stand and urged a reconsideration .
" i think we have come a long way here , " said dobriansky .
" in this , the united states is very committed to this effort and just wants to really ensure we all act together .
we will go forward and join consensus . "
the decision agreed upon includes a clear agenda for the key issues to be negotiated up to 2009 ; action for adapting to the negative consequences of climate change - including droughts and floods - along with ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions , to widely deploy climate-friendly technologies and to finance both adoption and mitigation measures .
concluding negotiations in 2009 will ensure that the new deal can enter into force by 2013 , following the expiry of the first phase of the kyoto protocol .
" this is a real breakthrough , a real opportunity for the international community to successfully fight climate change , " said indonesian environment minister and president of the conference , rachmat witoelar .
not nearly enough ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un secretary general ban ki-moon -lrb- left -rrb- made a plea to all the delagates to reach a compromise environmental activist , however , were less optimistic . the bali roadmap does not ensure that all developed countries will negotiate on binding reduction commitments , and leaves open the possibility for voluntarily actions by developed countries as well , said oxfam international . despite the scientific evidence , there is " no clear goal for global emissions cuts " in the bali roadmap or even a range of emissions targets for developed countries with a guideline for reduction of 25-40 per cent below 1990 by 2020 , the group said . during an emotional showdown in the final hours of the meeting , the us delegation , under intense of pressure , decided to join in the global talks .
the price of us participation , however , was a deal weak on substance , said the world wide for nature -lrb- wwf -rrb- . " the us administration was asked to get out of the way , and in the end they bowed to pressure , " said hans verolme , director of wwf 's global climate change program . " the bali roadmap leaves a seat at the table for the next us president to make a real contribution to the global fight to stop dangerous climate change , " he said . dpa news agency send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the success comes with a price tag . between jan .
1 , when benefits for stay-at-home parents were increased , and the end of september , 394,000 people registered for the program , family affairs minister ursula von der leyen told reporters on friday , dec .
14 . the measures allow one parent to take up a year of leave from work after the birth of a child while receiving two-thirds of their net pay from the state .
benefits are extended to a maximum of 14 months if both parents take at least two months leave . von der leyen said the policy , which caps benefits at 1,800 euros -lrb- $ 2,600 -rrb- per month , came at the same time the federal statistics office announced the first increase in recorded births in germany in a decade . numbers could increase bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most recipients have one child " i know this is just a beginning but i hope it will lead to a stable trend , " she said .
" you see in these figures that younger people have begun to have some faith in the government but also in society and the business community that they can reliably plan a future with children . " she said incentives for men to take a few months of paternity leave had proven attractive to new fathers , with 9.6 percent taking advantage of the policy - more than experts had forecast . parents have to file for leave with their employers seven weeks ahead of their date of departure , leaving open the possibility that some parents intend to take part in the scheme but have not yet filed their petition to do so . " three-quarters of those fathers were working before the birth of their child , " she said , hailing the " great support " the business community had offered to men who take time off to care for their children . added funding next year bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interest among fathers caused the progam to run overbudget , von der leyen said she said surveys showed that 34 percent of men who became fathers in 2007 said they were interested in taking parental leave .
half of the recipients are under 30 and 56 percent have one child . parents ' response to the measures meant that the program 's budget of 3.5 billion euros has been overdrawn by 130 million euros . " fathers blew the budget for 2007 , " von der leyen said , adding that she was calling for the budget to increase to 4 billion euros .
" i think it 's the best thing that could have happened to our country . " the family ministry said the new law exceeded its forecasted budget because men tend to earn more than their partners and it was more expensive for the state if they chose to stay at home with their children . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the search giant has already started inviting people to write about the subject on which they are known to be an expert .
google said it would not act as editor for the project but will provide the tools and infrastructure for the pages .
many experts see the initiative as an attack on the widely used wikipedia communal encyclopaedia .
' knol ' writing about the project on the official google blog , udi manber , one of the heads of engineering at the search firm , said it was all about sharing useful knowledge .

however , wrote mr manber , not all the information on the web was " well organised to make it easily discoverable " .
by getting respected authors to write about their specialism google hopes to start putting some of that information in better order .
the system will centre around authored articles created with a tool google has dubbed " knol " - the word denotes a unit of knowledge - that will make webpages with a distinctive livery to identify them as authoritative .
mr manber wrote : " a knol on a particular topic is meant to be the first thing someone who searches for this topic for the first time will want to read . "

cardiff university is offering a chance to study james bond , the british spy whose career in both books and film has spanned more than 50 years .
the 10-week course , james bond in context , will include a look at ian fleming 's creation in terms of his historical and social significance .
tutor hywel dix said there was renewed interest in 007 after the success of last year 's casino royale .
bond first appeared in fleming 's novel casino royale in 1952 , and became a literary phenomenon , which translated to the cinema with sean connery as the hero in dr no in 1962 .
that first novel gave its name to the latest film in 2006 , which became a huge hit at the box office with daniel craig in the lead role .
dr dix 's course will start in january at the university 's centre for lifelong learning , and he said 007 had secured his cultural significance .
" it 's been brought back into the public eye , it 's resurgent and popular " .
bond through the years 1962-71 - sean connery 1969 - george lazenby 1973-85 - roger moore 1987-89 - timothy dalton 1995-2002 - pierce brosnan 2006 - - daniel craig -lrb- above -rrb- in pictures : the actors who played bond for the first two weeks of the course , dr dix intends to look at the literary context of the bond novels between 1953 and 1954 .
he will also include other works published around the same time , including lord of the rings by jrr tolkien and lucky jim by kingsley amis .
dr dix said the novels were part of an " historic phenomena " and reflected the political situations of the time , including the cold war and its aftermath .
" it also highlights the representations of women and their role , " dr dix added .
the course will also look at the films which have been translated into many languages .
fleming 's death in 1964 did not prevent new bond novels appearing and subsequent novels were written by kingsley amis , as well as robert markham , john pearson , john gardner and raymond benson .
in addition , fast show star charlie higson has written a series of books on the young bond , with the approval of the fleming estate .
in july , it was announced that author sebastian faulks had been commissioned to write a bond novel for publication in 2008 .
and of all the bonds , who is dr dix 's favourite ?
like many people , it is sean connery .
he said : " he was the wittiest " .

tutor hywel dix said there was renewed interest in 007 after the success of last year 's casino royale .
bond first appeared in fleming 's novel casino royale in 1952 , and became a literary phenomenon , which translated to the cinema with sean connery as the hero in dr no in 1962 .
that first novel gave its name to the latest film in 2006 , which became a huge hit at the box office with daniel craig in the lead role .
dr dix 's course will start in january at the university 's centre for lifelong learning , and he said 007 had secured his cultural significance .
" it 's been brought back into the public eye , it 's resurgent and popular " .
bond through the years 1962-71 - sean connery 1969 - george lazenby 1973-85 - roger moore 1987-89 - timothy dalton 1995-2002 - pierce brosnan 2006 - - daniel craig -lrb- above -rrb- in pictures : the actors who played bond for the first two weeks of the course , dr dix intends to look at the literary context of the bond novels between 1953 and 1954 .
he will also include other works published around the same time , including lord of the rings by jrr tolkien and lucky jim by kingsley amis .
dr dix said the novels were part of an " historic phenomena " and reflected the political situations of the time , including the cold war and its aftermath .
" it also highlights the representations of women and their role , " dr dix added .
the course will also look at the films which have been translated into many languages .
fleming 's death in 1964 did not prevent new bond novels appearing and subsequent novels were written by kingsley amis , as well as robert markham , john pearson , john gardner and raymond benson .
in addition , fast show star charlie higson has written a series of books on the young bond , with the approval of the fleming estate .
in july , it was announced that author sebastian faulks had been commissioned to write a bond novel for publication in 2008 .
and of all the bonds , who is dr dix 's favourite ?
like many people , it is sean connery .
he said : " he was the wittiest " .

some banks are repeatedly telephoning customers to try to get them to take out costly loans , against the advice of debt charities .
citizens advice said it had received many complaints about the increasingly aggressive tactics being used .
banks say interest rate charges are up to them .
continually telephoned people find that even after they have been dealing with us they have found that they have been continued to be written to .
they get aggressive letters and phone calls from their lenders .
peter tutton , citizens advice the bbc 's breakfast programme has discovered some customers who have an agreed debt repayment plan with a debt advice charity are being put under pressure to take out loans , sometimes at a higher interest rate than they are already paying .
one hsbc customer , simon chandler , said that even though he had declined the bank 's offer of a " managed loan " , they had continually telephoned him to try and make him change his mind .
the interest rate on the managed loan is 13 % - double what he is paying at the moment .
simon chandler says he is being pressured by his bank he said : " i have had multiple letters from hsbc saying they want to help people in financial difficulty - when clearly they do n't .
" hsbc have agreed that the amount i can repay each month is acceptable .
but the only way they will accept that repayment is if i enter in what they call a managed loan . "
in a statement hsbc said : " as a responsible lender hsbc only offers a managed loan to customers when all other lending options have been exhausted .
mr chandler 's loan is flexible and affordable .
" now back in full time employment he can make additional monthly payments when possible and his interest rate can be revised after a period of good repayment - typically just one year . "
what is a managed loan ?
only offered to customers in financial difficulty interest rate will be higher than for " good risk " customers but the rate is lower than for " bad risk " customers offered over a longer term compared to normal loans interest rate can come down after a year citizens advice -lrb- cab -rrb- said it was aware of many cases in which people in debt have offered to make payments where the bank has asked for more than they can afford .
in some cases , customers had asked their bank to deal with a debt advice charity , yet they were still being sent aggressive letters and receiving pushy phone calls .
aggressive letters peter tutton from cab said : " we see a lot of cases of people coming in who have tried to talk to their banks about arranged payments and they have n't been listened to , and they have been asked for more than they can afford .
" typically people find that , even after they have been dealing with us , they have found that they have been continued to be written to .
they get aggressive letters and phone calls from their lenders . "
the banks ' organisation , the british bankers ' association -lrb- bba -rrb- , said banks were happy to work with debt advice charities .
however , it said they have to make their own judgement about the interest rate they charge and how much someone can afford .
eric leenders from the bba said : " the work that banks do with intermediaries like money advice trusts are essentially negotiations - they are not necessarily conclusive . "

doctors are operating on mandy peynado , 47 , in an effort to save the rest of her limb which was savaged by the dog at knightwood kennels , near salisbury .
her arms were bitten as she tried to protect her throat when the animal turned on her .
ms peynado , who had worked at the kennels for three years , was airlifted to salisbury district hospital .
she is said to be in a satisfactory condition .
kennel owner judith wykeham had not known the abandoned dog , which was later destroyed by wiltshire police , had a troubled history .
to defend her throat , because that 's all she was worried about , she put her hands up and that 's why she 's lost one of her arms victim 's sister describing what happened , ms peynado 's sister , claire gourley , said : " she went into the kennels , the dog wanted to play and grabbed hold of her coat .

ms wykeham said the dog would have been treated differently if she had known its background .

so it would be a churlish delegate indeed who professed disappointment as he or she staggered a bleary route from the conference hall to the taxi rank , ready for some home comforts after a marathon two-week session .
this has been a harsh round of un climate talks .
previous rounds have seen governments accept commitments they were never going to be able to meet - witness the us signing of the kyoto protocol a decade ago in the teeth of congressional opposition - and all were aware of the domestic political consequences of getting this one wrong .
for europe , already committed to unilateral emissions cuts of 20 % by 2020 and prepared to go further if others joined in , the grail was to leave bali with the us , japan , russia and the rest of the industrial world signed up to big cuts .
if no-one leaves bali with everything they wanted , it is also true that no-one leaves without some kind of present at a glance : bali deal the us and canada , on ideological grounds , and japan because it is already struggling to meet its kyoto protocol targets , were determined to avoid anything firm now .
for varying reasons , most industrialised nations wanted the major emitters of the developing world - china , india , brazil , south korea - to accept the principle that at some point , they would have to come on board with numerically-defined emissions curbs , too .
fearing economic consequences , and citing the un convention 's declaration that nations had " common but differentiated responsibilities " for climate change , those major emitters were determined not to give too much ground .
meanwhile others - drought-ridden african countries , and those likely to be erased from the geographical and political maps by rising sea levels - wanted the rich west , which has built its wealth largely on the back of coal and oil , to pay for the effects of the pollution they have caused and from which they have benefited .
the indonesian hosts partly gained what they wanted on forests in retrospect , does it seem absurdly ambitious that negotiators tried to cram all of these demands into a single document , the " bali roadmap " ?
perhaps .
and there will be voices now , as there always are , condemning the un process for being bulky , ponderous , unwieldy , bureaucratic , and bound by the lowest-common-denominator-generating demon of consensus .
but if no-one leaves bali with everything they wanted , it is also true that no-one leaves without some kind of present for their political masters back home .
trimmed ambitions europe has not got what it wanted .
but it does have a document committing states to the principle of further emissions cuts , and to concluding negotiations on those cuts by 2009 .
the date is important , because if concrete targets are established going further and deeper than those in the kyoto protocol , governments and businesses will need time to adjust to them before the current protocol targets expire in 2012 .
however , the eu must concede - and some european delegates did concede - that they have got far less than they demanded .
the bush administration is not for turning .
al gore was the most savage critic of the bush administration environmental groups accuse the white house of blockage and betrayal and obstruction .
but it is difficult to accuse it of inconsistency .
in bali it deployed positions and tactics which were totally in keeping with previous years .
and there is a case for saying that europe played a poor hand here , demanding something it was never going to get .
its counter-arguments are that it proposed targets based on the latest scientific findings from the intergovernmental panel on climate change -lrb- ipcc -rrb- , which the us , canada , japan and so on have all endorsed ; and that it needs to confront opposition in those other nations , not just in the us .
given japan 's enthusiasm for the kyoto accord , its stance here must have hurt .
at home , the us administration has been keen to promulgate the politically convenient view that climate change is now really china 's fault ; hence the desire to wring some kind of commitment from the chinese .
the us talked tough , but in the end got less than it wanted .
however , as its demands fell well short of binding numerical targets for china , the white house spinmeisters should be able to garnish its last-minute volte-face with glitter .
developing countries gained less access to clean technology than they asked for .
but there are various multilateral and bilateral deals outside the un climate framework that may be more relevant in this area anyway .
and protecting the poorest nations ?
like the emissions goals , money for adaptation is largely theoretical at this stage .
bali 's beaches provided a luxurious environment for the talks the bali roadmap envisages expanding the kyoto mechanisms designed to leverage money from international carbon trading to pay for sea walls , fresh water infrastructure , new crop varieties , mosquito nets and whatever else may be needed as the world warms and rainfall patterns change .
