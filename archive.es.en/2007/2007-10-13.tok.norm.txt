in 2006 , european r & d investments grew by 7.4 percent , the highest rate in the last five years , but still below the 11.1 percent growth seen in other major economies , including the us and japan , the study said . " the positive upward trend seen in the last two years is encouraging , and leads me to believe our innovation strategy is back on the right track , but we must not allow ourselves to be complacent , " said european science and research commissioner janez potocnik . private influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pharmaceutical companies had the largest r & d spending growth last year germany 's daimlerchrysler , which changed its name to daimler ag after the study was conducted , was europe 's highest scorer with 5.2 billion euros .
britain 's glaxosmithkline ranked no. 7 , and german engineering giant siemens ag was at no. 8 . pfizer , the world 's largest drugmaker , was the world 's biggest spender with 5.8 billion euros of its budget devoted to r & d in 2006 . about 55 percent of eu investment in r & d comes from private sources .
the comparable figure is 63 percent in the us ; in japan 75 percent of r & d spending comes from businesses . " we are only ever going to improve our r & d performance if more companies see the benefit of investing in research , " potocnik said . some positives for eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu automakers were among the biggest r & d spenders in their sector european commission officials stressed the positive elements of the survey , pointing out that the rate of growth had increased , that the eu leads the world in fixed capital investment , and that three eu companies were among the top 10 private investors in r & d worldwide . slower european growth in r & d-intensive fields , such as pharmaceuticals and computing , has led to less development spending in the 27-member eu , the report said . eu companies involved in more traditional industries , such as car manufacturing , hold up well against their global rivals with five eu-based carmakers in the list of top-50 r & d investors compared with six from non-eu members . but in the pharmaceuticals sector , nine non-eu companies - two of them in switzerland - compete with only three eu companies in the top 50 . while there were 13 hi-tech companies based outside the eu in the top 50 , including microsoft , samsung , intel , sony and ibm , only five eu companies made the list : siemens , nokia , ericsson , alcatel-lucent and philips , the report said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel will meet with russian president putin on sunday in germany . in chancellor angela merkel 's weekly podcast , she said that germany and russia had a " strategic partnership , " and that despite many differences of opinion , the two countries also shared several common positions on topics .
merkel and russian president vladimir putin are scheduled to meet sunday on the sidelines of the petersburg dialogue in the western city of wiesbaden .
the conference began on saturday , oct .
13 and runs through monday .
" i have already had many open , honest and very intensive conversations with president putin and i am pleased that we will be able to do this again , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has not been afraid to engage in tough talk with the russian president she said their discussions on sunday evening would primarily focus on bilateral issues and the relationship between the two countries , but she added that the two would also talk about the situation in iran and the future of kosovo , along with us plans for a missile defense system based in eastern europe , which moscow opposes .
on monday , she and putin will participate in a forum on the closing day of the event , where representatives from the civil societies of both countries will gather .
merkel said such a meeting highlighted the importance of the petersberg dialogue , since " only through exchanges among all groups in our societies can we create strong relationships with one another . "
former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev will take part in the dialogue in his capacity as co-chairman of the forum .
the petersburg dialogue is an regular russian-german conference that set up by putin and previous chancellor gerhard schröder in 2001 to bring the russian and german societies closer together .

this " pseudo-legal putsch , " according to beck , might satisfy strict legal requirements of the constitution , which says a head of state can not run for office for a third term .
but putin 's plan to bend russian law to his will , without breaking it , amounts to a " violence-free coup against the constitution . "
there are concerns that putin might use his party 's likely constitutional majority of 300 seats in the duma to push forward constitutional changes that would reshape russia ’ s political system as a parliamentary-presidential republic .
then the center of power would shift from the presidency to the prime minister ’ s office .

" we are talking here about buildings with a dome and a minaret , which are clearly recognizable from the outside , and not the 2,600 prayer areas housed in various buildings throughout the country , " abdullah added . of some 1,200 institutions used as mosques in germany , only 159 are recognizable mosques , serving a community that numbers over 3 million .
the remaining are so-called " backyard mosques , " meaning they are in rooms in buildings that have other purposes or would not obviously appear to be mosques to unaware passers-by .

but the losers in this development , at least financially , appear to be the writers . at the frankfurt book fair this week there are books galore by authors no one has ever heard of .
for every millionaire celebrity author , such as jk rowling sitting pretty on a fortune from her seven harry potter novels , there are hundreds of thousands of writers earning just pennies , having to make their living from taxi-driving or teaching .
a us webzine , 10 zen monkeys , did an unscientific survey last week of professional writers - the term was defined to include both book and magazine authors - and found many saying that they were receiving fewer commissions and less income than a decade ago .
the villain , many say , is the internet .
a surfeit of good stuff the web is being criticized for giving a voice to so many millions of people that good writing is no longer scarce .
it 's everywhere .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are more distractions than ever before thanks to the internet one of the surveyed writers , john shirley , observed , " people spend a great deal of time and energy online , time and energy which is then not available for that armchair book . "
the fear among writers is that , according to the old laws of supply and demand , writing is worth less today .
" generation download thinks information wants to be free ... even if some ink-stained wretch wept tears of blood to create it , " wrote mark dery , another contributor .
copyright concerns ?
what 's more , the masses who are blogging or uploading poetry seem unconcerned about that talisman of the traditional writer , copyright .
they 're publishing their essays , diaries , poetry and fiction online with no practical protection against plagiarists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how can one put income in writers ' pockets in the digital age ?
it 's a situation that appals alexander unverzagt , a hamburg , germany copyright lawyer in a panel discussion at the book fair .
he recalled being approached a few weeks ago by an academic who had hosted a blog that attracted a lot of profound comment .
the academic wanted to take 150 of the most superb comments and edit them into a book .
could he do so , without negotiating individual rights contracts with all 150 authors ?
no way , said unverzagt .
every contributor had implicitly granted a licence to use his text for the blog only , but not for another medium such as a book .
" the internet is not a lawless zone , " he said .
the key purpose of the annual , five-day frankfurt book fair is buying and selling the rights to writing , country by country and in all the myriad publication forms , whether as books , film or online .
discussion is growing about whether that is a sensible way to put income in writers ' pockets .
open access a panelist , catharina maracke , also a lawyer , said the hamburg academic should have asked his contributors to sign over some rights from the beginning with a " creative commons " license .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some argue copying from authors in the digital age should be less frowned upon the world creative commons movement - maracke heads its berlin office - is an offshoot of the open-access movement which argues that the legal phobia against copying is a brake on scholarship , science and debate .
obtaining 150 licenses would take more effort than it is worth to publish just one book .
if all the authors had legally gifted their comments to humanity , their thoughts could be reproduced in a book and would win wider influence .
top publishers at the fair agree that worldwide sales of printed books remain strong .
peter olson , chief executive of the world 's biggest book publisher , new york-based random house , says there is a digital future but it is not a threat .
sweat-shop labor ?
the concern among authors is that they are becoming low-pay workers in a flourishing industry .
many , such as poets and academics , receive only neglible royalties and mainly publish for the sake of glory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some poets make money off of appearances , not off their books monika rinck , a german poet , says she publishes her poetry on blogs and on the internet and does not expect the publication itself to bring her any income .
instead , she can charge appearance fees for reading the poetry , thanks to her growing reputation .
" i do n't earn income from a book , but rather from my readers , " she explained during the panel discussion .
writers justify free blogs as a way to build a fan community , establish a public personality and explain their thought processes .
open-source or traditional , writers like rinck agree that editors are still essential to select the best writing of the age .
" we 're drowning in yak , and it 's getting harder and harder to hear the insightful voices , " dery said .

but the losers in this development , at least financially , appear to be the writers . at the frankfurt book fair this week there are books galore by authors no one has ever heard of .
for every millionaire celebrity author , such as jk rowling sitting pretty on a fortune from her seven harry potter novels , there are hundreds of thousands of writers earning just pennies , having to make their living from taxi-driving or teaching .
a us webzine , 10 zen monkeys , did an unscientific survey last week of professional writers - the term was defined to include both book and magazine authors - and found many saying that they were receiving fewer commissions and less income than a decade ago .
the villain , many say , is the internet .
a surfeit of good stuff the web is being criticized for giving a voice to so many millions of people that good writing is no longer scarce .
it 's everywhere .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are more distractions than ever before thanks to the internet one of the surveyed writers , john shirley , observed , " people spend a great deal of time and energy online , time and energy which is then not available for that armchair book . "
the fear among writers is that , according to the old laws of supply and demand , writing is worth less today .
" generation download thinks information wants to be free ... even if some ink-stained wretch wept tears of blood to create it , " wrote mark dery , another contributor .
copyright concerns ?
what 's more , the masses who are blogging or uploading poetry seem unconcerned about that talisman of the traditional writer , copyright .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how can one put income in writers ' pockets in the digital age ?
it 's a situation that appals alexander unverzagt , a hamburg , germany copyright lawyer in a panel discussion at the book fair .
he recalled being approached a few weeks ago by an academic who had hosted a blog that attracted a lot of profound comment .
the academic wanted to take 150 of the most superb comments and edit them into a book .
could he do so , without negotiating individual rights contracts with all 150 authors ?
no way , said unverzagt .
every contributor had implicitly granted a licence to use his text for the blog only , but not for another medium such as a book .
" the internet is not a lawless zone , " he said .
the key purpose of the annual , five-day frankfurt book fair is buying and selling the rights to writing , country by country and in all the myriad publication forms , whether as books , film or online .
discussion is growing about whether that is a sensible way to put income in writers ' pockets .

obtaining 150 licenses would take more effort than it is worth to publish just one book .
if all the authors had legally gifted their comments to humanity , their thoughts could be reproduced in a book and would win wider influence .

13 , chancellor angela merkel stressed the need for russia and germany to cooperate on international issues .
merkel will meet with russian president putin on sunday in germany . in chancellor angela merkel 's weekly podcast , she said that germany and russia had a " strategic partnership , " and that despite many differences of opinion , the two countries also shared several common positions on topics .
merkel and russian president vladimir putin are scheduled to meet sunday on the sidelines of the petersburg dialogue in the western city of wiesbaden .
the conference began on saturday , oct .
13 and runs through monday .
" i have already had many open , honest and very intensive conversations with president putin and i am pleased that we will be able to do this again , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has not been afraid to engage in tough talk with the russian president she said their discussions on sunday evening would primarily focus on bilateral issues and the relationship between the two countries , but she added that the two would also talk about the situation in iran and the future of kosovo , along with us plans for a missile defense system based in eastern europe , which moscow opposes .
on monday , she and putin will participate in a forum on the closing day of the event , where representatives from the civil societies of both countries will gather .
merkel said such a meeting highlighted the importance of the petersberg dialogue , since " only through exchanges among all groups in our societies can we create strong relationships with one another . "
former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev will take part in the dialogue in his capacity as co-chairman of the forum .
the petersburg dialogue is an regular russian-german conference that set up by putin and previous chancellor gerhard schröder in 2001 to bring the russian and german societies closer together .
greens ' concerns the german greens have called on the government not to stay silent on the issue of russia 's democratic deficit .
the human rights spokesperson of the party , volker beck , told chancellor merkel on saturday that she should warn putin about " bending the russian constitution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spa hotel in wiesbaden where the petersburg dialogue will take place he said kremlin plans to keep putin in power constitute a " renewed , grave step backwards for democracy in russia " and that before elections on dec .
2 , a changing of positions could take place that could lead to putin again being president of the russian federation within a few months .
putin announced recently that he will lead the slate of candidates for his party , united russia , in duma elections in december and has hinted that he might eventually become russia ’ s prime minister in order to complete the political transformation he launched eight years ago .
this " pseudo-legal putsch , " according to beck , might satisfy strict legal requirements of the constitution , which says a head of state can not run for office for a third term .
but putin 's plan to bend russian law to his will , without breaking it , amounts to a " violence-free coup against the constitution . "
there are concerns that putin might use his party 's likely constitutional majority of 300 seats in the duma to push forward constitutional changes that would reshape russia ’ s political system as a parliamentary-presidential republic .
then the center of power would shift from the presidency to the prime minister ’ s office .
or , even if putin did not tinker with the constitution , he could simply become russia 's de facto leader as prime minister . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the losers in this development , at least financially , appear to be the writers . at the frankfurt book fair this week there are books galore by authors no one has ever heard of .
for every millionaire celebrity author , such as jk rowling sitting pretty on a fortune from her seven harry potter novels , there are hundreds of thousands of writers earning just pennies , having to make their living from taxi-driving or teaching .
a us webzine , 10 zen monkeys , did an unscientific survey last week of professional writers - the term was defined to include both book and magazine authors - and found many saying that they were receiving fewer commissions and less income than a decade ago .
the villain , many say , is the internet .
a surfeit of good stuff the web is being criticized for giving a voice to so many millions of people that good writing is no longer scarce .
it 's everywhere .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are more distractions than ever before thanks to the internet one of the surveyed writers , john shirley , observed , " people spend a great deal of time and energy online , time and energy which is then not available for that armchair book . "
the fear among writers is that , according to the old laws of supply and demand , writing is worth less today .
" generation download thinks information wants to be free ... even if some ink-stained wretch wept tears of blood to create it , " wrote mark dery , another contributor .
copyright concerns ?
what 's more , the masses who are blogging or uploading poetry seem unconcerned about that talisman of the traditional writer , copyright .
they 're publishing their essays , diaries , poetry and fiction online with no practical protection against plagiarists .

merkel will meet with russian president putin on sunday in germany . in chancellor angela merkel 's weekly podcast , she said that germany and russia had a " strategic partnership , " and that despite many differences of opinion , the two countries also shared several common positions on topics .
merkel and russian president vladimir putin are scheduled to meet sunday on the sidelines of the petersburg dialogue in the western city of wiesbaden .
the conference began on saturday , oct .
13 and runs through monday .
" i have already had many open , honest and very intensive conversations with president putin and i am pleased that we will be able to do this again , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has not been afraid to engage in tough talk with the russian president she said their discussions on sunday evening would primarily focus on bilateral issues and the relationship between the two countries , but she added that the two would also talk about the situation in iran and the future of kosovo , along with us plans for a missile defense system based in eastern europe , which moscow opposes .
on monday , she and putin will participate in a forum on the closing day of the event , where representatives from the civil societies of both countries will gather .
merkel said such a meeting highlighted the importance of the petersberg dialogue , since " only through exchanges among all groups in our societies can we create strong relationships with one another . "
former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev will take part in the dialogue in his capacity as co-chairman of the forum .

putin announced recently that he will lead the slate of candidates for his party , united russia , in duma elections in december and has hinted that he might eventually become russia ’ s prime minister in order to complete the political transformation he launched eight years ago .
this " pseudo-legal putsch , " according to beck , might satisfy strict legal requirements of the constitution , which says a head of state can not run for office for a third term .
but putin 's plan to bend russian law to his will , without breaking it , amounts to a " violence-free coup against the constitution . "
there are concerns that putin might use his party 's likely constitutional majority of 300 seats in the duma to push forward constitutional changes that would reshape russia ’ s political system as a parliamentary-presidential republic .
then the center of power would shift from the presidency to the prime minister ’ s office .

" the report shows that r & d investment by eu companies is still growing at a lower rate than their non-eu counterparts , a trend identified in every edition of the -lsb- survey -rsb- published to date , " the commission said in a statement ..
in 2006 , european r & d investments grew by 7.4 percent , the highest rate in the last five years , but still below the 11.1 percent growth seen in other major economies , including the us and japan , the study said . " the positive upward trend seen in the last two years is encouraging , and leads me to believe our innovation strategy is back on the right track , but we must not allow ourselves to be complacent , " said european science and research commissioner janez potocnik . private influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pharmaceutical companies had the largest r & d spending growth last year germany 's daimlerchrysler , which changed its name to daimler ag after the study was conducted , was europe 's highest scorer with 5.2 billion euros .
britain 's glaxosmithkline ranked no. 7 , and german engineering giant siemens ag was at no. 8 . pfizer , the world 's largest drugmaker , was the world 's biggest spender with 5.8 billion euros of its budget devoted to r & d in 2006 . about 55 percent of eu investment in r & d comes from private sources .
the comparable figure is 63 percent in the us ; in japan 75 percent of r & d spending comes from businesses . " we are only ever going to improve our r & d performance if more companies see the benefit of investing in research , " potocnik said . some positives for eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu automakers were among the biggest r & d spenders in their sector european commission officials stressed the positive elements of the survey , pointing out that the rate of growth had increased , that the eu leads the world in fixed capital investment , and that three eu companies were among the top 10 private investors in r & d worldwide . slower european growth in r & d-intensive fields , such as pharmaceuticals and computing , has led to less development spending in the 27-member eu , the report said . eu companies involved in more traditional industries , such as car manufacturing , hold up well against their global rivals with five eu-based carmakers in the list of top-50 r & d investors compared with six from non-eu members . but in the pharmaceuticals sector , nine non-eu companies - two of them in switzerland - compete with only three eu companies in the top 50 . while there were 13 hi-tech companies based outside the eu in the top 50 , including microsoft , samsung , intel , sony and ibm , only five eu companies made the list : siemens , nokia , ericsson , alcatel-lucent and philips , the report said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the losers in this development , at least financially , appear to be the writers . at the frankfurt book fair this week there are books galore by authors no one has ever heard of .
for every millionaire celebrity author , such as jk rowling sitting pretty on a fortune from her seven harry potter novels , there are hundreds of thousands of writers earning just pennies , having to make their living from taxi-driving or teaching .
a us webzine , 10 zen monkeys , did an unscientific survey last week of professional writers - the term was defined to include both book and magazine authors - and found many saying that they were receiving fewer commissions and less income than a decade ago .
the villain , many say , is the internet .
a surfeit of good stuff the web is being criticized for giving a voice to so many millions of people that good writing is no longer scarce .
it 's everywhere .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are more distractions than ever before thanks to the internet one of the surveyed writers , john shirley , observed , " people spend a great deal of time and energy online , time and energy which is then not available for that armchair book . "
the fear among writers is that , according to the old laws of supply and demand , writing is worth less today .
" generation download thinks information wants to be free ... even if some ink-stained wretch wept tears of blood to create it , " wrote mark dery , another contributor .
copyright concerns ?
what 's more , the masses who are blogging or uploading poetry seem unconcerned about that talisman of the traditional writer , copyright .
they 're publishing their essays , diaries , poetry and fiction online with no practical protection against plagiarists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how can one put income in writers ' pockets in the digital age ?
it 's a situation that appals alexander unverzagt , a hamburg , germany copyright lawyer in a panel discussion at the book fair .
he recalled being approached a few weeks ago by an academic who had hosted a blog that attracted a lot of profound comment .
the academic wanted to take 150 of the most superb comments and edit them into a book .
could he do so , without negotiating individual rights contracts with all 150 authors ?
no way , said unverzagt .
every contributor had implicitly granted a licence to use his text for the blog only , but not for another medium such as a book .
" the internet is not a lawless zone , " he said .
the key purpose of the annual , five-day frankfurt book fair is buying and selling the rights to writing , country by country and in all the myriad publication forms , whether as books , film or online .
discussion is growing about whether that is a sensible way to put income in writers ' pockets .
open access a panelist , catharina maracke , also a lawyer , said the hamburg academic should have asked his contributors to sign over some rights from the beginning with a " creative commons " license .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some argue copying from authors in the digital age should be less frowned upon the world creative commons movement - maracke heads its berlin office - is an offshoot of the open-access movement which argues that the legal phobia against copying is a brake on scholarship , science and debate .
obtaining 150 licenses would take more effort than it is worth to publish just one book .
if all the authors had legally gifted their comments to humanity , their thoughts could be reproduced in a book and would win wider influence .
top publishers at the fair agree that worldwide sales of printed books remain strong .
peter olson , chief executive of the world 's biggest book publisher , new york-based random house , says there is a digital future but it is not a threat .
sweat-shop labor ?
the concern among authors is that they are becoming low-pay workers in a flourishing industry .
many , such as poets and academics , receive only neglible royalties and mainly publish for the sake of glory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some poets make money off of appearances , not off their books monika rinck , a german poet , says she publishes her poetry on blogs and on the internet and does not expect the publication itself to bring her any income .
instead , she can charge appearance fees for reading the poetry , thanks to her growing reputation .
" i do n't earn income from a book , but rather from my readers , " she explained during the panel discussion .
writers justify free blogs as a way to build a fan community , establish a public personality and explain their thought processes .
open-source or traditional , writers like rinck agree that editors are still essential to select the best writing of the age .
" we 're drowning in yak , and it 's getting harder and harder to hear the insightful voices , " dery said .

13 , chancellor angela merkel stressed the need for russia and germany to cooperate on international issues .
merkel will meet with russian president putin on sunday in germany . in chancellor angela merkel 's weekly podcast , she said that germany and russia had a " strategic partnership , " and that despite many differences of opinion , the two countries also shared several common positions on topics .
merkel and russian president vladimir putin are scheduled to meet sunday on the sidelines of the petersburg dialogue in the western city of wiesbaden .
the conference began on saturday , oct .
13 and runs through monday .
" i have already had many open , honest and very intensive conversations with president putin and i am pleased that we will be able to do this again , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has not been afraid to engage in tough talk with the russian president she said their discussions on sunday evening would primarily focus on bilateral issues and the relationship between the two countries , but she added that the two would also talk about the situation in iran and the future of kosovo , along with us plans for a missile defense system based in eastern europe , which moscow opposes .
on monday , she and putin will participate in a forum on the closing day of the event , where representatives from the civil societies of both countries will gather .
merkel said such a meeting highlighted the importance of the petersberg dialogue , since " only through exchanges among all groups in our societies can we create strong relationships with one another . "
former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev will take part in the dialogue in his capacity as co-chairman of the forum .
the petersburg dialogue is an regular russian-german conference that set up by putin and previous chancellor gerhard schröder in 2001 to bring the russian and german societies closer together .
greens ' concerns the german greens have called on the government not to stay silent on the issue of russia 's democratic deficit .
the human rights spokesperson of the party , volker beck , told chancellor merkel on saturday that she should warn putin about " bending the russian constitution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spa hotel in wiesbaden where the petersburg dialogue will take place he said kremlin plans to keep putin in power constitute a " renewed , grave step backwards for democracy in russia " and that before elections on dec .
2 , a changing of positions could take place that could lead to putin again being president of the russian federation within a few months .
putin announced recently that he will lead the slate of candidates for his party , united russia , in duma elections in december and has hinted that he might eventually become russia ’ s prime minister in order to complete the political transformation he launched eight years ago .
this " pseudo-legal putsch , " according to beck , might satisfy strict legal requirements of the constitution , which says a head of state can not run for office for a third term .
but putin 's plan to bend russian law to his will , without breaking it , amounts to a " violence-free coup against the constitution . "
there are concerns that putin might use his party 's likely constitutional majority of 300 seats in the duma to push forward constitutional changes that would reshape russia ’ s political system as a parliamentary-presidential republic .
then the center of power would shift from the presidency to the prime minister ’ s office .
or , even if putin did not tinker with the constitution , he could simply become russia 's de facto leader as prime minister . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the report shows that r & d investment by eu companies is still growing at a lower rate than their non-eu counterparts , a trend identified in every edition of the -lsb- survey -rsb- published to date , " the commission said in a statement ..

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some argue copying from authors in the digital age should be less frowned upon the world creative commons movement - maracke heads its berlin office - is an offshoot of the open-access movement which argues that the legal phobia against copying is a brake on scholarship , science and debate .
obtaining 150 licenses would take more effort than it is worth to publish just one book .
if all the authors had legally gifted their comments to humanity , their thoughts could be reproduced in a book and would win wider influence .
top publishers at the fair agree that worldwide sales of printed books remain strong .
peter olson , chief executive of the world 's biggest book publisher , new york-based random house , says there is a digital future but it is not a threat .
sweat-shop labor ?
the concern among authors is that they are becoming low-pay workers in a flourishing industry .
many , such as poets and academics , receive only neglible royalties and mainly publish for the sake of glory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some poets make money off of appearances , not off their books monika rinck , a german poet , says she publishes her poetry on blogs and on the internet and does not expect the publication itself to bring her any income .
instead , she can charge appearance fees for reading the poetry , thanks to her growing reputation .
" i do n't earn income from a book , but rather from my readers , " she explained during the panel discussion .
writers justify free blogs as a way to build a fan community , establish a public personality and explain their thought processes .
open-source or traditional , writers like rinck agree that editors are still essential to select the best writing of the age .
" we 're drowning in yak , and it 's getting harder and harder to hear the insightful voices , " dery said .

" the report shows that r & d investment by eu companies is still growing at a lower rate than their non-eu counterparts , a trend identified in every edition of the -lsb- survey -rsb- published to date , " the commission said in a statement ..
in 2006 , european r & d investments grew by 7.4 percent , the highest rate in the last five years , but still below the 11.1 percent growth seen in other major economies , including the us and japan , the study said . " the positive upward trend seen in the last two years is encouraging , and leads me to believe our innovation strategy is back on the right track , but we must not allow ourselves to be complacent , " said european science and research commissioner janez potocnik . private influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pharmaceutical companies had the largest r & d spending growth last year germany 's daimlerchrysler , which changed its name to daimler ag after the study was conducted , was europe 's highest scorer with 5.2 billion euros .
britain 's glaxosmithkline ranked no. 7 , and german engineering giant siemens ag was at no. 8 . pfizer , the world 's largest drugmaker , was the world 's biggest spender with 5.8 billion euros of its budget devoted to r & d in 2006 . about 55 percent of eu investment in r & d comes from private sources .
the comparable figure is 63 percent in the us ; in japan 75 percent of r & d spending comes from businesses . " we are only ever going to improve our r & d performance if more companies see the benefit of investing in research , " potocnik said . some positives for eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu automakers were among the biggest r & d spenders in their sector european commission officials stressed the positive elements of the survey , pointing out that the rate of growth had increased , that the eu leads the world in fixed capital investment , and that three eu companies were among the top 10 private investors in r & d worldwide . slower european growth in r & d-intensive fields , such as pharmaceuticals and computing , has led to less development spending in the 27-member eu , the report said . eu companies involved in more traditional industries , such as car manufacturing , hold up well against their global rivals with five eu-based carmakers in the list of top-50 r & d investors compared with six from non-eu members . but in the pharmaceuticals sector , nine non-eu companies - two of them in switzerland - compete with only three eu companies in the top 50 . while there were 13 hi-tech companies based outside the eu in the top 50 , including microsoft , samsung , intel , sony and ibm , only five eu companies made the list : siemens , nokia , ericsson , alcatel-lucent and philips , the report said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 , chancellor angela merkel stressed the need for russia and germany to cooperate on international issues .
merkel will meet with russian president putin on sunday in germany . in chancellor angela merkel 's weekly podcast , she said that germany and russia had a " strategic partnership , " and that despite many differences of opinion , the two countries also shared several common positions on topics .
merkel and russian president vladimir putin are scheduled to meet sunday on the sidelines of the petersburg dialogue in the western city of wiesbaden .
the conference began on saturday , oct .
13 and runs through monday .
" i have already had many open , honest and very intensive conversations with president putin and i am pleased that we will be able to do this again , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has not been afraid to engage in tough talk with the russian president she said their discussions on sunday evening would primarily focus on bilateral issues and the relationship between the two countries , but she added that the two would also talk about the situation in iran and the future of kosovo , along with us plans for a missile defense system based in eastern europe , which moscow opposes .
on monday , she and putin will participate in a forum on the closing day of the event , where representatives from the civil societies of both countries will gather .
merkel said such a meeting highlighted the importance of the petersberg dialogue , since " only through exchanges among all groups in our societies can we create strong relationships with one another . "
former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev will take part in the dialogue in his capacity as co-chairman of the forum .
the petersburg dialogue is an regular russian-german conference that set up by putin and previous chancellor gerhard schröder in 2001 to bring the russian and german societies closer together .
greens ' concerns the german greens have called on the government not to stay silent on the issue of russia 's democratic deficit .
the human rights spokesperson of the party , volker beck , told chancellor merkel on saturday that she should warn putin about " bending the russian constitution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spa hotel in wiesbaden where the petersburg dialogue will take place he said kremlin plans to keep putin in power constitute a " renewed , grave step backwards for democracy in russia " and that before elections on dec .
2 , a changing of positions could take place that could lead to putin again being president of the russian federation within a few months .
putin announced recently that he will lead the slate of candidates for his party , united russia , in duma elections in december and has hinted that he might eventually become russia ’ s prime minister in order to complete the political transformation he launched eight years ago .
this " pseudo-legal putsch , " according to beck , might satisfy strict legal requirements of the constitution , which says a head of state can not run for office for a third term .
but putin 's plan to bend russian law to his will , without breaking it , amounts to a " violence-free coup against the constitution . "
there are concerns that putin might use his party 's likely constitutional majority of 300 seats in the duma to push forward constitutional changes that would reshape russia ’ s political system as a parliamentary-presidential republic .
then the center of power would shift from the presidency to the prime minister ’ s office .
or , even if putin did not tinker with the constitution , he could simply become russia 's de facto leader as prime minister . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the report shows that r & d investment by eu companies is still growing at a lower rate than their non-eu counterparts , a trend identified in every edition of the -lsb- survey -rsb- published to date , " the commission said in a statement ..
in 2006 , european r & d investments grew by 7.4 percent , the highest rate in the last five years , but still below the 11.1 percent growth seen in other major economies , including the us and japan , the study said . " the positive upward trend seen in the last two years is encouraging , and leads me to believe our innovation strategy is back on the right track , but we must not allow ourselves to be complacent , " said european science and research commissioner janez potocnik . private influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pharmaceutical companies had the largest r & d spending growth last year germany 's daimlerchrysler , which changed its name to daimler ag after the study was conducted , was europe 's highest scorer with 5.2 billion euros .
britain 's glaxosmithkline ranked no. 7 , and german engineering giant siemens ag was at no. 8 . pfizer , the world 's largest drugmaker , was the world 's biggest spender with 5.8 billion euros of its budget devoted to r & d in 2006 . about 55 percent of eu investment in r & d comes from private sources .
the comparable figure is 63 percent in the us ; in japan 75 percent of r & d spending comes from businesses . " we are only ever going to improve our r & d performance if more companies see the benefit of investing in research , " potocnik said . some positives for eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu automakers were among the biggest r & d spenders in their sector european commission officials stressed the positive elements of the survey , pointing out that the rate of growth had increased , that the eu leads the world in fixed capital investment , and that three eu companies were among the top 10 private investors in r & d worldwide . slower european growth in r & d-intensive fields , such as pharmaceuticals and computing , has led to less development spending in the 27-member eu , the report said . eu companies involved in more traditional industries , such as car manufacturing , hold up well against their global rivals with five eu-based carmakers in the list of top-50 r & d investors compared with six from non-eu members . but in the pharmaceuticals sector , nine non-eu companies - two of them in switzerland - compete with only three eu companies in the top 50 . while there were 13 hi-tech companies based outside the eu in the top 50 , including microsoft , samsung , intel , sony and ibm , only five eu companies made the list : siemens , nokia , ericsson , alcatel-lucent and philips , the report said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merkel will meet with russian president putin on sunday in germany . in chancellor angela merkel 's weekly podcast , she said that germany and russia had a " strategic partnership , " and that despite many differences of opinion , the two countries also shared several common positions on topics .
merkel and russian president vladimir putin are scheduled to meet sunday on the sidelines of the petersburg dialogue in the western city of wiesbaden .
the conference began on saturday , oct .
13 and runs through monday .
" i have already had many open , honest and very intensive conversations with president putin and i am pleased that we will be able to do this again , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has not been afraid to engage in tough talk with the russian president she said their discussions on sunday evening would primarily focus on bilateral issues and the relationship between the two countries , but she added that the two would also talk about the situation in iran and the future of kosovo , along with us plans for a missile defense system based in eastern europe , which moscow opposes .
on monday , she and putin will participate in a forum on the closing day of the event , where representatives from the civil societies of both countries will gather .
merkel said such a meeting highlighted the importance of the petersberg dialogue , since " only through exchanges among all groups in our societies can we create strong relationships with one another . "
former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev will take part in the dialogue in his capacity as co-chairman of the forum .
the petersburg dialogue is an regular russian-german conference that set up by putin and previous chancellor gerhard schröder in 2001 to bring the russian and german societies closer together .

putin announced recently that he will lead the slate of candidates for his party , united russia , in duma elections in december and has hinted that he might eventually become russia ’ s prime minister in order to complete the political transformation he launched eight years ago .
this " pseudo-legal putsch , " according to beck , might satisfy strict legal requirements of the constitution , which says a head of state can not run for office for a third term .
but putin 's plan to bend russian law to his will , without breaking it , amounts to a " violence-free coup against the constitution . "
there are concerns that putin might use his party 's likely constitutional majority of 300 seats in the duma to push forward constitutional changes that would reshape russia ’ s political system as a parliamentary-presidential republic .
then the center of power would shift from the presidency to the prime minister ’ s office .

13 , chancellor angela merkel stressed the need for russia and germany to cooperate on international issues .
merkel will meet with russian president putin on sunday in germany . in chancellor angela merkel 's weekly podcast , she said that germany and russia had a " strategic partnership , " and that despite many differences of opinion , the two countries also shared several common positions on topics .
merkel and russian president vladimir putin are scheduled to meet sunday on the sidelines of the petersburg dialogue in the western city of wiesbaden .
the conference began on saturday , oct .
13 and runs through monday .
" i have already had many open , honest and very intensive conversations with president putin and i am pleased that we will be able to do this again , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has not been afraid to engage in tough talk with the russian president she said their discussions on sunday evening would primarily focus on bilateral issues and the relationship between the two countries , but she added that the two would also talk about the situation in iran and the future of kosovo , along with us plans for a missile defense system based in eastern europe , which moscow opposes .
on monday , she and putin will participate in a forum on the closing day of the event , where representatives from the civil societies of both countries will gather .
merkel said such a meeting highlighted the importance of the petersberg dialogue , since " only through exchanges among all groups in our societies can we create strong relationships with one another . "
former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev will take part in the dialogue in his capacity as co-chairman of the forum .
the petersburg dialogue is an regular russian-german conference that set up by putin and previous chancellor gerhard schröder in 2001 to bring the russian and german societies closer together .
greens ' concerns the german greens have called on the government not to stay silent on the issue of russia 's democratic deficit .
the human rights spokesperson of the party , volker beck , told chancellor merkel on saturday that she should warn putin about " bending the russian constitution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spa hotel in wiesbaden where the petersburg dialogue will take place he said kremlin plans to keep putin in power constitute a " renewed , grave step backwards for democracy in russia " and that before elections on dec .
2 , a changing of positions could take place that could lead to putin again being president of the russian federation within a few months .
putin announced recently that he will lead the slate of candidates for his party , united russia , in duma elections in december and has hinted that he might eventually become russia ’ s prime minister in order to complete the political transformation he launched eight years ago .
this " pseudo-legal putsch , " according to beck , might satisfy strict legal requirements of the constitution , which says a head of state can not run for office for a third term .
but putin 's plan to bend russian law to his will , without breaking it , amounts to a " violence-free coup against the constitution . "
there are concerns that putin might use his party 's likely constitutional majority of 300 seats in the duma to push forward constitutional changes that would reshape russia ’ s political system as a parliamentary-presidential republic .
then the center of power would shift from the presidency to the prime minister ’ s office .
or , even if putin did not tinker with the constitution , he could simply become russia 's de facto leader as prime minister . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's a situation that appals alexander unverzagt , a hamburg , germany copyright lawyer in a panel discussion at the book fair .
he recalled being approached a few weeks ago by an academic who had hosted a blog that attracted a lot of profound comment .
the academic wanted to take 150 of the most superb comments and edit them into a book .
could he do so , without negotiating individual rights contracts with all 150 authors ?
no way , said unverzagt .

" the internet is not a lawless zone , " he said .
the key purpose of the annual , five-day frankfurt book fair is buying and selling the rights to writing , country by country and in all the myriad publication forms , whether as books , film or online .
discussion is growing about whether that is a sensible way to put income in writers ' pockets .

obtaining 150 licenses would take more effort than it is worth to publish just one book .

but the losers in this development , at least financially , appear to be the writers . at the frankfurt book fair this week there are books galore by authors no one has ever heard of .
for every millionaire celebrity author , such as jk rowling sitting pretty on a fortune from her seven harry potter novels , there are hundreds of thousands of writers earning just pennies , having to make their living from taxi-driving or teaching .
a us webzine , 10 zen monkeys , did an unscientific survey last week of professional writers - the term was defined to include both book and magazine authors - and found many saying that they were receiving fewer commissions and less income than a decade ago .
the villain , many say , is the internet .
a surfeit of good stuff the web is being criticized for giving a voice to so many millions of people that good writing is no longer scarce .
it 's everywhere .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are more distractions than ever before thanks to the internet one of the surveyed writers , john shirley , observed , " people spend a great deal of time and energy online , time and energy which is then not available for that armchair book . "
the fear among writers is that , according to the old laws of supply and demand , writing is worth less today .
" generation download thinks information wants to be free ... even if some ink-stained wretch wept tears of blood to create it , " wrote mark dery , another contributor .
copyright concerns ?
what 's more , the masses who are blogging or uploading poetry seem unconcerned about that talisman of the traditional writer , copyright .
they 're publishing their essays , diaries , poetry and fiction online with no practical protection against plagiarists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how can one put income in writers ' pockets in the digital age ?
it 's a situation that appals alexander unverzagt , a hamburg , germany copyright lawyer in a panel discussion at the book fair .
he recalled being approached a few weeks ago by an academic who had hosted a blog that attracted a lot of profound comment .
the academic wanted to take 150 of the most superb comments and edit them into a book .
could he do so , without negotiating individual rights contracts with all 150 authors ?
no way , said unverzagt .
every contributor had implicitly granted a licence to use his text for the blog only , but not for another medium such as a book .
" the internet is not a lawless zone , " he said .
the key purpose of the annual , five-day frankfurt book fair is buying and selling the rights to writing , country by country and in all the myriad publication forms , whether as books , film or online .
discussion is growing about whether that is a sensible way to put income in writers ' pockets .
open access a panelist , catharina maracke , also a lawyer , said the hamburg academic should have asked his contributors to sign over some rights from the beginning with a " creative commons " license .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some argue copying from authors in the digital age should be less frowned upon the world creative commons movement - maracke heads its berlin office - is an offshoot of the open-access movement which argues that the legal phobia against copying is a brake on scholarship , science and debate .
obtaining 150 licenses would take more effort than it is worth to publish just one book .
if all the authors had legally gifted their comments to humanity , their thoughts could be reproduced in a book and would win wider influence .
top publishers at the fair agree that worldwide sales of printed books remain strong .
peter olson , chief executive of the world 's biggest book publisher , new york-based random house , says there is a digital future but it is not a threat .
sweat-shop labor ?
the concern among authors is that they are becoming low-pay workers in a flourishing industry .
many , such as poets and academics , receive only neglible royalties and mainly publish for the sake of glory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some poets make money off of appearances , not off their books monika rinck , a german poet , says she publishes her poetry on blogs and on the internet and does not expect the publication itself to bring her any income .
instead , she can charge appearance fees for reading the poetry , thanks to her growing reputation .
" i do n't earn income from a book , but rather from my readers , " she explained during the panel discussion .
writers justify free blogs as a way to build a fan community , establish a public personality and explain their thought processes .
open-source or traditional , writers like rinck agree that editors are still essential to select the best writing of the age .
" we 're drowning in yak , and it 's getting harder and harder to hear the insightful voices , " dery said .

" we have recorded 184 projects to build new mosques , of which some are already under construction , " salim abdullah , of the german institute of islamic archives , told the afp news agency this past week . " we are talking here about buildings with a dome and a minaret , which are clearly recognizable from the outside , and not the 2,600 prayer areas housed in various buildings throughout the country , " abdullah added . of some 1,200 institutions used as mosques in germany , only 159 are recognizable mosques , serving a community that numbers over 3 million .
the remaining are so-called " backyard mosques , " meaning they are in rooms in buildings that have other purposes or would not obviously appear to be mosques to unaware passers-by .
in 2004 , mosques with minarets numbered just 141 . the growth in the construction of mosques over the past two decades has made germany one of the " best-equipped " countries in europe for islamic worship , abdullah said . resistance to renovations bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german architect paul böhm with a model of the mosque he designed for cologne plans to build one of the biggest mosques in europe in the western german city of cologne have been opposed by christian leaders and far-right politicians . the mosque is being planned by the turkish-islamic union for religious affairs -lrb- ditib -rrb- , germany 's biggest muslim group . the central council of ex-muslims has also spoken out against the project .
speaking on german public radio , mina ahadi , chairwoman of the ex-muslims group , argued that were already enough mosques in germany . " if more mosques are built , then women are put under increased pressure and even more children will be sent to school in headscarves , and become isolated , " she said . churches to mosques while the number of mosques is growing , the doors are slamming shut at christian churches across the country . in recent weeks , a church in the neukölln neighborhood of berlin was sold for 550,000 euros to the muslim association of intercultural centers , which plans to turn it into what it calls a " house of peace . " in future , the group says , the building will host prayer services , projects designed to promote integration , social advice services and career guidance . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the report shows that r & d investment by eu companies is still growing at a lower rate than their non-eu counterparts , a trend identified in every edition of the -lsb- survey -rsb- published to date , " the commission said in a statement ..
in 2006 , european r & d investments grew by 7.4 percent , the highest rate in the last five years , but still below the 11.1 percent growth seen in other major economies , including the us and japan , the study said . " the positive upward trend seen in the last two years is encouraging , and leads me to believe our innovation strategy is back on the right track , but we must not allow ourselves to be complacent , " said european science and research commissioner janez potocnik . private influence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pharmaceutical companies had the largest r & d spending growth last year germany 's daimlerchrysler , which changed its name to daimler ag after the study was conducted , was europe 's highest scorer with 5.2 billion euros .
britain 's glaxosmithkline ranked no. 7 , and german engineering giant siemens ag was at no. 8 . pfizer , the world 's largest drugmaker , was the world 's biggest spender with 5.8 billion euros of its budget devoted to r & d in 2006 . about 55 percent of eu investment in r & d comes from private sources .
the comparable figure is 63 percent in the us ; in japan 75 percent of r & d spending comes from businesses . " we are only ever going to improve our r & d performance if more companies see the benefit of investing in research , " potocnik said . some positives for eu bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu automakers were among the biggest r & d spenders in their sector european commission officials stressed the positive elements of the survey , pointing out that the rate of growth had increased , that the eu leads the world in fixed capital investment , and that three eu companies were among the top 10 private investors in r & d worldwide . slower european growth in r & d-intensive fields , such as pharmaceuticals and computing , has led to less development spending in the 27-member eu , the report said . eu companies involved in more traditional industries , such as car manufacturing , hold up well against their global rivals with five eu-based carmakers in the list of top-50 r & d investors compared with six from non-eu members . but in the pharmaceuticals sector , nine non-eu companies - two of them in switzerland - compete with only three eu companies in the top 50 . while there were 13 hi-tech companies based outside the eu in the top 50 , including microsoft , samsung , intel , sony and ibm , only five eu companies made the list : siemens , nokia , ericsson , alcatel-lucent and philips , the report said . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

13 , chancellor angela merkel stressed the need for russia and germany to cooperate on international issues .
merkel will meet with russian president putin on sunday in germany . in chancellor angela merkel 's weekly podcast , she said that germany and russia had a " strategic partnership , " and that despite many differences of opinion , the two countries also shared several common positions on topics .
merkel and russian president vladimir putin are scheduled to meet sunday on the sidelines of the petersburg dialogue in the western city of wiesbaden .
the conference began on saturday , oct .
13 and runs through monday .
" i have already had many open , honest and very intensive conversations with president putin and i am pleased that we will be able to do this again , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has not been afraid to engage in tough talk with the russian president she said their discussions on sunday evening would primarily focus on bilateral issues and the relationship between the two countries , but she added that the two would also talk about the situation in iran and the future of kosovo , along with us plans for a missile defense system based in eastern europe , which moscow opposes .
on monday , she and putin will participate in a forum on the closing day of the event , where representatives from the civil societies of both countries will gather .
merkel said such a meeting highlighted the importance of the petersberg dialogue , since " only through exchanges among all groups in our societies can we create strong relationships with one another . "
former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev will take part in the dialogue in his capacity as co-chairman of the forum .
the petersburg dialogue is an regular russian-german conference that set up by putin and previous chancellor gerhard schröder in 2001 to bring the russian and german societies closer together .
greens ' concerns the german greens have called on the government not to stay silent on the issue of russia 's democratic deficit .
the human rights spokesperson of the party , volker beck , told chancellor merkel on saturday that she should warn putin about " bending the russian constitution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spa hotel in wiesbaden where the petersburg dialogue will take place he said kremlin plans to keep putin in power constitute a " renewed , grave step backwards for democracy in russia " and that before elections on dec .
2 , a changing of positions could take place that could lead to putin again being president of the russian federation within a few months .
putin announced recently that he will lead the slate of candidates for his party , united russia , in duma elections in december and has hinted that he might eventually become russia ’ s prime minister in order to complete the political transformation he launched eight years ago .
this " pseudo-legal putsch , " according to beck , might satisfy strict legal requirements of the constitution , which says a head of state can not run for office for a third term .
but putin 's plan to bend russian law to his will , without breaking it , amounts to a " violence-free coup against the constitution . "
there are concerns that putin might use his party 's likely constitutional majority of 300 seats in the duma to push forward constitutional changes that would reshape russia ’ s political system as a parliamentary-presidential republic .
then the center of power would shift from the presidency to the prime minister ’ s office .
or , even if putin did not tinker with the constitution , he could simply become russia 's de facto leader as prime minister . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the losers in this development , at least financially , appear to be the writers . at the frankfurt book fair this week there are books galore by authors no one has ever heard of .
for every millionaire celebrity author , such as jk rowling sitting pretty on a fortune from her seven harry potter novels , there are hundreds of thousands of writers earning just pennies , having to make their living from taxi-driving or teaching .
a us webzine , 10 zen monkeys , did an unscientific survey last week of professional writers - the term was defined to include both book and magazine authors - and found many saying that they were receiving fewer commissions and less income than a decade ago .
the villain , many say , is the internet .
a surfeit of good stuff the web is being criticized for giving a voice to so many millions of people that good writing is no longer scarce .
it 's everywhere .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are more distractions than ever before thanks to the internet one of the surveyed writers , john shirley , observed , " people spend a great deal of time and energy online , time and energy which is then not available for that armchair book . "
the fear among writers is that , according to the old laws of supply and demand , writing is worth less today .
" generation download thinks information wants to be free ... even if some ink-stained wretch wept tears of blood to create it , " wrote mark dery , another contributor .
copyright concerns ?
what 's more , the masses who are blogging or uploading poetry seem unconcerned about that talisman of the traditional writer , copyright .
they 're publishing their essays , diaries , poetry and fiction online with no practical protection against plagiarists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how can one put income in writers ' pockets in the digital age ?
it 's a situation that appals alexander unverzagt , a hamburg , germany copyright lawyer in a panel discussion at the book fair .
he recalled being approached a few weeks ago by an academic who had hosted a blog that attracted a lot of profound comment .
the academic wanted to take 150 of the most superb comments and edit them into a book .
could he do so , without negotiating individual rights contracts with all 150 authors ?
no way , said unverzagt .
every contributor had implicitly granted a licence to use his text for the blog only , but not for another medium such as a book .
" the internet is not a lawless zone , " he said .
the key purpose of the annual , five-day frankfurt book fair is buying and selling the rights to writing , country by country and in all the myriad publication forms , whether as books , film or online .
discussion is growing about whether that is a sensible way to put income in writers ' pockets .
open access a panelist , catharina maracke , also a lawyer , said the hamburg academic should have asked his contributors to sign over some rights from the beginning with a " creative commons " license .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some argue copying from authors in the digital age should be less frowned upon the world creative commons movement - maracke heads its berlin office - is an offshoot of the open-access movement which argues that the legal phobia against copying is a brake on scholarship , science and debate .
obtaining 150 licenses would take more effort than it is worth to publish just one book .
if all the authors had legally gifted their comments to humanity , their thoughts could be reproduced in a book and would win wider influence .
top publishers at the fair agree that worldwide sales of printed books remain strong .
peter olson , chief executive of the world 's biggest book publisher , new york-based random house , says there is a digital future but it is not a threat .
sweat-shop labor ?
the concern among authors is that they are becoming low-pay workers in a flourishing industry .
many , such as poets and academics , receive only neglible royalties and mainly publish for the sake of glory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some poets make money off of appearances , not off their books monika rinck , a german poet , says she publishes her poetry on blogs and on the internet and does not expect the publication itself to bring her any income .
instead , she can charge appearance fees for reading the poetry , thanks to her growing reputation .
" i do n't earn income from a book , but rather from my readers , " she explained during the panel discussion .
writers justify free blogs as a way to build a fan community , establish a public personality and explain their thought processes .
open-source or traditional , writers like rinck agree that editors are still essential to select the best writing of the age .
" we 're drowning in yak , and it 's getting harder and harder to hear the insightful voices , " dery said .

" i do n't earn income from a book , but rather from my readers , " she explained during the panel discussion .
writers justify free blogs as a way to build a fan community , establish a public personality and explain their thought processes .
open-source or traditional , writers like rinck agree that editors are still essential to select the best writing of the age .
" we 're drowning in yak , and it 's getting harder and harder to hear the insightful voices , " dery said .

13 , chancellor angela merkel stressed the need for russia and germany to cooperate on international issues .
merkel will meet with russian president putin on sunday in germany . in chancellor angela merkel 's weekly podcast , she said that germany and russia had a " strategic partnership , " and that despite many differences of opinion , the two countries also shared several common positions on topics .
merkel and russian president vladimir putin are scheduled to meet sunday on the sidelines of the petersburg dialogue in the western city of wiesbaden .
the conference began on saturday , oct .
13 and runs through monday .
" i have already had many open , honest and very intensive conversations with president putin and i am pleased that we will be able to do this again , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has not been afraid to engage in tough talk with the russian president she said their discussions on sunday evening would primarily focus on bilateral issues and the relationship between the two countries , but she added that the two would also talk about the situation in iran and the future of kosovo , along with us plans for a missile defense system based in eastern europe , which moscow opposes .
on monday , she and putin will participate in a forum on the closing day of the event , where representatives from the civil societies of both countries will gather .
merkel said such a meeting highlighted the importance of the petersberg dialogue , since " only through exchanges among all groups in our societies can we create strong relationships with one another . "
former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev will take part in the dialogue in his capacity as co-chairman of the forum .
the petersburg dialogue is an regular russian-german conference that set up by putin and previous chancellor gerhard schröder in 2001 to bring the russian and german societies closer together .

putin announced recently that he will lead the slate of candidates for his party , united russia , in duma elections in december and has hinted that he might eventually become russia ’ s prime minister in order to complete the political transformation he launched eight years ago .
this " pseudo-legal putsch , " according to beck , might satisfy strict legal requirements of the constitution , which says a head of state can not run for office for a third term .
but putin 's plan to bend russian law to his will , without breaking it , amounts to a " violence-free coup against the constitution . "
there are concerns that putin might use his party 's likely constitutional majority of 300 seats in the duma to push forward constitutional changes that would reshape russia ’ s political system as a parliamentary-presidential republic .
then the center of power would shift from the presidency to the prime minister ’ s office .

but the losers in this development , at least financially , appear to be the writers . at the frankfurt book fair this week there are books galore by authors no one has ever heard of .
for every millionaire celebrity author , such as jk rowling sitting pretty on a fortune from her seven harry potter novels , there are hundreds of thousands of writers earning just pennies , having to make their living from taxi-driving or teaching .
a us webzine , 10 zen monkeys , did an unscientific survey last week of professional writers - the term was defined to include both book and magazine authors - and found many saying that they were receiving fewer commissions and less income than a decade ago .
the villain , many say , is the internet .
a surfeit of good stuff the web is being criticized for giving a voice to so many millions of people that good writing is no longer scarce .
it 's everywhere .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are more distractions than ever before thanks to the internet one of the surveyed writers , john shirley , observed , " people spend a great deal of time and energy online , time and energy which is then not available for that armchair book . "
the fear among writers is that , according to the old laws of supply and demand , writing is worth less today .
" generation download thinks information wants to be free ... even if some ink-stained wretch wept tears of blood to create it , " wrote mark dery , another contributor .
copyright concerns ?
what 's more , the masses who are blogging or uploading poetry seem unconcerned about that talisman of the traditional writer , copyright .
they 're publishing their essays , diaries , poetry and fiction online with no practical protection against plagiarists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how can one put income in writers ' pockets in the digital age ?
it 's a situation that appals alexander unverzagt , a hamburg , germany copyright lawyer in a panel discussion at the book fair .
he recalled being approached a few weeks ago by an academic who had hosted a blog that attracted a lot of profound comment .
the academic wanted to take 150 of the most superb comments and edit them into a book .
could he do so , without negotiating individual rights contracts with all 150 authors ?
no way , said unverzagt .
every contributor had implicitly granted a licence to use his text for the blog only , but not for another medium such as a book .
" the internet is not a lawless zone , " he said .
the key purpose of the annual , five-day frankfurt book fair is buying and selling the rights to writing , country by country and in all the myriad publication forms , whether as books , film or online .
discussion is growing about whether that is a sensible way to put income in writers ' pockets .
open access a panelist , catharina maracke , also a lawyer , said the hamburg academic should have asked his contributors to sign over some rights from the beginning with a " creative commons " license .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some argue copying from authors in the digital age should be less frowned upon the world creative commons movement - maracke heads its berlin office - is an offshoot of the open-access movement which argues that the legal phobia against copying is a brake on scholarship , science and debate .
obtaining 150 licenses would take more effort than it is worth to publish just one book .
if all the authors had legally gifted their comments to humanity , their thoughts could be reproduced in a book and would win wider influence .
top publishers at the fair agree that worldwide sales of printed books remain strong .
peter olson , chief executive of the world 's biggest book publisher , new york-based random house , says there is a digital future but it is not a threat .
sweat-shop labor ?
the concern among authors is that they are becoming low-pay workers in a flourishing industry .
many , such as poets and academics , receive only neglible royalties and mainly publish for the sake of glory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some poets make money off of appearances , not off their books monika rinck , a german poet , says she publishes her poetry on blogs and on the internet and does not expect the publication itself to bring her any income .
instead , she can charge appearance fees for reading the poetry , thanks to her growing reputation .
" i do n't earn income from a book , but rather from my readers , " she explained during the panel discussion .
writers justify free blogs as a way to build a fan community , establish a public personality and explain their thought processes .
open-source or traditional , writers like rinck agree that editors are still essential to select the best writing of the age .
" we 're drowning in yak , and it 's getting harder and harder to hear the insightful voices , " dery said .

13 , chancellor angela merkel stressed the need for russia and germany to cooperate on international issues .
merkel will meet with russian president putin on sunday in germany . in chancellor angela merkel 's weekly podcast , she said that germany and russia had a " strategic partnership , " and that despite many differences of opinion , the two countries also shared several common positions on topics .
merkel and russian president vladimir putin are scheduled to meet sunday on the sidelines of the petersburg dialogue in the western city of wiesbaden .
the conference began on saturday , oct .
13 and runs through monday .
" i have already had many open , honest and very intensive conversations with president putin and i am pleased that we will be able to do this again , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has not been afraid to engage in tough talk with the russian president she said their discussions on sunday evening would primarily focus on bilateral issues and the relationship between the two countries , but she added that the two would also talk about the situation in iran and the future of kosovo , along with us plans for a missile defense system based in eastern europe , which moscow opposes .
on monday , she and putin will participate in a forum on the closing day of the event , where representatives from the civil societies of both countries will gather .
merkel said such a meeting highlighted the importance of the petersberg dialogue , since " only through exchanges among all groups in our societies can we create strong relationships with one another . "
former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev will take part in the dialogue in his capacity as co-chairman of the forum .
the petersburg dialogue is an regular russian-german conference that set up by putin and previous chancellor gerhard schröder in 2001 to bring the russian and german societies closer together .
greens ' concerns the german greens have called on the government not to stay silent on the issue of russia 's democratic deficit .
the human rights spokesperson of the party , volker beck , told chancellor merkel on saturday that she should warn putin about " bending the russian constitution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spa hotel in wiesbaden where the petersburg dialogue will take place he said kremlin plans to keep putin in power constitute a " renewed , grave step backwards for democracy in russia " and that before elections on dec .
2 , a changing of positions could take place that could lead to putin again being president of the russian federation within a few months .
putin announced recently that he will lead the slate of candidates for his party , united russia , in duma elections in december and has hinted that he might eventually become russia ’ s prime minister in order to complete the political transformation he launched eight years ago .
this " pseudo-legal putsch , " according to beck , might satisfy strict legal requirements of the constitution , which says a head of state can not run for office for a third term .

on monday , she and putin will participate in a forum on the closing day of the event , where representatives from the civil societies of both countries will gather .
merkel said such a meeting highlighted the importance of the petersberg dialogue , since " only through exchanges among all groups in our societies can we create strong relationships with one another . "
former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev will take part in the dialogue in his capacity as co-chairman of the forum .
the petersburg dialogue is an regular russian-german conference that set up by putin and previous chancellor gerhard schröder in 2001 to bring the russian and german societies closer together .
greens ' concerns the german greens have called on the government not to stay silent on the issue of russia 's democratic deficit .
the human rights spokesperson of the party , volker beck , told chancellor merkel on saturday that she should warn putin about " bending the russian constitution . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the spa hotel in wiesbaden where the petersburg dialogue will take place he said kremlin plans to keep putin in power constitute a " renewed , grave step backwards for democracy in russia " and that before elections on dec .
2 , a changing of positions could take place that could lead to putin again being president of the russian federation within a few months .
putin announced recently that he will lead the slate of candidates for his party , united russia , in duma elections in december and has hinted that he might eventually become russia ’ s prime minister in order to complete the political transformation he launched eight years ago .
this " pseudo-legal putsch , " according to beck , might satisfy strict legal requirements of the constitution , which says a head of state can not run for office for a third term .
but putin 's plan to bend russian law to his will , without breaking it , amounts to a " violence-free coup against the constitution . "
there are concerns that putin might use his party 's likely constitutional majority of 300 seats in the duma to push forward constitutional changes that would reshape russia ’ s political system as a parliamentary-presidential republic .
then the center of power would shift from the presidency to the prime minister ’ s office .
or , even if putin did not tinker with the constitution , he could simply become russia 's de facto leader as prime minister . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how can one put income in writers ' pockets in the digital age ?
it 's a situation that appals alexander unverzagt , a hamburg , germany copyright lawyer in a panel discussion at the book fair .
he recalled being approached a few weeks ago by an academic who had hosted a blog that attracted a lot of profound comment .
the academic wanted to take 150 of the most superb comments and edit them into a book .
could he do so , without negotiating individual rights contracts with all 150 authors ?
no way , said unverzagt .
every contributor had implicitly granted a licence to use his text for the blog only , but not for another medium such as a book .
" the internet is not a lawless zone , " he said .
the key purpose of the annual , five-day frankfurt book fair is buying and selling the rights to writing , country by country and in all the myriad publication forms , whether as books , film or online .
discussion is growing about whether that is a sensible way to put income in writers ' pockets .

obtaining 150 licenses would take more effort than it is worth to publish just one book .
if all the authors had legally gifted their comments to humanity , their thoughts could be reproduced in a book and would win wider influence .

13 , chancellor angela merkel stressed the need for russia and germany to cooperate on international issues .
merkel will meet with russian president putin on sunday in germany . in chancellor angela merkel 's weekly podcast , she said that germany and russia had a " strategic partnership , " and that despite many differences of opinion , the two countries also shared several common positions on topics .
merkel and russian president vladimir putin are scheduled to meet sunday on the sidelines of the petersburg dialogue in the western city of wiesbaden .
the conference began on saturday , oct .
13 and runs through monday .
" i have already had many open , honest and very intensive conversations with president putin and i am pleased that we will be able to do this again , " she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has not been afraid to engage in tough talk with the russian president she said their discussions on sunday evening would primarily focus on bilateral issues and the relationship between the two countries , but she added that the two would also talk about the situation in iran and the future of kosovo , along with us plans for a missile defense system based in eastern europe , which moscow opposes .
on monday , she and putin will participate in a forum on the closing day of the event , where representatives from the civil societies of both countries will gather .
merkel said such a meeting highlighted the importance of the petersberg dialogue , since " only through exchanges among all groups in our societies can we create strong relationships with one another . "
former soviet leader mikhail gorbachev will take part in the dialogue in his capacity as co-chairman of the forum .
the petersburg dialogue is an regular russian-german conference that set up by putin and previous chancellor gerhard schröder in 2001 to bring the russian and german societies closer together .

2 , a changing of positions could take place that could lead to putin again being president of the russian federation within a few months .
putin announced recently that he will lead the slate of candidates for his party , united russia , in duma elections in december and has hinted that he might eventually become russia ’ s prime minister in order to complete the political transformation he launched eight years ago .
this " pseudo-legal putsch , " according to beck , might satisfy strict legal requirements of the constitution , which says a head of state can not run for office for a third term .
but putin 's plan to bend russian law to his will , without breaking it , amounts to a " violence-free coup against the constitution . "
there are concerns that putin might use his party 's likely constitutional majority of 300 seats in the duma to push forward constitutional changes that would reshape russia ’ s political system as a parliamentary-presidential republic .
then the center of power would shift from the presidency to the prime minister ’ s office .

but the losers in this development , at least financially , appear to be the writers . at the frankfurt book fair this week there are books galore by authors no one has ever heard of .
for every millionaire celebrity author , such as jk rowling sitting pretty on a fortune from her seven harry potter novels , there are hundreds of thousands of writers earning just pennies , having to make their living from taxi-driving or teaching .
a us webzine , 10 zen monkeys , did an unscientific survey last week of professional writers - the term was defined to include both book and magazine authors - and found many saying that they were receiving fewer commissions and less income than a decade ago .
the villain , many say , is the internet .
a surfeit of good stuff the web is being criticized for giving a voice to so many millions of people that good writing is no longer scarce .
it 's everywhere .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are more distractions than ever before thanks to the internet one of the surveyed writers , john shirley , observed , " people spend a great deal of time and energy online , time and energy which is then not available for that armchair book . "
the fear among writers is that , according to the old laws of supply and demand , writing is worth less today .
" generation download thinks information wants to be free ... even if some ink-stained wretch wept tears of blood to create it , " wrote mark dery , another contributor .
copyright concerns ?
what 's more , the masses who are blogging or uploading poetry seem unconcerned about that talisman of the traditional writer , copyright .
they 're publishing their essays , diaries , poetry and fiction online with no practical protection against plagiarists .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : how can one put income in writers ' pockets in the digital age ?
it 's a situation that appals alexander unverzagt , a hamburg , germany copyright lawyer in a panel discussion at the book fair .
he recalled being approached a few weeks ago by an academic who had hosted a blog that attracted a lot of profound comment .
the academic wanted to take 150 of the most superb comments and edit them into a book .
could he do so , without negotiating individual rights contracts with all 150 authors ?
no way , said unverzagt .
every contributor had implicitly granted a licence to use his text for the blog only , but not for another medium such as a book .
" the internet is not a lawless zone , " he said .
the key purpose of the annual , five-day frankfurt book fair is buying and selling the rights to writing , country by country and in all the myriad publication forms , whether as books , film or online .
discussion is growing about whether that is a sensible way to put income in writers ' pockets .
open access a panelist , catharina maracke , also a lawyer , said the hamburg academic should have asked his contributors to sign over some rights from the beginning with a " creative commons " license .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some argue copying from authors in the digital age should be less frowned upon the world creative commons movement - maracke heads its berlin office - is an offshoot of the open-access movement which argues that the legal phobia against copying is a brake on scholarship , science and debate .
obtaining 150 licenses would take more effort than it is worth to publish just one book .
if all the authors had legally gifted their comments to humanity , their thoughts could be reproduced in a book and would win wider influence .
top publishers at the fair agree that worldwide sales of printed books remain strong .
peter olson , chief executive of the world 's biggest book publisher , new york-based random house , says there is a digital future but it is not a threat .
sweat-shop labor ?
the concern among authors is that they are becoming low-pay workers in a flourishing industry .
many , such as poets and academics , receive only neglible royalties and mainly publish for the sake of glory .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some poets make money off of appearances , not off their books monika rinck , a german poet , says she publishes her poetry on blogs and on the internet and does not expect the publication itself to bring her any income .
instead , she can charge appearance fees for reading the poetry , thanks to her growing reputation .
" i do n't earn income from a book , but rather from my readers , " she explained during the panel discussion .
writers justify free blogs as a way to build a fan community , establish a public personality and explain their thought processes .
open-source or traditional , writers like rinck agree that editors are still essential to select the best writing of the age .
" we 're drowning in yak , and it 's getting harder and harder to hear the insightful voices , " dery said .

the conservative leader spoke to senior officers from the los angeles police department , the city 's mayor , antonia villaraigosa , and former gang members .
earlier in his trip he met california governor arnold schwarzenegger .
mr cameron said the city was trying to deal with similar issues as those faced in the uk and he was looking at what could be learned from their strategies .
on the three day trip mr cameron also saw an educational project for people from deprived backgrounds , designed to try to prevent them joining gangs .
gang violence rising los angeles has had a major problem with gangs for decades and is one of the crime capitals of the world .
in the 1970s rival gangs the bloods and the crips terrorised neighbourhoods in the south of the city .
today , dozens of gangs operate with hundreds of members and police say more then half of all murders in the city are gang-related .
last year , gang violence rose by 14 % . "
i think this is a place to come to understand how bad problems can get with gangs and understand what the police and other authorities can do to deal with that " david cameron conservative leader mr cameron said the uk could learn from the authorities in los angeles but acknowledged the uk did not have problems on the same scale .
" i think this is a place to come to understand how bad problems can get with gangs and understand what the police and other authorities can do to deal with that , " he said .
" our problem in the uk is not as bad as in the us , of course it is n't .
" but it is getting worse and we need to know what works , what we can get the police to do and what we can get society to do and families to do to make sure we deal with our gang problem and deal with it now . "
new measures on thursday , mr cameron 's talks with mr schwarzenegger focused on guns and gangs , along with the environment .
earlier this week mr schwarzenegger unveiled new measures designed to bring down levels of gang violence .
he gave judges the power to order parents of gang members to attend anti-violence classes .
another new law will make it easier to have gang members evicted if they are caught with a weapon in apartment buildings used as hang-outs .
mr cameron has been seeking closer links with mr schwarzenegger for some time .
the former film star was invited to address the conservative party conference in blackpool earlier this month but could not appear in person due to political commitments .
speaking to the guardian ahead of his flight home to the uk on friday evening , mr cameron said he hoped to emulate the governor .
" my wife said to me : ' how are you going to explain to an american audience what sort of conservative you are ? '
i said ' i 'll say look at me and think of arnold schwarzenegger ' . "
mr cameron added : " he 's a very impressive politician .
he 's achieved huge amounts in california because he 's had to work with a democratic legislature , so he 's very good at making compromises , making deals , getting things done .
" his analysis of us politics is very sharp . "

" i think this is a place to come to understand how bad problems can get with gangs and understand what the police and other authorities can do to deal with that , " he said .
" our problem in the uk is not as bad as in the us , of course it is n't .

earlier this week mr schwarzenegger unveiled new measures designed to bring down levels of gang violence .
he gave judges the power to order parents of gang members to attend anti-violence classes .
another new law will make it easier to have gang members evicted if they are caught with a weapon in apartment buildings used as hang-outs .
mr cameron says he shares a vision with the california governor mr cameron has been seeking closer links with mr schwarzenegger for some time .
the former film star was invited to address the conservative party conference in blackpool earlier this month but could not appear in person due to political commitments .

" my wife said to me : ' how are you going to explain to an american audience what sort of conservative you are ? '
i said ' i 'll say look at me and think of arnold schwarzenegger ' . "
mr cameron added : " he 's a very impressive politician .
he 's achieved huge amounts in california because he 's had to work with a democratic legislature , so he 's very good at making compromises , making deals , getting things done .
" his analysis of us politics is very sharp . "

it said their monitoring of the problem might not be as good as that found in the gwent and south wales forces .
north wales police said it had played a comprehensive and active role in protecting victims of the sex trade .
the force said it was " disappointing " amnesty international had not properly researched the local situation .
the report called under the covers , discusses the difficulties police face in identifying sex trafficking victims , and gives examples of unverified cases in north wales .
it also recommends that a refuge for trafficked women is set up in wales . "
victims often originate from countries where the police are corrupt and can not be trusted .
these fears greatly influence the behaviour and statements of victims " amnesty international report the human rights charity said it was compiled to provide a " snapshot " of the extent of the issue in wales .
it researched crime records and interviewed police outreach workers and professionals with knowledge of the sex industry to estimate the extent of the problem in wales .
the report estimated that there are around 60 women at any one time in cardiff who have been trafficked for the sex trade .
it also found smaller but " significant " numbers of trafficked women in swansea and newport .
evidence of small numbers of trafficked women in small communities in north wales were uncovered too .
the report 's authors researched the work of police in north wales during operation pentameter , a national crackdown on human trafficking in 2006 .
summary of findings in the previous two years , 18 women from overseas had been removed from brothels in wales and 12 of these had been confirmed as victims of trafficking most of the women found had been from the far east , aged between 18 and 40 six people had been convicted of trafficking for sexual exploitation in wales since 2004 since march 2003 , five women from overseas have been referred to a project in london source : under the covers , trafficking for sexual exploitation in wales , amnesty international as part of the operation , more than 40 police officers searched a number of properties in rhuddlan , penmaenmawr , cemaes bay , llanrhuddlad and colwyn bay .
six people were arrested but released pending further enquiries .
but three 18-year-old women from china , malaysia and namibia who were found to be working as prostitutes by north wales police , were released from covert police premises after 10 hours .
they refused services and told police they believed they had not been trafficked .
amnesty said it was not known where they went or whether they were still working as prostitutes .
the women had not been arrested and were offered food , clothes , translators and health checks .
the amnesty report found that while police had been trying to help the women , it pointed out that victims of trafficking were hard to identify because of threats made to them and their families by traffickers .
" moreover , victims often originate from countries where the police are corrupt and can not be trusted , " the report said .
" these fears greatly influence the behaviour and statements of victims , even after they have been removed from traffickers ' control . "
the report said the case involving the three 18-year-olds suggested that improved training , a clearer understanding of victim identification and the implementation of national guidelines could help ensure that victims received support .
' protecting victims ' chief supt chris corcoran of north wales police said : " it is disappointing that amnesty international has not properly researched the local situation nor approached the force before making its criticisms .
" north wales police has played a comprehensive and active role in protecting victims of the sex trade and dealing with those who prey on them . "
an amnesty international spokeswoman said the charity had been in consultation with north wales police , along with other forces across wales .
she said : " we do feel that all police forces in wales would benefit from enhanced guidance on this matter and we also know that the police are happy to support our call to ensure that there is better support for victims . "

north wales police said it had played a comprehensive and active role in protecting victims of the sex trade .
the force said it was " disappointing " amnesty international had not properly researched the local situation .

victims often originate from countries where the police are corrupt and can not be trusted .
these fears greatly influence the behaviour and statements of victims amnesty international report the human rights charity said it was compiled to provide a " snapshot " of the extent of the issue in wales .
it researched crime records and interviewed police outreach workers and professionals with knowledge of the sex industry to estimate the extent of the problem in wales .
the report estimated that there are around 60 women at any one time in cardiff who have been trafficked for the sex trade .
it also found smaller but " significant " numbers of trafficked women in swansea and newport .

but three 18-year-old women from china , malaysia and namibia who were found to be working as prostitutes by north wales police , were released from covert police premises after 10 hours .
they refused services and told police they believed they had not been trafficked .
amnesty said it was not known where they went or whether they were still working as prostitutes .
the women had not been arrested and were offered food , clothes , translators and health checks .
the amnesty report found that while police had been trying to help the women , it pointed out that victims of trafficking were hard to identify because of threats made to them and their families by traffickers .

" these fears greatly influence the behaviour and statements of victims , even after they have been removed from traffickers ' control . "

robert peston blog an agreement has been reached that could lead to an end to strike action by postal workers .
the breakthrough came late on friday after marathon talks between royal mail and the communication workers ' union at the tuc in london .
details are yet to be announced , but it is hoped the deal will end the dispute , which centres on pay , pensions and flexible working .
the terms reached will be considered by the union 's executive on monday .
the deal was ratified by royal mail boss adam crozier , communication workers ' union -lrb- cwu -rrb- general secretary billy hayes and his deputy dave ward , and tuc general secretary brendan barber .
if it is supported by the executive , it is likely to be put to the vote by the cwu 's 130,000 members .
it is hoped the resolution will bring to an end the long-running row over royal mail 's modernisation plans , which union officials had feared would see 40,000 jobs lost .
injunction bbc business editor robert peston said the " big pillars " of management demands were in place , including pension fund reform , a pay rise this year of around 2.5 % and the reform of working practices .
however , he added : " i do n't think that the company has got it all its own way " .
earlier on friday , the royal mail was granted an injunction to stop cwu members at sorting centres and delivery offices striking next week .
the company argued that the union had not given accurate figures for the number of staff affected by the strike - a legal requirement .
planned 24-hour strikes 15 october from 1800bst : mail sorting offices and airports 16 october from 0300bst : deliveries and collection hubs 17 october from 1200bst : royal mail drivers 18 october from 1200bst : manual data entry centres 18 october from 1400bst : heathrow world distribution centre source : cwu the union insisted the strike was legitimate .
the cwu had announced rolling 24-hour strikes to start on monday and end on friday , designed to cause maximum disruption to mail services with minimal financial loss for its members .
the injunction did not apply to all parts of the royal mail , and in the wake of friday 's agreement it was not clear whether some groups , such as drivers , would take part in the walkouts .
thousands of royal mail customers across britain have suffered from disruption since official protests by workers began in june .
stephen alambritis of the federation of small businesses said : " for britain 's four million small businesses it is good news .
" they 've been shelling out an extra five million pounds a day to use alternative services . "
wildcat walkouts royal mail has insisted it needs to modernise to survive as a business in the highly competitive mail industry , while union leaders have argued that its plans have no regard for its employees .
areas under dispute have included pay and pensions , with the cwu saying a pay rise came with unacceptable strings attached , and the royal mail wanting to scrap its final salary pension scheme and raise the retirement age .
some working practices are also under dispute , such as workers being allowed to go home before their shift has ended if they have completed their designated workload unofficial strikes over shift times have affected deliveries in london , glasgow , edinburgh and liverpool .
the wildcat protests which began on wednesday have been called off in scotland while some workers in london and liverpool have not gone back to work .
workers at all 21 delivery depots across liverpool walked out , with cwu branch representative mark walsh saying staff felt they were being " being bullied into having their contract changed " .
have your say " the postal workers need to start work again now " chris , durham send us your comments but royal mail condemned the mass walkouts , saying they were " wholly unacceptable " and not supported by the cwu nationally .
postal workers in east , south-west and south-east london also went back to the picket lines over the dispute .
and staff in edinburgh and grangemouth walked out over pay deductions following recent official action .
despite calls from mps to intervene in the dispute , the government has said it will not take action .

the cwu had announced rolling 24-hour strikes to start on monday and end on friday , designed to cause maximum disruption to mail services with minimal financial loss for its members .

at a meeting at aintree racecourse on friday , 800 merseyside staff voted to reject proposals to return to work .
mark walsh , from the communication workers union -lrb- cwu -rrb- , said : " the result is a resounding no vote . "
meanwhile , a deal to end the national dispute is being put to the union 's executive on monday .
legal action mr walsh said : " it is something i have to say , in 20 years of being involved in the trade union i have never seen anything like it in my life .
" there was not a hand from any man or woman in the room to return to work .
i hope it does not come to legal action . "
the wildcat walkout , prompted by a row over shift patterns , began on wednesday after the end of the official strike .
the cwu has claimed royal mail in liverpool has refused to renegotiate on shift times .
nationally , the union and the royal mail struck a deal late on friday night and sources said they believed the deal will be accepted .
the royal mail obtained a high court injunction on friday to prevent strikes going ahead on monday and tuesday .
