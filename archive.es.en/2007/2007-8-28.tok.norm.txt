" here the turbulences in financial markets may have played a role . " germany has borne the brunt of the european fallout from problems stemming from sub-prime us home loans .
earlier in the month , germany 's sachsen lb bank and ikb bank almost collapsed , requiring major bailouts . in an interview with deutsche welle , the director of the hamburg world economic institute , thomas straubhaar , said that although the us home loans crisis had hit some institutions hard , germany 's " positive employment market " was strong enough to maintain the current business climate .
" the business climate is still robust , " straubhaar said .
" employment will continue to develop strongly , and the number of unemployed could fall to around the three million mark , potentially even lower . "
exports expected to drop ifo said the six-month outlook had weakened in the manufacturing sector and it also reported a fall in the business climate for exports , the motor of europe 's biggest economy . " the optimism has also faded for the export business , despite the euro 's decline in value , " ifo president sinn said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany primarily exports manufactured goods and machine tools " employment will also rise according to companies ' plans but somewhat less robustly than foreseen in recent months . " in construction , the decline in the business climate index evident since the beginning of the year continued in august after the interruption in july . the business climate in wholesaling has stabilized .
the firms assessed their current situation slightly more pessimistically than in july , however with regard to the six-month outlook they are somewhat more optimistic . for its monthly index , ifo surveys some 7,000 companies across various sectors about their assessment of the current business climate and their expectation for the next six months . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that leaves germany as the only european contender in a field of four . buoyed by the success of the 2006 men 's world cup , germany is hoping to host another soccer celebration with women athletes in four year 's time .
german chancellor angela merkel , herself a big fan of the beautiful game , has thrown her weight behind the bid , and france 's decision to remove its hat from the ring has given germany 's chances an additional lift .
" we are very grateful to our friends in the french soccer federation for their pledge to support the german bid for the 2011 women 's world cup , " german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger said in a statement .
germany is now up against australia , canada and peru for the right to host the event .
soccer 's world governing authority fifa will announce the winner on oct .
30 in zurich , switzerland .
past history , new impulses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach theune-meyer says germany 's bid is good for the women 's game the european soccer federation uefa has eight of the 24 votes in the fifa executive , and germany can base its case on its successful hosting of the men 's event last summer .
the german women 's team won the last world cup in 2003 , and some argue that it would be good for the sport , if the 2011 event were held in a powerhouse soccer nation .
" germany would definitely make a good host nation and it would benefit women 's football , " germany coach tina theune-meyer said in an interview for fifa 's web site .
" we 'd be talking about public viewing again , too .
a world cup in germany would naturally add a new impulse to our already positive development . "

" we are very grateful to our friends in the french soccer federation for their pledge to support the german bid for the 2011 women 's world cup , " german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger said in a statement .
germany is now up against australia , canada and peru for the right to host the event .
soccer 's world governing authority fifa will announce the winner on oct .

past history , new impulses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : coach theune-meyer says germany 's bid is good for the women 's game the european soccer federation uefa has eight of the 24 votes in the fifa executive , and germany can base its case on its successful hosting of the men 's event last summer .
the german women 's team won the last world cup in 2003 , and some argue that it would be good for the sport , if the 2011 event were held in a powerhouse soccer nation .
" germany would definitely make a good host nation and it would benefit women 's football , " germany coach tina theune-meyer said in an interview for fifa 's web site .
" we 'd be talking about public viewing again , too .
a world cup in germany would naturally add a new impulse to our already positive development . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popularity of women 's professional leagues has also be on the rise canada could be germany 's strongest competitor - despite the fact that its neighbour , the united states , has hosted the past two of women 's world cups .
the 2007 cup is taking place in china in september .
" i think it would n't be too much to have three of four world cups in north america , fifa president sepp blatter has told the edmonton sun newspaper .
" a bid from canada is absolutely possible for 2011 from fifa 's point of view . "
the popularity of women 's soccer has been growing steadily in recent years , and fifa estimates that by the year 2010 as many women as men will be playing the sport . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the outlook for the coming six months is still marked by optimism . in its monthly survey released on tuesday , the ifo institute for economic research 's business climate index dropped for the third month in a row in august , edging down to 105.2 points from 106.4 points in july . the munich-based ifo said turbulence on world financial markets in recent weeks had probably clouded executives ' mood although they were generally optimistic about the economic upswing in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 17.3 billion-euro -lrb- $ 23.3 billion -rrb- rescue of sachsen lb was the second bail-out a german bank " the outlook for the coming six months is still marked by optimism , albeit somewhat weaker , " ifo president hans-werner sinn said in a press release .
" here the turbulences in financial markets may have played a role . " germany has borne the brunt of the european fallout from problems stemming from sub-prime us home loans .
earlier in the month , germany 's sachsen lb bank and ikb bank almost collapsed , requiring major bailouts . in an interview with deutsche welle , the director of the hamburg world economic institute , thomas straubhaar , said that although the us home loans crisis had hit some institutions hard , germany 's " positive employment market " was strong enough to maintain the current business climate .
" the business climate is still robust , " straubhaar said .
" employment will continue to develop strongly , and the number of unemployed could fall to around the three million mark , potentially even lower . "
exports expected to drop ifo said the six-month outlook had weakened in the manufacturing sector and it also reported a fall in the business climate for exports , the motor of europe 's biggest economy . " the optimism has also faded for the export business , despite the euro 's decline in value , " ifo president sinn said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany primarily exports manufactured goods and machine tools " employment will also rise according to companies ' plans but somewhat less robustly than foreseen in recent months . " in construction , the decline in the business climate index evident since the beginning of the year continued in august after the interruption in july . the business climate in wholesaling has stabilized .
the firms assessed their current situation slightly more pessimistically than in july , however with regard to the six-month outlook they are somewhat more optimistic . for its monthly index , ifo surveys some 7,000 companies across various sectors about their assessment of the current business climate and their expectation for the next six months . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

abdullah gül was elected turkey 's next president on tuesday .
but calls by prime minister erdogan for gül 's critics to give up their citizenship have the media wondering what direction turkey will take . prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has come under sharp criticism for calling on turks who refuse to accept former islamist abdullah gül 's presidency to leave the country .
the turkish parliament on tuesday elected the current foreign minister as the country 's next president . gül had failed in an attempt to win the presidency earlier this year . " those -lrb- turks -rrb- who do not recognize abdullah gül as their president should give up their turkish citizenship , " erdogan said in an interview with television station kanal d. erdogan was commenting on an article by the prominent columnist bekir coskun from turkey 's largest daily hürriyet .
coskun had written that gül 's presidency would mean the end of the secular state in turkey - a fear shared by the country 's secular elite . " gül will not be my president , " coskun wrote last week .
erdogan 's ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- nominated gül for the presidency . government terror ? after the akp victory in general elections on july 22 , erdogan had promised to be " everyone 's prime minister . "
many observers had hoped he would embrace the highly polarized society as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister abdullah gül will become the country 's next president yet according to yüksel isik from the progressive journalists association , the prime minister 's statement showed that press freedom was still a major challenge in turkey . " the prime minister is taking an exclusionary stance against a prominent journalist , bekir coskun , as if he is ' the other ' , " isik said .
" if local governors follow the prime minister 's behavior and try to pressure journalists in local regions , this would mean the total terrorization of turkey by this government . " in a separate move , the mass circulation hürriyet fired columnist emin cölasan last week , who is known for his highly critical articles on the akp-led government .
according to isik , these events showed that the problem of press freedom was more serious than it appeared . " many of our journalist colleagues have been fired without any just cause , only for their criticism of governmental policies , " isik said . harming turkey 's eu ambitions ? lucio leante has been working in turkey since 2001 for the italian ansa news agency .
he said he thinks that critical journalists such as cölasan are fired because of intricate relations between media owners and the government . the interests of hürriyet publisher the dogan group with the government could have influenced the paper 's management to fire cölasan , leante said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's position towards the press does not conform to eu standards " we ca n't prove it , but the dogan group 's many businesses and links with the state is limiting freedom of press , " leante said . leante added that erdogan 's inability to endure criticism played an important role in stifling the press .
yet despite the prime minister 's harsh attitude toward journalists , cartoon artists and publishers , there was still support for him and his party for turkey 's ambitions to join the european union .
according to leante , western nations were putting turkey to the test . " i think turkey is going on an experiment in which international circles want to see if a moderate islamic conservative party like the akp can be permanently moderate and democratic , " leante said . he said that some western countries believed this " experiment " could serve as a kind of model for other countries in the middle east .
but he said he thought this was risky . " political islam is a contradiction in itself , " leante said .
" it is difficult for islam to prove itself democratic and moderate because political islam means extending religion to state problems . " for turkey 's journalists , the big question now is whether the islamist-rooted akp will use its majority power to continue criticizing the press or to open itself up to different views . berivan orucoglu -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

abdullah gül was elected turkey 's next president on tuesday .
but calls by prime minister erdogan for gül 's critics to give up their citizenship have the media wondering what direction turkey will take . prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has come under sharp criticism for calling on turks who refuse to accept former islamist abdullah gül 's presidency to leave the country .
the turkish parliament on tuesday elected the current foreign minister as the country 's next president . gül had failed in an attempt to win the presidency earlier this year . " those -lrb- turks -rrb- who do not recognize abdullah gül as their president should give up their turkish citizenship , " erdogan said in an interview with television station kanal d. erdogan was commenting on an article by the prominent columnist bekir coskun from turkey 's largest daily hürriyet .
coskun had written that gül 's presidency would mean the end of the secular state in turkey - a fear shared by the country 's secular elite . " gül will not be my president , " coskun wrote last week .
erdogan 's ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- nominated gül for the presidency . government terror ? after the akp victory in general elections on july 22 , erdogan had promised to be " everyone 's prime minister . "
many observers had hoped he would embrace the highly polarized society as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister abdullah gül will become the country 's next president yet according to yüksel isik from the progressive journalists association , the prime minister 's statement showed that press freedom was still a major challenge in turkey . " the prime minister is taking an exclusionary stance against a prominent journalist , bekir coskun , as if he is ' the other ' , " isik said .
" if local governors follow the prime minister 's behavior and try to pressure journalists in local regions , this would mean the total terrorization of turkey by this government . " in a separate move , the mass circulation hürriyet fired columnist emin cölasan last week , who is known for his highly critical articles on the akp-led government .
according to isik , these events showed that the problem of press freedom was more serious than it appeared . " many of our journalist colleagues have been fired without any just cause , only for their criticism of governmental policies , " isik said . harming turkey 's eu ambitions ? lucio leante has been working in turkey since 2001 for the italian ansa news agency .
he said he thinks that critical journalists such as cölasan are fired because of intricate relations between media owners and the government . the interests of hürriyet publisher the dogan group with the government could have influenced the paper 's management to fire cölasan , leante said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's position towards the press does not conform to eu standards " we ca n't prove it , but the dogan group 's many businesses and links with the state is limiting freedom of press , " leante said . leante added that erdogan 's inability to endure criticism played an important role in stifling the press .
yet despite the prime minister 's harsh attitude toward journalists , cartoon artists and publishers , there was still support for him and his party for turkey 's ambitions to join the european union .
according to leante , western nations were putting turkey to the test . " i think turkey is going on an experiment in which international circles want to see if a moderate islamic conservative party like the akp can be permanently moderate and democratic , " leante said . he said that some western countries believed this " experiment " could serve as a kind of model for other countries in the middle east .
but he said he thought this was risky . " political islam is a contradiction in itself , " leante said .
" it is difficult for islam to prove itself democratic and moderate because political islam means extending religion to state problems . " for turkey 's journalists , the big question now is whether the islamist-rooted akp will use its majority power to continue criticizing the press or to open itself up to different views . berivan orucoglu -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the calls for caution arise from fears the politicians will suffer an embarrassing defeat as they did in 2003 , when the constitutional court , based in the city of karlsruhe , rejected a case put forward jointly by both houses of parliament .
since pictures of the eight indian beaten up at mügeln were flashed around the world , other racist attacks have been reported , revealing a drift to the violent right among those youths that see themselves as left out of germany 's once-again rising prosperity .
" studies show that xenophobia , anti-semitism and contempt for the person are on the rise , " the berliner zeitung commented tuesday .
all mainstream politicians abhor the npd -lrb- german national democratic party -rrb- , which garnered only 1.6 per cent of the vote in the 2005 parliamentary elections and thus is excluded from the national parliament , although it has seats in the parliaments of two eastern states .
" i believe that even those skeptical -lrb- of a renewed banning attempt -rrb- regard the npd as unconstitutional , " spd home affairs parliamentary spokesman dieter wiefelspütz told reporters tuesday .
spd seemingly ignoring previous failed attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court threw out the last case but securing a ban under germany 's democratic constitution - which strenuously guards freedom of speech - is another matter .
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- parliamentary caucus , believes that parliament faces " another gigantic embarrassment " if it tries again .
the main problem lies in the numerous undercover agents operating within the npd to monitor its activities .
the activities of these agents - one of them reached the top of the hierarchy and is said to have authored an anti-semitic pamphlet - led the constitutional court to throw the case out in the preliminary stages four years ago .
" it was one of the bitterest defeats that the politicians have ever been handed by karlsruhe - and it was their own fault , " the berliner zeitung commented .
lengthy process could endanger police operations one person well placed to know about the undercover agents , cdu interior minister wolfgang schaüble , warns of " great procedural risk . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police infiltrators would be at risk during a court ruling the legal process leading up to a constitutional court ruling could take years , experts warn .
police and the special authority charged with the protection of the constitution are reported to be aghast at the prospect of having to withdraw their undercover agents for as long as this .
but wiefelspütz is adamant that parliament should try again .
" i call on all parties to engage in a debate over how this can be achieved , " he says .
case to ban npd " doomed to failure " say greens the spd , currently the junior partner in merkel 's grand coalition , finds itself alone on this issue , with even their former partner in government , the greens , opposed .
the problem of rightwing extremism will not be resolved by a legal process that is in any case doomed to failure , the party warns .
" their members would still be there and would look for new organizational structures .
much more important are initiatives in civil society against the dissemination of rightwing ideology , " greens parliamentary spokesman volker beck says .
instead , the party blames merkel 's government for fiscal cutbacks that have helped return the budget to balance but have closed down many social programs .
" the federal government has to demonstrate that it can do something else besides push through cuts , " beck says . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

abdullah gül was elected turkey 's next president on tuesday .
but calls by prime minister erdogan for gül 's critics to give up their citizenship have the media wondering what direction turkey will take . prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has come under sharp criticism for calling on turks who refuse to accept former islamist abdullah gül 's presidency to leave the country .
the turkish parliament on tuesday elected the current foreign minister as the country 's next president . gül had failed in an attempt to win the presidency earlier this year . " those -lrb- turks -rrb- who do not recognize abdullah gül as their president should give up their turkish citizenship , " erdogan said in an interview with television station kanal d. erdogan was commenting on an article by the prominent columnist bekir coskun from turkey 's largest daily hürriyet .
coskun had written that gül 's presidency would mean the end of the secular state in turkey - a fear shared by the country 's secular elite . " gül will not be my president , " coskun wrote last week .
erdogan 's ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- nominated gül for the presidency . government terror ? after the akp victory in general elections on july 22 , erdogan had promised to be " everyone 's prime minister . "
many observers had hoped he would embrace the highly polarized society as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister abdullah gül will become the country 's next president yet according to yüksel isik from the progressive journalists association , the prime minister 's statement showed that press freedom was still a major challenge in turkey . " the prime minister is taking an exclusionary stance against a prominent journalist , bekir coskun , as if he is ' the other ' , " isik said .
" if local governors follow the prime minister 's behavior and try to pressure journalists in local regions , this would mean the total terrorization of turkey by this government . " in a separate move , the mass circulation hürriyet fired columnist emin cölasan last week , who is known for his highly critical articles on the akp-led government .
according to isik , these events showed that the problem of press freedom was more serious than it appeared . " many of our journalist colleagues have been fired without any just cause , only for their criticism of governmental policies , " isik said . harming turkey 's eu ambitions ? lucio leante has been working in turkey since 2001 for the italian ansa news agency .
he said he thinks that critical journalists such as cölasan are fired because of intricate relations between media owners and the government . the interests of hürriyet publisher the dogan group with the government could have influenced the paper 's management to fire cölasan , leante said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's position towards the press does not conform to eu standards " we ca n't prove it , but the dogan group 's many businesses and links with the state is limiting freedom of press , " leante said . leante added that erdogan 's inability to endure criticism played an important role in stifling the press .
yet despite the prime minister 's harsh attitude toward journalists , cartoon artists and publishers , there was still support for him and his party for turkey 's ambitions to join the european union .
according to leante , western nations were putting turkey to the test . " i think turkey is going on an experiment in which international circles want to see if a moderate islamic conservative party like the akp can be permanently moderate and democratic , " leante said . he said that some western countries believed this " experiment " could serve as a kind of model for other countries in the middle east .
but he said he thought this was risky . " political islam is a contradiction in itself , " leante said .
" it is difficult for islam to prove itself democratic and moderate because political islam means extending religion to state problems . " for turkey 's journalists , the big question now is whether the islamist-rooted akp will use its majority power to continue criticizing the press or to open itself up to different views . berivan orucoglu -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that leaves germany as the only european contender in a field of four . buoyed by the success of the 2006 men 's world cup , germany is hoping to host another soccer celebration with women athletes in four year 's time .
german chancellor angela merkel , herself a big fan of the beautiful game , has thrown her weight behind the bid , and france 's decision to remove its hat from the ring has given germany 's chances an additional lift .
" we are very grateful to our friends in the french soccer federation for their pledge to support the german bid for the 2011 women 's world cup , " german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger said in a statement .
germany is now up against australia , canada and peru for the right to host the event .

the german women 's team won the last world cup in 2003 , and some argue that it would be good for the sport , if the 2011 event were held in a powerhouse soccer nation .
" germany would definitely make a good host nation and it would benefit women 's football , " germany coach tina theune-meyer said in an interview for fifa 's web site .
" we 'd be talking about public viewing again , too .
a world cup in germany would naturally add a new impulse to our already positive development . "

" i think it would n't be too much to have three of four world cups in north america , fifa president sepp blatter has told the edmonton sun newspaper .
" a bid from canada is absolutely possible for 2011 from fifa 's point of view . "
the popularity of women 's soccer has been growing steadily in recent years , and fifa estimates that by the year 2010 as many women as men will be playing the sport . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the calls for caution arise from fears the politicians will suffer an embarrassing defeat as they did in 2003 , when the constitutional court , based in the city of karlsruhe , rejected a case put forward jointly by both houses of parliament .
since pictures of the eight indian beaten up at mügeln were flashed around the world , other racist attacks have been reported , revealing a drift to the violent right among those youths that see themselves as left out of germany 's once-again rising prosperity .
" studies show that xenophobia , anti-semitism and contempt for the person are on the rise , " the berliner zeitung commented tuesday .
all mainstream politicians abhor the npd -lrb- german national democratic party -rrb- , which garnered only 1.6 per cent of the vote in the 2005 parliamentary elections and thus is excluded from the national parliament , although it has seats in the parliaments of two eastern states .
" i believe that even those skeptical -lrb- of a renewed banning attempt -rrb- regard the npd as unconstitutional , " spd home affairs parliamentary spokesman dieter wiefelspütz told reporters tuesday .
spd seemingly ignoring previous failed attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court threw out the last case but securing a ban under germany 's democratic constitution - which strenuously guards freedom of speech - is another matter .
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- parliamentary caucus , believes that parliament faces " another gigantic embarrassment " if it tries again .
the main problem lies in the numerous undercover agents operating within the npd to monitor its activities .
the activities of these agents - one of them reached the top of the hierarchy and is said to have authored an anti-semitic pamphlet - led the constitutional court to throw the case out in the preliminary stages four years ago .
" it was one of the bitterest defeats that the politicians have ever been handed by karlsruhe - and it was their own fault , " the berliner zeitung commented .
lengthy process could endanger police operations one person well placed to know about the undercover agents , cdu interior minister wolfgang schaüble , warns of " great procedural risk . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police infiltrators would be at risk during a court ruling the legal process leading up to a constitutional court ruling could take years , experts warn .
police and the special authority charged with the protection of the constitution are reported to be aghast at the prospect of having to withdraw their undercover agents for as long as this .
but wiefelspütz is adamant that parliament should try again .
" i call on all parties to engage in a debate over how this can be achieved , " he says .
case to ban npd " doomed to failure " say greens the spd , currently the junior partner in merkel 's grand coalition , finds itself alone on this issue , with even their former partner in government , the greens , opposed .
the problem of rightwing extremism will not be resolved by a legal process that is in any case doomed to failure , the party warns .
" their members would still be there and would look for new organizational structures .
much more important are initiatives in civil society against the dissemination of rightwing ideology , " greens parliamentary spokesman volker beck says .
instead , the party blames merkel 's government for fiscal cutbacks that have helped return the budget to balance but have closed down many social programs .

" i expect to sell out " but partnering with aldi is exactly what german winemakers raimond prüm , of the mosel region , and fritz keller , from kaiserstuhl in baden , deemed the right thing to do . back in june , keller struck a deal with aldi to produce weissburgunder and spätburgunder wines .
to produce enough wine , he will cooperate with some 1,000 local vintners , who have to adhere to a strict set of quality criteria in order to be able to contribute to the cuvee .
the wines will be priced to sell at around seven or eight euros . raimund prüm , whose best rieslings can sell for hundreds of euros per bottle , also struck a deal to release a cuvee for aldi .
for his release of between 300,000 and a half a million bottles , prüm will use grapes of his own , as well as selected other vineyards .

wine specialty shops , in contrast , account for just 3 to 5 percent of sales . ironically , getting the invitation to sell wine through a giant discounter can be seen as an honor in itself , according to the german wine institute 's büscher .

the move has some observers scratching their heads , and others hoping for the best . the reputation of german wine has been on the rise in recent years .
no longer viewed solely as the producer of painfully sweet whites , the country is starting to enjoy a worldwide reputation as a producer of subtle and flavourful rieslings , burgundies and müller-thurgaus , among others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small growers are still important in german wine regions so it may not seem like the ideal time for two of the country 's most respected wine makers to hop into bed with the country 's number one discount supermarket chain . after all , by continuously slashing prices , aldi has lowered the average price of wine on its shelves from over two euros -lrb- $ 2.70 -rrb- for a 0.75 liter bottle in 2001 , to 1.73 euros a bottle today , according to ernst büscher , a spokesman for the german wine institute , an industry association . " i expect to sell out " but partnering with aldi is exactly what german winemakers raimond prüm , of the mosel region , and fritz keller , from kaiserstuhl in baden , deemed the right thing to do . back in june , keller struck a deal with aldi to produce weissburgunder and spätburgunder wines .
to produce enough wine , he will cooperate with some 1,000 local vintners , who have to adhere to a strict set of quality criteria in order to be able to contribute to the cuvee .
the wines will be priced to sell at around seven or eight euros . raimund prüm , whose best rieslings can sell for hundreds of euros per bottle , also struck a deal to release a cuvee for aldi .
for his release of between 300,000 and a half a million bottles , prüm will use grapes of his own , as well as selected other vineyards .
the other grapes must be grown in accordance with rigid growing , production and territory criteria . given the relatively small production , and the price of between six and eight euros per bottle , prüm told germany 's die welt newspaper , " i expect the wine to sell out in a number of hours . " win-win situation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in rudesheim , vinyards are also hiking paths for prüm , the situation is win-win .
for one thing , thanks to aldi 's massive distribution system , his wines can be appreciated by the widest possible audience . " the wine will be something special for the discounter to offer , and will show just how high a quality wine the mosel region can produce , " prüm said . statistics are unreliable , but the german wine institute estimates retail grocery sales in general account for 70 percent of wine sales in germany ; 30 percent of that amount can be chalked up to aldi sales alone .
wine specialty shops , in contrast , account for just 3 to 5 percent of sales . ironically , getting the invitation to sell wine through a giant discounter can be seen as an honor in itself , according to the german wine institute 's büscher .
aldi has promoted high-quality , higher-priced italian and spanish wines in the past ; now its germany 's turn . " that aldi is now opening this price class for german wines shows that the image of german wines has improved , both here and internationally , " büscher said . but nils vahrenwald , the owner of weinhaus süd , a mid-sized distributor of international wines in cologne , is skeptical about the wine makers who are in league with rock-bottom retailers . good for the industry ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone knows when it 's time for picking " i do n't understand why they 're doing it - these winemakers do n't need to be on the shelves next to the cheapest mass-produced stuff , " vahrenwald said .
" i honestly do not know how they are making this wine , but they must be buying the cheapest grapes , working on it a little in production , and then selling it for a great profit . " in the end they are n't doing german wine a favor , " said vahrenwald , who noted that he has spent years trying to boost the image of german wines among his customers , even back when it was out of fashion . but ulrich sauter , an editor at germany 's wein gourmet magazine , said he does think both parties stand to gain from the deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi has had a huge influence on german wine tastes " from the side of the discounters , they want to get more prestige , " he said .
" the producers want more sales .
and if aldi is ready to have more expensive wines on its shelves that could be an improvement for the wine growers . " " i agree that it 's a paradoxical situation , but i do n't think people like fritz keller are doing this just to make a profit , " sauter said .
" i think he is really concerned about the structure of the small wine villages in his region .
if the small wine growers in kaiserstuhl , in baden , in the mosel , disappear , these regions would change entirely . " finally , sauter said , only time will tell whether it 's a good move or a bad one for the german wine industry . " we 'll only know after we taste the wines they make , " he said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the vote had pitted secularists and the ruling islamist-rooted justice and development party against each other . abdullah gül is the first former islamist to become turkey 's president in the secular but predominantly muslim country 's modern history .
public opinion in turkey has been sharply divided over gül 's allegiance to the country 's basic tenets . gül 's supporters consider him to be a moderate politician who has backed far-reaching democratic and human rights reforms , enabling turkey to start accession talks with the european union in 2005 .
yet staunch secularists see gül as a wolf in sheep 's clothing , bent on pushing what they consider as the ruling justice and development party 's -lrb- akp -rrb- plans to dismantle the country 's secular system . however , gül has publicly stressed in recent weeks that such plans were not on his agenda .
he told the country in a press conference earlier this month that he had cut loose from his past and fully believed in the separation of state and religion - a principle he vowed to defend as president . many analysts have said that gül 's experience as foreign minister over the past five years made him well-suited for the presidency .
this background would play an active role in furthering turkey 's european ambitions during his seven-year term , analysts said . european commission president jose manuel barroso said tuesday that the election of gül could provide fresh impetus to ankara 's eu membership talks . the election and the arrival to power of a new government " provides an opportunity to give fresh , immediate and positive impetus to the accession process to the european union through progress in a number of key areas , " barroso said in a statement . barroso said : " i am confident that you will fulfil your task with a strong sense of duty and commitment to your country and fellow citizens . " german chancellor angela merkel also sent a message of congratulation to gül . germany and turkey were " important partners " and linked by friendship , merkel said .

in a move designed to calm these fears , harunisa announced earlier on tuesday that she would not attend the swearing-in ceremony . gül has countered critics by saying that the headscarf was a personal choice , and that he , and not his wife , would become president . gül won a clear majority gül won 339 votes in the parliamentary poll on tuesday in the third round of voting .
during the previous two rounds last week , gül had failed to receive a two-thirds majority .

yet staunch secularists see gül as a wolf in sheep 's clothing , bent on pushing what they consider as the ruling justice and development party 's -lrb- akp -rrb- plans to dismantle the country 's secular system . however , gül has publicly stressed in recent weeks that such plans were not on his agenda .
he told the country in a press conference earlier this month that he had cut loose from his past and fully believed in the separation of state and religion - a principle he vowed to defend as president . many analysts have said that gül 's experience as foreign minister over the past five years made him well-suited for the presidency .
this background would play an active role in furthering turkey 's european ambitions during his seven-year term , analysts said . european commission president jose manuel barroso said tuesday that the election of gül could provide fresh impetus to ankara 's eu membership talks . the election and the arrival to power of a new government " provides an opportunity to give fresh , immediate and positive impetus to the accession process to the european union through progress in a number of key areas , " barroso said in a statement . barroso said : " i am confident that you will fulfil your task with a strong sense of duty and commitment to your country and fellow citizens .

the move has some observers scratching their heads , and others hoping for the best . the reputation of german wine has been on the rise in recent years .
no longer viewed solely as the producer of painfully sweet whites , the country is starting to enjoy a worldwide reputation as a producer of subtle and flavourful rieslings , burgundies and müller-thurgaus , among others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small growers are still important in german wine regions so it may not seem like the ideal time for two of the country 's most respected wine makers to hop into bed with the country 's number one discount supermarket chain . after all , by continuously slashing prices , aldi has lowered the average price of wine on its shelves from over two euros -lrb- $ 2.70 -rrb- for a 0.75 liter bottle in 2001 , to 1.73 euros a bottle today , according to ernst büscher , a spokesman for the german wine institute , an industry association . " i expect to sell out " but partnering with aldi is exactly what german winemakers raimond prüm , of the mosel region , and fritz keller , from kaiserstuhl in baden , deemed the right thing to do . back in june , keller struck a deal with aldi to produce weissburgunder and spätburgunder wines .
to produce enough wine , he will cooperate with some 1,000 local vintners , who have to adhere to a strict set of quality criteria in order to be able to contribute to the cuvee .
the wines will be priced to sell at around seven or eight euros . raimund prüm , whose best rieslings can sell for hundreds of euros per bottle , also struck a deal to release a cuvee for aldi .
for his release of between 300,000 and a half a million bottles , prüm will use grapes of his own , as well as selected other vineyards .
the other grapes must be grown in accordance with rigid growing , production and territory criteria . given the relatively small production , and the price of between six and eight euros per bottle , prüm told germany 's die welt newspaper , " i expect the wine to sell out in a number of hours . " win-win situation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in rudesheim , vinyards are also hiking paths for prüm , the situation is win-win .
for one thing , thanks to aldi 's massive distribution system , his wines can be appreciated by the widest possible audience . " the wine will be something special for the discounter to offer , and will show just how high a quality wine the mosel region can produce , " prüm said . statistics are unreliable , but the german wine institute estimates retail grocery sales in general account for 70 percent of wine sales in germany ; 30 percent of that amount can be chalked up to aldi sales alone .
wine specialty shops , in contrast , account for just 3 to 5 percent of sales . ironically , getting the invitation to sell wine through a giant discounter can be seen as an honor in itself , according to the german wine institute 's büscher .
aldi has promoted high-quality , higher-priced italian and spanish wines in the past ; now its germany 's turn . " that aldi is now opening this price class for german wines shows that the image of german wines has improved , both here and internationally , " büscher said . but nils vahrenwald , the owner of weinhaus süd , a mid-sized distributor of international wines in cologne , is skeptical about the wine makers who are in league with rock-bottom retailers . good for the industry ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone knows when it 's time for picking " i do n't understand why they 're doing it - these winemakers do n't need to be on the shelves next to the cheapest mass-produced stuff , " vahrenwald said .
" i honestly do not know how they are making this wine , but they must be buying the cheapest grapes , working on it a little in production , and then selling it for a great profit . " in the end they are n't doing german wine a favor , " said vahrenwald , who noted that he has spent years trying to boost the image of german wines among his customers , even back when it was out of fashion . but ulrich sauter , an editor at germany 's wein gourmet magazine , said he does think both parties stand to gain from the deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi has had a huge influence on german wine tastes " from the side of the discounters , they want to get more prestige , " he said .
" the producers want more sales .
and if aldi is ready to have more expensive wines on its shelves that could be an improvement for the wine growers . " " i agree that it 's a paradoxical situation , but i do n't think people like fritz keller are doing this just to make a profit , " sauter said .
" i think he is really concerned about the structure of the small wine villages in his region .
if the small wine growers in kaiserstuhl , in baden , in the mosel , disappear , these regions would change entirely . " finally , sauter said , only time will tell whether it 's a good move or a bad one for the german wine industry .

" the wine will be something special for the discounter to offer , and will show just how high a quality wine the mosel region can produce , " prüm said . statistics are unreliable , but the german wine institute estimates retail grocery sales in general account for 70 percent of wine sales in germany ; 30 percent of that amount can be chalked up to aldi sales alone .
wine specialty shops , in contrast , account for just 3 to 5 percent of sales . ironically , getting the invitation to sell wine through a giant discounter can be seen as an honor in itself , according to the german wine institute 's büscher .
aldi has promoted high-quality , higher-priced italian and spanish wines in the past ; now its germany 's turn . " that aldi is now opening this price class for german wines shows that the image of german wines has improved , both here and internationally , " büscher said . but nils vahrenwald , the owner of weinhaus süd , a mid-sized distributor of international wines in cologne , is skeptical about the wine makers who are in league with rock-bottom retailers . good for the industry ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone knows when it 's time for picking " i do n't understand why they 're doing it - these winemakers do n't need to be on the shelves next to the cheapest mass-produced stuff , " vahrenwald said .
" i honestly do not know how they are making this wine , but they must be buying the cheapest grapes , working on it a little in production , and then selling it for a great profit . " in the end they are n't doing german wine a favor , " said vahrenwald , who noted that he has spent years trying to boost the image of german wines among his customers , even back when it was out of fashion . but ulrich sauter , an editor at germany 's wein gourmet magazine , said he does think both parties stand to gain from the deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi has had a huge influence on german wine tastes " from the side of the discounters , they want to get more prestige , " he said .
" the producers want more sales .
and if aldi is ready to have more expensive wines on its shelves that could be an improvement for the wine growers . " " i agree that it 's a paradoxical situation , but i do n't think people like fritz keller are doing this just to make a profit , " sauter said .
" i think he is really concerned about the structure of the small wine villages in his region .
if the small wine growers in kaiserstuhl , in baden , in the mosel , disappear , these regions would change entirely . " finally , sauter said , only time will tell whether it 's a good move or a bad one for the german wine industry . " we 'll only know after we taste the wines they make , " he said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de music -pipe- 28.08.2007 german orchestra to perform in iran großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the tehran symphony orchestra performed in osnabrück last year this week , the osnabrück symphony will be the first western classical ensemble to perform in iran since the islamic revolution in 1979 .
german organizers hope the event will contribute to inter-cultural understanding . the 60-member osnabrück symphony has arrived in tehran and is preparing to go on stage on wednesday and thursday in the iranian capital .
conductor hermann bäumer will lead the musicians in playing works by beethoven , brahms and elgar . the concert will be a rare occasion , as no other western orchestra of this size has played in iran since the islamic revolution in 1979 .
last year , osnabrück hosted the tehran symphony orchestra , who performed to a packed audience in the western german city .
the exchange is part of osnabrück 's orient festival . in view of the ongoing political tensions between iran and the west , the orchestra 's concerts were aimed at improving inter-cultural dialogue , said the festival 's director michael dreyer . " it is important to me that this is not a one-time event , but rather the beginning of a long-term cultural cooperation , " dreyer said .
six iranian musicians will support the german orchestra in this week 's concerts , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : music is a language everyone understands " i hope that such cultural exchange projects will soon become normality , even between the west and the islamic world , " dreyer said .
he told reporters in tehran that the exchange hoped to " show to both countries that there are lots of similarities between us and no reason to fear each other . " conductor bäumer said music was the only language everybody in the world could speak and understand . " i 'm sure that making music together will change things , " bäumer said in tehran .
" every human being can be reached by music . " politics are not part of it dreyer visited tehran several times over the past year in order to prepare the concerts .
the trip has been fully coordinated with iran 's ministry of culture and islamic guidance . " it was all but a mission impossible , " dreyer said in an interview with german news agency dpa prior to his departure .
" we only managed it because high-ranking clerical and political iranians lobbied for it . " all of the female musicians will be required to wear islamic headscarves to obey iran 's dress code . " the women are not used to playing in hijab , " bäumer said .
" i am very glad that the women tried it and it was fine .
what is most important is the music . " the orchestra 's directors said the visit was aimed purely at cultural understanding , and not politics .
dreyer said he had rejected a request by three german mps to join the tour in order to keep the trip focused on music and not politics . the concerts are expected to draw large crowds . classical music experiencing a resurgence in iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karajan conducted the berlin philharmonic for 35 years prior to the islamic revolution , foreign orchestras performed regularly in iran , including the berlin philharmonic and its legendary conductor herbert von karajan .
but the tehran orchestra was dissolved following the revolution . only in the past decade have attempts been made to revive classical music in iran .
tehran 's symphony orchestra gives regular concerts , mixing western classics with compositions by iranian composers . the country 's ruling clerics tolerate classical , traditional iranian , as well as instrumental versions of western music .
however , pop music with singing is strictly forbidden . the festival is financed by various cultural organizations in osnabrück , as well as the german foreign office .

german organizers hope the event will contribute to inter-cultural understanding . the 60-member osnabrück symphony has arrived in tehran and is preparing to go on stage on wednesday and thursday in the iranian capital .
conductor hermann bäumer will lead the musicians in playing works by beethoven , brahms and elgar . the concert will be a rare occasion , as no other western orchestra of this size has played in iran since the islamic revolution in 1979 .
last year , osnabrück hosted the tehran symphony orchestra , who performed to a packed audience in the western german city .
the exchange is part of osnabrück 's orient festival . in view of the ongoing political tensions between iran and the west , the orchestra 's concerts were aimed at improving inter-cultural dialogue , said the festival 's director michael dreyer . " it is important to me that this is not a one-time event , but rather the beginning of a long-term cultural cooperation , " dreyer said .
six iranian musicians will support the german orchestra in this week 's concerts , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : music is a language everyone understands " i hope that such cultural exchange projects will soon become normality , even between the west and the islamic world , " dreyer said .
he told reporters in tehran that the exchange hoped to " show to both countries that there are lots of similarities between us and no reason to fear each other . " conductor bäumer said music was the only language everybody in the world could speak and understand . " i 'm sure that making music together will change things , " bäumer said in tehran .
" every human being can be reached by music . " politics are not part of it dreyer visited tehran several times over the past year in order to prepare the concerts .
the trip has been fully coordinated with iran 's ministry of culture and islamic guidance . " it was all but a mission impossible , " dreyer said in an interview with german news agency dpa prior to his departure .
" we only managed it because high-ranking clerical and political iranians lobbied for it . " all of the female musicians will be required to wear islamic headscarves to obey iran 's dress code . " the women are not used to playing in hijab , " bäumer said .
" i am very glad that the women tried it and it was fine .
what is most important is the music . " the orchestra 's directors said the visit was aimed purely at cultural understanding , and not politics .
dreyer said he had rejected a request by three german mps to join the tour in order to keep the trip focused on music and not politics . the concerts are expected to draw large crowds . classical music experiencing a resurgence in iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karajan conducted the berlin philharmonic for 35 years prior to the islamic revolution , foreign orchestras performed regularly in iran , including the berlin philharmonic and its legendary conductor herbert von karajan .
but the tehran orchestra was dissolved following the revolution . only in the past decade have attempts been made to revive classical music in iran .
tehran 's symphony orchestra gives regular concerts , mixing western classics with compositions by iranian composers . the country 's ruling clerics tolerate classical , traditional iranian , as well as instrumental versions of western music .
however , pop music with singing is strictly forbidden . the festival is financed by various cultural organizations in osnabrück , as well as the german foreign office .

german organizers hope the event will contribute to inter-cultural understanding . the 60-member osnabrück symphony has arrived in tehran and is preparing to go on stage on wednesday and thursday in the iranian capital .
conductor hermann bäumer will lead the musicians in playing works by beethoven , brahms and elgar . the concert will be a rare occasion , as no other western orchestra of this size has played in iran since the islamic revolution in 1979 .
last year , osnabrück hosted the tehran symphony orchestra , who performed to a packed audience in the western german city .
the exchange is part of osnabrück 's orient festival . in view of the ongoing political tensions between iran and the west , the orchestra 's concerts were aimed at improving inter-cultural dialogue , said the festival 's director michael dreyer . " it is important to me that this is not a one-time event , but rather the beginning of a long-term cultural cooperation , " dreyer said .
six iranian musicians will support the german orchestra in this week 's concerts , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : music is a language everyone understands " i hope that such cultural exchange projects will soon become normality , even between the west and the islamic world , " dreyer said .
he told reporters in tehran that the exchange hoped to " show to both countries that there are lots of similarities between us and no reason to fear each other . " conductor bäumer said music was the only language everybody in the world could speak and understand . " i 'm sure that making music together will change things , " bäumer said in tehran .
" every human being can be reached by music . " politics are not part of it dreyer visited tehran several times over the past year in order to prepare the concerts .
the trip has been fully coordinated with iran 's ministry of culture and islamic guidance . " it was all but a mission impossible , " dreyer said in an interview with german news agency dpa prior to his departure .
" we only managed it because high-ranking clerical and political iranians lobbied for it . " all of the female musicians will be required to wear islamic headscarves to obey iran 's dress code . " the women are not used to playing in hijab , " bäumer said .
" i am very glad that the women tried it and it was fine .
what is most important is the music . " the orchestra 's directors said the visit was aimed purely at cultural understanding , and not politics .
dreyer said he had rejected a request by three german mps to join the tour in order to keep the trip focused on music and not politics . the concerts are expected to draw large crowds . classical music experiencing a resurgence in iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karajan conducted the berlin philharmonic for 35 years prior to the islamic revolution , foreign orchestras performed regularly in iran , including the berlin philharmonic and its legendary conductor herbert von karajan .
but the tehran orchestra was dissolved following the revolution . only in the past decade have attempts been made to revive classical music in iran .
tehran 's symphony orchestra gives regular concerts , mixing western classics with compositions by iranian composers . the country 's ruling clerics tolerate classical , traditional iranian , as well as instrumental versions of western music .

but the outlook for the coming six months is still marked by optimism . in its monthly survey released on tuesday , the ifo institute for economic research 's business climate index dropped for the third month in a row in august , edging down to 105.2 points from 106.4 points in july . the munich-based ifo said turbulence on world financial markets in recent weeks had probably clouded executives ' mood although they were generally optimistic about the economic upswing in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 17.3 billion-euro -lrb- $ 23.3 billion -rrb- rescue of sachsen lb was the second bail-out a german bank " the outlook for the coming six months is still marked by optimism , albeit somewhat weaker , " ifo president hans-werner sinn said in a press release .
" here the turbulences in financial markets may have played a role . " germany has borne the brunt of the european fallout from problems stemming from sub-prime us home loans .
earlier in the month , germany 's sachsen lb bank and ikb bank almost collapsed , requiring major bailouts . in an interview with deutsche welle , the director of the hamburg world economic institute , thomas straubhaar , said that although the us home loans crisis had hit some institutions hard , germany 's " positive employment market " was strong enough to maintain the current business climate .
" the business climate is still robust , " straubhaar said .
" employment will continue to develop strongly , and the number of unemployed could fall to around the three million mark , potentially even lower . "
exports expected to drop ifo said the six-month outlook had weakened in the manufacturing sector and it also reported a fall in the business climate for exports , the motor of europe 's biggest economy .

abdullah gül was elected turkey 's next president on tuesday .
but calls by prime minister erdogan for gül 's critics to give up their citizenship have the media wondering what direction turkey will take . prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has come under sharp criticism for calling on turks who refuse to accept former islamist abdullah gül 's presidency to leave the country .
the turkish parliament on tuesday elected the current foreign minister as the country 's next president . gül had failed in an attempt to win the presidency earlier this year . " those -lrb- turks -rrb- who do not recognize abdullah gül as their president should give up their turkish citizenship , " erdogan said in an interview with television station kanal d. erdogan was commenting on an article by the prominent columnist bekir coskun from turkey 's largest daily hürriyet .
coskun had written that gül 's presidency would mean the end of the secular state in turkey - a fear shared by the country 's secular elite . " gül will not be my president , " coskun wrote last week .
erdogan 's ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- nominated gül for the presidency . government terror ? after the akp victory in general elections on july 22 , erdogan had promised to be " everyone 's prime minister . "
many observers had hoped he would embrace the highly polarized society as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister abdullah gül will become the country 's next president yet according to yüksel isik from the progressive journalists association , the prime minister 's statement showed that press freedom was still a major challenge in turkey . " the prime minister is taking an exclusionary stance against a prominent journalist , bekir coskun , as if he is ' the other ' , " isik said .
" if local governors follow the prime minister 's behavior and try to pressure journalists in local regions , this would mean the total terrorization of turkey by this government . " in a separate move , the mass circulation hürriyet fired columnist emin cölasan last week , who is known for his highly critical articles on the akp-led government .

abdullah gül was elected turkey 's next president on tuesday .
but calls by prime minister erdogan for gül 's critics to give up their citizenship have the media wondering what direction turkey will take . prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has come under sharp criticism for calling on turks who refuse to accept former islamist abdullah gül 's presidency to leave the country .
the turkish parliament on tuesday elected the current foreign minister as the country 's next president . gül had failed in an attempt to win the presidency earlier this year . " those -lrb- turks -rrb- who do not recognize abdullah gül as their president should give up their turkish citizenship , " erdogan said in an interview with television station kanal d. erdogan was commenting on an article by the prominent columnist bekir coskun from turkey 's largest daily hürriyet .
coskun had written that gül 's presidency would mean the end of the secular state in turkey - a fear shared by the country 's secular elite . " gül will not be my president , " coskun wrote last week .
erdogan 's ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- nominated gül for the presidency . government terror ? after the akp victory in general elections on july 22 , erdogan had promised to be " everyone 's prime minister . "
many observers had hoped he would embrace the highly polarized society as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister abdullah gül will become the country 's next president yet according to yüksel isik from the progressive journalists association , the prime minister 's statement showed that press freedom was still a major challenge in turkey . " the prime minister is taking an exclusionary stance against a prominent journalist , bekir coskun , as if he is ' the other ' , " isik said .
" if local governors follow the prime minister 's behavior and try to pressure journalists in local regions , this would mean the total terrorization of turkey by this government . " in a separate move , the mass circulation hürriyet fired columnist emin cölasan last week , who is known for his highly critical articles on the akp-led government .
according to isik , these events showed that the problem of press freedom was more serious than it appeared . " many of our journalist colleagues have been fired without any just cause , only for their criticism of governmental policies , " isik said . harming turkey 's eu ambitions ? lucio leante has been working in turkey since 2001 for the italian ansa news agency .

the calls for caution arise from fears the politicians will suffer an embarrassing defeat as they did in 2003 , when the constitutional court , based in the city of karlsruhe , rejected a case put forward jointly by both houses of parliament .
since pictures of the eight indian beaten up at mügeln were flashed around the world , other racist attacks have been reported , revealing a drift to the violent right among those youths that see themselves as left out of germany 's once-again rising prosperity .
" studies show that xenophobia , anti-semitism and contempt for the person are on the rise , " the berliner zeitung commented tuesday .
all mainstream politicians abhor the npd -lrb- german national democratic party -rrb- , which garnered only 1.6 per cent of the vote in the 2005 parliamentary elections and thus is excluded from the national parliament , although it has seats in the parliaments of two eastern states .
" i believe that even those skeptical -lrb- of a renewed banning attempt -rrb- regard the npd as unconstitutional , " spd home affairs parliamentary spokesman dieter wiefelspütz told reporters tuesday .

wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- parliamentary caucus , believes that parliament faces " another gigantic embarrassment " if it tries again .
the main problem lies in the numerous undercover agents operating within the npd to monitor its activities .
the activities of these agents - one of them reached the top of the hierarchy and is said to have authored an anti-semitic pamphlet - led the constitutional court to throw the case out in the preliminary stages four years ago .
" it was one of the bitterest defeats that the politicians have ever been handed by karlsruhe - and it was their own fault , " the berliner zeitung commented .
lengthy process could endanger police operations one person well placed to know about the undercover agents , cdu interior minister wolfgang schaüble , warns of " great procedural risk . "

the calls for caution arise from fears the politicians will suffer an embarrassing defeat as they did in 2003 , when the constitutional court , based in the city of karlsruhe , rejected a case put forward jointly by both houses of parliament .
since pictures of the eight indian beaten up at mügeln were flashed around the world , other racist attacks have been reported , revealing a drift to the violent right among those youths that see themselves as left out of germany 's once-again rising prosperity .
" studies show that xenophobia , anti-semitism and contempt for the person are on the rise , " the berliner zeitung commented tuesday .
all mainstream politicians abhor the npd -lrb- german national democratic party -rrb- , which garnered only 1.6 per cent of the vote in the 2005 parliamentary elections and thus is excluded from the national parliament , although it has seats in the parliaments of two eastern states .
" i believe that even those skeptical -lrb- of a renewed banning attempt -rrb- regard the npd as unconstitutional , " spd home affairs parliamentary spokesman dieter wiefelspütz told reporters tuesday .
spd seemingly ignoring previous failed attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court threw out the last case but securing a ban under germany 's democratic constitution - which strenuously guards freedom of speech - is another matter .
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- parliamentary caucus , believes that parliament faces " another gigantic embarrassment " if it tries again .
the main problem lies in the numerous undercover agents operating within the npd to monitor its activities .
the activities of these agents - one of them reached the top of the hierarchy and is said to have authored an anti-semitic pamphlet - led the constitutional court to throw the case out in the preliminary stages four years ago .
" it was one of the bitterest defeats that the politicians have ever been handed by karlsruhe - and it was their own fault , " the berliner zeitung commented .
lengthy process could endanger police operations one person well placed to know about the undercover agents , cdu interior minister wolfgang schaüble , warns of " great procedural risk . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police infiltrators would be at risk during a court ruling the legal process leading up to a constitutional court ruling could take years , experts warn .
police and the special authority charged with the protection of the constitution are reported to be aghast at the prospect of having to withdraw their undercover agents for as long as this .
but wiefelspütz is adamant that parliament should try again .
" i call on all parties to engage in a debate over how this can be achieved , " he says .
case to ban npd " doomed to failure " say greens the spd , currently the junior partner in merkel 's grand coalition , finds itself alone on this issue , with even their former partner in government , the greens , opposed .
the problem of rightwing extremism will not be resolved by a legal process that is in any case doomed to failure , the party warns .
" their members would still be there and would look for new organizational structures .
much more important are initiatives in civil society against the dissemination of rightwing ideology , " greens parliamentary spokesman volker beck says .
instead , the party blames merkel 's government for fiscal cutbacks that have helped return the budget to balance but have closed down many social programs .

the vote had pitted secularists and the ruling islamist-rooted justice and development party against each other . abdullah gül is the first former islamist to become turkey 's president in the secular but predominantly muslim country 's modern history .
public opinion in turkey has been sharply divided over gül 's allegiance to the country 's basic tenets . gül 's supporters consider him to be a moderate politician who has backed far-reaching democratic and human rights reforms , enabling turkey to start accession talks with the european union in 2005 .
yet staunch secularists see gül as a wolf in sheep 's clothing , bent on pushing what they consider as the ruling justice and development party 's -lrb- akp -rrb- plans to dismantle the country 's secular system . however , gül has publicly stressed in recent weeks that such plans were not on his agenda .
he told the country in a press conference earlier this month that he had cut loose from his past and fully believed in the separation of state and religion - a principle he vowed to defend as president . many analysts have said that gül 's experience as foreign minister over the past five years made him well-suited for the presidency .
this background would play an active role in furthering turkey 's european ambitions during his seven-year term , analysts said . european commission president jose manuel barroso said tuesday that the election of gül could provide fresh impetus to ankara 's eu membership talks . the election and the arrival to power of a new government " provides an opportunity to give fresh , immediate and positive impetus to the accession process to the european union through progress in a number of key areas , " barroso said in a statement . barroso said : " i am confident that you will fulfil your task with a strong sense of duty and commitment to your country and fellow citizens . " german chancellor angela merkel also sent a message of congratulation to gül . germany and turkey were " important partners " and linked by friendship , merkel said . " i am certain that you will dedicate yourself in your new office to deepening our relations , for the good of europe and the atlantic alliance , " gül 's wife not to attend swearing-in ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gül 's wife hayrunisa is a staunch defender of her right to wear a headscarf gül 's bid to become president had not only become a controversial issue due to his past involvement in islamist groups .
in addition , the fact that his wife harunisa wears an islamic-style headscarf had alarmed turkey 's secular elite .
it is illegal for state employees and university students to wear headscarves in turkey . hayrunisa gül will become the first wife of a president to wear a headscarf , which secularist turks consider a symbol of muslim political militancy .
in a move designed to calm these fears , harunisa announced earlier on tuesday that she would not attend the swearing-in ceremony . gül has countered critics by saying that the headscarf was a personal choice , and that he , and not his wife , would become president . gül won a clear majority gül won 339 votes in the parliamentary poll on tuesday in the third round of voting .
during the previous two rounds last week , gül had failed to receive a two-thirds majority .
but for the third round , he needed just a simple majority of 276 votes in the 550-seat parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish parliament needed three rounds to elect gül the 56-year-old gül will be sworn in at a parliamentary ceremony later on tuesday , taking over from current president ahmet necdet sezer on tuesday night . the current foreign minister easily defeated sabahattin cakmakoglu with 70 votes and huseyin tayfur icli with 13 .

the vote had pitted secularists and the ruling islamist-rooted justice and development party against each other . abdullah gül is the first former islamist to become turkey 's president in the secular but predominantly muslim country 's modern history .
public opinion in turkey has been sharply divided over gül 's allegiance to the country 's basic tenets . gül 's supporters consider him to be a moderate politician who has backed far-reaching democratic and human rights reforms , enabling turkey to start accession talks with the european union in 2005 .
yet staunch secularists see gül as a wolf in sheep 's clothing , bent on pushing what they consider as the ruling justice and development party 's -lrb- akp -rrb- plans to dismantle the country 's secular system . however , gül has publicly stressed in recent weeks that such plans were not on his agenda .
he told the country in a press conference earlier this month that he had cut loose from his past and fully believed in the separation of state and religion - a principle he vowed to defend as president . many analysts have said that gül 's experience as foreign minister over the past five years made him well-suited for the presidency .
this background would play an active role in furthering turkey 's european ambitions during his seven-year term , analysts said . european commission president jose manuel barroso said tuesday that the election of gül could provide fresh impetus to ankara 's eu membership talks . the election and the arrival to power of a new government " provides an opportunity to give fresh , immediate and positive impetus to the accession process to the european union through progress in a number of key areas , " barroso said in a statement . barroso said : " i am confident that you will fulfil your task with a strong sense of duty and commitment to your country and fellow citizens .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : riesling from the rhineland and other divine drops german vintners feel squeeze from new world wines vintners toast german wine 's popularity eu winemakers likely to be asked to dig up some vines family winery cultivates the grape for 27 generations food and drink -pipe- 28.08.2007 discounter aldi pulls top german vintners into low-cost fold großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the reputation of german wine has greatly improved of late germany 's grocery discounter aldi has struck a deal with two respected german winemakers to sell top-flight cuvees at cut-rate prices .
the move has some observers scratching their heads , and others hoping for the best . the reputation of german wine has been on the rise in recent years .
no longer viewed solely as the producer of painfully sweet whites , the country is starting to enjoy a worldwide reputation as a producer of subtle and flavourful rieslings , burgundies and müller-thurgaus , among others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small growers are still important in german wine regions so it may not seem like the ideal time for two of the country 's most respected wine makers to hop into bed with the country 's number one discount supermarket chain . after all , by continuously slashing prices , aldi has lowered the average price of wine on its shelves from over two euros -lrb- $ 2.70 -rrb- for a 0.75 liter bottle in 2001 , to 1.73 euros a bottle today , according to ernst büscher , a spokesman for the german wine institute , an industry association . " i expect to sell out " but partnering with aldi is exactly what german winemakers raimond prüm , of the mosel region , and fritz keller , from kaiserstuhl in baden , deemed the right thing to do . back in june , keller struck a deal with aldi to produce weissburgunder and spätburgunder wines .
to produce enough wine , he will cooperate with some 1,000 local vintners , who have to adhere to a strict set of quality criteria in order to be able to contribute to the cuvee .
the wines will be priced to sell at around seven or eight euros . raimund prüm , whose best rieslings can sell for hundreds of euros per bottle , also struck a deal to release a cuvee for aldi .
for his release of between 300,000 and a half a million bottles , prüm will use grapes of his own , as well as selected other vineyards .
the other grapes must be grown in accordance with rigid growing , production and territory criteria . given the relatively small production , and the price of between six and eight euros per bottle , prüm told germany 's die welt newspaper , " i expect the wine to sell out in a number of hours . " win-win situation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in rudesheim , vinyards are also hiking paths for prüm , the situation is win-win .
for one thing , thanks to aldi 's massive distribution system , his wines can be appreciated by the widest possible audience . " the wine will be something special for the discounter to offer , and will show just how high a quality wine the mosel region can produce , " prüm said . statistics are unreliable , but the german wine institute estimates retail grocery sales in general account for 70 percent of wine sales in germany ; 30 percent of that amount can be chalked up to aldi sales alone .

the meeting was a signal of germany 's support for more press freedom in china . li datong , the former publisher of a supplement to the china youth daily newspaper , was full of praise for merkel . " the meeting shows that the chancellor attaches great significance to democracy and freedom of speech in china , " li told german news agency dpa . later , at a speech to china 's academy of social sciences , merkel underscored western concerns about the status of civil liberties in china . " from our perspective , the topic of human rights is of decisive importance , " merkel said in her speech .
" basically this means nothing else than that the dignity of every individual human being can not be compromised .
i think we would do well to keep discussing this with one another . " increased scrutiny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahead of 2008 , freedom of the press has become a hot issue for beijing merkel reminded the chinese government that , with the 2008 summer olympics fast approaching , the eyes of the world will be on beijing . " the world will be looking at china to a greater extent than it has in past years , " merkel said .
" and people will also be looking at how china presents itself in terms of freedom of speech and freedom of the press . " chinese critics of beijing welcomed merkel 's remarks . " unlike her predecessor gerhard schröder , angela merkel does not run and hide from this topic , " former university professor and dissident liu xiaobo told deutsche welle .
" she tells it like it is .
the pressure she 's put on the chinese government has already had significant effect . " press freedom and piracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel suggested to wu that china look to germany as a model merkel also raised the issue of freedom of the press at a meeting with china 's head of parliament , wu bangguo . dpa cited unnamed sources from the delegations at that meeting as saying that merkel had called for china to guarantee freedom of the press by law . but civil liberties were n't the only contentious topic merkel raised on tuesday .
at her speech before the academy of social scienes , merkel also criticized chinese piracy of western products and , in particular , automobiles . " if suddenly a car turns up that looks like a smart but is n't one , but rather a copy produced by not entirely legal means , then that 's not good , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german organizers hope the event will contribute to inter-cultural understanding . the 60-member osnabrück symphony has arrived in tehran and is preparing to go on stage on wednesday and thursday in the iranian capital .
conductor hermann bäumer will lead the musicians in playing works by beethoven , brahms and elgar . the concert will be a rare occasion , as no other western orchestra of this size has played in iran since the islamic revolution in 1979 .
last year , osnabrück hosted the tehran symphony orchestra , who performed to a packed audience in the western german city .
the exchange is part of osnabrück 's orient festival . in view of the ongoing political tensions between iran and the west , the orchestra 's concerts were aimed at improving inter-cultural dialogue , said the festival 's director michael dreyer . " it is important to me that this is not a one-time event , but rather the beginning of a long-term cultural cooperation , " dreyer said .
six iranian musicians will support the german orchestra in this week 's concerts , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : music is a language everyone understands " i hope that such cultural exchange projects will soon become normality , even between the west and the islamic world , " dreyer said .
he told reporters in tehran that the exchange hoped to " show to both countries that there are lots of similarities between us and no reason to fear each other . " conductor bäumer said music was the only language everybody in the world could speak and understand . " i 'm sure that making music together will change things , " bäumer said in tehran .
" every human being can be reached by music . " politics are not part of it dreyer visited tehran several times over the past year in order to prepare the concerts .
the trip has been fully coordinated with iran 's ministry of culture and islamic guidance . " it was all but a mission impossible , " dreyer said in an interview with german news agency dpa prior to his departure .
" we only managed it because high-ranking clerical and political iranians lobbied for it . " all of the female musicians will be required to wear islamic headscarves to obey iran 's dress code . " the women are not used to playing in hijab , " bäumer said .
" i am very glad that the women tried it and it was fine .
what is most important is the music . " the orchestra 's directors said the visit was aimed purely at cultural understanding , and not politics .
dreyer said he had rejected a request by three german mps to join the tour in order to keep the trip focused on music and not politics . the concerts are expected to draw large crowds . classical music experiencing a resurgence in iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karajan conducted the berlin philharmonic for 35 years prior to the islamic revolution , foreign orchestras performed regularly in iran , including the berlin philharmonic and its legendary conductor herbert von karajan .
but the tehran orchestra was dissolved following the revolution . only in the past decade have attempts been made to revive classical music in iran .
tehran 's symphony orchestra gives regular concerts , mixing western classics with compositions by iranian composers . the country 's ruling clerics tolerate classical , traditional iranian , as well as instrumental versions of western music .
however , pop music with singing is strictly forbidden . the festival is financed by various cultural organizations in osnabrück , as well as the german foreign office .

german organizers hope the event will contribute to inter-cultural understanding . the 60-member osnabrück symphony has arrived in tehran and is preparing to go on stage on wednesday and thursday in the iranian capital .
conductor hermann bäumer will lead the musicians in playing works by beethoven , brahms and elgar . the concert will be a rare occasion , as no other western orchestra of this size has played in iran since the islamic revolution in 1979 .
last year , osnabrück hosted the tehran symphony orchestra , who performed to a packed audience in the western german city .
the exchange is part of osnabrück 's orient festival . in view of the ongoing political tensions between iran and the west , the orchestra 's concerts were aimed at improving inter-cultural dialogue , said the festival 's director michael dreyer . " it is important to me that this is not a one-time event , but rather the beginning of a long-term cultural cooperation , " dreyer said .
six iranian musicians will support the german orchestra in this week 's concerts , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : music is a language everyone understands " i hope that such cultural exchange projects will soon become normality , even between the west and the islamic world , " dreyer said .
he told reporters in tehran that the exchange hoped to " show to both countries that there are lots of similarities between us and no reason to fear each other . " conductor bäumer said music was the only language everybody in the world could speak and understand . " i 'm sure that making music together will change things , " bäumer said in tehran .
" every human being can be reached by music . " politics are not part of it dreyer visited tehran several times over the past year in order to prepare the concerts .
the trip has been fully coordinated with iran 's ministry of culture and islamic guidance . " it was all but a mission impossible , " dreyer said in an interview with german news agency dpa prior to his departure .
" we only managed it because high-ranking clerical and political iranians lobbied for it . " all of the female musicians will be required to wear islamic headscarves to obey iran 's dress code . " the women are not used to playing in hijab , " bäumer said .
" i am very glad that the women tried it and it was fine .
what is most important is the music . " the orchestra 's directors said the visit was aimed purely at cultural understanding , and not politics .
dreyer said he had rejected a request by three german mps to join the tour in order to keep the trip focused on music and not politics . the concerts are expected to draw large crowds . classical music experiencing a resurgence in iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karajan conducted the berlin philharmonic for 35 years prior to the islamic revolution , foreign orchestras performed regularly in iran , including the berlin philharmonic and its legendary conductor herbert von karajan .
but the tehran orchestra was dissolved following the revolution . only in the past decade have attempts been made to revive classical music in iran .
tehran 's symphony orchestra gives regular concerts , mixing western classics with compositions by iranian composers . the country 's ruling clerics tolerate classical , traditional iranian , as well as instrumental versions of western music .
however , pop music with singing is strictly forbidden . the festival is financed by various cultural organizations in osnabrück , as well as the german foreign office .

she reminded beijing that the west would like to see progress on freedom of the press and other human rights issues . merkel began tuesday by meeting with representatives of the chinese media - including four prominent figures critical of the government in beijing .
the meeting was a signal of germany 's support for more press freedom in china . li datong , the former publisher of a supplement to the china youth daily newspaper , was full of praise for merkel . " the meeting shows that the chancellor attaches great significance to democracy and freedom of speech in china , " li told german news agency dpa . later , at a speech to china 's academy of social sciences , merkel underscored western concerns about the status of civil liberties in china . " from our perspective , the topic of human rights is of decisive importance , " merkel said in her speech .
" basically this means nothing else than that the dignity of every individual human being can not be compromised .
i think we would do well to keep discussing this with one another . " increased scrutiny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahead of 2008 , freedom of the press has become a hot issue for beijing merkel reminded the chinese government that , with the 2008 summer olympics fast approaching , the eyes of the world will be on beijing . " the world will be looking at china to a greater extent than it has in past years , " merkel said .
" and people will also be looking at how china presents itself in terms of freedom of speech and freedom of the press . " chinese critics of beijing welcomed merkel 's remarks . " unlike her predecessor gerhard schröder , angela merkel does not run and hide from this topic , " former university professor and dissident liu xiaobo told deutsche welle .
" she tells it like it is .
the pressure she 's put on the chinese government has already had significant effect .

at her speech before the academy of social scienes , merkel also criticized chinese piracy of western products and , in particular , automobiles . " if suddenly a car turns up that looks like a smart but is n't one , but rather a copy produced by not entirely legal means , then that 's not good , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

abdullah gül was elected turkey 's next president on tuesday .
but calls by prime minister erdogan for gül 's critics to give up their citizenship have the media wondering what direction turkey will take . prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has come under sharp criticism for calling on turks who refuse to accept former islamist abdullah gül 's presidency to leave the country .
the turkish parliament on tuesday elected the current foreign minister as the country 's next president . gül had failed in an attempt to win the presidency earlier this year . " those -lrb- turks -rrb- who do not recognize abdullah gül as their president should give up their turkish citizenship , " erdogan said in an interview with television station kanal d. erdogan was commenting on an article by the prominent columnist bekir coskun from turkey 's largest daily hürriyet .
coskun had written that gül 's presidency would mean the end of the secular state in turkey - a fear shared by the country 's secular elite . " gül will not be my president , " coskun wrote last week .
erdogan 's ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- nominated gül for the presidency . government terror ? after the akp victory in general elections on july 22 , erdogan had promised to be " everyone 's prime minister . "
many observers had hoped he would embrace the highly polarized society as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister abdullah gül will become the country 's next president yet according to yüksel isik from the progressive journalists association , the prime minister 's statement showed that press freedom was still a major challenge in turkey . " the prime minister is taking an exclusionary stance against a prominent journalist , bekir coskun , as if he is ' the other ' , " isik said .
" if local governors follow the prime minister 's behavior and try to pressure journalists in local regions , this would mean the total terrorization of turkey by this government . " in a separate move , the mass circulation hürriyet fired columnist emin cölasan last week , who is known for his highly critical articles on the akp-led government .
according to isik , these events showed that the problem of press freedom was more serious than it appeared . " many of our journalist colleagues have been fired without any just cause , only for their criticism of governmental policies , " isik said . harming turkey 's eu ambitions ? lucio leante has been working in turkey since 2001 for the italian ansa news agency .
he said he thinks that critical journalists such as cölasan are fired because of intricate relations between media owners and the government . the interests of hürriyet publisher the dogan group with the government could have influenced the paper 's management to fire cölasan , leante said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's position towards the press does not conform to eu standards " we ca n't prove it , but the dogan group 's many businesses and links with the state is limiting freedom of press , " leante said . leante added that erdogan 's inability to endure criticism played an important role in stifling the press .
yet despite the prime minister 's harsh attitude toward journalists , cartoon artists and publishers , there was still support for him and his party for turkey 's ambitions to join the european union .
according to leante , western nations were putting turkey to the test . " i think turkey is going on an experiment in which international circles want to see if a moderate islamic conservative party like the akp can be permanently moderate and democratic , " leante said . he said that some western countries believed this " experiment " could serve as a kind of model for other countries in the middle east .

abdullah gül was elected turkey 's next president on tuesday .
but calls by prime minister erdogan for gül 's critics to give up their citizenship have the media wondering what direction turkey will take . prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has come under sharp criticism for calling on turks who refuse to accept former islamist abdullah gül 's presidency to leave the country .
the turkish parliament on tuesday elected the current foreign minister as the country 's next president . gül had failed in an attempt to win the presidency earlier this year . " those -lrb- turks -rrb- who do not recognize abdullah gül as their president should give up their turkish citizenship , " erdogan said in an interview with television station kanal d. erdogan was commenting on an article by the prominent columnist bekir coskun from turkey 's largest daily hürriyet .
coskun had written that gül 's presidency would mean the end of the secular state in turkey - a fear shared by the country 's secular elite . " gül will not be my president , " coskun wrote last week .
erdogan 's ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- nominated gül for the presidency . government terror ? after the akp victory in general elections on july 22 , erdogan had promised to be " everyone 's prime minister . "
many observers had hoped he would embrace the highly polarized society as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister abdullah gül will become the country 's next president yet according to yüksel isik from the progressive journalists association , the prime minister 's statement showed that press freedom was still a major challenge in turkey . " the prime minister is taking an exclusionary stance against a prominent journalist , bekir coskun , as if he is ' the other ' , " isik said .
" if local governors follow the prime minister 's behavior and try to pressure journalists in local regions , this would mean the total terrorization of turkey by this government . " in a separate move , the mass circulation hürriyet fired columnist emin cölasan last week , who is known for his highly critical articles on the akp-led government .
according to isik , these events showed that the problem of press freedom was more serious than it appeared . " many of our journalist colleagues have been fired without any just cause , only for their criticism of governmental policies , " isik said . harming turkey 's eu ambitions ? lucio leante has been working in turkey since 2001 for the italian ansa news agency .
he said he thinks that critical journalists such as cölasan are fired because of intricate relations between media owners and the government . the interests of hürriyet publisher the dogan group with the government could have influenced the paper 's management to fire cölasan , leante said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's position towards the press does not conform to eu standards " we ca n't prove it , but the dogan group 's many businesses and links with the state is limiting freedom of press , " leante said . leante added that erdogan 's inability to endure criticism played an important role in stifling the press .
yet despite the prime minister 's harsh attitude toward journalists , cartoon artists and publishers , there was still support for him and his party for turkey 's ambitions to join the european union .
according to leante , western nations were putting turkey to the test . " i think turkey is going on an experiment in which international circles want to see if a moderate islamic conservative party like the akp can be permanently moderate and democratic , " leante said . he said that some western countries believed this " experiment " could serve as a kind of model for other countries in the middle east .
but he said he thought this was risky . " political islam is a contradiction in itself , " leante said .

" employment will continue to develop strongly , and the number of unemployed could fall to around the three million mark , potentially even lower . "

abdullah gül was elected turkey 's next president on tuesday .
but calls by prime minister erdogan for gül 's critics to give up their citizenship have the media wondering what direction turkey will take . prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has come under sharp criticism for calling on turks who refuse to accept former islamist abdullah gül 's presidency to leave the country .
the turkish parliament on tuesday elected the current foreign minister as the country 's next president . gül had failed in an attempt to win the presidency earlier this year . " those -lrb- turks -rrb- who do not recognize abdullah gül as their president should give up their turkish citizenship , " erdogan said in an interview with television station kanal d. erdogan was commenting on an article by the prominent columnist bekir coskun from turkey 's largest daily hürriyet .
coskun had written that gül 's presidency would mean the end of the secular state in turkey - a fear shared by the country 's secular elite . " gül will not be my president , " coskun wrote last week .
erdogan 's ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- nominated gül for the presidency . government terror ? after the akp victory in general elections on july 22 , erdogan had promised to be " everyone 's prime minister . "
many observers had hoped he would embrace the highly polarized society as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister abdullah gül will become the country 's next president yet according to yüksel isik from the progressive journalists association , the prime minister 's statement showed that press freedom was still a major challenge in turkey . " the prime minister is taking an exclusionary stance against a prominent journalist , bekir coskun , as if he is ' the other ' , " isik said .
" if local governors follow the prime minister 's behavior and try to pressure journalists in local regions , this would mean the total terrorization of turkey by this government . " in a separate move , the mass circulation hürriyet fired columnist emin cölasan last week , who is known for his highly critical articles on the akp-led government .
according to isik , these events showed that the problem of press freedom was more serious than it appeared . " many of our journalist colleagues have been fired without any just cause , only for their criticism of governmental policies , " isik said . harming turkey 's eu ambitions ? lucio leante has been working in turkey since 2001 for the italian ansa news agency .
he said he thinks that critical journalists such as cölasan are fired because of intricate relations between media owners and the government . the interests of hürriyet publisher the dogan group with the government could have influenced the paper 's management to fire cölasan , leante said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's position towards the press does not conform to eu standards " we ca n't prove it , but the dogan group 's many businesses and links with the state is limiting freedom of press , " leante said . leante added that erdogan 's inability to endure criticism played an important role in stifling the press .

abdullah gül was elected turkey 's next president on tuesday .
but calls by prime minister erdogan for gül 's critics to give up their citizenship have the media wondering what direction turkey will take . prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has come under sharp criticism for calling on turks who refuse to accept former islamist abdullah gül 's presidency to leave the country .
the turkish parliament on tuesday elected the current foreign minister as the country 's next president . gül had failed in an attempt to win the presidency earlier this year . " those -lrb- turks -rrb- who do not recognize abdullah gül as their president should give up their turkish citizenship , " erdogan said in an interview with television station kanal d. erdogan was commenting on an article by the prominent columnist bekir coskun from turkey 's largest daily hürriyet .
coskun had written that gül 's presidency would mean the end of the secular state in turkey - a fear shared by the country 's secular elite . " gül will not be my president , " coskun wrote last week .
erdogan 's ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- nominated gül for the presidency . government terror ? after the akp victory in general elections on july 22 , erdogan had promised to be " everyone 's prime minister . "
many observers had hoped he would embrace the highly polarized society as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister abdullah gül will become the country 's next president yet according to yüksel isik from the progressive journalists association , the prime minister 's statement showed that press freedom was still a major challenge in turkey . " the prime minister is taking an exclusionary stance against a prominent journalist , bekir coskun , as if he is ' the other ' , " isik said .
" if local governors follow the prime minister 's behavior and try to pressure journalists in local regions , this would mean the total terrorization of turkey by this government . " in a separate move , the mass circulation hürriyet fired columnist emin cölasan last week , who is known for his highly critical articles on the akp-led government .
according to isik , these events showed that the problem of press freedom was more serious than it appeared . " many of our journalist colleagues have been fired without any just cause , only for their criticism of governmental policies , " isik said . harming turkey 's eu ambitions ? lucio leante has been working in turkey since 2001 for the italian ansa news agency .
he said he thinks that critical journalists such as cölasan are fired because of intricate relations between media owners and the government . the interests of hürriyet publisher the dogan group with the government could have influenced the paper 's management to fire cölasan , leante said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's position towards the press does not conform to eu standards " we ca n't prove it , but the dogan group 's many businesses and links with the state is limiting freedom of press , " leante said . leante added that erdogan 's inability to endure criticism played an important role in stifling the press .
yet despite the prime minister 's harsh attitude toward journalists , cartoon artists and publishers , there was still support for him and his party for turkey 's ambitions to join the european union .
according to leante , western nations were putting turkey to the test . " i think turkey is going on an experiment in which international circles want to see if a moderate islamic conservative party like the akp can be permanently moderate and democratic , " leante said . he said that some western countries believed this " experiment " could serve as a kind of model for other countries in the middle east .

german organizers hope the event will contribute to inter-cultural understanding . the 60-member osnabrück symphony has arrived in tehran and is preparing to go on stage on wednesday and thursday in the iranian capital .
conductor hermann bäumer will lead the musicians in playing works by beethoven , brahms and elgar . the concert will be a rare occasion , as no other western orchestra of this size has played in iran since the islamic revolution in 1979 .
last year , osnabrück hosted the tehran symphony orchestra , who performed to a packed audience in the western german city .
the exchange is part of osnabrück 's orient festival . in view of the ongoing political tensions between iran and the west , the orchestra 's concerts were aimed at improving inter-cultural dialogue , said the festival 's director michael dreyer . " it is important to me that this is not a one-time event , but rather the beginning of a long-term cultural cooperation , " dreyer said .
six iranian musicians will support the german orchestra in this week 's concerts , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : music is a language everyone understands " i hope that such cultural exchange projects will soon become normality , even between the west and the islamic world , " dreyer said .
he told reporters in tehran that the exchange hoped to " show to both countries that there are lots of similarities between us and no reason to fear each other . " conductor bäumer said music was the only language everybody in the world could speak and understand . " i 'm sure that making music together will change things , " bäumer said in tehran .
" every human being can be reached by music . " politics are not part of it dreyer visited tehran several times over the past year in order to prepare the concerts .
the trip has been fully coordinated with iran 's ministry of culture and islamic guidance . " it was all but a mission impossible , " dreyer said in an interview with german news agency dpa prior to his departure .
" we only managed it because high-ranking clerical and political iranians lobbied for it . " all of the female musicians will be required to wear islamic headscarves to obey iran 's dress code . " the women are not used to playing in hijab , " bäumer said .
" i am very glad that the women tried it and it was fine .
what is most important is the music . " the orchestra 's directors said the visit was aimed purely at cultural understanding , and not politics .
dreyer said he had rejected a request by three german mps to join the tour in order to keep the trip focused on music and not politics . the concerts are expected to draw large crowds . classical music experiencing a resurgence in iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karajan conducted the berlin philharmonic for 35 years prior to the islamic revolution , foreign orchestras performed regularly in iran , including the berlin philharmonic and its legendary conductor herbert von karajan .
but the tehran orchestra was dissolved following the revolution . only in the past decade have attempts been made to revive classical music in iran .
tehran 's symphony orchestra gives regular concerts , mixing western classics with compositions by iranian composers . the country 's ruling clerics tolerate classical , traditional iranian , as well as instrumental versions of western music .
however , pop music with singing is strictly forbidden . the festival is financed by various cultural organizations in osnabrück , as well as the german foreign office .

abdullah gül was elected turkey 's next president on tuesday .
but calls by prime minister erdogan for gül 's critics to give up their citizenship have the media wondering what direction turkey will take . prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has come under sharp criticism for calling on turks who refuse to accept former islamist abdullah gül 's presidency to leave the country .
the turkish parliament on tuesday elected the current foreign minister as the country 's next president . gül had failed in an attempt to win the presidency earlier this year . " those -lrb- turks -rrb- who do not recognize abdullah gül as their president should give up their turkish citizenship , " erdogan said in an interview with television station kanal d. erdogan was commenting on an article by the prominent columnist bekir coskun from turkey 's largest daily hürriyet .
coskun had written that gül 's presidency would mean the end of the secular state in turkey - a fear shared by the country 's secular elite . " gül will not be my president , " coskun wrote last week .
erdogan 's ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- nominated gül for the presidency . government terror ? after the akp victory in general elections on july 22 , erdogan had promised to be " everyone 's prime minister . "
many observers had hoped he would embrace the highly polarized society as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister abdullah gül will become the country 's next president yet according to yüksel isik from the progressive journalists association , the prime minister 's statement showed that press freedom was still a major challenge in turkey . " the prime minister is taking an exclusionary stance against a prominent journalist , bekir coskun , as if he is ' the other ' , " isik said .
" if local governors follow the prime minister 's behavior and try to pressure journalists in local regions , this would mean the total terrorization of turkey by this government . " in a separate move , the mass circulation hürriyet fired columnist emin cölasan last week , who is known for his highly critical articles on the akp-led government .
according to isik , these events showed that the problem of press freedom was more serious than it appeared . " many of our journalist colleagues have been fired without any just cause , only for their criticism of governmental policies , " isik said . harming turkey 's eu ambitions ? lucio leante has been working in turkey since 2001 for the italian ansa news agency .
he said he thinks that critical journalists such as cölasan are fired because of intricate relations between media owners and the government . the interests of hürriyet publisher the dogan group with the government could have influenced the paper 's management to fire cölasan , leante said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's position towards the press does not conform to eu standards " we ca n't prove it , but the dogan group 's many businesses and links with the state is limiting freedom of press , " leante said . leante added that erdogan 's inability to endure criticism played an important role in stifling the press .
yet despite the prime minister 's harsh attitude toward journalists , cartoon artists and publishers , there was still support for him and his party for turkey 's ambitions to join the european union .
according to leante , western nations were putting turkey to the test . " i think turkey is going on an experiment in which international circles want to see if a moderate islamic conservative party like the akp can be permanently moderate and democratic , " leante said . he said that some western countries believed this " experiment " could serve as a kind of model for other countries in the middle east .
but he said he thought this was risky . " political islam is a contradiction in itself , " leante said .
" it is difficult for islam to prove itself democratic and moderate because political islam means extending religion to state problems . " for turkey 's journalists , the big question now is whether the islamist-rooted akp will use its majority power to continue criticizing the press or to open itself up to different views . berivan orucoglu -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german organizers hope the event will contribute to inter-cultural understanding . the 60-member osnabrück symphony has arrived in tehran and is preparing to go on stage on wednesday and thursday in the iranian capital .
conductor hermann bäumer will lead the musicians in playing works by beethoven , brahms and elgar . the concert will be a rare occasion , as no other western orchestra of this size has played in iran since the islamic revolution in 1979 .
last year , osnabrück hosted the tehran symphony orchestra , who performed to a packed audience in the western german city .
the exchange is part of osnabrück 's orient festival . in view of the ongoing political tensions between iran and the west , the orchestra 's concerts were aimed at improving inter-cultural dialogue , said the festival 's director michael dreyer . " it is important to me that this is not a one-time event , but rather the beginning of a long-term cultural cooperation , " dreyer said .
six iranian musicians will support the german orchestra in this week 's concerts , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : music is a language everyone understands " i hope that such cultural exchange projects will soon become normality , even between the west and the islamic world , " dreyer said .

" conductor bäumer said music was the only language everybody in the world could speak and understand . " i 'm sure that making music together will change things , " bäumer said in tehran .
" every human being can be reached by music . " politics are not part of it dreyer visited tehran several times over the past year in order to prepare the concerts .

that leaves germany as the only european contender in a field of four . buoyed by the success of the 2006 men 's world cup , germany is hoping to host another soccer celebration with women athletes in four year 's time .
german chancellor angela merkel , herself a big fan of the beautiful game , has thrown her weight behind the bid , and france 's decision to remove its hat from the ring has given germany 's chances an additional lift .
" we are very grateful to our friends in the french soccer federation for their pledge to support the german bid for the 2011 women 's world cup , " german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger said in a statement .
germany is now up against australia , canada and peru for the right to host the event .

the german women 's team won the last world cup in 2003 , and some argue that it would be good for the sport , if the 2011 event were held in a powerhouse soccer nation .
" germany would definitely make a good host nation and it would benefit women 's football , " germany coach tina theune-meyer said in an interview for fifa 's web site .
" we 'd be talking about public viewing again , too .
a world cup in germany would naturally add a new impulse to our already positive development . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popularity of women 's professional leagues has also be on the rise canada could be germany 's strongest competitor - despite the fact that its neighbour , the united states , has hosted the past two of women 's world cups .
the 2007 cup is taking place in china in september .
" i think it would n't be too much to have three of four world cups in north america , fifa president sepp blatter has told the edmonton sun newspaper .
" a bid from canada is absolutely possible for 2011 from fifa 's point of view . "
the popularity of women 's soccer has been growing steadily in recent years , and fifa estimates that by the year 2010 as many women as men will be playing the sport . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german organizers hope the event will contribute to inter-cultural understanding . the 60-member osnabrück symphony has arrived in tehran and is preparing to go on stage on wednesday and thursday in the iranian capital .
conductor hermann bäumer will lead the musicians in playing works by beethoven , brahms and elgar . the concert will be a rare occasion , as no other western orchestra of this size has played in iran since the islamic revolution in 1979 .
last year , osnabrück hosted the tehran symphony orchestra , who performed to a packed audience in the western german city .
the exchange is part of osnabrück 's orient festival . in view of the ongoing political tensions between iran and the west , the orchestra 's concerts were aimed at improving inter-cultural dialogue , said the festival 's director michael dreyer . " it is important to me that this is not a one-time event , but rather the beginning of a long-term cultural cooperation , " dreyer said .
six iranian musicians will support the german orchestra in this week 's concerts , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : music is a language everyone understands " i hope that such cultural exchange projects will soon become normality , even between the west and the islamic world , " dreyer said .
he told reporters in tehran that the exchange hoped to " show to both countries that there are lots of similarities between us and no reason to fear each other . " conductor bäumer said music was the only language everybody in the world could speak and understand . " i 'm sure that making music together will change things , " bäumer said in tehran .
" every human being can be reached by music . " politics are not part of it dreyer visited tehran several times over the past year in order to prepare the concerts .
the trip has been fully coordinated with iran 's ministry of culture and islamic guidance . " it was all but a mission impossible , " dreyer said in an interview with german news agency dpa prior to his departure .
" we only managed it because high-ranking clerical and political iranians lobbied for it . " all of the female musicians will be required to wear islamic headscarves to obey iran 's dress code . " the women are not used to playing in hijab , " bäumer said .
" i am very glad that the women tried it and it was fine .
what is most important is the music . " the orchestra 's directors said the visit was aimed purely at cultural understanding , and not politics .
dreyer said he had rejected a request by three german mps to join the tour in order to keep the trip focused on music and not politics . the concerts are expected to draw large crowds . classical music experiencing a resurgence in iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karajan conducted the berlin philharmonic for 35 years prior to the islamic revolution , foreign orchestras performed regularly in iran , including the berlin philharmonic and its legendary conductor herbert von karajan .
but the tehran orchestra was dissolved following the revolution . only in the past decade have attempts been made to revive classical music in iran .
tehran 's symphony orchestra gives regular concerts , mixing western classics with compositions by iranian composers . the country 's ruling clerics tolerate classical , traditional iranian , as well as instrumental versions of western music .

she reminded beijing that the west would like to see progress on freedom of the press and other human rights issues . merkel began tuesday by meeting with representatives of the chinese media - including four prominent figures critical of the government in beijing .
the meeting was a signal of germany 's support for more press freedom in china . li datong , the former publisher of a supplement to the china youth daily newspaper , was full of praise for merkel . " the meeting shows that the chancellor attaches great significance to democracy and freedom of speech in china , " li told german news agency dpa . later , at a speech to china 's academy of social sciences , merkel underscored western concerns about the status of civil liberties in china . " from our perspective , the topic of human rights is of decisive importance , " merkel said in her speech .
" basically this means nothing else than that the dignity of every individual human being can not be compromised .
i think we would do well to keep discussing this with one another . " increased scrutiny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahead of 2008 , freedom of the press has become a hot issue for beijing merkel reminded the chinese government that , with the 2008 summer olympics fast approaching , the eyes of the world will be on beijing . " the world will be looking at china to a greater extent than it has in past years , " merkel said .
" and people will also be looking at how china presents itself in terms of freedom of speech and freedom of the press . " chinese critics of beijing welcomed merkel 's remarks . " unlike her predecessor gerhard schröder , angela merkel does not run and hide from this topic , " former university professor and dissident liu xiaobo told deutsche welle .
" she tells it like it is .

she reminded beijing that the west would like to see progress on freedom of the press and other human rights issues . merkel began tuesday by meeting with representatives of the chinese media - including four prominent figures critical of the government in beijing .
the meeting was a signal of germany 's support for more press freedom in china . li datong , the former publisher of a supplement to the china youth daily newspaper , was full of praise for merkel . " the meeting shows that the chancellor attaches great significance to democracy and freedom of speech in china , " li told german news agency dpa . later , at a speech to china 's academy of social sciences , merkel underscored western concerns about the status of civil liberties in china . " from our perspective , the topic of human rights is of decisive importance , " merkel said in her speech .
" basically this means nothing else than that the dignity of every individual human being can not be compromised .
i think we would do well to keep discussing this with one another . " increased scrutiny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahead of 2008 , freedom of the press has become a hot issue for beijing merkel reminded the chinese government that , with the 2008 summer olympics fast approaching , the eyes of the world will be on beijing .

" and people will also be looking at how china presents itself in terms of freedom of speech and freedom of the press . " chinese critics of beijing welcomed merkel 's remarks . " unlike her predecessor gerhard schröder , angela merkel does not run and hide from this topic , " former university professor and dissident liu xiaobo told deutsche welle .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 28.08.2007 social democrats press for npd ban despite warnings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd is opposed by all mainstream parties but many see huge problems with a ban german social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are pressing for a ban on the far-right npd in the face of warnings from other quarters that the german constitutional court will throw out the case as it did four years ago . the main impulse for a renewed attempt to outlaw the party derives from the assault by a 50-strong mob on a group of eight indians in the small eastern german town of mügeln on august 18 .
the calls for caution arise from fears the politicians will suffer an embarrassing defeat as they did in 2003 , when the constitutional court , based in the city of karlsruhe , rejected a case put forward jointly by both houses of parliament .
since pictures of the eight indian beaten up at mügeln were flashed around the world , other racist attacks have been reported , revealing a drift to the violent right among those youths that see themselves as left out of germany 's once-again rising prosperity .
" studies show that xenophobia , anti-semitism and contempt for the person are on the rise , " the berliner zeitung commented tuesday .
all mainstream politicians abhor the npd -lrb- german national democratic party -rrb- , which garnered only 1.6 per cent of the vote in the 2005 parliamentary elections and thus is excluded from the national parliament , although it has seats in the parliaments of two eastern states .
" i believe that even those skeptical -lrb- of a renewed banning attempt -rrb- regard the npd as unconstitutional , " spd home affairs parliamentary spokesman dieter wiefelspütz told reporters tuesday .
spd seemingly ignoring previous failed attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court threw out the last case but securing a ban under germany 's democratic constitution - which strenuously guards freedom of speech - is another matter .
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- parliamentary caucus , believes that parliament faces " another gigantic embarrassment " if it tries again .
the main problem lies in the numerous undercover agents operating within the npd to monitor its activities .
the activities of these agents - one of them reached the top of the hierarchy and is said to have authored an anti-semitic pamphlet - led the constitutional court to throw the case out in the preliminary stages four years ago .
" it was one of the bitterest defeats that the politicians have ever been handed by karlsruhe - and it was their own fault , " the berliner zeitung commented .
lengthy process could endanger police operations one person well placed to know about the undercover agents , cdu interior minister wolfgang schaüble , warns of " great procedural risk . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police infiltrators would be at risk during a court ruling the legal process leading up to a constitutional court ruling could take years , experts warn .
police and the special authority charged with the protection of the constitution are reported to be aghast at the prospect of having to withdraw their undercover agents for as long as this .
but wiefelspütz is adamant that parliament should try again .
" i call on all parties to engage in a debate over how this can be achieved , " he says .
case to ban npd " doomed to failure " say greens the spd , currently the junior partner in merkel 's grand coalition , finds itself alone on this issue , with even their former partner in government , the greens , opposed .
the problem of rightwing extremism will not be resolved by a legal process that is in any case doomed to failure , the party warns .
" their members would still be there and would look for new organizational structures .
much more important are initiatives in civil society against the dissemination of rightwing ideology , " greens parliamentary spokesman volker beck says .
instead , the party blames merkel 's government for fiscal cutbacks that have helped return the budget to balance but have closed down many social programs .
" the federal government has to demonstrate that it can do something else besides push through cuts , " beck says . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move has some observers scratching their heads , and others hoping for the best . the reputation of german wine has been on the rise in recent years .
no longer viewed solely as the producer of painfully sweet whites , the country is starting to enjoy a worldwide reputation as a producer of subtle and flavourful rieslings , burgundies and müller-thurgaus , among others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small growers are still important in german wine regions so it may not seem like the ideal time for two of the country 's most respected wine makers to hop into bed with the country 's number one discount supermarket chain . after all , by continuously slashing prices , aldi has lowered the average price of wine on its shelves from over two euros -lrb- $ 2.70 -rrb- for a 0.75 liter bottle in 2001 , to 1.73 euros a bottle today , according to ernst büscher , a spokesman for the german wine institute , an industry association . " i expect to sell out " but partnering with aldi is exactly what german winemakers raimond prüm , of the mosel region , and fritz keller , from kaiserstuhl in baden , deemed the right thing to do . back in june , keller struck a deal with aldi to produce weissburgunder and spätburgunder wines .
to produce enough wine , he will cooperate with some 1,000 local vintners , who have to adhere to a strict set of quality criteria in order to be able to contribute to the cuvee .
the wines will be priced to sell at around seven or eight euros . raimund prüm , whose best rieslings can sell for hundreds of euros per bottle , also struck a deal to release a cuvee for aldi .
for his release of between 300,000 and a half a million bottles , prüm will use grapes of his own , as well as selected other vineyards .
the other grapes must be grown in accordance with rigid growing , production and territory criteria . given the relatively small production , and the price of between six and eight euros per bottle , prüm told germany 's die welt newspaper , " i expect the wine to sell out in a number of hours . " win-win situation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in rudesheim , vinyards are also hiking paths for prüm , the situation is win-win .
for one thing , thanks to aldi 's massive distribution system , his wines can be appreciated by the widest possible audience . " the wine will be something special for the discounter to offer , and will show just how high a quality wine the mosel region can produce , " prüm said . statistics are unreliable , but the german wine institute estimates retail grocery sales in general account for 70 percent of wine sales in germany ; 30 percent of that amount can be chalked up to aldi sales alone .
wine specialty shops , in contrast , account for just 3 to 5 percent of sales . ironically , getting the invitation to sell wine through a giant discounter can be seen as an honor in itself , according to the german wine institute 's büscher .
aldi has promoted high-quality , higher-priced italian and spanish wines in the past ; now its germany 's turn . " that aldi is now opening this price class for german wines shows that the image of german wines has improved , both here and internationally , " büscher said . but nils vahrenwald , the owner of weinhaus süd , a mid-sized distributor of international wines in cologne , is skeptical about the wine makers who are in league with rock-bottom retailers . good for the industry ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone knows when it 's time for picking " i do n't understand why they 're doing it - these winemakers do n't need to be on the shelves next to the cheapest mass-produced stuff , " vahrenwald said .
" i honestly do not know how they are making this wine , but they must be buying the cheapest grapes , working on it a little in production , and then selling it for a great profit . " in the end they are n't doing german wine a favor , " said vahrenwald , who noted that he has spent years trying to boost the image of german wines among his customers , even back when it was out of fashion . but ulrich sauter , an editor at germany 's wein gourmet magazine , said he does think both parties stand to gain from the deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi has had a huge influence on german wine tastes " from the side of the discounters , they want to get more prestige , " he said .
" the producers want more sales .
and if aldi is ready to have more expensive wines on its shelves that could be an improvement for the wine growers . " " i agree that it 's a paradoxical situation , but i do n't think people like fritz keller are doing this just to make a profit , " sauter said .
" i think he is really concerned about the structure of the small wine villages in his region .
if the small wine growers in kaiserstuhl , in baden , in the mosel , disappear , these regions would change entirely . " finally , sauter said , only time will tell whether it 's a good move or a bad one for the german wine industry . " we 'll only know after we taste the wines they make , " he said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the calls for caution arise from fears the politicians will suffer an embarrassing defeat as they did in 2003 , when the constitutional court , based in the city of karlsruhe , rejected a case put forward jointly by both houses of parliament .
since pictures of the eight indian beaten up at mügeln were flashed around the world , other racist attacks have been reported , revealing a drift to the violent right among those youths that see themselves as left out of germany 's once-again rising prosperity .

wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- parliamentary caucus , believes that parliament faces " another gigantic embarrassment " if it tries again .
the main problem lies in the numerous undercover agents operating within the npd to monitor its activities .
the activities of these agents - one of them reached the top of the hierarchy and is said to have authored an anti-semitic pamphlet - led the constitutional court to throw the case out in the preliminary stages four years ago .
" it was one of the bitterest defeats that the politicians have ever been handed by karlsruhe - and it was their own fault , " the berliner zeitung commented .

case to ban npd " doomed to failure " say greens the spd , currently the junior partner in merkel 's grand coalition , finds itself alone on this issue , with even their former partner in government , the greens , opposed .
the problem of rightwing extremism will not be resolved by a legal process that is in any case doomed to failure , the party warns .
" their members would still be there and would look for new organizational structures .
much more important are initiatives in civil society against the dissemination of rightwing ideology , " greens parliamentary spokesman volker beck says .
instead , the party blames merkel 's government for fiscal cutbacks that have helped return the budget to balance but have closed down many social programs .
" the federal government has to demonstrate that it can do something else besides push through cuts , " beck says . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the vote had pitted secularists and the ruling islamist-rooted justice and development party against each other . abdullah gül is the first former islamist to become turkey 's president in the secular but predominantly muslim country 's modern history .
public opinion in turkey has been sharply divided over gül 's allegiance to the country 's basic tenets . gül 's supporters consider him to be a moderate politician who has backed far-reaching democratic and human rights reforms , enabling turkey to start accession talks with the european union in 2005 .
yet staunch secularists see gül as a wolf in sheep 's clothing , bent on pushing what they consider as the ruling justice and development party 's -lrb- akp -rrb- plans to dismantle the country 's secular system . however , gül has publicly stressed in recent weeks that such plans were not on his agenda .
he told the country in a press conference earlier this month that he had cut loose from his past and fully believed in the separation of state and religion - a principle he vowed to defend as president . many analysts have said that gül 's experience as foreign minister over the past five years made him well-suited for the presidency .
this background would play an active role in furthering turkey 's european ambitions during his seven-year term , analysts said . european commission president jose manuel barroso said tuesday that the election of gül could provide fresh impetus to ankara 's eu membership talks . the election and the arrival to power of a new government " provides an opportunity to give fresh , immediate and positive impetus to the accession process to the european union through progress in a number of key areas , " barroso said in a statement . barroso said : " i am confident that you will fulfil your task with a strong sense of duty and commitment to your country and fellow citizens . " german chancellor angela merkel also sent a message of congratulation to gül . germany and turkey were " important partners " and linked by friendship , merkel said .

in addition , the fact that his wife harunisa wears an islamic-style headscarf had alarmed turkey 's secular elite .
it is illegal for state employees and university students to wear headscarves in turkey . hayrunisa gül will become the first wife of a president to wear a headscarf , which secularist turks consider a symbol of muslim political militancy .
in a move designed to calm these fears , harunisa announced earlier on tuesday that she would not attend the swearing-in ceremony . gül has countered critics by saying that the headscarf was a personal choice , and that he , and not his wife , would become president . gül won a clear majority gül won 339 votes in the parliamentary poll on tuesday in the third round of voting .
during the previous two rounds last week , gül had failed to receive a two-thirds majority .
but for the third round , he needed just a simple majority of 276 votes in the 550-seat parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish parliament needed three rounds to elect gül the 56-year-old gül will be sworn in at a parliamentary ceremony later on tuesday , taking over from current president ahmet necdet sezer on tuesday night . the current foreign minister easily defeated sabahattin cakmakoglu with 70 votes and huseyin tayfur icli with 13 .

the vote had pitted secularists and the ruling islamist-rooted justice and development party against each other . abdullah gül is the first former islamist to become turkey 's president in the secular but predominantly muslim country 's modern history .
public opinion in turkey has been sharply divided over gül 's allegiance to the country 's basic tenets . gül 's supporters consider him to be a moderate politician who has backed far-reaching democratic and human rights reforms , enabling turkey to start accession talks with the european union in 2005 .
yet staunch secularists see gül as a wolf in sheep 's clothing , bent on pushing what they consider as the ruling justice and development party 's -lrb- akp -rrb- plans to dismantle the country 's secular system . however , gül has publicly stressed in recent weeks that such plans were not on his agenda .
he told the country in a press conference earlier this month that he had cut loose from his past and fully believed in the separation of state and religion - a principle he vowed to defend as president . many analysts have said that gül 's experience as foreign minister over the past five years made him well-suited for the presidency .
this background would play an active role in furthering turkey 's european ambitions during his seven-year term , analysts said . european commission president jose manuel barroso said tuesday that the election of gül could provide fresh impetus to ankara 's eu membership talks . the election and the arrival to power of a new government " provides an opportunity to give fresh , immediate and positive impetus to the accession process to the european union through progress in a number of key areas , " barroso said in a statement . barroso said : " i am confident that you will fulfil your task with a strong sense of duty and commitment to your country and fellow citizens .

abdullah gül was elected turkey 's next president on tuesday .
but calls by prime minister erdogan for gül 's critics to give up their citizenship have the media wondering what direction turkey will take . prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has come under sharp criticism for calling on turks who refuse to accept former islamist abdullah gül 's presidency to leave the country .
the turkish parliament on tuesday elected the current foreign minister as the country 's next president . gül had failed in an attempt to win the presidency earlier this year . " those -lrb- turks -rrb- who do not recognize abdullah gül as their president should give up their turkish citizenship , " erdogan said in an interview with television station kanal d. erdogan was commenting on an article by the prominent columnist bekir coskun from turkey 's largest daily hürriyet .
coskun had written that gül 's presidency would mean the end of the secular state in turkey - a fear shared by the country 's secular elite . " gül will not be my president , " coskun wrote last week .
erdogan 's ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- nominated gül for the presidency . government terror ? after the akp victory in general elections on july 22 , erdogan had promised to be " everyone 's prime minister . "
many observers had hoped he would embrace the highly polarized society as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister abdullah gül will become the country 's next president yet according to yüksel isik from the progressive journalists association , the prime minister 's statement showed that press freedom was still a major challenge in turkey . " the prime minister is taking an exclusionary stance against a prominent journalist , bekir coskun , as if he is ' the other ' , " isik said .
" if local governors follow the prime minister 's behavior and try to pressure journalists in local regions , this would mean the total terrorization of turkey by this government . " in a separate move , the mass circulation hürriyet fired columnist emin cölasan last week , who is known for his highly critical articles on the akp-led government .
according to isik , these events showed that the problem of press freedom was more serious than it appeared . " many of our journalist colleagues have been fired without any just cause , only for their criticism of governmental policies , " isik said . harming turkey 's eu ambitions ? lucio leante has been working in turkey since 2001 for the italian ansa news agency .
he said he thinks that critical journalists such as cölasan are fired because of intricate relations between media owners and the government . the interests of hürriyet publisher the dogan group with the government could have influenced the paper 's management to fire cölasan , leante said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's position towards the press does not conform to eu standards " we ca n't prove it , but the dogan group 's many businesses and links with the state is limiting freedom of press , " leante said . leante added that erdogan 's inability to endure criticism played an important role in stifling the press .
yet despite the prime minister 's harsh attitude toward journalists , cartoon artists and publishers , there was still support for him and his party for turkey 's ambitions to join the european union .
according to leante , western nations were putting turkey to the test . " i think turkey is going on an experiment in which international circles want to see if a moderate islamic conservative party like the akp can be permanently moderate and democratic , " leante said . he said that some western countries believed this " experiment " could serve as a kind of model for other countries in the middle east .
but he said he thought this was risky . " political islam is a contradiction in itself , " leante said .
" it is difficult for islam to prove itself democratic and moderate because political islam means extending religion to state problems . " for turkey 's journalists , the big question now is whether the islamist-rooted akp will use its majority power to continue criticizing the press or to open itself up to different views . berivan orucoglu -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

abdullah gül was elected turkey 's next president on tuesday .
but calls by prime minister erdogan for gül 's critics to give up their citizenship have the media wondering what direction turkey will take . prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has come under sharp criticism for calling on turks who refuse to accept former islamist abdullah gül 's presidency to leave the country .
the turkish parliament on tuesday elected the current foreign minister as the country 's next president . gül had failed in an attempt to win the presidency earlier this year . " those -lrb- turks -rrb- who do not recognize abdullah gül as their president should give up their turkish citizenship , " erdogan said in an interview with television station kanal d. erdogan was commenting on an article by the prominent columnist bekir coskun from turkey 's largest daily hürriyet .
coskun had written that gül 's presidency would mean the end of the secular state in turkey - a fear shared by the country 's secular elite . " gül will not be my president , " coskun wrote last week .
erdogan 's ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- nominated gül for the presidency . government terror ? after the akp victory in general elections on july 22 , erdogan had promised to be " everyone 's prime minister . "
many observers had hoped he would embrace the highly polarized society as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister abdullah gül will become the country 's next president yet according to yüksel isik from the progressive journalists association , the prime minister 's statement showed that press freedom was still a major challenge in turkey . " the prime minister is taking an exclusionary stance against a prominent journalist , bekir coskun , as if he is ' the other ' , " isik said .
" if local governors follow the prime minister 's behavior and try to pressure journalists in local regions , this would mean the total terrorization of turkey by this government . " in a separate move , the mass circulation hürriyet fired columnist emin cölasan last week , who is known for his highly critical articles on the akp-led government .
according to isik , these events showed that the problem of press freedom was more serious than it appeared . " many of our journalist colleagues have been fired without any just cause , only for their criticism of governmental policies , " isik said . harming turkey 's eu ambitions ? lucio leante has been working in turkey since 2001 for the italian ansa news agency .
he said he thinks that critical journalists such as cölasan are fired because of intricate relations between media owners and the government . the interests of hürriyet publisher the dogan group with the government could have influenced the paper 's management to fire cölasan , leante said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's position towards the press does not conform to eu standards " we ca n't prove it , but the dogan group 's many businesses and links with the state is limiting freedom of press , " leante said . leante added that erdogan 's inability to endure criticism played an important role in stifling the press .
yet despite the prime minister 's harsh attitude toward journalists , cartoon artists and publishers , there was still support for him and his party for turkey 's ambitions to join the european union .
according to leante , western nations were putting turkey to the test . " i think turkey is going on an experiment in which international circles want to see if a moderate islamic conservative party like the akp can be permanently moderate and democratic , " leante said . he said that some western countries believed this " experiment " could serve as a kind of model for other countries in the middle east .
but he said he thought this was risky . " political islam is a contradiction in itself , " leante said .
" it is difficult for islam to prove itself democratic and moderate because political islam means extending religion to state problems . " for turkey 's journalists , the big question now is whether the islamist-rooted akp will use its majority power to continue criticizing the press or to open itself up to different views . berivan orucoglu -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that leaves germany as the only european contender in a field of four . buoyed by the success of the 2006 men 's world cup , germany is hoping to host another soccer celebration with women athletes in four year 's time .
german chancellor angela merkel , herself a big fan of the beautiful game , has thrown her weight behind the bid , and france 's decision to remove its hat from the ring has given germany 's chances an additional lift .
" we are very grateful to our friends in the french soccer federation for their pledge to support the german bid for the 2011 women 's world cup , " german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger said in a statement .

the german women 's team won the last world cup in 2003 , and some argue that it would be good for the sport , if the 2011 event were held in a powerhouse soccer nation .
" germany would definitely make a good host nation and it would benefit women 's football , " germany coach tina theune-meyer said in an interview for fifa 's web site .
" we 'd be talking about public viewing again , too .
a world cup in germany would naturally add a new impulse to our already positive development . "

" i think it would n't be too much to have three of four world cups in north america , fifa president sepp blatter has told the edmonton sun newspaper .
" a bid from canada is absolutely possible for 2011 from fifa 's point of view . "
the popularity of women 's soccer has been growing steadily in recent years , and fifa estimates that by the year 2010 as many women as men will be playing the sport . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 28.08.2007 gül wins presidential vote in turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gül can now officially say hello to the turkish presidency the turkish parliament on tuesday elected foreign minister gül to become the country 's next president .
the vote had pitted secularists and the ruling islamist-rooted justice and development party against each other . abdullah gül is the first former islamist to become turkey 's president in the secular but predominantly muslim country 's modern history .
public opinion in turkey has been sharply divided over gül 's allegiance to the country 's basic tenets . gül 's supporters consider him to be a moderate politician who has backed far-reaching democratic and human rights reforms , enabling turkey to start accession talks with the european union in 2005 .
yet staunch secularists see gül as a wolf in sheep 's clothing , bent on pushing what they consider as the ruling justice and development party 's -lrb- akp -rrb- plans to dismantle the country 's secular system . however , gül has publicly stressed in recent weeks that such plans were not on his agenda .
he told the country in a press conference earlier this month that he had cut loose from his past and fully believed in the separation of state and religion - a principle he vowed to defend as president . many analysts have said that gül 's experience as foreign minister over the past five years made him well-suited for the presidency .
this background would play an active role in furthering turkey 's european ambitions during his seven-year term , analysts said . european commission president jose manuel barroso said tuesday that the election of gül could provide fresh impetus to ankara 's eu membership talks . the election and the arrival to power of a new government " provides an opportunity to give fresh , immediate and positive impetus to the accession process to the european union through progress in a number of key areas , " barroso said in a statement . barroso said : " i am confident that you will fulfil your task with a strong sense of duty and commitment to your country and fellow citizens . " german chancellor angela merkel also sent a message of congratulation to gül . germany and turkey were " important partners " and linked by friendship , merkel said . " i am certain that you will dedicate yourself in your new office to deepening our relations , for the good of europe and the atlantic alliance , " gül 's wife not to attend swearing-in ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gül 's wife hayrunisa is a staunch defender of her right to wear a headscarf gül 's bid to become president had not only become a controversial issue due to his past involvement in islamist groups .
in addition , the fact that his wife harunisa wears an islamic-style headscarf had alarmed turkey 's secular elite .
it is illegal for state employees and university students to wear headscarves in turkey . hayrunisa gül will become the first wife of a president to wear a headscarf , which secularist turks consider a symbol of muslim political militancy .
in a move designed to calm these fears , harunisa announced earlier on tuesday that she would not attend the swearing-in ceremony . gül has countered critics by saying that the headscarf was a personal choice , and that he , and not his wife , would become president . gül won a clear majority gül won 339 votes in the parliamentary poll on tuesday in the third round of voting .
during the previous two rounds last week , gül had failed to receive a two-thirds majority .
but for the third round , he needed just a simple majority of 276 votes in the 550-seat parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish parliament needed three rounds to elect gül the 56-year-old gül will be sworn in at a parliamentary ceremony later on tuesday , taking over from current president ahmet necdet sezer on tuesday night . the current foreign minister easily defeated sabahattin cakmakoglu with 70 votes and huseyin tayfur icli with 13 .
twenty-four parliamentarians voted " none of the above " and two votes were declared invalid . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 28.08.2007 social democrats press for npd ban despite warnings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd is opposed by all mainstream parties but many see huge problems with a ban german social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are pressing for a ban on the far-right npd in the face of warnings from other quarters that the german constitutional court will throw out the case as it did four years ago . the main impulse for a renewed attempt to outlaw the party derives from the assault by a 50-strong mob on a group of eight indians in the small eastern german town of mügeln on august 18 .
the calls for caution arise from fears the politicians will suffer an embarrassing defeat as they did in 2003 , when the constitutional court , based in the city of karlsruhe , rejected a case put forward jointly by both houses of parliament .
since pictures of the eight indian beaten up at mügeln were flashed around the world , other racist attacks have been reported , revealing a drift to the violent right among those youths that see themselves as left out of germany 's once-again rising prosperity .
" studies show that xenophobia , anti-semitism and contempt for the person are on the rise , " the berliner zeitung commented tuesday .
all mainstream politicians abhor the npd -lrb- german national democratic party -rrb- , which garnered only 1.6 per cent of the vote in the 2005 parliamentary elections and thus is excluded from the national parliament , although it has seats in the parliaments of two eastern states .
" i believe that even those skeptical -lrb- of a renewed banning attempt -rrb- regard the npd as unconstitutional , " spd home affairs parliamentary spokesman dieter wiefelspütz told reporters tuesday .
spd seemingly ignoring previous failed attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court threw out the last case but securing a ban under germany 's democratic constitution - which strenuously guards freedom of speech - is another matter .
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- parliamentary caucus , believes that parliament faces " another gigantic embarrassment " if it tries again .
the main problem lies in the numerous undercover agents operating within the npd to monitor its activities .
the activities of these agents - one of them reached the top of the hierarchy and is said to have authored an anti-semitic pamphlet - led the constitutional court to throw the case out in the preliminary stages four years ago .
" it was one of the bitterest defeats that the politicians have ever been handed by karlsruhe - and it was their own fault , " the berliner zeitung commented .
lengthy process could endanger police operations one person well placed to know about the undercover agents , cdu interior minister wolfgang schaüble , warns of " great procedural risk . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police infiltrators would be at risk during a court ruling the legal process leading up to a constitutional court ruling could take years , experts warn .
police and the special authority charged with the protection of the constitution are reported to be aghast at the prospect of having to withdraw their undercover agents for as long as this .
but wiefelspütz is adamant that parliament should try again .
" i call on all parties to engage in a debate over how this can be achieved , " he says .
case to ban npd " doomed to failure " say greens the spd , currently the junior partner in merkel 's grand coalition , finds itself alone on this issue , with even their former partner in government , the greens , opposed .
the problem of rightwing extremism will not be resolved by a legal process that is in any case doomed to failure , the party warns .
" their members would still be there and would look for new organizational structures .
much more important are initiatives in civil society against the dissemination of rightwing ideology , " greens parliamentary spokesman volker beck says .
instead , the party blames merkel 's government for fiscal cutbacks that have helped return the budget to balance but have closed down many social programs .
" the federal government has to demonstrate that it can do something else besides push through cuts , " beck says . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german organizers hope the event will contribute to inter-cultural understanding . the 60-member osnabrück symphony has arrived in tehran and is preparing to go on stage on wednesday and thursday in the iranian capital .
conductor hermann bäumer will lead the musicians in playing works by beethoven , brahms and elgar . the concert will be a rare occasion , as no other western orchestra of this size has played in iran since the islamic revolution in 1979 .
last year , osnabrück hosted the tehran symphony orchestra , who performed to a packed audience in the western german city .
the exchange is part of osnabrück 's orient festival . in view of the ongoing political tensions between iran and the west , the orchestra 's concerts were aimed at improving inter-cultural dialogue , said the festival 's director michael dreyer . " it is important to me that this is not a one-time event , but rather the beginning of a long-term cultural cooperation , " dreyer said .

" i am very glad that the women tried it and it was fine .
what is most important is the music . " the orchestra 's directors said the visit was aimed purely at cultural understanding , and not politics .
dreyer said he had rejected a request by three german mps to join the tour in order to keep the trip focused on music and not politics . the concerts are expected to draw large crowds . classical music experiencing a resurgence in iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karajan conducted the berlin philharmonic for 35 years prior to the islamic revolution , foreign orchestras performed regularly in iran , including the berlin philharmonic and its legendary conductor herbert von karajan .

but the outlook for the coming six months is still marked by optimism . in its monthly survey released on tuesday , the ifo institute for economic research 's business climate index dropped for the third month in a row in august , edging down to 105.2 points from 106.4 points in july . the munich-based ifo said turbulence on world financial markets in recent weeks had probably clouded executives ' mood although they were generally optimistic about the economic upswing in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the 17.3 billion-euro -lrb- $ 23.3 billion -rrb- rescue of sachsen lb was the second bail-out a german bank " the outlook for the coming six months is still marked by optimism , albeit somewhat weaker , " ifo president hans-werner sinn said in a press release .
" here the turbulences in financial markets may have played a role . " germany has borne the brunt of the european fallout from problems stemming from sub-prime us home loans .
earlier in the month , germany 's sachsen lb bank and ikb bank almost collapsed , requiring major bailouts . in an interview with deutsche welle , the director of the hamburg world economic institute , thomas straubhaar , said that although the us home loans crisis had hit some institutions hard , germany 's " positive employment market " was strong enough to maintain the current business climate .
" the business climate is still robust , " straubhaar said .
" employment will continue to develop strongly , and the number of unemployed could fall to around the three million mark , potentially even lower . "
exports expected to drop ifo said the six-month outlook had weakened in the manufacturing sector and it also reported a fall in the business climate for exports , the motor of europe 's biggest economy . " the optimism has also faded for the export business , despite the euro 's decline in value , " ifo president sinn said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany primarily exports manufactured goods and machine tools " employment will also rise according to companies ' plans but somewhat less robustly than foreseen in recent months . " in construction , the decline in the business climate index evident since the beginning of the year continued in august after the interruption in july . the business climate in wholesaling has stabilized .
the firms assessed their current situation slightly more pessimistically than in july , however with regard to the six-month outlook they are somewhat more optimistic . for its monthly index , ifo surveys some 7,000 companies across various sectors about their assessment of the current business climate and their expectation for the next six months . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

abdullah gül was elected turkey 's next president on tuesday .
but calls by prime minister erdogan for gül 's critics to give up their citizenship have the media wondering what direction turkey will take . prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has come under sharp criticism for calling on turks who refuse to accept former islamist abdullah gül 's presidency to leave the country .
the turkish parliament on tuesday elected the current foreign minister as the country 's next president . gül had failed in an attempt to win the presidency earlier this year . " those -lrb- turks -rrb- who do not recognize abdullah gül as their president should give up their turkish citizenship , " erdogan said in an interview with television station kanal d. erdogan was commenting on an article by the prominent columnist bekir coskun from turkey 's largest daily hürriyet .
coskun had written that gül 's presidency would mean the end of the secular state in turkey - a fear shared by the country 's secular elite . " gül will not be my president , " coskun wrote last week .
erdogan 's ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- nominated gül for the presidency . government terror ? after the akp victory in general elections on july 22 , erdogan had promised to be " everyone 's prime minister . "
many observers had hoped he would embrace the highly polarized society as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister abdullah gül will become the country 's next president yet according to yüksel isik from the progressive journalists association , the prime minister 's statement showed that press freedom was still a major challenge in turkey . " the prime minister is taking an exclusionary stance against a prominent journalist , bekir coskun , as if he is ' the other ' , " isik said .
" if local governors follow the prime minister 's behavior and try to pressure journalists in local regions , this would mean the total terrorization of turkey by this government . " in a separate move , the mass circulation hürriyet fired columnist emin cölasan last week , who is known for his highly critical articles on the akp-led government .
according to isik , these events showed that the problem of press freedom was more serious than it appeared . " many of our journalist colleagues have been fired without any just cause , only for their criticism of governmental policies , " isik said . harming turkey 's eu ambitions ? lucio leante has been working in turkey since 2001 for the italian ansa news agency .
he said he thinks that critical journalists such as cölasan are fired because of intricate relations between media owners and the government . the interests of hürriyet publisher the dogan group with the government could have influenced the paper 's management to fire cölasan , leante said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's position towards the press does not conform to eu standards " we ca n't prove it , but the dogan group 's many businesses and links with the state is limiting freedom of press , " leante said . leante added that erdogan 's inability to endure criticism played an important role in stifling the press .
yet despite the prime minister 's harsh attitude toward journalists , cartoon artists and publishers , there was still support for him and his party for turkey 's ambitions to join the european union .
according to leante , western nations were putting turkey to the test . " i think turkey is going on an experiment in which international circles want to see if a moderate islamic conservative party like the akp can be permanently moderate and democratic , " leante said . he said that some western countries believed this " experiment " could serve as a kind of model for other countries in the middle east .
but he said he thought this was risky . " political islam is a contradiction in itself , " leante said .
" it is difficult for islam to prove itself democratic and moderate because political islam means extending religion to state problems .

abdullah gül was elected turkey 's next president on tuesday .
but calls by prime minister erdogan for gül 's critics to give up their citizenship have the media wondering what direction turkey will take . prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has come under sharp criticism for calling on turks who refuse to accept former islamist abdullah gül 's presidency to leave the country .
the turkish parliament on tuesday elected the current foreign minister as the country 's next president . gül had failed in an attempt to win the presidency earlier this year . " those -lrb- turks -rrb- who do not recognize abdullah gül as their president should give up their turkish citizenship , " erdogan said in an interview with television station kanal d. erdogan was commenting on an article by the prominent columnist bekir coskun from turkey 's largest daily hürriyet .
coskun had written that gül 's presidency would mean the end of the secular state in turkey - a fear shared by the country 's secular elite . " gül will not be my president , " coskun wrote last week .
erdogan 's ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- nominated gül for the presidency . government terror ? after the akp victory in general elections on july 22 , erdogan had promised to be " everyone 's prime minister . "
many observers had hoped he would embrace the highly polarized society as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister abdullah gül will become the country 's next president yet according to yüksel isik from the progressive journalists association , the prime minister 's statement showed that press freedom was still a major challenge in turkey . " the prime minister is taking an exclusionary stance against a prominent journalist , bekir coskun , as if he is ' the other ' , " isik said .
" if local governors follow the prime minister 's behavior and try to pressure journalists in local regions , this would mean the total terrorization of turkey by this government . " in a separate move , the mass circulation hürriyet fired columnist emin cölasan last week , who is known for his highly critical articles on the akp-led government .
according to isik , these events showed that the problem of press freedom was more serious than it appeared . " many of our journalist colleagues have been fired without any just cause , only for their criticism of governmental policies , " isik said . harming turkey 's eu ambitions ? lucio leante has been working in turkey since 2001 for the italian ansa news agency .
he said he thinks that critical journalists such as cölasan are fired because of intricate relations between media owners and the government . the interests of hürriyet publisher the dogan group with the government could have influenced the paper 's management to fire cölasan , leante said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's position towards the press does not conform to eu standards " we ca n't prove it , but the dogan group 's many businesses and links with the state is limiting freedom of press , " leante said . leante added that erdogan 's inability to endure criticism played an important role in stifling the press .
yet despite the prime minister 's harsh attitude toward journalists , cartoon artists and publishers , there was still support for him and his party for turkey 's ambitions to join the european union .
according to leante , western nations were putting turkey to the test . " i think turkey is going on an experiment in which international circles want to see if a moderate islamic conservative party like the akp can be permanently moderate and democratic , " leante said . he said that some western countries believed this " experiment " could serve as a kind of model for other countries in the middle east .
but he said he thought this was risky . " political islam is a contradiction in itself , " leante said .
" it is difficult for islam to prove itself democratic and moderate because political islam means extending religion to state problems .

the move has some observers scratching their heads , and others hoping for the best . the reputation of german wine has been on the rise in recent years .
no longer viewed solely as the producer of painfully sweet whites , the country is starting to enjoy a worldwide reputation as a producer of subtle and flavourful rieslings , burgundies and müller-thurgaus , among others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small growers are still important in german wine regions so it may not seem like the ideal time for two of the country 's most respected wine makers to hop into bed with the country 's number one discount supermarket chain . after all , by continuously slashing prices , aldi has lowered the average price of wine on its shelves from over two euros -lrb- $ 2.70 -rrb- for a 0.75 liter bottle in 2001 , to 1.73 euros a bottle today , according to ernst büscher , a spokesman for the german wine institute , an industry association . " i expect to sell out " but partnering with aldi is exactly what german winemakers raimond prüm , of the mosel region , and fritz keller , from kaiserstuhl in baden , deemed the right thing to do . back in june , keller struck a deal with aldi to produce weissburgunder and spätburgunder wines .
to produce enough wine , he will cooperate with some 1,000 local vintners , who have to adhere to a strict set of quality criteria in order to be able to contribute to the cuvee .
the wines will be priced to sell at around seven or eight euros . raimund prüm , whose best rieslings can sell for hundreds of euros per bottle , also struck a deal to release a cuvee for aldi .
for his release of between 300,000 and a half a million bottles , prüm will use grapes of his own , as well as selected other vineyards .
the other grapes must be grown in accordance with rigid growing , production and territory criteria . given the relatively small production , and the price of between six and eight euros per bottle , prüm told germany 's die welt newspaper , " i expect the wine to sell out in a number of hours . " win-win situation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in rudesheim , vinyards are also hiking paths for prüm , the situation is win-win .
for one thing , thanks to aldi 's massive distribution system , his wines can be appreciated by the widest possible audience . " the wine will be something special for the discounter to offer , and will show just how high a quality wine the mosel region can produce , " prüm said . statistics are unreliable , but the german wine institute estimates retail grocery sales in general account for 70 percent of wine sales in germany ; 30 percent of that amount can be chalked up to aldi sales alone .
wine specialty shops , in contrast , account for just 3 to 5 percent of sales . ironically , getting the invitation to sell wine through a giant discounter can be seen as an honor in itself , according to the german wine institute 's büscher .
aldi has promoted high-quality , higher-priced italian and spanish wines in the past ; now its germany 's turn . " that aldi is now opening this price class for german wines shows that the image of german wines has improved , both here and internationally , " büscher said . but nils vahrenwald , the owner of weinhaus süd , a mid-sized distributor of international wines in cologne , is skeptical about the wine makers who are in league with rock-bottom retailers . good for the industry ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone knows when it 's time for picking " i do n't understand why they 're doing it - these winemakers do n't need to be on the shelves next to the cheapest mass-produced stuff , " vahrenwald said .
" i honestly do not know how they are making this wine , but they must be buying the cheapest grapes , working on it a little in production , and then selling it for a great profit . " in the end they are n't doing german wine a favor , " said vahrenwald , who noted that he has spent years trying to boost the image of german wines among his customers , even back when it was out of fashion . but ulrich sauter , an editor at germany 's wein gourmet magazine , said he does think both parties stand to gain from the deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi has had a huge influence on german wine tastes " from the side of the discounters , they want to get more prestige , " he said .
" the producers want more sales .
and if aldi is ready to have more expensive wines on its shelves that could be an improvement for the wine growers . " " i agree that it 's a paradoxical situation , but i do n't think people like fritz keller are doing this just to make a profit , " sauter said .
" i think he is really concerned about the structure of the small wine villages in his region .
if the small wine growers in kaiserstuhl , in baden , in the mosel , disappear , these regions would change entirely . " finally , sauter said , only time will tell whether it 's a good move or a bad one for the german wine industry . " we 'll only know after we taste the wines they make , " he said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i expect to sell out " but partnering with aldi is exactly what german winemakers raimond prüm , of the mosel region , and fritz keller , from kaiserstuhl in baden , deemed the right thing to do . back in june , keller struck a deal with aldi to produce weissburgunder and spätburgunder wines .
to produce enough wine , he will cooperate with some 1,000 local vintners , who have to adhere to a strict set of quality criteria in order to be able to contribute to the cuvee .
the wines will be priced to sell at around seven or eight euros . raimund prüm , whose best rieslings can sell for hundreds of euros per bottle , also struck a deal to release a cuvee for aldi .
for his release of between 300,000 and a half a million bottles , prüm will use grapes of his own , as well as selected other vineyards .
the other grapes must be grown in accordance with rigid growing , production and territory criteria . given the relatively small production , and the price of between six and eight euros per bottle , prüm told germany 's die welt newspaper , " i expect the wine to sell out in a number of hours .

wine specialty shops , in contrast , account for just 3 to 5 percent of sales . ironically , getting the invitation to sell wine through a giant discounter can be seen as an honor in itself , according to the german wine institute 's büscher .
aldi has promoted high-quality , higher-priced italian and spanish wines in the past ; now its germany 's turn .

abdullah gül was elected turkey 's next president on tuesday .
but calls by prime minister erdogan for gül 's critics to give up their citizenship have the media wondering what direction turkey will take . prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has come under sharp criticism for calling on turks who refuse to accept former islamist abdullah gül 's presidency to leave the country .
the turkish parliament on tuesday elected the current foreign minister as the country 's next president . gül had failed in an attempt to win the presidency earlier this year . " those -lrb- turks -rrb- who do not recognize abdullah gül as their president should give up their turkish citizenship , " erdogan said in an interview with television station kanal d. erdogan was commenting on an article by the prominent columnist bekir coskun from turkey 's largest daily hürriyet .
coskun had written that gül 's presidency would mean the end of the secular state in turkey - a fear shared by the country 's secular elite . " gül will not be my president , " coskun wrote last week .
erdogan 's ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- nominated gül for the presidency . government terror ? after the akp victory in general elections on july 22 , erdogan had promised to be " everyone 's prime minister . "
many observers had hoped he would embrace the highly polarized society as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister abdullah gül will become the country 's next president yet according to yüksel isik from the progressive journalists association , the prime minister 's statement showed that press freedom was still a major challenge in turkey . " the prime minister is taking an exclusionary stance against a prominent journalist , bekir coskun , as if he is ' the other ' , " isik said .
" if local governors follow the prime minister 's behavior and try to pressure journalists in local regions , this would mean the total terrorization of turkey by this government . " in a separate move , the mass circulation hürriyet fired columnist emin cölasan last week , who is known for his highly critical articles on the akp-led government .
according to isik , these events showed that the problem of press freedom was more serious than it appeared . " many of our journalist colleagues have been fired without any just cause , only for their criticism of governmental policies , " isik said . harming turkey 's eu ambitions ? lucio leante has been working in turkey since 2001 for the italian ansa news agency .
he said he thinks that critical journalists such as cölasan are fired because of intricate relations between media owners and the government . the interests of hürriyet publisher the dogan group with the government could have influenced the paper 's management to fire cölasan , leante said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's position towards the press does not conform to eu standards " we ca n't prove it , but the dogan group 's many businesses and links with the state is limiting freedom of press , " leante said . leante added that erdogan 's inability to endure criticism played an important role in stifling the press .
yet despite the prime minister 's harsh attitude toward journalists , cartoon artists and publishers , there was still support for him and his party for turkey 's ambitions to join the european union .
according to leante , western nations were putting turkey to the test . " i think turkey is going on an experiment in which international circles want to see if a moderate islamic conservative party like the akp can be permanently moderate and democratic , " leante said . he said that some western countries believed this " experiment " could serve as a kind of model for other countries in the middle east .
but he said he thought this was risky . " political islam is a contradiction in itself , " leante said .
" it is difficult for islam to prove itself democratic and moderate because political islam means extending religion to state problems . " for turkey 's journalists , the big question now is whether the islamist-rooted akp will use its majority power to continue criticizing the press or to open itself up to different views . berivan orucoglu -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the wine will be something special for the discounter to offer , and will show just how high a quality wine the mosel region can produce , " prüm said . statistics are unreliable , but the german wine institute estimates retail grocery sales in general account for 70 percent of wine sales in germany ; 30 percent of that amount can be chalked up to aldi sales alone .
wine specialty shops , in contrast , account for just 3 to 5 percent of sales . ironically , getting the invitation to sell wine through a giant discounter can be seen as an honor in itself , according to the german wine institute 's büscher .
aldi has promoted high-quality , higher-priced italian and spanish wines in the past ; now its germany 's turn . " that aldi is now opening this price class for german wines shows that the image of german wines has improved , both here and internationally , " büscher said . but nils vahrenwald , the owner of weinhaus süd , a mid-sized distributor of international wines in cologne , is skeptical about the wine makers who are in league with rock-bottom retailers . good for the industry ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone knows when it 's time for picking " i do n't understand why they 're doing it - these winemakers do n't need to be on the shelves next to the cheapest mass-produced stuff , " vahrenwald said .
" i honestly do not know how they are making this wine , but they must be buying the cheapest grapes , working on it a little in production , and then selling it for a great profit . " in the end they are n't doing german wine a favor , " said vahrenwald , who noted that he has spent years trying to boost the image of german wines among his customers , even back when it was out of fashion . but ulrich sauter , an editor at germany 's wein gourmet magazine , said he does think both parties stand to gain from the deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi has had a huge influence on german wine tastes " from the side of the discounters , they want to get more prestige , " he said .
" the producers want more sales .
and if aldi is ready to have more expensive wines on its shelves that could be an improvement for the wine growers . " " i agree that it 's a paradoxical situation , but i do n't think people like fritz keller are doing this just to make a profit , " sauter said .
" i think he is really concerned about the structure of the small wine villages in his region .
if the small wine growers in kaiserstuhl , in baden , in the mosel , disappear , these regions would change entirely . " finally , sauter said , only time will tell whether it 's a good move or a bad one for the german wine industry . " we 'll only know after we taste the wines they make , " he said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the calls for caution arise from fears the politicians will suffer an embarrassing defeat as they did in 2003 , when the constitutional court , based in the city of karlsruhe , rejected a case put forward jointly by both houses of parliament .
since pictures of the eight indian beaten up at mügeln were flashed around the world , other racist attacks have been reported , revealing a drift to the violent right among those youths that see themselves as left out of germany 's once-again rising prosperity .
" studies show that xenophobia , anti-semitism and contempt for the person are on the rise , " the berliner zeitung commented tuesday .
all mainstream politicians abhor the npd -lrb- german national democratic party -rrb- , which garnered only 1.6 per cent of the vote in the 2005 parliamentary elections and thus is excluded from the national parliament , although it has seats in the parliaments of two eastern states .
" i believe that even those skeptical -lrb- of a renewed banning attempt -rrb- regard the npd as unconstitutional , " spd home affairs parliamentary spokesman dieter wiefelspütz told reporters tuesday .
spd seemingly ignoring previous failed attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court threw out the last case but securing a ban under germany 's democratic constitution - which strenuously guards freedom of speech - is another matter .
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- parliamentary caucus , believes that parliament faces " another gigantic embarrassment " if it tries again .
the main problem lies in the numerous undercover agents operating within the npd to monitor its activities .
the activities of these agents - one of them reached the top of the hierarchy and is said to have authored an anti-semitic pamphlet - led the constitutional court to throw the case out in the preliminary stages four years ago .
" it was one of the bitterest defeats that the politicians have ever been handed by karlsruhe - and it was their own fault , " the berliner zeitung commented .
lengthy process could endanger police operations one person well placed to know about the undercover agents , cdu interior minister wolfgang schaüble , warns of " great procedural risk . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police infiltrators would be at risk during a court ruling the legal process leading up to a constitutional court ruling could take years , experts warn .
police and the special authority charged with the protection of the constitution are reported to be aghast at the prospect of having to withdraw their undercover agents for as long as this .
but wiefelspütz is adamant that parliament should try again .
" i call on all parties to engage in a debate over how this can be achieved , " he says .
case to ban npd " doomed to failure " say greens the spd , currently the junior partner in merkel 's grand coalition , finds itself alone on this issue , with even their former partner in government , the greens , opposed .

" their members would still be there and would look for new organizational structures .
much more important are initiatives in civil society against the dissemination of rightwing ideology , " greens parliamentary spokesman volker beck says .

the calls for caution arise from fears the politicians will suffer an embarrassing defeat as they did in 2003 , when the constitutional court , based in the city of karlsruhe , rejected a case put forward jointly by both houses of parliament .
since pictures of the eight indian beaten up at mügeln were flashed around the world , other racist attacks have been reported , revealing a drift to the violent right among those youths that see themselves as left out of germany 's once-again rising prosperity .
" studies show that xenophobia , anti-semitism and contempt for the person are on the rise , " the berliner zeitung commented tuesday .
all mainstream politicians abhor the npd -lrb- german national democratic party -rrb- , which garnered only 1.6 per cent of the vote in the 2005 parliamentary elections and thus is excluded from the national parliament , although it has seats in the parliaments of two eastern states .
" i believe that even those skeptical -lrb- of a renewed banning attempt -rrb- regard the npd as unconstitutional , " spd home affairs parliamentary spokesman dieter wiefelspütz told reporters tuesday .
spd seemingly ignoring previous failed attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court threw out the last case but securing a ban under germany 's democratic constitution - which strenuously guards freedom of speech - is another matter .
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- parliamentary caucus , believes that parliament faces " another gigantic embarrassment " if it tries again .
the main problem lies in the numerous undercover agents operating within the npd to monitor its activities .
the activities of these agents - one of them reached the top of the hierarchy and is said to have authored an anti-semitic pamphlet - led the constitutional court to throw the case out in the preliminary stages four years ago .
" it was one of the bitterest defeats that the politicians have ever been handed by karlsruhe - and it was their own fault , " the berliner zeitung commented .
lengthy process could endanger police operations one person well placed to know about the undercover agents , cdu interior minister wolfgang schaüble , warns of " great procedural risk . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police infiltrators would be at risk during a court ruling the legal process leading up to a constitutional court ruling could take years , experts warn .
police and the special authority charged with the protection of the constitution are reported to be aghast at the prospect of having to withdraw their undercover agents for as long as this .
but wiefelspütz is adamant that parliament should try again .
" i call on all parties to engage in a debate over how this can be achieved , " he says .
case to ban npd " doomed to failure " say greens the spd , currently the junior partner in merkel 's grand coalition , finds itself alone on this issue , with even their former partner in government , the greens , opposed .
the problem of rightwing extremism will not be resolved by a legal process that is in any case doomed to failure , the party warns .
" their members would still be there and would look for new organizational structures .
much more important are initiatives in civil society against the dissemination of rightwing ideology , " greens parliamentary spokesman volker beck says .
instead , the party blames merkel 's government for fiscal cutbacks that have helped return the budget to balance but have closed down many social programs .

abdullah gül was elected turkey 's next president on tuesday .
but calls by prime minister erdogan for gül 's critics to give up their citizenship have the media wondering what direction turkey will take . prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has come under sharp criticism for calling on turks who refuse to accept former islamist abdullah gül 's presidency to leave the country .
the turkish parliament on tuesday elected the current foreign minister as the country 's next president . gül had failed in an attempt to win the presidency earlier this year . " those -lrb- turks -rrb- who do not recognize abdullah gül as their president should give up their turkish citizenship , " erdogan said in an interview with television station kanal d. erdogan was commenting on an article by the prominent columnist bekir coskun from turkey 's largest daily hürriyet .
coskun had written that gül 's presidency would mean the end of the secular state in turkey - a fear shared by the country 's secular elite . " gül will not be my president , " coskun wrote last week .
erdogan 's ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- nominated gül for the presidency . government terror ? after the akp victory in general elections on july 22 , erdogan had promised to be " everyone 's prime minister . "
many observers had hoped he would embrace the highly polarized society as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister abdullah gül will become the country 's next president yet according to yüksel isik from the progressive journalists association , the prime minister 's statement showed that press freedom was still a major challenge in turkey . " the prime minister is taking an exclusionary stance against a prominent journalist , bekir coskun , as if he is ' the other ' , " isik said .
" if local governors follow the prime minister 's behavior and try to pressure journalists in local regions , this would mean the total terrorization of turkey by this government . " in a separate move , the mass circulation hürriyet fired columnist emin cölasan last week , who is known for his highly critical articles on the akp-led government .
according to isik , these events showed that the problem of press freedom was more serious than it appeared . " many of our journalist colleagues have been fired without any just cause , only for their criticism of governmental policies , " isik said . harming turkey 's eu ambitions ? lucio leante has been working in turkey since 2001 for the italian ansa news agency .
he said he thinks that critical journalists such as cölasan are fired because of intricate relations between media owners and the government . the interests of hürriyet publisher the dogan group with the government could have influenced the paper 's management to fire cölasan , leante said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's position towards the press does not conform to eu standards " we ca n't prove it , but the dogan group 's many businesses and links with the state is limiting freedom of press , " leante said . leante added that erdogan 's inability to endure criticism played an important role in stifling the press .
yet despite the prime minister 's harsh attitude toward journalists , cartoon artists and publishers , there was still support for him and his party for turkey 's ambitions to join the european union .
according to leante , western nations were putting turkey to the test . " i think turkey is going on an experiment in which international circles want to see if a moderate islamic conservative party like the akp can be permanently moderate and democratic , " leante said . he said that some western countries believed this " experiment " could serve as a kind of model for other countries in the middle east .
but he said he thought this was risky . " political islam is a contradiction in itself , " leante said .
" it is difficult for islam to prove itself democratic and moderate because political islam means extending religion to state problems . " for turkey 's journalists , the big question now is whether the islamist-rooted akp will use its majority power to continue criticizing the press or to open itself up to different views . berivan orucoglu -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

their younger brother ayhan sürücü , who was a juvenile at the time , was convicted by the same berlin court to nine years and three months in prison for gunning down hatin on a berlin street in 2005 .
the federal court of justice in leipzig has now ruled a retrial on the grounds that the berlin court ignored evidence given by the youngest brother 's ex-girlfriend . she had told the berlin court ayhan had confided that one of his older brothers had obtained the murder weapon .
she also said the other brother was nearby when the murder took place to help ayhan . the berlin court originally ruled that evidence conflicted with other statements . conviction still holds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hatin sürücü was shot three times in the head today 's ruling by the leipzig court does not affect the conviction of ayhan sürücü , who said he killed his sister because he felt dishonored by her lifestyle . hatin sürücü grew up in germany but was forced into a marriage with a cousin who lived in turkey .
after giving birth to a son in berlin , hatin subsequently refused to return to turkey . six months later , she moved out of her parent 's home and began to train as an electrician , turning her back on her conservative muslim family .
she even stopped wearing her headscarf . her murder shocked germany and triggered angry debate about the integration of the estimated two million people of turkish origin who live in the country . dw staff -lrb- kh -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he told the country in a press conference earlier this month that he had cut loose from his past and fully believed in the separation of state and religion - a principle he vowed to defend as president . many analysts have said that gül 's experience as foreign minister over the past five years made him well-suited for the presidency .
this background would play an active role in furthering turkey 's european ambitions during his seven-year term , analysts said . european commission president jose manuel barroso said tuesday that the election of gül could provide fresh impetus to ankara 's eu membership talks . the election and the arrival to power of a new government " provides an opportunity to give fresh , immediate and positive impetus to the accession process to the european union through progress in a number of key areas , " barroso said in a statement . barroso said : " i am confident that you will fulfil your task with a strong sense of duty and commitment to your country and fellow citizens .

german organizers hope the event will contribute to inter-cultural understanding . the 60-member osnabrück symphony has arrived in tehran and is preparing to go on stage on wednesday and thursday in the iranian capital .
conductor hermann bäumer will lead the musicians in playing works by beethoven , brahms and elgar . the concert will be a rare occasion , as no other western orchestra of this size has played in iran since the islamic revolution in 1979 .
last year , osnabrück hosted the tehran symphony orchestra , who performed to a packed audience in the western german city .
the exchange is part of osnabrück 's orient festival . in view of the ongoing political tensions between iran and the west , the orchestra 's concerts were aimed at improving inter-cultural dialogue , said the festival 's director michael dreyer . " it is important to me that this is not a one-time event , but rather the beginning of a long-term cultural cooperation , " dreyer said .
six iranian musicians will support the german orchestra in this week 's concerts , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : music is a language everyone understands " i hope that such cultural exchange projects will soon become normality , even between the west and the islamic world , " dreyer said .
he told reporters in tehran that the exchange hoped to " show to both countries that there are lots of similarities between us and no reason to fear each other . " conductor bäumer said music was the only language everybody in the world could speak and understand . " i 'm sure that making music together will change things , " bäumer said in tehran .
" every human being can be reached by music . " politics are not part of it dreyer visited tehran several times over the past year in order to prepare the concerts .
the trip has been fully coordinated with iran 's ministry of culture and islamic guidance . " it was all but a mission impossible , " dreyer said in an interview with german news agency dpa prior to his departure .
" we only managed it because high-ranking clerical and political iranians lobbied for it . " all of the female musicians will be required to wear islamic headscarves to obey iran 's dress code . " the women are not used to playing in hijab , " bäumer said .
" i am very glad that the women tried it and it was fine .
what is most important is the music . " the orchestra 's directors said the visit was aimed purely at cultural understanding , and not politics .
dreyer said he had rejected a request by three german mps to join the tour in order to keep the trip focused on music and not politics . the concerts are expected to draw large crowds . classical music experiencing a resurgence in iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karajan conducted the berlin philharmonic for 35 years prior to the islamic revolution , foreign orchestras performed regularly in iran , including the berlin philharmonic and its legendary conductor herbert von karajan .
but the tehran orchestra was dissolved following the revolution . only in the past decade have attempts been made to revive classical music in iran .
tehran 's symphony orchestra gives regular concerts , mixing western classics with compositions by iranian composers . the country 's ruling clerics tolerate classical , traditional iranian , as well as instrumental versions of western music .
however , pop music with singing is strictly forbidden . the festival is financed by various cultural organizations in osnabrück , as well as the german foreign office .

" i am very glad that the women tried it and it was fine .
what is most important is the music . " the orchestra 's directors said the visit was aimed purely at cultural understanding , and not politics .

the deal will cost the dfb millions it could have earned from nike . the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and adidas , the traditional supplier of equipment to the german national soccer team , have extended their association until 2018 .
" the partnership is something special , and today is a historic occasion , " said adidas ceo herbert hainer after the agreement was made public .
" it was a matter of harmoniously balancing tradition , legal concerns and money , " said dfb president theo zwanziger .
the two soccer powers have been partners since germany won its first world cup title in 1954 .
but they have been at loggerheads for months , after adidas rival nike made a much more lucrative sponsorship offer .
adidas had claimed that its existing supplier agreement with the dfb was effectively extended in august 2006 until at least 2014 .

a court of arbitration was called in , which suggested the two sides reach a compromise .

adidas has reportedly also agreed to commit 5 million euros to support youth and women 's soccer programs .
the deal will cost the dfb millions of euros .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 28.08.2007 social democrats press for npd ban despite warnings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd is opposed by all mainstream parties but many see huge problems with a ban german social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are pressing for a ban on the far-right npd in the face of warnings from other quarters that the german constitutional court will throw out the case as it did four years ago . the main impulse for a renewed attempt to outlaw the party derives from the assault by a 50-strong mob on a group of eight indians in the small eastern german town of mügeln on august 18 .
the calls for caution arise from fears the politicians will suffer an embarrassing defeat as they did in 2003 , when the constitutional court , based in the city of karlsruhe , rejected a case put forward jointly by both houses of parliament .
since pictures of the eight indian beaten up at mügeln were flashed around the world , other racist attacks have been reported , revealing a drift to the violent right among those youths that see themselves as left out of germany 's once-again rising prosperity .
" studies show that xenophobia , anti-semitism and contempt for the person are on the rise , " the berliner zeitung commented tuesday .
all mainstream politicians abhor the npd -lrb- german national democratic party -rrb- , which garnered only 1.6 per cent of the vote in the 2005 parliamentary elections and thus is excluded from the national parliament , although it has seats in the parliaments of two eastern states .
" i believe that even those skeptical -lrb- of a renewed banning attempt -rrb- regard the npd as unconstitutional , " spd home affairs parliamentary spokesman dieter wiefelspütz told reporters tuesday .
spd seemingly ignoring previous failed attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court threw out the last case but securing a ban under germany 's democratic constitution - which strenuously guards freedom of speech - is another matter .
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- parliamentary caucus , believes that parliament faces " another gigantic embarrassment " if it tries again .
the main problem lies in the numerous undercover agents operating within the npd to monitor its activities .
the activities of these agents - one of them reached the top of the hierarchy and is said to have authored an anti-semitic pamphlet - led the constitutional court to throw the case out in the preliminary stages four years ago .
" it was one of the bitterest defeats that the politicians have ever been handed by karlsruhe - and it was their own fault , " the berliner zeitung commented .
lengthy process could endanger police operations one person well placed to know about the undercover agents , cdu interior minister wolfgang schaüble , warns of " great procedural risk . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police infiltrators would be at risk during a court ruling the legal process leading up to a constitutional court ruling could take years , experts warn .
police and the special authority charged with the protection of the constitution are reported to be aghast at the prospect of having to withdraw their undercover agents for as long as this .
but wiefelspütz is adamant that parliament should try again .
" i call on all parties to engage in a debate over how this can be achieved , " he says .
case to ban npd " doomed to failure " say greens the spd , currently the junior partner in merkel 's grand coalition , finds itself alone on this issue , with even their former partner in government , the greens , opposed .
the problem of rightwing extremism will not be resolved by a legal process that is in any case doomed to failure , the party warns .
" their members would still be there and would look for new organizational structures .
much more important are initiatives in civil society against the dissemination of rightwing ideology , " greens parliamentary spokesman volker beck says .
instead , the party blames merkel 's government for fiscal cutbacks that have helped return the budget to balance but have closed down many social programs .
" the federal government has to demonstrate that it can do something else besides push through cuts , " beck says . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the calls for caution arise from fears the politicians will suffer an embarrassing defeat as they did in 2003 , when the constitutional court , based in the city of karlsruhe , rejected a case put forward jointly by both houses of parliament .
since pictures of the eight indian beaten up at mügeln were flashed around the world , other racist attacks have been reported , revealing a drift to the violent right among those youths that see themselves as left out of germany 's once-again rising prosperity .

wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- parliamentary caucus , believes that parliament faces " another gigantic embarrassment " if it tries again .
the main problem lies in the numerous undercover agents operating within the npd to monitor its activities .
the activities of these agents - one of them reached the top of the hierarchy and is said to have authored an anti-semitic pamphlet - led the constitutional court to throw the case out in the preliminary stages four years ago .
" it was one of the bitterest defeats that the politicians have ever been handed by karlsruhe - and it was their own fault , " the berliner zeitung commented .

she reminded beijing that the west would like to see progress on freedom of the press and other human rights issues . merkel began tuesday by meeting with representatives of the chinese media - including four prominent figures critical of the government in beijing .
the meeting was a signal of germany 's support for more press freedom in china . li datong , the former publisher of a supplement to the china youth daily newspaper , was full of praise for merkel . " the meeting shows that the chancellor attaches great significance to democracy and freedom of speech in china , " li told german news agency dpa . later , at a speech to china 's academy of social sciences , merkel underscored western concerns about the status of civil liberties in china . " from our perspective , the topic of human rights is of decisive importance , " merkel said in her speech .
" basically this means nothing else than that the dignity of every individual human being can not be compromised .
i think we would do well to keep discussing this with one another . " increased scrutiny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahead of 2008 , freedom of the press has become a hot issue for beijing merkel reminded the chinese government that , with the 2008 summer olympics fast approaching , the eyes of the world will be on beijing . " the world will be looking at china to a greater extent than it has in past years , " merkel said .
" and people will also be looking at how china presents itself in terms of freedom of speech and freedom of the press . " chinese critics of beijing welcomed merkel 's remarks . " unlike her predecessor gerhard schröder , angela merkel does not run and hide from this topic , " former university professor and dissident liu xiaobo told deutsche welle .
" she tells it like it is .
the pressure she 's put on the chinese government has already had significant effect . " press freedom and piracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel suggested to wu that china look to germany as a model merkel also raised the issue of freedom of the press at a meeting with china 's head of parliament , wu bangguo . dpa cited unnamed sources from the delegations at that meeting as saying that merkel had called for china to guarantee freedom of the press by law . but civil liberties were n't the only contentious topic merkel raised on tuesday .
at her speech before the academy of social scienes , merkel also criticized chinese piracy of western products and , in particular , automobiles . " if suddenly a car turns up that looks like a smart but is n't one , but rather a copy produced by not entirely legal means , then that 's not good , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 28.08.2007 gül wins presidential vote in turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gül can now officially say hello to the turkish presidency the turkish parliament on tuesday elected foreign minister gül to become the country 's next president .
the vote had pitted secularists and the ruling islamist-rooted justice and development party against each other . abdullah gül is the first former islamist to become turkey 's president in the secular but predominantly muslim country 's modern history .
public opinion in turkey has been sharply divided over gül 's allegiance to the country 's basic tenets . gül 's supporters consider him to be a moderate politician who has backed far-reaching democratic and human rights reforms , enabling turkey to start accession talks with the european union in 2005 .
yet staunch secularists see gül as a wolf in sheep 's clothing , bent on pushing what they consider as the ruling justice and development party 's -lrb- akp -rrb- plans to dismantle the country 's secular system . however , gül has publicly stressed in recent weeks that such plans were not on his agenda .
he told the country in a press conference earlier this month that he had cut loose from his past and fully believed in the separation of state and religion - a principle he vowed to defend as president . many analysts have said that gül 's experience as foreign minister over the past five years made him well-suited for the presidency .
this background would play an active role in furthering turkey 's european ambitions during his seven-year term , analysts said . european commission president jose manuel barroso said tuesday that the election of gül could provide fresh impetus to ankara 's eu membership talks . the election and the arrival to power of a new government " provides an opportunity to give fresh , immediate and positive impetus to the accession process to the european union through progress in a number of key areas , " barroso said in a statement . barroso said : " i am confident that you will fulfil your task with a strong sense of duty and commitment to your country and fellow citizens . " german chancellor angela merkel also sent a message of congratulation to gül . germany and turkey were " important partners " and linked by friendship , merkel said . " i am certain that you will dedicate yourself in your new office to deepening our relations , for the good of europe and the atlantic alliance , " gül 's wife not to attend swearing-in ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gül 's wife hayrunisa is a staunch defender of her right to wear a headscarf gül 's bid to become president had not only become a controversial issue due to his past involvement in islamist groups .
in addition , the fact that his wife harunisa wears an islamic-style headscarf had alarmed turkey 's secular elite .
it is illegal for state employees and university students to wear headscarves in turkey . hayrunisa gül will become the first wife of a president to wear a headscarf , which secularist turks consider a symbol of muslim political militancy .
in a move designed to calm these fears , harunisa announced earlier on tuesday that she would not attend the swearing-in ceremony . gül has countered critics by saying that the headscarf was a personal choice , and that he , and not his wife , would become president . gül won a clear majority gül won 339 votes in the parliamentary poll on tuesday in the third round of voting .
during the previous two rounds last week , gül had failed to receive a two-thirds majority .
but for the third round , he needed just a simple majority of 276 votes in the 550-seat parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish parliament needed three rounds to elect gül the 56-year-old gül will be sworn in at a parliamentary ceremony later on tuesday , taking over from current president ahmet necdet sezer on tuesday night . the current foreign minister easily defeated sabahattin cakmakoglu with 70 votes and huseyin tayfur icli with 13 .
twenty-four parliamentarians voted " none of the above " and two votes were declared invalid . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

abdullah gül was elected turkey 's next president on tuesday .
but calls by prime minister erdogan for gül 's critics to give up their citizenship have the media wondering what direction turkey will take . prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has come under sharp criticism for calling on turks who refuse to accept former islamist abdullah gül 's presidency to leave the country .
the turkish parliament on tuesday elected the current foreign minister as the country 's next president . gül had failed in an attempt to win the presidency earlier this year . " those -lrb- turks -rrb- who do not recognize abdullah gül as their president should give up their turkish citizenship , " erdogan said in an interview with television station kanal d. erdogan was commenting on an article by the prominent columnist bekir coskun from turkey 's largest daily hürriyet .
coskun had written that gül 's presidency would mean the end of the secular state in turkey - a fear shared by the country 's secular elite . " gül will not be my president , " coskun wrote last week .
erdogan 's ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- nominated gül for the presidency . government terror ? after the akp victory in general elections on july 22 , erdogan had promised to be " everyone 's prime minister . "
many observers had hoped he would embrace the highly polarized society as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister abdullah gül will become the country 's next president yet according to yüksel isik from the progressive journalists association , the prime minister 's statement showed that press freedom was still a major challenge in turkey . " the prime minister is taking an exclusionary stance against a prominent journalist , bekir coskun , as if he is ' the other ' , " isik said .
" if local governors follow the prime minister 's behavior and try to pressure journalists in local regions , this would mean the total terrorization of turkey by this government . " in a separate move , the mass circulation hürriyet fired columnist emin cölasan last week , who is known for his highly critical articles on the akp-led government .
according to isik , these events showed that the problem of press freedom was more serious than it appeared . " many of our journalist colleagues have been fired without any just cause , only for their criticism of governmental policies , " isik said . harming turkey 's eu ambitions ? lucio leante has been working in turkey since 2001 for the italian ansa news agency .
he said he thinks that critical journalists such as cölasan are fired because of intricate relations between media owners and the government . the interests of hürriyet publisher the dogan group with the government could have influenced the paper 's management to fire cölasan , leante said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's position towards the press does not conform to eu standards " we ca n't prove it , but the dogan group 's many businesses and links with the state is limiting freedom of press , " leante said . leante added that erdogan 's inability to endure criticism played an important role in stifling the press .
yet despite the prime minister 's harsh attitude toward journalists , cartoon artists and publishers , there was still support for him and his party for turkey 's ambitions to join the european union .
according to leante , western nations were putting turkey to the test . " i think turkey is going on an experiment in which international circles want to see if a moderate islamic conservative party like the akp can be permanently moderate and democratic , " leante said . he said that some western countries believed this " experiment " could serve as a kind of model for other countries in the middle east .
but he said he thought this was risky . " political islam is a contradiction in itself , " leante said .
" it is difficult for islam to prove itself democratic and moderate because political islam means extending religion to state problems . " for turkey 's journalists , the big question now is whether the islamist-rooted akp will use its majority power to continue criticizing the press or to open itself up to different views . berivan orucoglu -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she reminded beijing that the west would like to see progress on freedom of the press and other human rights issues . merkel began tuesday by meeting with representatives of the chinese media - including four prominent figures critical of the government in beijing .
the meeting was a signal of germany 's support for more press freedom in china . li datong , the former publisher of a supplement to the china youth daily newspaper , was full of praise for merkel . " the meeting shows that the chancellor attaches great significance to democracy and freedom of speech in china , " li told german news agency dpa . later , at a speech to china 's academy of social sciences , merkel underscored western concerns about the status of civil liberties in china . " from our perspective , the topic of human rights is of decisive importance , " merkel said in her speech .
" basically this means nothing else than that the dignity of every individual human being can not be compromised .
i think we would do well to keep discussing this with one another . " increased scrutiny bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahead of 2008 , freedom of the press has become a hot issue for beijing merkel reminded the chinese government that , with the 2008 summer olympics fast approaching , the eyes of the world will be on beijing . " the world will be looking at china to a greater extent than it has in past years , " merkel said .
" and people will also be looking at how china presents itself in terms of freedom of speech and freedom of the press . " chinese critics of beijing welcomed merkel 's remarks . " unlike her predecessor gerhard schröder , angela merkel does not run and hide from this topic , " former university professor and dissident liu xiaobo told deutsche welle .
" she tells it like it is .
the pressure she 's put on the chinese government has already had significant effect . " press freedom and piracy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel suggested to wu that china look to germany as a model merkel also raised the issue of freedom of the press at a meeting with china 's head of parliament , wu bangguo . dpa cited unnamed sources from the delegations at that meeting as saying that merkel had called for china to guarantee freedom of the press by law . but civil liberties were n't the only contentious topic merkel raised on tuesday .
at her speech before the academy of social scienes , merkel also criticized chinese piracy of western products and , in particular , automobiles . " if suddenly a car turns up that looks like a smart but is n't one , but rather a copy produced by not entirely legal means , then that 's not good , " merkel said . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

abdullah gül was elected turkey 's next president on tuesday .
but calls by prime minister erdogan for gül 's critics to give up their citizenship have the media wondering what direction turkey will take . prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has come under sharp criticism for calling on turks who refuse to accept former islamist abdullah gül 's presidency to leave the country .
the turkish parliament on tuesday elected the current foreign minister as the country 's next president . gül had failed in an attempt to win the presidency earlier this year . " those -lrb- turks -rrb- who do not recognize abdullah gül as their president should give up their turkish citizenship , " erdogan said in an interview with television station kanal d. erdogan was commenting on an article by the prominent columnist bekir coskun from turkey 's largest daily hürriyet .
coskun had written that gül 's presidency would mean the end of the secular state in turkey - a fear shared by the country 's secular elite . " gül will not be my president , " coskun wrote last week .
erdogan 's ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- nominated gül for the presidency . government terror ? after the akp victory in general elections on july 22 , erdogan had promised to be " everyone 's prime minister . "
many observers had hoped he would embrace the highly polarized society as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister abdullah gül will become the country 's next president yet according to yüksel isik from the progressive journalists association , the prime minister 's statement showed that press freedom was still a major challenge in turkey . " the prime minister is taking an exclusionary stance against a prominent journalist , bekir coskun , as if he is ' the other ' , " isik said .
" if local governors follow the prime minister 's behavior and try to pressure journalists in local regions , this would mean the total terrorization of turkey by this government . " in a separate move , the mass circulation hürriyet fired columnist emin cölasan last week , who is known for his highly critical articles on the akp-led government .
according to isik , these events showed that the problem of press freedom was more serious than it appeared . " many of our journalist colleagues have been fired without any just cause , only for their criticism of governmental policies , " isik said . harming turkey 's eu ambitions ? lucio leante has been working in turkey since 2001 for the italian ansa news agency .
he said he thinks that critical journalists such as cölasan are fired because of intricate relations between media owners and the government . the interests of hürriyet publisher the dogan group with the government could have influenced the paper 's management to fire cölasan , leante said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's position towards the press does not conform to eu standards " we ca n't prove it , but the dogan group 's many businesses and links with the state is limiting freedom of press , " leante said . leante added that erdogan 's inability to endure criticism played an important role in stifling the press .
yet despite the prime minister 's harsh attitude toward journalists , cartoon artists and publishers , there was still support for him and his party for turkey 's ambitions to join the european union .
according to leante , western nations were putting turkey to the test . " i think turkey is going on an experiment in which international circles want to see if a moderate islamic conservative party like the akp can be permanently moderate and democratic , " leante said . he said that some western countries believed this " experiment " could serve as a kind of model for other countries in the middle east .
but he said he thought this was risky . " political islam is a contradiction in itself , " leante said .
" it is difficult for islam to prove itself democratic and moderate because political islam means extending religion to state problems . " for turkey 's journalists , the big question now is whether the islamist-rooted akp will use its majority power to continue criticizing the press or to open itself up to different views . berivan orucoglu -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 28.08.2007 turkey 's prime minister sparks debate on press freedom großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the turkish government cracking down on press freedom ?
abdullah gül was elected turkey 's next president on tuesday .
but calls by prime minister erdogan for gül 's critics to give up their citizenship have the media wondering what direction turkey will take . prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has come under sharp criticism for calling on turks who refuse to accept former islamist abdullah gül 's presidency to leave the country .
the turkish parliament on tuesday elected the current foreign minister as the country 's next president . gül had failed in an attempt to win the presidency earlier this year . " those -lrb- turks -rrb- who do not recognize abdullah gül as their president should give up their turkish citizenship , " erdogan said in an interview with television station kanal d. erdogan was commenting on an article by the prominent columnist bekir coskun from turkey 's largest daily hürriyet .
coskun had written that gül 's presidency would mean the end of the secular state in turkey - a fear shared by the country 's secular elite . " gül will not be my president , " coskun wrote last week .
erdogan 's ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- nominated gül for the presidency . government terror ? after the akp victory in general elections on july 22 , erdogan had promised to be " everyone 's prime minister . "
many observers had hoped he would embrace the highly polarized society as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister abdullah gül will become the country 's next president yet according to yüksel isik from the progressive journalists association , the prime minister 's statement showed that press freedom was still a major challenge in turkey . " the prime minister is taking an exclusionary stance against a prominent journalist , bekir coskun , as if he is ' the other ' , " isik said .
" if local governors follow the prime minister 's behavior and try to pressure journalists in local regions , this would mean the total terrorization of turkey by this government . " in a separate move , the mass circulation hürriyet fired columnist emin cölasan last week , who is known for his highly critical articles on the akp-led government .
according to isik , these events showed that the problem of press freedom was more serious than it appeared . " many of our journalist colleagues have been fired without any just cause , only for their criticism of governmental policies , " isik said . harming turkey 's eu ambitions ? lucio leante has been working in turkey since 2001 for the italian ansa news agency .
he said he thinks that critical journalists such as cölasan are fired because of intricate relations between media owners and the government . the interests of hürriyet publisher the dogan group with the government could have influenced the paper 's management to fire cölasan , leante said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's position towards the press does not conform to eu standards " we ca n't prove it , but the dogan group 's many businesses and links with the state is limiting freedom of press , " leante said . leante added that erdogan 's inability to endure criticism played an important role in stifling the press .
yet despite the prime minister 's harsh attitude toward journalists , cartoon artists and publishers , there was still support for him and his party for turkey 's ambitions to join the european union .
according to leante , western nations were putting turkey to the test . " i think turkey is going on an experiment in which international circles want to see if a moderate islamic conservative party like the akp can be permanently moderate and democratic , " leante said . he said that some western countries believed this " experiment " could serve as a kind of model for other countries in the middle east .
but he said he thought this was risky . " political islam is a contradiction in itself , " leante said .

abdullah gül was elected turkey 's next president on tuesday .
but calls by prime minister erdogan for gül 's critics to give up their citizenship have the media wondering what direction turkey will take . prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has come under sharp criticism for calling on turks who refuse to accept former islamist abdullah gül 's presidency to leave the country .
the turkish parliament on tuesday elected the current foreign minister as the country 's next president . gül had failed in an attempt to win the presidency earlier this year . " those -lrb- turks -rrb- who do not recognize abdullah gül as their president should give up their turkish citizenship , " erdogan said in an interview with television station kanal d. erdogan was commenting on an article by the prominent columnist bekir coskun from turkey 's largest daily hürriyet .
coskun had written that gül 's presidency would mean the end of the secular state in turkey - a fear shared by the country 's secular elite . " gül will not be my president , " coskun wrote last week .
erdogan 's ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- nominated gül for the presidency . government terror ? after the akp victory in general elections on july 22 , erdogan had promised to be " everyone 's prime minister . "
many observers had hoped he would embrace the highly polarized society as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister abdullah gül will become the country 's next president yet according to yüksel isik from the progressive journalists association , the prime minister 's statement showed that press freedom was still a major challenge in turkey . " the prime minister is taking an exclusionary stance against a prominent journalist , bekir coskun , as if he is ' the other ' , " isik said .
" if local governors follow the prime minister 's behavior and try to pressure journalists in local regions , this would mean the total terrorization of turkey by this government . " in a separate move , the mass circulation hürriyet fired columnist emin cölasan last week , who is known for his highly critical articles on the akp-led government .
according to isik , these events showed that the problem of press freedom was more serious than it appeared . " many of our journalist colleagues have been fired without any just cause , only for their criticism of governmental policies , " isik said . harming turkey 's eu ambitions ? lucio leante has been working in turkey since 2001 for the italian ansa news agency .
he said he thinks that critical journalists such as cölasan are fired because of intricate relations between media owners and the government . the interests of hürriyet publisher the dogan group with the government could have influenced the paper 's management to fire cölasan , leante said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's position towards the press does not conform to eu standards " we ca n't prove it , but the dogan group 's many businesses and links with the state is limiting freedom of press , " leante said . leante added that erdogan 's inability to endure criticism played an important role in stifling the press .
yet despite the prime minister 's harsh attitude toward journalists , cartoon artists and publishers , there was still support for him and his party for turkey 's ambitions to join the european union .
according to leante , western nations were putting turkey to the test . " i think turkey is going on an experiment in which international circles want to see if a moderate islamic conservative party like the akp can be permanently moderate and democratic , " leante said . he said that some western countries believed this " experiment " could serve as a kind of model for other countries in the middle east .
but he said he thought this was risky . " political islam is a contradiction in itself , " leante said .
" it is difficult for islam to prove itself democratic and moderate because political islam means extending religion to state problems . " for turkey 's journalists , the big question now is whether the islamist-rooted akp will use its majority power to continue criticizing the press or to open itself up to different views . berivan orucoglu -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move has some observers scratching their heads , and others hoping for the best . the reputation of german wine has been on the rise in recent years .

" i expect to sell out " but partnering with aldi is exactly what german winemakers raimond prüm , of the mosel region , and fritz keller , from kaiserstuhl in baden , deemed the right thing to do . back in june , keller struck a deal with aldi to produce weissburgunder and spätburgunder wines .
to produce enough wine , he will cooperate with some 1,000 local vintners , who have to adhere to a strict set of quality criteria in order to be able to contribute to the cuvee .
the wines will be priced to sell at around seven or eight euros . raimund prüm , whose best rieslings can sell for hundreds of euros per bottle , also struck a deal to release a cuvee for aldi .
for his release of between 300,000 and a half a million bottles , prüm will use grapes of his own , as well as selected other vineyards .

wine specialty shops , in contrast , account for just 3 to 5 percent of sales . ironically , getting the invitation to sell wine through a giant discounter can be seen as an honor in itself , according to the german wine institute 's büscher .

" in the end they are n't doing german wine a favor , " said vahrenwald , who noted that he has spent years trying to boost the image of german wines among his customers , even back when it was out of fashion . but ulrich sauter , an editor at germany 's wein gourmet magazine , said he does think both parties stand to gain from the deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi has had a huge influence on german wine tastes " from the side of the discounters , they want to get more prestige , " he said .
" the producers want more sales .
and if aldi is ready to have more expensive wines on its shelves that could be an improvement for the wine growers . " " i agree that it 's a paradoxical situation , but i do n't think people like fritz keller are doing this just to make a profit , " sauter said .
" i think he is really concerned about the structure of the small wine villages in his region .
if the small wine growers in kaiserstuhl , in baden , in the mosel , disappear , these regions would change entirely . " finally , sauter said , only time will tell whether it 's a good move or a bad one for the german wine industry . " we 'll only know after we taste the wines they make , " he said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german organizers hope the event will contribute to inter-cultural understanding . the 60-member osnabrück symphony has arrived in tehran and is preparing to go on stage on wednesday and thursday in the iranian capital .
conductor hermann bäumer will lead the musicians in playing works by beethoven , brahms and elgar . the concert will be a rare occasion , as no other western orchestra of this size has played in iran since the islamic revolution in 1979 .
last year , osnabrück hosted the tehran symphony orchestra , who performed to a packed audience in the western german city .
the exchange is part of osnabrück 's orient festival . in view of the ongoing political tensions between iran and the west , the orchestra 's concerts were aimed at improving inter-cultural dialogue , said the festival 's director michael dreyer . " it is important to me that this is not a one-time event , but rather the beginning of a long-term cultural cooperation , " dreyer said .
six iranian musicians will support the german orchestra in this week 's concerts , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : music is a language everyone understands " i hope that such cultural exchange projects will soon become normality , even between the west and the islamic world , " dreyer said .

" every human being can be reached by music . " politics are not part of it dreyer visited tehran several times over the past year in order to prepare the concerts .
the trip has been fully coordinated with iran 's ministry of culture and islamic guidance . " it was all but a mission impossible , " dreyer said in an interview with german news agency dpa prior to his departure .
" we only managed it because high-ranking clerical and political iranians lobbied for it . " all of the female musicians will be required to wear islamic headscarves to obey iran 's dress code . " the women are not used to playing in hijab , " bäumer said .
" i am very glad that the women tried it and it was fine .
what is most important is the music . " the orchestra 's directors said the visit was aimed purely at cultural understanding , and not politics .
dreyer said he had rejected a request by three german mps to join the tour in order to keep the trip focused on music and not politics . the concerts are expected to draw large crowds . classical music experiencing a resurgence in iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karajan conducted the berlin philharmonic for 35 years prior to the islamic revolution , foreign orchestras performed regularly in iran , including the berlin philharmonic and its legendary conductor herbert von karajan .

the move has some observers scratching their heads , and others hoping for the best . the reputation of german wine has been on the rise in recent years .
no longer viewed solely as the producer of painfully sweet whites , the country is starting to enjoy a worldwide reputation as a producer of subtle and flavourful rieslings , burgundies and müller-thurgaus , among others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small growers are still important in german wine regions so it may not seem like the ideal time for two of the country 's most respected wine makers to hop into bed with the country 's number one discount supermarket chain . after all , by continuously slashing prices , aldi has lowered the average price of wine on its shelves from over two euros -lrb- $ 2.70 -rrb- for a 0.75 liter bottle in 2001 , to 1.73 euros a bottle today , according to ernst büscher , a spokesman for the german wine institute , an industry association . " i expect to sell out " but partnering with aldi is exactly what german winemakers raimond prüm , of the mosel region , and fritz keller , from kaiserstuhl in baden , deemed the right thing to do . back in june , keller struck a deal with aldi to produce weissburgunder and spätburgunder wines .
to produce enough wine , he will cooperate with some 1,000 local vintners , who have to adhere to a strict set of quality criteria in order to be able to contribute to the cuvee .
the wines will be priced to sell at around seven or eight euros . raimund prüm , whose best rieslings can sell for hundreds of euros per bottle , also struck a deal to release a cuvee for aldi .
for his release of between 300,000 and a half a million bottles , prüm will use grapes of his own , as well as selected other vineyards .
the other grapes must be grown in accordance with rigid growing , production and territory criteria . given the relatively small production , and the price of between six and eight euros per bottle , prüm told germany 's die welt newspaper , " i expect the wine to sell out in a number of hours . " win-win situation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in rudesheim , vinyards are also hiking paths for prüm , the situation is win-win .
for one thing , thanks to aldi 's massive distribution system , his wines can be appreciated by the widest possible audience . " the wine will be something special for the discounter to offer , and will show just how high a quality wine the mosel region can produce , " prüm said . statistics are unreliable , but the german wine institute estimates retail grocery sales in general account for 70 percent of wine sales in germany ; 30 percent of that amount can be chalked up to aldi sales alone .
wine specialty shops , in contrast , account for just 3 to 5 percent of sales . ironically , getting the invitation to sell wine through a giant discounter can be seen as an honor in itself , according to the german wine institute 's büscher .
aldi has promoted high-quality , higher-priced italian and spanish wines in the past ; now its germany 's turn . " that aldi is now opening this price class for german wines shows that the image of german wines has improved , both here and internationally , " büscher said . but nils vahrenwald , the owner of weinhaus süd , a mid-sized distributor of international wines in cologne , is skeptical about the wine makers who are in league with rock-bottom retailers . good for the industry ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone knows when it 's time for picking " i do n't understand why they 're doing it - these winemakers do n't need to be on the shelves next to the cheapest mass-produced stuff , " vahrenwald said .
" i honestly do not know how they are making this wine , but they must be buying the cheapest grapes , working on it a little in production , and then selling it for a great profit . " in the end they are n't doing german wine a favor , " said vahrenwald , who noted that he has spent years trying to boost the image of german wines among his customers , even back when it was out of fashion . but ulrich sauter , an editor at germany 's wein gourmet magazine , said he does think both parties stand to gain from the deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi has had a huge influence on german wine tastes " from the side of the discounters , they want to get more prestige , " he said .
" the producers want more sales .
and if aldi is ready to have more expensive wines on its shelves that could be an improvement for the wine growers . " " i agree that it 's a paradoxical situation , but i do n't think people like fritz keller are doing this just to make a profit , " sauter said .
" i think he is really concerned about the structure of the small wine villages in his region .
if the small wine growers in kaiserstuhl , in baden , in the mosel , disappear , these regions would change entirely . " finally , sauter said , only time will tell whether it 's a good move or a bad one for the german wine industry . " we 'll only know after we taste the wines they make , " he said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel , herself a big fan of the beautiful game , has thrown her weight behind the bid , and france 's decision to remove its hat from the ring has given germany 's chances an additional lift .
" we are very grateful to our friends in the french soccer federation for their pledge to support the german bid for the 2011 women 's world cup , " german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger said in a statement .
germany is now up against australia , canada and peru for the right to host the event .

the german women 's team won the last world cup in 2003 , and some argue that it would be good for the sport , if the 2011 event were held in a powerhouse soccer nation .
" germany would definitely make a good host nation and it would benefit women 's football , " germany coach tina theune-meyer said in an interview for fifa 's web site .
" we 'd be talking about public viewing again , too .
a world cup in germany would naturally add a new impulse to our already positive development . "

the 2007 cup is taking place in china in september .
" i think it would n't be too much to have three of four world cups in north america , fifa president sepp blatter has told the edmonton sun newspaper .
" a bid from canada is absolutely possible for 2011 from fifa 's point of view . "
the popularity of women 's soccer has been growing steadily in recent years , and fifa estimates that by the year 2010 as many women as men will be playing the sport . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the calls for caution arise from fears the politicians will suffer an embarrassing defeat as they did in 2003 , when the constitutional court , based in the city of karlsruhe , rejected a case put forward jointly by both houses of parliament .
since pictures of the eight indian beaten up at mügeln were flashed around the world , other racist attacks have been reported , revealing a drift to the violent right among those youths that see themselves as left out of germany 's once-again rising prosperity .

the main problem lies in the numerous undercover agents operating within the npd to monitor its activities .
the activities of these agents - one of them reached the top of the hierarchy and is said to have authored an anti-semitic pamphlet - led the constitutional court to throw the case out in the preliminary stages four years ago .
" it was one of the bitterest defeats that the politicians have ever been handed by karlsruhe - and it was their own fault , " the berliner zeitung commented .

the calls for caution arise from fears the politicians will suffer an embarrassing defeat as they did in 2003 , when the constitutional court , based in the city of karlsruhe , rejected a case put forward jointly by both houses of parliament .
since pictures of the eight indian beaten up at mügeln were flashed around the world , other racist attacks have been reported , revealing a drift to the violent right among those youths that see themselves as left out of germany 's once-again rising prosperity .
" studies show that xenophobia , anti-semitism and contempt for the person are on the rise , " the berliner zeitung commented tuesday .
all mainstream politicians abhor the npd -lrb- german national democratic party -rrb- , which garnered only 1.6 per cent of the vote in the 2005 parliamentary elections and thus is excluded from the national parliament , although it has seats in the parliaments of two eastern states .
" i believe that even those skeptical -lrb- of a renewed banning attempt -rrb- regard the npd as unconstitutional , " spd home affairs parliamentary spokesman dieter wiefelspütz told reporters tuesday .
spd seemingly ignoring previous failed attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court threw out the last case but securing a ban under germany 's democratic constitution - which strenuously guards freedom of speech - is another matter .
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- parliamentary caucus , believes that parliament faces " another gigantic embarrassment " if it tries again .
the main problem lies in the numerous undercover agents operating within the npd to monitor its activities .
the activities of these agents - one of them reached the top of the hierarchy and is said to have authored an anti-semitic pamphlet - led the constitutional court to throw the case out in the preliminary stages four years ago .
" it was one of the bitterest defeats that the politicians have ever been handed by karlsruhe - and it was their own fault , " the berliner zeitung commented .
lengthy process could endanger police operations one person well placed to know about the undercover agents , cdu interior minister wolfgang schaüble , warns of " great procedural risk . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police infiltrators would be at risk during a court ruling the legal process leading up to a constitutional court ruling could take years , experts warn .
police and the special authority charged with the protection of the constitution are reported to be aghast at the prospect of having to withdraw their undercover agents for as long as this .
but wiefelspütz is adamant that parliament should try again .
" i call on all parties to engage in a debate over how this can be achieved , " he says .
case to ban npd " doomed to failure " say greens the spd , currently the junior partner in merkel 's grand coalition , finds itself alone on this issue , with even their former partner in government , the greens , opposed .
the problem of rightwing extremism will not be resolved by a legal process that is in any case doomed to failure , the party warns .
" their members would still be there and would look for new organizational structures .
much more important are initiatives in civil society against the dissemination of rightwing ideology , " greens parliamentary spokesman volker beck says .
instead , the party blames merkel 's government for fiscal cutbacks that have helped return the budget to balance but have closed down many social programs .

the vote had pitted secularists and the ruling islamist-rooted justice and development party against each other . abdullah gül is the first former islamist to become turkey 's president in the secular but predominantly muslim country 's modern history .
public opinion in turkey has been sharply divided over gül 's allegiance to the country 's basic tenets . gül 's supporters consider him to be a moderate politician who has backed far-reaching democratic and human rights reforms , enabling turkey to start accession talks with the european union in 2005 .
yet staunch secularists see gül as a wolf in sheep 's clothing , bent on pushing what they consider as the ruling justice and development party 's -lrb- akp -rrb- plans to dismantle the country 's secular system . however , gül has publicly stressed in recent weeks that such plans were not on his agenda .
he told the country in a press conference earlier this month that he had cut loose from his past and fully believed in the separation of state and religion - a principle he vowed to defend as president . many analysts have said that gül 's experience as foreign minister over the past five years made him well-suited for the presidency .
this background would play an active role in furthering turkey 's european ambitions during his seven-year term , analysts said . european commission president jose manuel barroso said tuesday that the election of gül could provide fresh impetus to ankara 's eu membership talks . the election and the arrival to power of a new government " provides an opportunity to give fresh , immediate and positive impetus to the accession process to the european union through progress in a number of key areas , " barroso said in a statement . barroso said : " i am confident that you will fulfil your task with a strong sense of duty and commitment to your country and fellow citizens . " german chancellor angela merkel also sent a message of congratulation to gül . germany and turkey were " important partners " and linked by friendship , merkel said . " i am certain that you will dedicate yourself in your new office to deepening our relations , for the good of europe and the atlantic alliance , " gül 's wife not to attend swearing-in ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gül 's wife hayrunisa is a staunch defender of her right to wear a headscarf gül 's bid to become president had not only become a controversial issue due to his past involvement in islamist groups .
in addition , the fact that his wife harunisa wears an islamic-style headscarf had alarmed turkey 's secular elite .
it is illegal for state employees and university students to wear headscarves in turkey . hayrunisa gül will become the first wife of a president to wear a headscarf , which secularist turks consider a symbol of muslim political militancy .
in a move designed to calm these fears , harunisa announced earlier on tuesday that she would not attend the swearing-in ceremony . gül has countered critics by saying that the headscarf was a personal choice , and that he , and not his wife , would become president . gül won a clear majority gül won 339 votes in the parliamentary poll on tuesday in the third round of voting .
during the previous two rounds last week , gül had failed to receive a two-thirds majority .
but for the third round , he needed just a simple majority of 276 votes in the 550-seat parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish parliament needed three rounds to elect gül the 56-year-old gül will be sworn in at a parliamentary ceremony later on tuesday , taking over from current president ahmet necdet sezer on tuesday night . the current foreign minister easily defeated sabahattin cakmakoglu with 70 votes and huseyin tayfur icli with 13 .

the deal will cost the dfb millions it could have earned from nike . the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and adidas , the traditional supplier of equipment to the german national soccer team , have extended their association until 2018 .
" the partnership is something special , and today is a historic occasion , " said adidas ceo herbert hainer after the agreement was made public .
" it was a matter of harmoniously balancing tradition , legal concerns and money , " said dfb president theo zwanziger .
the two soccer powers have been partners since germany won its first world cup title in 1954 .
but they have been at loggerheads for months , after adidas rival nike made a much more lucrative sponsorship offer .
adidas had claimed that its existing supplier agreement with the dfb was effectively extended in august 2006 until at least 2014 .
dfb officials , on the other hand , had maintained their deal with adidas was set to expire in 2011 .
a court of arbitration was called in , which suggested the two sides reach a compromise .

adidas has reportedly also agreed to commit 5 million euros to support youth and women 's soccer programs .
the deal will cost the dfb millions of euros .
in january this year , nike offered 500 million euros -lrb- $ 648 million -rrb- in a proposed eight-year sponsorship contract to the dfb .
that would have been some 200 million euros more than the dfb will get from adidas .

the german soccer idol also said that the dfb would be " liable to persecution " if it out and out rejected the offer from nike .
and in the run-up to the new deal , the dfl - the organization that represents the 36 professional clubs in first and second-division german soccer - voiced its displeasure .
dfl president reinhard rauball said he viewed the move " with serious reservations . "
the dfb had a responsibility to the clubs , who get some of the proceeds from the contract , to reach a better financial arrangement , rauball said .

the coaching staff , again presumably under pressure from the dfb , then issued a warning that failure to wear the adidas footwear would lead to being dropped from the national team .

the deal will cost the dfb millions it could have earned from nike . the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and adidas , the traditional supplier of equipment to the german national soccer team , have extended their association until 2018 .
" the partnership is something special , and today is a historic occasion , " said adidas ceo herbert hainer after the agreement was made public .
" it was a matter of harmoniously balancing tradition , legal concerns and money , " said dfb president theo zwanziger .
the two soccer powers have been partners since germany won its first world cup title in 1954 .
but they have been at loggerheads for months , after adidas rival nike made a much more lucrative sponsorship offer .
adidas had claimed that its existing supplier agreement with the dfb was effectively extended in august 2006 until at least 2014 .
dfb officials , on the other hand , had maintained their deal with adidas was set to expire in 2011 .
a court of arbitration was called in , which suggested the two sides reach a compromise .
tradition trumps nike millions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike has an impressive roster - but no germany neither side was giving specifics about the new deal .
but german news agency dpa reported that , as of 2011 , adidas will pay the dfb 20 million euros -lrb- $ 27.6 million -rrb- a year - up from the current 11 million euros .
adidas has reportedly also agreed to commit 5 million euros to support youth and women 's soccer programs .
the deal will cost the dfb millions of euros .
in january this year , nike offered 500 million euros -lrb- $ 648 million -rrb- in a proposed eight-year sponsorship contract to the dfb .
that would have been some 200 million euros more than the dfb will get from adidas .
the idea of the us giant taking over the germany team sent shockwaves throughout the country .
analysts predicted that losing the germany team sponsorship deal would not only be a commercial blow to adidas , but would also bring an end to a long tradition and perhaps dent national pride . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz in the old days but former germany player and coach franz beckenbauer was a high-profile supporter of the potential deal with nike .
he said that times had changed and that national concerns figured less than they might have in the past .
the german soccer idol also said that the dfb would be " liable to persecution " if it out and out rejected the offer from nike .
and in the run-up to the new deal , the dfl - the organization that represents the 36 professional clubs in first and second-division german soccer - voiced its displeasure .
dfl president reinhard rauball said he viewed the move " with serious reservations . "
the dfb had a responsibility to the clubs , who get some of the proceeds from the contract , to reach a better financial arrangement , rauball said .
germany stars talk with their feet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germany stars prefer their own brand of shoes the national team caused a little friction themselves last year when told by the coaching staff of a dfb directive that made wearing adidas boots compulsory .
some of the stars , each with their own personal - and very lucrative - footwear deals , were unhappy about giving up their nikes , pumas and umbros in favor of the three stripes while on international duty and threatened to strike .
the coaching staff , again presumably under pressure from the dfb , then issued a warning that failure to wear the adidas footwear would lead to being dropped from the national team .
after some fraught and intense negotiations , the players agreed to play on in adidas on the proviso that the dfb did all it could to get out of the deal with the german firm by september last year . dw staff -lrb- jc / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and in the run-up to the new deal , the dfl - the organization that represents the 36 professional clubs in first and second-division german soccer - voiced its displeasure .

the deal will cost the dfb millions it could have earned from nike . the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and adidas , the traditional supplier of equipment to the german national soccer team , have extended their association until 2018 .
" the partnership is something special , and today is a historic occasion , " said adidas ceo herbert hainer after the agreement was made public .
" it was a matter of harmoniously balancing tradition , legal concerns and money , " said dfb president theo zwanziger .
the two soccer powers have been partners since germany won its first world cup title in 1954 .
but they have been at loggerheads for months , after adidas rival nike made a much more lucrative sponsorship offer .
adidas had claimed that its existing supplier agreement with the dfb was effectively extended in august 2006 until at least 2014 .
dfb officials , on the other hand , had maintained their deal with adidas was set to expire in 2011 .
a court of arbitration was called in , which suggested the two sides reach a compromise .
tradition trumps nike millions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike has an impressive roster - but no germany neither side was giving specifics about the new deal .
but german news agency dpa reported that , as of 2011 , adidas will pay the dfb 20 million euros -lrb- $ 27.6 million -rrb- a year - up from the current 11 million euros .
adidas has reportedly also agreed to commit 5 million euros to support youth and women 's soccer programs .
the deal will cost the dfb millions of euros .
in january this year , nike offered 500 million euros -lrb- $ 648 million -rrb- in a proposed eight-year sponsorship contract to the dfb .
that would have been some 200 million euros more than the dfb will get from adidas .

he said that times had changed and that national concerns figured less than they might have in the past .
the german soccer idol also said that the dfb would be " liable to persecution " if it out and out rejected the offer from nike .
and in the run-up to the new deal , the dfl - the organization that represents the 36 professional clubs in first and second-division german soccer - voiced its displeasure .
dfl president reinhard rauball said he viewed the move " with serious reservations . "
the dfb had a responsibility to the clubs , who get some of the proceeds from the contract , to reach a better financial arrangement , rauball said .
germany stars talk with their feet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germany stars prefer their own brand of shoes the national team caused a little friction themselves last year when told by the coaching staff of a dfb directive that made wearing adidas boots compulsory .
some of the stars , each with their own personal - and very lucrative - footwear deals , were unhappy about giving up their nikes , pumas and umbros in favor of the three stripes while on international duty and threatened to strike .
the coaching staff , again presumably under pressure from the dfb , then issued a warning that failure to wear the adidas footwear would lead to being dropped from the national team .

the deal will cost the dfb millions it could have earned from nike . the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and adidas , the traditional supplier of equipment to the german national soccer team , have extended their association until 2018 .
" the partnership is something special , and today is a historic occasion , " said adidas ceo herbert hainer after the agreement was made public .
" it was a matter of harmoniously balancing tradition , legal concerns and money , " said dfb president theo zwanziger .
the two soccer powers have been partners since germany won its first world cup title in 1954 .
but they have been at loggerheads for months , after adidas rival nike made a much more lucrative sponsorship offer .
adidas had claimed that its existing supplier agreement with the dfb was effectively extended in august 2006 until at least 2014 .
dfb officials , on the other hand , had maintained their deal with adidas was set to expire in 2011 .
a court of arbitration was called in , which suggested the two sides reach a compromise .
tradition trumps nike millions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike has an impressive roster - but no germany neither side was giving specifics about the new deal .
but german news agency dpa reported that , as of 2011 , adidas will pay the dfb 20 million euros -lrb- $ 27.6 million -rrb- a year - up from the current 11 million euros .
adidas has reportedly also agreed to commit 5 million euros to support youth and women 's soccer programs .
the deal will cost the dfb millions of euros .
in january this year , nike offered 500 million euros -lrb- $ 648 million -rrb- in a proposed eight-year sponsorship contract to the dfb .
that would have been some 200 million euros more than the dfb will get from adidas .
the idea of the us giant taking over the germany team sent shockwaves throughout the country .
analysts predicted that losing the germany team sponsorship deal would not only be a commercial blow to adidas , but would also bring an end to a long tradition and perhaps dent national pride . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz in the old days but former germany player and coach franz beckenbauer was a high-profile supporter of the potential deal with nike .
he said that times had changed and that national concerns figured less than they might have in the past .
the german soccer idol also said that the dfb would be " liable to persecution " if it out and out rejected the offer from nike .
and in the run-up to the new deal , the dfl - the organization that represents the 36 professional clubs in first and second-division german soccer - voiced its displeasure .
dfl president reinhard rauball said he viewed the move " with serious reservations . "
the dfb had a responsibility to the clubs , who get some of the proceeds from the contract , to reach a better financial arrangement , rauball said .
germany stars talk with their feet bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germany stars prefer their own brand of shoes the national team caused a little friction themselves last year when told by the coaching staff of a dfb directive that made wearing adidas boots compulsory .
some of the stars , each with their own personal - and very lucrative - footwear deals , were unhappy about giving up their nikes , pumas and umbros in favor of the three stripes while on international duty and threatened to strike .
the coaching staff , again presumably under pressure from the dfb , then issued a warning that failure to wear the adidas footwear would lead to being dropped from the national team .
after some fraught and intense negotiations , the players agreed to play on in adidas on the proviso that the dfb did all it could to get out of the deal with the german firm by september last year . dw staff -lrb- jc / nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal will cost the dfb millions it could have earned from nike . the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and adidas , the traditional supplier of equipment to the german national soccer team , have extended their association until 2018 .
" the partnership is something special , and today is a historic occasion , " said adidas ceo herbert hainer after the agreement was made public .
" it was a matter of harmoniously balancing tradition , legal concerns and money , " said dfb president theo zwanziger .
the two soccer powers have been partners since germany won its first world cup title in 1954 .
but they have been at loggerheads for months , after adidas rival nike made a much more lucrative sponsorship offer .
adidas had claimed that its existing supplier agreement with the dfb was effectively extended in august 2006 until at least 2014 .
dfb officials , on the other hand , had maintained their deal with adidas was set to expire in 2011 .
a court of arbitration was called in , which suggested the two sides reach a compromise .
tradition trumps nike millions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike has an impressive roster - but no germany neither side was giving specifics about the new deal .
but german news agency dpa reported that , as of 2011 , adidas will pay the dfb 20 million euros -lrb- $ 27.6 million -rrb- a year - up from the current 11 million euros .
adidas has reportedly also agreed to commit 5 million euros to support youth and women 's soccer programs .
the deal will cost the dfb millions of euros .
in january this year , nike offered 500 million euros -lrb- $ 648 million -rrb- in a proposed eight-year sponsorship contract to the dfb .
that would have been some 200 million euros more than the dfb will get from adidas .
the idea of the us giant taking over the germany team sent shockwaves throughout the country .
analysts predicted that losing the germany team sponsorship deal would not only be a commercial blow to adidas , but would also bring an end to a long tradition and perhaps dent national pride . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : franz in the old days but former germany player and coach franz beckenbauer was a high-profile supporter of the potential deal with nike .

the move has some observers scratching their heads , and others hoping for the best . the reputation of german wine has been on the rise in recent years .
no longer viewed solely as the producer of painfully sweet whites , the country is starting to enjoy a worldwide reputation as a producer of subtle and flavourful rieslings , burgundies and müller-thurgaus , among others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small growers are still important in german wine regions so it may not seem like the ideal time for two of the country 's most respected wine makers to hop into bed with the country 's number one discount supermarket chain . after all , by continuously slashing prices , aldi has lowered the average price of wine on its shelves from over two euros -lrb- $ 2.70 -rrb- for a 0.75 liter bottle in 2001 , to 1.73 euros a bottle today , according to ernst büscher , a spokesman for the german wine institute , an industry association . " i expect to sell out " but partnering with aldi is exactly what german winemakers raimond prüm , of the mosel region , and fritz keller , from kaiserstuhl in baden , deemed the right thing to do . back in june , keller struck a deal with aldi to produce weissburgunder and spätburgunder wines .
to produce enough wine , he will cooperate with some 1,000 local vintners , who have to adhere to a strict set of quality criteria in order to be able to contribute to the cuvee .
the wines will be priced to sell at around seven or eight euros . raimund prüm , whose best rieslings can sell for hundreds of euros per bottle , also struck a deal to release a cuvee for aldi .
for his release of between 300,000 and a half a million bottles , prüm will use grapes of his own , as well as selected other vineyards .
the other grapes must be grown in accordance with rigid growing , production and territory criteria . given the relatively small production , and the price of between six and eight euros per bottle , prüm told germany 's die welt newspaper , " i expect the wine to sell out in a number of hours . " win-win situation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in rudesheim , vinyards are also hiking paths for prüm , the situation is win-win .
for one thing , thanks to aldi 's massive distribution system , his wines can be appreciated by the widest possible audience . " the wine will be something special for the discounter to offer , and will show just how high a quality wine the mosel region can produce , " prüm said . statistics are unreliable , but the german wine institute estimates retail grocery sales in general account for 70 percent of wine sales in germany ; 30 percent of that amount can be chalked up to aldi sales alone .
wine specialty shops , in contrast , account for just 3 to 5 percent of sales . ironically , getting the invitation to sell wine through a giant discounter can be seen as an honor in itself , according to the german wine institute 's büscher .
aldi has promoted high-quality , higher-priced italian and spanish wines in the past ; now its germany 's turn . " that aldi is now opening this price class for german wines shows that the image of german wines has improved , both here and internationally , " büscher said . but nils vahrenwald , the owner of weinhaus süd , a mid-sized distributor of international wines in cologne , is skeptical about the wine makers who are in league with rock-bottom retailers . good for the industry ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone knows when it 's time for picking " i do n't understand why they 're doing it - these winemakers do n't need to be on the shelves next to the cheapest mass-produced stuff , " vahrenwald said .
" i honestly do not know how they are making this wine , but they must be buying the cheapest grapes , working on it a little in production , and then selling it for a great profit . " in the end they are n't doing german wine a favor , " said vahrenwald , who noted that he has spent years trying to boost the image of german wines among his customers , even back when it was out of fashion . but ulrich sauter , an editor at germany 's wein gourmet magazine , said he does think both parties stand to gain from the deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi has had a huge influence on german wine tastes " from the side of the discounters , they want to get more prestige , " he said .
" the producers want more sales .
and if aldi is ready to have more expensive wines on its shelves that could be an improvement for the wine growers . " " i agree that it 's a paradoxical situation , but i do n't think people like fritz keller are doing this just to make a profit , " sauter said .
" i think he is really concerned about the structure of the small wine villages in his region .
if the small wine growers in kaiserstuhl , in baden , in the mosel , disappear , these regions would change entirely . " finally , sauter said , only time will tell whether it 's a good move or a bad one for the german wine industry . " we 'll only know after we taste the wines they make , " he said . jennifer abramsohn send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

abdullah gül was elected turkey 's next president on tuesday .
but calls by prime minister erdogan for gül 's critics to give up their citizenship have the media wondering what direction turkey will take . prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has come under sharp criticism for calling on turks who refuse to accept former islamist abdullah gül 's presidency to leave the country .
the turkish parliament on tuesday elected the current foreign minister as the country 's next president . gül had failed in an attempt to win the presidency earlier this year . " those -lrb- turks -rrb- who do not recognize abdullah gül as their president should give up their turkish citizenship , " erdogan said in an interview with television station kanal d. erdogan was commenting on an article by the prominent columnist bekir coskun from turkey 's largest daily hürriyet .
coskun had written that gül 's presidency would mean the end of the secular state in turkey - a fear shared by the country 's secular elite . " gül will not be my president , " coskun wrote last week .
erdogan 's ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- nominated gül for the presidency . government terror ? after the akp victory in general elections on july 22 , erdogan had promised to be " everyone 's prime minister . "
many observers had hoped he would embrace the highly polarized society as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister abdullah gül will become the country 's next president yet according to yüksel isik from the progressive journalists association , the prime minister 's statement showed that press freedom was still a major challenge in turkey . " the prime minister is taking an exclusionary stance against a prominent journalist , bekir coskun , as if he is ' the other ' , " isik said .
" if local governors follow the prime minister 's behavior and try to pressure journalists in local regions , this would mean the total terrorization of turkey by this government . " in a separate move , the mass circulation hürriyet fired columnist emin cölasan last week , who is known for his highly critical articles on the akp-led government .

the turkish parliament on tuesday elected the current foreign minister as the country 's next president . gül had failed in an attempt to win the presidency earlier this year . " those -lrb- turks -rrb- who do not recognize abdullah gül as their president should give up their turkish citizenship , " erdogan said in an interview with television station kanal d. erdogan was commenting on an article by the prominent columnist bekir coskun from turkey 's largest daily hürriyet .
coskun had written that gül 's presidency would mean the end of the secular state in turkey - a fear shared by the country 's secular elite . " gül will not be my president , " coskun wrote last week .

german organizers hope the event will contribute to inter-cultural understanding . the 60-member osnabrück symphony has arrived in tehran and is preparing to go on stage on wednesday and thursday in the iranian capital .
conductor hermann bäumer will lead the musicians in playing works by beethoven , brahms and elgar . the concert will be a rare occasion , as no other western orchestra of this size has played in iran since the islamic revolution in 1979 .
last year , osnabrück hosted the tehran symphony orchestra , who performed to a packed audience in the western german city .
the exchange is part of osnabrück 's orient festival . in view of the ongoing political tensions between iran and the west , the orchestra 's concerts were aimed at improving inter-cultural dialogue , said the festival 's director michael dreyer . " it is important to me that this is not a one-time event , but rather the beginning of a long-term cultural cooperation , " dreyer said .
six iranian musicians will support the german orchestra in this week 's concerts , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : music is a language everyone understands " i hope that such cultural exchange projects will soon become normality , even between the west and the islamic world , " dreyer said .
he told reporters in tehran that the exchange hoped to " show to both countries that there are lots of similarities between us and no reason to fear each other . " conductor bäumer said music was the only language everybody in the world could speak and understand . " i 'm sure that making music together will change things , " bäumer said in tehran .
" every human being can be reached by music . " politics are not part of it dreyer visited tehran several times over the past year in order to prepare the concerts .
the trip has been fully coordinated with iran 's ministry of culture and islamic guidance . " it was all but a mission impossible , " dreyer said in an interview with german news agency dpa prior to his departure .
" we only managed it because high-ranking clerical and political iranians lobbied for it . " all of the female musicians will be required to wear islamic headscarves to obey iran 's dress code . " the women are not used to playing in hijab , " bäumer said .
" i am very glad that the women tried it and it was fine .
what is most important is the music . " the orchestra 's directors said the visit was aimed purely at cultural understanding , and not politics .
dreyer said he had rejected a request by three german mps to join the tour in order to keep the trip focused on music and not politics . the concerts are expected to draw large crowds . classical music experiencing a resurgence in iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karajan conducted the berlin philharmonic for 35 years prior to the islamic revolution , foreign orchestras performed regularly in iran , including the berlin philharmonic and its legendary conductor herbert von karajan .
but the tehran orchestra was dissolved following the revolution . only in the past decade have attempts been made to revive classical music in iran .
tehran 's symphony orchestra gives regular concerts , mixing western classics with compositions by iranian composers . the country 's ruling clerics tolerate classical , traditional iranian , as well as instrumental versions of western music .
however , pop music with singing is strictly forbidden . the festival is financed by various cultural organizations in osnabrück , as well as the german foreign office .

the vote had pitted secularists and the ruling islamist-rooted justice and development party against each other . abdullah gül is the first former islamist to become turkey 's president in the secular but predominantly muslim country 's modern history .
public opinion in turkey has been sharply divided over gül 's allegiance to the country 's basic tenets . gül 's supporters consider him to be a moderate politician who has backed far-reaching democratic and human rights reforms , enabling turkey to start accession talks with the european union in 2005 .
yet staunch secularists see gül as a wolf in sheep 's clothing , bent on pushing what they consider as the ruling justice and development party 's -lrb- akp -rrb- plans to dismantle the country 's secular system . however , gül has publicly stressed in recent weeks that such plans were not on his agenda .
he told the country in a press conference earlier this month that he had cut loose from his past and fully believed in the separation of state and religion - a principle he vowed to defend as president . many analysts have said that gül 's experience as foreign minister over the past five years made him well-suited for the presidency .
this background would play an active role in furthering turkey 's european ambitions during his seven-year term , analysts said . european commission president jose manuel barroso said tuesday that the election of gül could provide fresh impetus to ankara 's eu membership talks . the election and the arrival to power of a new government " provides an opportunity to give fresh , immediate and positive impetus to the accession process to the european union through progress in a number of key areas , " barroso said in a statement . barroso said : " i am confident that you will fulfil your task with a strong sense of duty and commitment to your country and fellow citizens . " german chancellor angela merkel also sent a message of congratulation to gül . germany and turkey were " important partners " and linked by friendship , merkel said .

in addition , the fact that his wife harunisa wears an islamic-style headscarf had alarmed turkey 's secular elite .
it is illegal for state employees and university students to wear headscarves in turkey . hayrunisa gül will become the first wife of a president to wear a headscarf , which secularist turks consider a symbol of muslim political militancy .
in a move designed to calm these fears , harunisa announced earlier on tuesday that she would not attend the swearing-in ceremony . gül has countered critics by saying that the headscarf was a personal choice , and that he , and not his wife , would become president . gül won a clear majority gül won 339 votes in the parliamentary poll on tuesday in the third round of voting .
during the previous two rounds last week , gül had failed to receive a two-thirds majority .

german organizers hope the event will contribute to inter-cultural understanding . the 60-member osnabrück symphony has arrived in tehran and is preparing to go on stage on wednesday and thursday in the iranian capital .
conductor hermann bäumer will lead the musicians in playing works by beethoven , brahms and elgar . the concert will be a rare occasion , as no other western orchestra of this size has played in iran since the islamic revolution in 1979 .
last year , osnabrück hosted the tehran symphony orchestra , who performed to a packed audience in the western german city .
the exchange is part of osnabrück 's orient festival . in view of the ongoing political tensions between iran and the west , the orchestra 's concerts were aimed at improving inter-cultural dialogue , said the festival 's director michael dreyer . " it is important to me that this is not a one-time event , but rather the beginning of a long-term cultural cooperation , " dreyer said .
six iranian musicians will support the german orchestra in this week 's concerts , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : music is a language everyone understands " i hope that such cultural exchange projects will soon become normality , even between the west and the islamic world , " dreyer said .
he told reporters in tehran that the exchange hoped to " show to both countries that there are lots of similarities between us and no reason to fear each other . " conductor bäumer said music was the only language everybody in the world could speak and understand . " i 'm sure that making music together will change things , " bäumer said in tehran .
" every human being can be reached by music . " politics are not part of it dreyer visited tehran several times over the past year in order to prepare the concerts .
the trip has been fully coordinated with iran 's ministry of culture and islamic guidance . " it was all but a mission impossible , " dreyer said in an interview with german news agency dpa prior to his departure .
" we only managed it because high-ranking clerical and political iranians lobbied for it . " all of the female musicians will be required to wear islamic headscarves to obey iran 's dress code . " the women are not used to playing in hijab , " bäumer said .
" i am very glad that the women tried it and it was fine .
what is most important is the music . " the orchestra 's directors said the visit was aimed purely at cultural understanding , and not politics .
dreyer said he had rejected a request by three german mps to join the tour in order to keep the trip focused on music and not politics . the concerts are expected to draw large crowds . classical music experiencing a resurgence in iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karajan conducted the berlin philharmonic for 35 years prior to the islamic revolution , foreign orchestras performed regularly in iran , including the berlin philharmonic and its legendary conductor herbert von karajan .
but the tehran orchestra was dissolved following the revolution . only in the past decade have attempts been made to revive classical music in iran .
tehran 's symphony orchestra gives regular concerts , mixing western classics with compositions by iranian composers . the country 's ruling clerics tolerate classical , traditional iranian , as well as instrumental versions of western music .
however , pop music with singing is strictly forbidden . the festival is financed by various cultural organizations in osnabrück , as well as the german foreign office .

the calls for caution arise from fears the politicians will suffer an embarrassing defeat as they did in 2003 , when the constitutional court , based in the city of karlsruhe , rejected a case put forward jointly by both houses of parliament .
since pictures of the eight indian beaten up at mügeln were flashed around the world , other racist attacks have been reported , revealing a drift to the violent right among those youths that see themselves as left out of germany 's once-again rising prosperity .
" studies show that xenophobia , anti-semitism and contempt for the person are on the rise , " the berliner zeitung commented tuesday .
all mainstream politicians abhor the npd -lrb- german national democratic party -rrb- , which garnered only 1.6 per cent of the vote in the 2005 parliamentary elections and thus is excluded from the national parliament , although it has seats in the parliaments of two eastern states .
" i believe that even those skeptical -lrb- of a renewed banning attempt -rrb- regard the npd as unconstitutional , " spd home affairs parliamentary spokesman dieter wiefelspütz told reporters tuesday .
spd seemingly ignoring previous failed attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court threw out the last case but securing a ban under germany 's democratic constitution - which strenuously guards freedom of speech - is another matter .
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- parliamentary caucus , believes that parliament faces " another gigantic embarrassment " if it tries again .
the main problem lies in the numerous undercover agents operating within the npd to monitor its activities .
the activities of these agents - one of them reached the top of the hierarchy and is said to have authored an anti-semitic pamphlet - led the constitutional court to throw the case out in the preliminary stages four years ago .
" it was one of the bitterest defeats that the politicians have ever been handed by karlsruhe - and it was their own fault , " the berliner zeitung commented .
lengthy process could endanger police operations one person well placed to know about the undercover agents , cdu interior minister wolfgang schaüble , warns of " great procedural risk . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police infiltrators would be at risk during a court ruling the legal process leading up to a constitutional court ruling could take years , experts warn .
police and the special authority charged with the protection of the constitution are reported to be aghast at the prospect of having to withdraw their undercover agents for as long as this .
but wiefelspütz is adamant that parliament should try again .
" i call on all parties to engage in a debate over how this can be achieved , " he says .
case to ban npd " doomed to failure " say greens the spd , currently the junior partner in merkel 's grand coalition , finds itself alone on this issue , with even their former partner in government , the greens , opposed .
the problem of rightwing extremism will not be resolved by a legal process that is in any case doomed to failure , the party warns .
" their members would still be there and would look for new organizational structures .
much more important are initiatives in civil society against the dissemination of rightwing ideology , " greens parliamentary spokesman volker beck says .
instead , the party blames merkel 's government for fiscal cutbacks that have helped return the budget to balance but have closed down many social programs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de marketing -pipe- 28.08.2007 german soccer association and adidas seal new kit contract großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future of the partnership between adidas and the dfb has been a little unclear of late the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and sports apparel company adidas have agreed on a new contract for supplying the national team kit .
the deal will cost the dfb millions it could have earned from nike . the german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- and adidas , the traditional supplier of equipment to the german national soccer team , have extended their association until 2018 .
" the partnership is something special , and today is a historic occasion , " said adidas ceo herbert hainer after the agreement was made public .
" it was a matter of harmoniously balancing tradition , legal concerns and money , " said dfb president theo zwanziger .
the two soccer powers have been partners since germany won its first world cup title in 1954 .
but they have been at loggerheads for months , after adidas rival nike made a much more lucrative sponsorship offer .
adidas had claimed that its existing supplier agreement with the dfb was effectively extended in august 2006 until at least 2014 .
dfb officials , on the other hand , had maintained their deal with adidas was set to expire in 2011 .
a court of arbitration was called in , which suggested the two sides reach a compromise .
tradition trumps nike millions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nike has an impressive roster - but no germany neither side was giving specifics about the new deal .
but german news agency dpa reported that , as of 2011 , adidas will pay the dfb 20 million euros -lrb- $ 27.6 million -rrb- a year - up from the current 11 million euros .
adidas has reportedly also agreed to commit 5 million euros to support youth and women 's soccer programs .
the deal will cost the dfb millions of euros .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de right-wing extremism -pipe- 28.08.2007 social democrats press for npd ban despite warnings großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the npd is opposed by all mainstream parties but many see huge problems with a ban german social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- are pressing for a ban on the far-right npd in the face of warnings from other quarters that the german constitutional court will throw out the case as it did four years ago . the main impulse for a renewed attempt to outlaw the party derives from the assault by a 50-strong mob on a group of eight indians in the small eastern german town of mügeln on august 18 .
the calls for caution arise from fears the politicians will suffer an embarrassing defeat as they did in 2003 , when the constitutional court , based in the city of karlsruhe , rejected a case put forward jointly by both houses of parliament .
since pictures of the eight indian beaten up at mügeln were flashed around the world , other racist attacks have been reported , revealing a drift to the violent right among those youths that see themselves as left out of germany 's once-again rising prosperity .
" studies show that xenophobia , anti-semitism and contempt for the person are on the rise , " the berliner zeitung commented tuesday .
all mainstream politicians abhor the npd -lrb- german national democratic party -rrb- , which garnered only 1.6 per cent of the vote in the 2005 parliamentary elections and thus is excluded from the national parliament , although it has seats in the parliaments of two eastern states .
" i believe that even those skeptical -lrb- of a renewed banning attempt -rrb- regard the npd as unconstitutional , " spd home affairs parliamentary spokesman dieter wiefelspütz told reporters tuesday .
spd seemingly ignoring previous failed attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court threw out the last case but securing a ban under germany 's democratic constitution - which strenuously guards freedom of speech - is another matter .
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- parliamentary caucus , believes that parliament faces " another gigantic embarrassment " if it tries again .
the main problem lies in the numerous undercover agents operating within the npd to monitor its activities .
the activities of these agents - one of them reached the top of the hierarchy and is said to have authored an anti-semitic pamphlet - led the constitutional court to throw the case out in the preliminary stages four years ago .
" it was one of the bitterest defeats that the politicians have ever been handed by karlsruhe - and it was their own fault , " the berliner zeitung commented .
lengthy process could endanger police operations one person well placed to know about the undercover agents , cdu interior minister wolfgang schaüble , warns of " great procedural risk . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police infiltrators would be at risk during a court ruling the legal process leading up to a constitutional court ruling could take years , experts warn .
police and the special authority charged with the protection of the constitution are reported to be aghast at the prospect of having to withdraw their undercover agents for as long as this .
but wiefelspütz is adamant that parliament should try again .
" i call on all parties to engage in a debate over how this can be achieved , " he says .
case to ban npd " doomed to failure " say greens the spd , currently the junior partner in merkel 's grand coalition , finds itself alone on this issue , with even their former partner in government , the greens , opposed .
the problem of rightwing extremism will not be resolved by a legal process that is in any case doomed to failure , the party warns .
" their members would still be there and would look for new organizational structures .
much more important are initiatives in civil society against the dissemination of rightwing ideology , " greens parliamentary spokesman volker beck says .
instead , the party blames merkel 's government for fiscal cutbacks that have helped return the budget to balance but have closed down many social programs .
" the federal government has to demonstrate that it can do something else besides push through cuts , " beck says . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the calls for caution arise from fears the politicians will suffer an embarrassing defeat as they did in 2003 , when the constitutional court , based in the city of karlsruhe , rejected a case put forward jointly by both houses of parliament .
since pictures of the eight indian beaten up at mügeln were flashed around the world , other racist attacks have been reported , revealing a drift to the violent right among those youths that see themselves as left out of germany 's once-again rising prosperity .
" studies show that xenophobia , anti-semitism and contempt for the person are on the rise , " the berliner zeitung commented tuesday .
all mainstream politicians abhor the npd -lrb- german national democratic party -rrb- , which garnered only 1.6 per cent of the vote in the 2005 parliamentary elections and thus is excluded from the national parliament , although it has seats in the parliaments of two eastern states .
" i believe that even those skeptical -lrb- of a renewed banning attempt -rrb- regard the npd as unconstitutional , " spd home affairs parliamentary spokesman dieter wiefelspütz told reporters tuesday .
spd seemingly ignoring previous failed attempt bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's constitutional court threw out the last case but securing a ban under germany 's democratic constitution - which strenuously guards freedom of speech - is another matter .
wolfgang bosbach , deputy head of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic -lrb- cdu / csu -rrb- parliamentary caucus , believes that parliament faces " another gigantic embarrassment " if it tries again .
the main problem lies in the numerous undercover agents operating within the npd to monitor its activities .
the activities of these agents - one of them reached the top of the hierarchy and is said to have authored an anti-semitic pamphlet - led the constitutional court to throw the case out in the preliminary stages four years ago .
" it was one of the bitterest defeats that the politicians have ever been handed by karlsruhe - and it was their own fault , " the berliner zeitung commented .
lengthy process could endanger police operations one person well placed to know about the undercover agents , cdu interior minister wolfgang schaüble , warns of " great procedural risk . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : police infiltrators would be at risk during a court ruling the legal process leading up to a constitutional court ruling could take years , experts warn .
police and the special authority charged with the protection of the constitution are reported to be aghast at the prospect of having to withdraw their undercover agents for as long as this .
but wiefelspütz is adamant that parliament should try again .
" i call on all parties to engage in a debate over how this can be achieved , " he says .
case to ban npd " doomed to failure " say greens the spd , currently the junior partner in merkel 's grand coalition , finds itself alone on this issue , with even their former partner in government , the greens , opposed .
the problem of rightwing extremism will not be resolved by a legal process that is in any case doomed to failure , the party warns .
" their members would still be there and would look for new organizational structures .
much more important are initiatives in civil society against the dissemination of rightwing ideology , " greens parliamentary spokesman volker beck says .
instead , the party blames merkel 's government for fiscal cutbacks that have helped return the budget to balance but have closed down many social programs .
" the federal government has to demonstrate that it can do something else besides push through cuts , " beck says . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move has some observers scratching their heads , and others hoping for the best . the reputation of german wine has been on the rise in recent years .
no longer viewed solely as the producer of painfully sweet whites , the country is starting to enjoy a worldwide reputation as a producer of subtle and flavourful rieslings , burgundies and müller-thurgaus , among others . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : small growers are still important in german wine regions so it may not seem like the ideal time for two of the country 's most respected wine makers to hop into bed with the country 's number one discount supermarket chain . after all , by continuously slashing prices , aldi has lowered the average price of wine on its shelves from over two euros -lrb- $ 2.70 -rrb- for a 0.75 liter bottle in 2001 , to 1.73 euros a bottle today , according to ernst büscher , a spokesman for the german wine institute , an industry association . " i expect to sell out " but partnering with aldi is exactly what german winemakers raimond prüm , of the mosel region , and fritz keller , from kaiserstuhl in baden , deemed the right thing to do . back in june , keller struck a deal with aldi to produce weissburgunder and spätburgunder wines .
to produce enough wine , he will cooperate with some 1,000 local vintners , who have to adhere to a strict set of quality criteria in order to be able to contribute to the cuvee .
the wines will be priced to sell at around seven or eight euros . raimund prüm , whose best rieslings can sell for hundreds of euros per bottle , also struck a deal to release a cuvee for aldi .
for his release of between 300,000 and a half a million bottles , prüm will use grapes of his own , as well as selected other vineyards .
the other grapes must be grown in accordance with rigid growing , production and territory criteria . given the relatively small production , and the price of between six and eight euros per bottle , prüm told germany 's die welt newspaper , " i expect the wine to sell out in a number of hours . " win-win situation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in rudesheim , vinyards are also hiking paths for prüm , the situation is win-win .
for one thing , thanks to aldi 's massive distribution system , his wines can be appreciated by the widest possible audience . " the wine will be something special for the discounter to offer , and will show just how high a quality wine the mosel region can produce , " prüm said . statistics are unreliable , but the german wine institute estimates retail grocery sales in general account for 70 percent of wine sales in germany ; 30 percent of that amount can be chalked up to aldi sales alone .
wine specialty shops , in contrast , account for just 3 to 5 percent of sales . ironically , getting the invitation to sell wine through a giant discounter can be seen as an honor in itself , according to the german wine institute 's büscher .
aldi has promoted high-quality , higher-priced italian and spanish wines in the past ; now its germany 's turn . " that aldi is now opening this price class for german wines shows that the image of german wines has improved , both here and internationally , " büscher said . but nils vahrenwald , the owner of weinhaus süd , a mid-sized distributor of international wines in cologne , is skeptical about the wine makers who are in league with rock-bottom retailers . good for the industry ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone knows when it 's time for picking " i do n't understand why they 're doing it - these winemakers do n't need to be on the shelves next to the cheapest mass-produced stuff , " vahrenwald said .
" i honestly do not know how they are making this wine , but they must be buying the cheapest grapes , working on it a little in production , and then selling it for a great profit . " in the end they are n't doing german wine a favor , " said vahrenwald , who noted that he has spent years trying to boost the image of german wines among his customers , even back when it was out of fashion . but ulrich sauter , an editor at germany 's wein gourmet magazine , said he does think both parties stand to gain from the deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aldi has had a huge influence on german wine tastes " from the side of the discounters , they want to get more prestige , " he said .
" the producers want more sales .
and if aldi is ready to have more expensive wines on its shelves that could be an improvement for the wine growers . " " i agree that it 's a paradoxical situation , but i do n't think people like fritz keller are doing this just to make a profit , " sauter said .
" i think he is really concerned about the structure of the small wine villages in his region .
if the small wine growers in kaiserstuhl , in baden , in the mosel , disappear , these regions would change entirely . " finally , sauter said , only time will tell whether it 's a good move or a bad one for the german wine industry .

she reminded beijing that the west would like to see progress on freedom of the press and other human rights issues . merkel began tuesday by meeting with representatives of the chinese media - including four prominent figures critical of the government in beijing .
the meeting was a signal of germany 's support for more press freedom in china . li datong , the former publisher of a supplement to the china youth daily newspaper , was full of praise for merkel . " the meeting shows that the chancellor attaches great significance to democracy and freedom of speech in china , " li told german news agency dpa . later , at a speech to china 's academy of social sciences , merkel underscored western concerns about the status of civil liberties in china . " from our perspective , the topic of human rights is of decisive importance , " merkel said in her speech .

abdullah gül was elected turkey 's next president on tuesday .
but calls by prime minister erdogan for gül 's critics to give up their citizenship have the media wondering what direction turkey will take . prime minister recep tayyip erdogan has come under sharp criticism for calling on turks who refuse to accept former islamist abdullah gül 's presidency to leave the country .
the turkish parliament on tuesday elected the current foreign minister as the country 's next president . gül had failed in an attempt to win the presidency earlier this year . " those -lrb- turks -rrb- who do not recognize abdullah gül as their president should give up their turkish citizenship , " erdogan said in an interview with television station kanal d. erdogan was commenting on an article by the prominent columnist bekir coskun from turkey 's largest daily hürriyet .
coskun had written that gül 's presidency would mean the end of the secular state in turkey - a fear shared by the country 's secular elite . " gül will not be my president , " coskun wrote last week .
erdogan 's ruling justice and development party -lrb- akp -rrb- nominated gül for the presidency . government terror ? after the akp victory in general elections on july 22 , erdogan had promised to be " everyone 's prime minister . "
many observers had hoped he would embrace the highly polarized society as a whole . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's foreign minister abdullah gül will become the country 's next president yet according to yüksel isik from the progressive journalists association , the prime minister 's statement showed that press freedom was still a major challenge in turkey . " the prime minister is taking an exclusionary stance against a prominent journalist , bekir coskun , as if he is ' the other ' , " isik said .
" if local governors follow the prime minister 's behavior and try to pressure journalists in local regions , this would mean the total terrorization of turkey by this government . " in a separate move , the mass circulation hürriyet fired columnist emin cölasan last week , who is known for his highly critical articles on the akp-led government .
according to isik , these events showed that the problem of press freedom was more serious than it appeared . " many of our journalist colleagues have been fired without any just cause , only for their criticism of governmental policies , " isik said . harming turkey 's eu ambitions ? lucio leante has been working in turkey since 2001 for the italian ansa news agency .
he said he thinks that critical journalists such as cölasan are fired because of intricate relations between media owners and the government . the interests of hürriyet publisher the dogan group with the government could have influenced the paper 's management to fire cölasan , leante said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : turkey 's position towards the press does not conform to eu standards " we ca n't prove it , but the dogan group 's many businesses and links with the state is limiting freedom of press , " leante said . leante added that erdogan 's inability to endure criticism played an important role in stifling the press .
yet despite the prime minister 's harsh attitude toward journalists , cartoon artists and publishers , there was still support for him and his party for turkey 's ambitions to join the european union .
according to leante , western nations were putting turkey to the test . " i think turkey is going on an experiment in which international circles want to see if a moderate islamic conservative party like the akp can be permanently moderate and democratic , " leante said . he said that some western countries believed this " experiment " could serve as a kind of model for other countries in the middle east .
but he said he thought this was risky . " political islam is a contradiction in itself , " leante said .
" it is difficult for islam to prove itself democratic and moderate because political islam means extending religion to state problems . " for turkey 's journalists , the big question now is whether the islamist-rooted akp will use its majority power to continue criticizing the press or to open itself up to different views . berivan orucoglu -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that leaves germany as the only european contender in a field of four . buoyed by the success of the 2006 men 's world cup , germany is hoping to host another soccer celebration with women athletes in four year 's time .
german chancellor angela merkel , herself a big fan of the beautiful game , has thrown her weight behind the bid , and france 's decision to remove its hat from the ring has given germany 's chances an additional lift .
" we are very grateful to our friends in the french soccer federation for their pledge to support the german bid for the 2011 women 's world cup , " german soccer association -lrb- dfb -rrb- president theo zwanziger said in a statement .
germany is now up against australia , canada and peru for the right to host the event .

the german women 's team won the last world cup in 2003 , and some argue that it would be good for the sport , if the 2011 event were held in a powerhouse soccer nation .
" germany would definitely make a good host nation and it would benefit women 's football , " germany coach tina theune-meyer said in an interview for fifa 's web site .
" we 'd be talking about public viewing again , too .
a world cup in germany would naturally add a new impulse to our already positive development . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popularity of women 's professional leagues has also be on the rise canada could be germany 's strongest competitor - despite the fact that its neighbour , the united states , has hosted the past two of women 's world cups .
the 2007 cup is taking place in china in september .
" i think it would n't be too much to have three of four world cups in north america , fifa president sepp blatter has told the edmonton sun newspaper .
" a bid from canada is absolutely possible for 2011 from fifa 's point of view . "
the popularity of women 's soccer has been growing steadily in recent years , and fifa estimates that by the year 2010 as many women as men will be playing the sport . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german organizers hope the event will contribute to inter-cultural understanding . the 60-member osnabrück symphony has arrived in tehran and is preparing to go on stage on wednesday and thursday in the iranian capital .
conductor hermann bäumer will lead the musicians in playing works by beethoven , brahms and elgar . the concert will be a rare occasion , as no other western orchestra of this size has played in iran since the islamic revolution in 1979 .
last year , osnabrück hosted the tehran symphony orchestra , who performed to a packed audience in the western german city .
the exchange is part of osnabrück 's orient festival . in view of the ongoing political tensions between iran and the west , the orchestra 's concerts were aimed at improving inter-cultural dialogue , said the festival 's director michael dreyer . " it is important to me that this is not a one-time event , but rather the beginning of a long-term cultural cooperation , " dreyer said .
six iranian musicians will support the german orchestra in this week 's concerts , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : music is a language everyone understands " i hope that such cultural exchange projects will soon become normality , even between the west and the islamic world , " dreyer said .
he told reporters in tehran that the exchange hoped to " show to both countries that there are lots of similarities between us and no reason to fear each other . " conductor bäumer said music was the only language everybody in the world could speak and understand . " i 'm sure that making music together will change things , " bäumer said in tehran .
" every human being can be reached by music . " politics are not part of it dreyer visited tehran several times over the past year in order to prepare the concerts .
the trip has been fully coordinated with iran 's ministry of culture and islamic guidance . " it was all but a mission impossible , " dreyer said in an interview with german news agency dpa prior to his departure .
" we only managed it because high-ranking clerical and political iranians lobbied for it . " all of the female musicians will be required to wear islamic headscarves to obey iran 's dress code . " the women are not used to playing in hijab , " bäumer said .
" i am very glad that the women tried it and it was fine .
what is most important is the music . " the orchestra 's directors said the visit was aimed purely at cultural understanding , and not politics .
dreyer said he had rejected a request by three german mps to join the tour in order to keep the trip focused on music and not politics . the concerts are expected to draw large crowds . classical music experiencing a resurgence in iran bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karajan conducted the berlin philharmonic for 35 years prior to the islamic revolution , foreign orchestras performed regularly in iran , including the berlin philharmonic and its legendary conductor herbert von karajan .
but the tehran orchestra was dissolved following the revolution . only in the past decade have attempts been made to revive classical music in iran .
tehran 's symphony orchestra gives regular concerts , mixing western classics with compositions by iranian composers . the country 's ruling clerics tolerate classical , traditional iranian , as well as instrumental versions of western music .
however , pop music with singing is strictly forbidden . the festival is financed by various cultural organizations in osnabrück , as well as the german foreign office .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de turkey -pipe- 28.08.2007 gül wins presidential vote in turkey großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : abdullah gül can now officially say hello to the turkish presidency the turkish parliament on tuesday elected foreign minister gül to become the country 's next president .
the vote had pitted secularists and the ruling islamist-rooted justice and development party against each other . abdullah gül is the first former islamist to become turkey 's president in the secular but predominantly muslim country 's modern history .
public opinion in turkey has been sharply divided over gül 's allegiance to the country 's basic tenets . gül 's supporters consider him to be a moderate politician who has backed far-reaching democratic and human rights reforms , enabling turkey to start accession talks with the european union in 2005 .
yet staunch secularists see gül as a wolf in sheep 's clothing , bent on pushing what they consider as the ruling justice and development party 's -lrb- akp -rrb- plans to dismantle the country 's secular system . however , gül has publicly stressed in recent weeks that such plans were not on his agenda .
he told the country in a press conference earlier this month that he had cut loose from his past and fully believed in the separation of state and religion - a principle he vowed to defend as president . many analysts have said that gül 's experience as foreign minister over the past five years made him well-suited for the presidency .
this background would play an active role in furthering turkey 's european ambitions during his seven-year term , analysts said . european commission president jose manuel barroso said tuesday that the election of gül could provide fresh impetus to ankara 's eu membership talks . the election and the arrival to power of a new government " provides an opportunity to give fresh , immediate and positive impetus to the accession process to the european union through progress in a number of key areas , " barroso said in a statement . barroso said : " i am confident that you will fulfil your task with a strong sense of duty and commitment to your country and fellow citizens . " german chancellor angela merkel also sent a message of congratulation to gül . germany and turkey were " important partners " and linked by friendship , merkel said . " i am certain that you will dedicate yourself in your new office to deepening our relations , for the good of europe and the atlantic alliance , " gül 's wife not to attend swearing-in ceremony bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gül 's wife hayrunisa is a staunch defender of her right to wear a headscarf gül 's bid to become president had not only become a controversial issue due to his past involvement in islamist groups .
in addition , the fact that his wife harunisa wears an islamic-style headscarf had alarmed turkey 's secular elite .
it is illegal for state employees and university students to wear headscarves in turkey . hayrunisa gül will become the first wife of a president to wear a headscarf , which secularist turks consider a symbol of muslim political militancy .
in a move designed to calm these fears , harunisa announced earlier on tuesday that she would not attend the swearing-in ceremony . gül has countered critics by saying that the headscarf was a personal choice , and that he , and not his wife , would become president . gül won a clear majority gül won 339 votes in the parliamentary poll on tuesday in the third round of voting .
during the previous two rounds last week , gül had failed to receive a two-thirds majority .
but for the third round , he needed just a simple majority of 276 votes in the 550-seat parliament . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the turkish parliament needed three rounds to elect gül the 56-year-old gül will be sworn in at a parliamentary ceremony later on tuesday , taking over from current president ahmet necdet sezer on tuesday night . the current foreign minister easily defeated sabahattin cakmakoglu with 70 votes and huseyin tayfur icli with 13 .

eight horses showed symptoms of the virus and all 36 animals have now been placed in quarantine , police said .
the move means that mounted police officers will be unable to help provide security for next week 's summit of asia-pacific leaders in sydney .
deputy police commissioner andrew scipione said that security at the summit would not be affected .
tests had confirmed the virus in a number of horses at the state mounted police headquarters in redfern , a statement from new south wales police said .
" three horses were initially showing symptoms of ei -lrb- equine influenza -rrb- - now eight are believed to be suffering from the virus , " it said .
the horses will remain quarantined until 30 days after the last horse is free of the virus .
world leaders this is the first time equine influenza has appeared in australia .
the outbreak began last week when horses at two sites in sydney were found to be infected .
more than 400 horses across new south wales and queensland are now showing symptoms of the highly contagious virus , which does not affect humans .
race meetings have been put on hold and the movement of horses banned , meaning that police horses could not be brought to the sydney summit from another state .
australian police are mounting a huge security operation for the asia pacific economic co-operation -lrb- apec -rrb- summit next week .
the leaders of 21 nations , including russia , china and the us , will be attending .
protesters are expected to turn out for the summit but mr scipione said that mounted police would no longer be part of the crowd-control effort .

fortnum & mason , the piccadilly institution that has catered to the tastes of kings and prime ministers , as well as explorers , soldiers and generations of foreign tourists since 1707 , will mark the start of its fourth century in october .
and given that the retailer is 300 years old , it is no surprise that one of london 's most famous shopping landmarks is showing a few wrinkles .
so the store is getting a well-deserved and much-needed makeover .
" the store was very well known , had tremendous brand recognition and was very well-loved by lots of its regular customers , " explains its managing director beverley aspinall .
" but we did have a number of significant problems . "
store defects foremost among these was that the building , which in its current guise dates back to 1926 , was " worn out " .
" the fridges did not work , " ms aspinall mentions as one example of its shortcomings .
" on a hot day we would have to move the chocolates off because we did n't have enough fridges working at the right temperature to keep them on the shop floor . "
as well as day-to-day difficulties , the store faced a longer-term commercial dilemma . "
people are happy to pay for the very best and that is where we aim to position ourselves " beverley aspinall , fortnum & mason managing director while very loyal , many customers only visited a couple of times a year - at christmas or easter - while others ventured no further than the food hall on the ground floor .
while this helped sales of the store 's teas and jams , it did little for the thousands of other products stocked on its other five floors .
" we need to have people coming in more frequently , " observes ms aspinall .
" if you are living or working in mayfair , these are the sorts of people we want to have in more regularly . "
a gift for everyone in the past , some local residents may have been put off by fortnum & mason 's image as a rather eccentric and expensive curiosity shop .
it still sells jars of foie gras for £ 120 -lrb- $ 240 -rrb- while the most expensive hamper in this year 's collection will set you back £ 20,000 .
but while unashamedly trumpeting its position at the top end of the market , ms aspinall also appears to head down-market , stressing a new emphasis on " affordable luxury " that does not exclude people on more modest budgets .
fortnum 's history 1707 : royal footman william fortnum and shopkeeper hugh mason open grocery store 1788 : grandson charles fortnum leaves royal service to run store 1855 : queen victoria orders fortnum 's to send beef tea to wounded soldiers in the crimea 1863 : first royal warrant to supply the prince of wales 1925 : new ladies fashion store 1998 : launches website 2001 : delists from stock market after 62 years 2004 : opens first concession store in tokyo 2005 : begins £ 24m refurbishment in pictures : fortnum 's through the years so fortnum & mason has packed hampers that go on sale for £ 40 and are geared to modern celebrations - such as flat warming parties - as well as more traditional social occasions .
" you can come in and buy a really nice tin of tea for £ 5 or a beautiful bar of soap , " ms aspinall says .
in an effort to widen its appeal , the store decided several years ago to embark on its most comprehensive refurbishment in years .
when it unveils its new layout on 29 october , more than £ 25m will have been spent on creating a new floor devoted to fresh food , along with a central atrium showing off all its trading space as well as several new cafes and restaurants .
in the process , fortnum 's has endured nearly two years of serious disruption .
although it tried to minimise the impact on its business by stopping building work in the run-up to christmas - its busiest time - its sales have been badly hit .
" you name it , customers have had to contend with it , " ms aspinall acknowledges .
on its travels growth in online orders - fortnum 's revamped its website in 2005 and has seen sales rise sharply - has compensated to some degree .
fortnum 's is also fortunate that it is just one outpost of the global retail empire run by the weston family of canada .
the family , which also owns selfridges among other retailers , can afford to take a longer-term view of the store 's prospects and return on investment than a public company .
in reality , the changes to the piccadilly store are part of a bigger picture in which the growth of the fortnum & mason 's brand , rather neglected in the past , has moved to centre-stage .
" it will always have limitations in how far it can grow as it is small by comparison with other department stores , " ms aspinall says of the 64,000 square foot site .
" but -lsb- the refurbishment -rsb- is doing more than servicing local shoppers .
it is also the place that people will come from japan and the us who want to see the real thing . "
fortnum 's wants to give expatriates and foreign fans a taste of the real thing nearer home .
it has raised its international ambitions in the past five years , opening 13 concession stores in japan in partnership with local retailer mitsukoshi .
" the link is tea , " she says , explaining the japanese connection .
" because the japanese are huge tea drinkers , there is an enormous and natural synergy there . "
fortnum 's is looking for retail sites in the us and also has high hopes for russia , having benefited from the influx of russian wealth into london in recent years .
" they are very keen on well-known , luxury brands , " ms aspinall says .
from peterborough to piccadilly fortnum 's boss is " ambitious " for the company 's future - but what of her own ambitions ?
ms aspinall came to fortnum & mason 's in 2005 , having crowned a 25-year career with john lewis by managing the £ 100m redevelopment of flagship london store peter jones .
she may be acquiring a handy reputation for managing high-profile retail developments with aplomb but she does not want to look beyond making the current project a success .
" i tend not to look ahead and think that is what i want to do next .
when i was running john lewis in peterborough i was very , very happy doing that . "
she is not underestimating the current challenge , which comes at a time when the weak dollar and global market volatility are likely to affect some regular customers .
but she says the store has adapted to upheavals in the past , not least when so many of its clients were killed in world war i and widows replaced manservants as customers .
" there have been radical changes in the past .
you change the store in response to social change . "

the discovery of the so-called black boxes comes after a us-operated ship arrived last week to help the search .
the adam air boeing 737 was flying between java and sulawesi when it came down off the sulawesi coast in one of indonesia 's worst air disasters .
the body of the plane is believed to be at a depth of 1,700m -lrb- 5,600ft -rrb- .
despite a massive search , no bodies have ever been found although some wreckage made its way to the surface in the weeks following the crash .
while a signal from the black boxes was thought to have been heard soon after the crash , their retrieval has been held up by disagreements between the government and the airline over who should pay for it .
false leads " they have retrieved two black boxes , " tatang kurniadi , of the national transportation safety commission , said on tuesday .
he said the data recorders - which include vital information about the flight and conversations in the cockpit - had been sent to makassar port in sulawesi and would be heading to the us for analysis .
" god willing they are still readable , " he was quoted by the associated press as saying .
he was speaking after a salvage ship operated by us firm phoenix international joined the search off sulawesi island last week .
the plane disappeared after battling strong winds and twice changing course during a flight from surabaya in java to manado in northern sulawesi on 1 january 2007 .
a massive air , land and sea operation got under way with several other countries offering help with the search .
but the hunt was hampered by bad weather as well as false leads .
the government had to apologise for erroneously saying , soon after the plane 's disappearance , that the wreckage had been found .

the discovery of the so-called black boxes comes after a us-operated ship arrived last week to help the search .
the adam air boeing 737 was flying between java and sulawesi when it came down off the sulawesi coast in one of indonesia 's worst air disasters .
the body of the plane is believed to be at a depth of 1,700m -lrb- 5,600ft -rrb- .
despite a massive search , no bodies have ever been found although some wreckage made its way to the surface in the weeks following the crash .
while a signal from the black boxes was thought to have been heard soon after the crash , their retrieval has been held up by disagreements between the government and the airline over who should pay for it .
false leads " they have retrieved two black boxes , " tatang kurniadi , of the national transportation safety commission , said on tuesday .
he said the data recorders - which include vital information about the flight and conversations in the cockpit - had been sent to makassar port in sulawesi and would be heading to the us for analysis .
" god willing they are still readable , " he was quoted by the associated press as saying .
he was speaking after a salvage ship operated by us firm phoenix international joined the search off sulawesi island last week .
the plane disappeared after battling strong winds and twice changing course during a flight from surabaya in java to manado in northern sulawesi on 1 january 2007 .
a massive air , land and sea operation got under way with several other countries offering help with the search .
but the hunt was hampered by bad weather as well as false leads .
the government had to apologise for erroneously saying , soon after the plane 's disappearance , that the wreckage had been found .
