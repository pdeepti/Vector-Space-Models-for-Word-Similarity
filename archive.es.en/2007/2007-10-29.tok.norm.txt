" antiquated and crusty structures will be broken up . " the aim was for the agency to become stronger as a " service provider " for the german government and parliament , borchert said , adding that berlin 's control over the agency was meant to be strengthened .
the reform of the bnd , which has 6,000 employees , is due to be completed by 2009 , the same year as germany 's next parliamentary elections , and three years before the agency is due to complete its move from pullach , near munich , to berlin .

borchert stressed that the reform plans were not the result of " alleged or real existing scandals . "
he said an overhaul had been under debate for a long time in order to prepare the bnd for " future challenges , " but that the events had made reform more urgent . bnd president ernst uhrlau had touted the reform in employee meetings in pullach and berlin as a profound change to the service .

but critics say it 's inhumane and does nothing to get to the root of the problem . in 2003 , time magazine 's cover story on heroes featured an arresting image of a gray-haired white man , clad in a clergyman 's robes and a gleaming cross around his neck , standing knee-deep in the sea clasping a black baby in his arms .
the man was isidoro macias , a white cross franciscan friar who ran shelters for the hundreds of illegal immigrants at the time who made the perilous journey across the strait of gibraltar to spain in small boats known as pateras in spanish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isidoro macias was dubbed papa patera for his efforts to help illegal immigrants squashed together in the small dinghies , the shivering , dazed africans who arrived on spanish shores included many pregnant women and mothers with babies .
it was this group that isidoro paid special attention to , proving them with food , clothing and shelter - a mission that earned him the nickname " papa patera . "
up to 20 pregnant women lived in isidoro 's shelter at any given time , sleeping on air mattresses .
infrared cameras to deter migrants today , the shelter houses only three women with four children .
" all of a sudden , their numbers have dropped drastically , " isidoro said .
" the spanish security authorities have developed technologies that have led to refugees and criminal people-smugglers taking other routes . "
in 2002 , the spanish government developed a high-tech 300-million-euro -lrb- $ 430-million -rrb- border surveillance system called sive and has since deployed it on its porous southern border .
the control room of the sophisticated tracking system responsible for monitoring a 114-kilometer -lrb- 71-mile -rrb- long stretch of the strait of gibraltar - one of the world 's most-traveled sea routes - is located in a drab block of buildings in the spanish port of algeciras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian augustina gave birth to twins in spain the nerve center , a room bathed in neon light and outfitted with dozens of computer monitors , allows officials to track the movements of boats and fishing vessels with the help of video cameras and infrared systems installed at five points in the strait .
" the significant thing about the system is that , both day and night , it can track and make visible swimming objects that barely stick out of the water 's surface and are less than a meter -lrb- a yard -rrb- long , " said salvador gomez , one of the officials working there .
system working well , say officials the main concern for the spanish coast guard is the sea traffic from the south to the north .
the route is largely used by young migrants from morocco , aware that they ca n't be deported so easily , if they are caught , because they are minors .
" just this morning we caught two young moroccans in the strait , " said gomez .
" they were trying to cross it in a child 's dinghy that you can buy in any supermarket . "
officials say the sophisticated surveillance system is not just meant to deter illegal immigrants but also to save lives .
once the system detects illegal immigrants , the chase is taken on by the spanish coast guard , and emergency services are notified if the rickety boats overturn .
bildunterschrift : the spanish coast guard seizes illegal immigrants once they are detected by the tracking system the surveillance system is also meant to help in the fight against the drugs trade .
morocco is the world 's largest exporter of hashish , and cocaine , too , is often smuggled via north africa to europe .
the tracking system has hugely helped , according to officials .
this year , officials seized less than 1,000 illegal migrants trying to get into spain , down from some 13,000 in 2000 .
a number of other countries , including portugal , estonia and serbia , are following spain 's example and setting up the surveillance system as increasing numbers of illegal immigrants try to make their way into europe to find work .
" a policy that kills " the system , however , has been massively criticized by human rights groups , who say it does nothing to stem the flood of illegal migration but only diverts it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte espuche says the surveillance system is endangering migrant 's lives " the immigrants are increasingly selecting further , dangerous routes - for example via the canary islands , " said brigitte espuche of the pro human rights group in cadiz .
" to me that 's not a policy that saves lives , but rather one that kills , " she said .
not everyone agrees .
manuel fenix of the red cross in tarifa near algeciras , who has been called countless times by the spanish civil guard to take care of newly-arrived illegal immigrants , said the surveillance system has proved to be a life-saver .
" boats that run into rough weather on the seas can be tracked by the system and the emergency services can be sent out on time , " said fenix .
" earlier , the people used to just drown . "
the system , however , wo n't prevent people from trying to get to spain , fenix added .
he remembered the one time authorities pulled out a dead moroccan man from the waters in the strait .
he had bound an old rubber tire to his chest and another to his back .
two table tennis rackets , which he had used as paddles , bobbed from rope tied to his hands .
" africa is just a stone 's throw away from us , " fenix said .
" as long as people believe they can find a better life here , they 'll keep coming .
it does n't matter how many more cameras you install . " steffen leidel -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

manuel fenix of the red cross in tarifa near algeciras , who has been called countless times by the spanish civil guard to take care of newly-arrived illegal immigrants , said the surveillance system has proved to be a life-saver .
" boats that run into rough weather on the seas can be tracked by the system and the emergency services can be sent out on time , " said fenix .

but critics say it 's inhumane and does nothing to get to the root of the problem . in 2003 , time magazine 's cover story on heroes featured an arresting image of a gray-haired white man , clad in a clergyman 's robes and a gleaming cross around his neck , standing knee-deep in the sea clasping a black baby in his arms .
the man was isidoro macias , a white cross franciscan friar who ran shelters for the hundreds of illegal immigrants at the time who made the perilous journey across the strait of gibraltar to spain in small boats known as pateras in spanish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isidoro macias was dubbed papa patera for his efforts to help illegal immigrants squashed together in the small dinghies , the shivering , dazed africans who arrived on spanish shores included many pregnant women and mothers with babies .
it was this group that isidoro paid special attention to , proving them with food , clothing and shelter - a mission that earned him the nickname " papa patera . "
up to 20 pregnant women lived in isidoro 's shelter at any given time , sleeping on air mattresses .
infrared cameras to deter migrants today , the shelter houses only three women with four children .
" all of a sudden , their numbers have dropped drastically , " isidoro said .
" the spanish security authorities have developed technologies that have led to refugees and criminal people-smugglers taking other routes . "
in 2002 , the spanish government developed a high-tech 300-million-euro -lrb- $ 430-million -rrb- border surveillance system called sive and has since deployed it on its porous southern border .
the control room of the sophisticated tracking system responsible for monitoring a 114-kilometer -lrb- 71-mile -rrb- long stretch of the strait of gibraltar - one of the world 's most-traveled sea routes - is located in a drab block of buildings in the spanish port of algeciras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian augustina gave birth to twins in spain the nerve center , a room bathed in neon light and outfitted with dozens of computer monitors , allows officials to track the movements of boats and fishing vessels with the help of video cameras and infrared systems installed at five points in the strait .
" the significant thing about the system is that , both day and night , it can track and make visible swimming objects that barely stick out of the water 's surface and are less than a meter -lrb- a yard -rrb- long , " said salvador gomez , one of the officials working there .
system working well , say officials the main concern for the spanish coast guard is the sea traffic from the south to the north .
the route is largely used by young migrants from morocco , aware that they ca n't be deported so easily , if they are caught , because they are minors .
" just this morning we caught two young moroccans in the strait , " said gomez .
" they were trying to cross it in a child 's dinghy that you can buy in any supermarket . "
officials say the sophisticated surveillance system is not just meant to deter illegal immigrants but also to save lives .
once the system detects illegal immigrants , the chase is taken on by the spanish coast guard , and emergency services are notified if the rickety boats overturn .
bildunterschrift : the spanish coast guard seizes illegal immigrants once they are detected by the tracking system the surveillance system is also meant to help in the fight against the drugs trade .

but critics say it 's inhumane and does nothing to get to the root of the problem . in 2003 , time magazine 's cover story on heroes featured an arresting image of a gray-haired white man , clad in a clergyman 's robes and a gleaming cross around his neck , standing knee-deep in the sea clasping a black baby in his arms .
the man was isidoro macias , a white cross franciscan friar who ran shelters for the hundreds of illegal immigrants at the time who made the perilous journey across the strait of gibraltar to spain in small boats known as pateras in spanish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isidoro macias was dubbed papa patera for his efforts to help illegal immigrants squashed together in the small dinghies , the shivering , dazed africans who arrived on spanish shores included many pregnant women and mothers with babies .
it was this group that isidoro paid special attention to , proving them with food , clothing and shelter - a mission that earned him the nickname " papa patera . "
up to 20 pregnant women lived in isidoro 's shelter at any given time , sleeping on air mattresses .
infrared cameras to deter migrants today , the shelter houses only three women with four children .
" all of a sudden , their numbers have dropped drastically , " isidoro said .
" the spanish security authorities have developed technologies that have led to refugees and criminal people-smugglers taking other routes . "
in 2002 , the spanish government developed a high-tech 300-million-euro -lrb- $ 430-million -rrb- border surveillance system called sive and has since deployed it on its porous southern border .
the control room of the sophisticated tracking system responsible for monitoring a 114-kilometer -lrb- 71-mile -rrb- long stretch of the strait of gibraltar - one of the world 's most-traveled sea routes - is located in a drab block of buildings in the spanish port of algeciras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian augustina gave birth to twins in spain the nerve center , a room bathed in neon light and outfitted with dozens of computer monitors , allows officials to track the movements of boats and fishing vessels with the help of video cameras and infrared systems installed at five points in the strait .
" the significant thing about the system is that , both day and night , it can track and make visible swimming objects that barely stick out of the water 's surface and are less than a meter -lrb- a yard -rrb- long , " said salvador gomez , one of the officials working there .
system working well , say officials the main concern for the spanish coast guard is the sea traffic from the south to the north .
the route is largely used by young migrants from morocco , aware that they ca n't be deported so easily , if they are caught , because they are minors .
" just this morning we caught two young moroccans in the strait , " said gomez .
" they were trying to cross it in a child 's dinghy that you can buy in any supermarket . "
officials say the sophisticated surveillance system is not just meant to deter illegal immigrants but also to save lives .
once the system detects illegal immigrants , the chase is taken on by the spanish coast guard , and emergency services are notified if the rickety boats overturn .
bildunterschrift : the spanish coast guard seizes illegal immigrants once they are detected by the tracking system the surveillance system is also meant to help in the fight against the drugs trade .
morocco is the world 's largest exporter of hashish , and cocaine , too , is often smuggled via north africa to europe .
the tracking system has hugely helped , according to officials .
this year , officials seized less than 1,000 illegal migrants trying to get into spain , down from some 13,000 in 2000 .
a number of other countries , including portugal , estonia and serbia , are following spain 's example and setting up the surveillance system as increasing numbers of illegal immigrants try to make their way into europe to find work .
" a policy that kills " the system , however , has been massively criticized by human rights groups , who say it does nothing to stem the flood of illegal migration but only diverts it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte espuche says the surveillance system is endangering migrant 's lives " the immigrants are increasingly selecting further , dangerous routes - for example via the canary islands , " said brigitte espuche of the pro human rights group in cadiz .
" to me that 's not a policy that saves lives , but rather one that kills , " she said .
not everyone agrees .
manuel fenix of the red cross in tarifa near algeciras , who has been called countless times by the spanish civil guard to take care of newly-arrived illegal immigrants , said the surveillance system has proved to be a life-saver .
" boats that run into rough weather on the seas can be tracked by the system and the emergency services can be sent out on time , " said fenix .
" earlier , the people used to just drown . "
the system , however , wo n't prevent people from trying to get to spain , fenix added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de security -pipe- 29.10.2007 germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service to be overhauled großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bnd has started cleaning house germany 's bnd foreign intelligence service faces a radical overhaul after a series of scandals .
the agency is meant to become a stronger " service provider , " a spokesman said . " the service will undergo a thorough reform process , " said bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- spokesman stefan borchert on saturday , oct .
27 .
" antiquated and crusty structures will be broken up . " the aim was for the agency to become stronger as a " service provider " for the german government and parliament , borchert said , adding that berlin 's control over the agency was meant to be strengthened .
the reform of the bnd , which has 6,000 employees , is due to be completed by 2009 , the same year as germany 's next parliamentary elections , and three years before the agency is due to complete its move from pullach , near munich , to berlin .
" profound changes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bnd 's headquarters will soon be in the capital the service 's upper tiers are supposed to be trimmed down at the same time as its eight departments would grow to 12 .
a new " proliferation " department would deal with illegal weapons deals .
the wall between agents who collect information and those who analyze it was going to be broken down , borchert said , ensuring more transparency .
the bnd 's 50-year history is speckled with scandals , most recently for its agent 's questionable actions in afghanistan and for spying on journalists in germany , a practice that was only suspended in late 2005 .
the " self-protection " department , which did the spying , would only be responsible for protecting the service 's own agents after the reform , der spiegel newsmagazine reported .
borchert stressed that the reform plans were not the result of " alleged or real existing scandals . "
he said an overhaul had been under debate for a long time in order to prepare the bnd for " future challenges , " but that the events had made reform more urgent . bnd president ernst uhrlau had touted the reform in employee meetings in pullach and berlin as a profound change to the service .
high time , opposition says praise for the reform came from opposition politicians over the weekend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd chief uhrlau is prepared to break taboos " it was time for the consequences to be drawn from the apparent aberrations , " hans-christian ströbele , an opposition green party member of the parliamentary commission established to investigate the bnd 's activities in afghanistan , told the taz daily .
" thus the bnd leadership and the federal chancellery would be in a position to better control the agency .
the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party 's secret service expert expressed similar sentiments . " the federal government has recognized that it has to keep the bnd on a shorter leash , " max stadler , told ard television over the weekend .
" for that we also need better control by the parliament . " dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 29.10.2007 ahead of india visit , merkel signals shift in asia policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : changing priorities - merkel with chinese president hu and indian premier singh german chancellor angela merkel heads to india on monday , oct .
29 , promising to reverse her government 's china-centric asia policy and expand business and political ties with delhi . india may have increasingly been on the radar of successive german governments in recent years , but it 's been a mere blip compared to china 's overpowering presence . that is likely to change as german chancellor angela merkel heads to delhi and mumbai on her first official visit . last week , members of merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- called for a shift in focus of the government 's asia policy , saying there had been an overemphasis on china at the expense of other rising asian economies . berlin 's relationship with beijing is currently strained after china objected to a meeting between merkel and the exiled tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama in september . " many chances in a democracy like india " germany 's policy towards asia has so far " been too narrowly focused on economic issues and china , " said eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for the cdu 's parliamentary group , last week in the bundestag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party has stressed india 's democratic credentials cdu deputies outlined plans to make relations with asia a cornerstone of germany 's foreign and security policy in order to ensure that the region 's growing economic and political clout does not lead to a decline in german influence .
the plan calls for an asia policy increasingly based on western values and urges germany to close ranks with other democratic asian nations such as india , japan and south korea . merkel signaled last week she is prepared to reverse her predecessor gerhard schröder 's policy on asia .
he was criticized for an overt emphasis on cultivating business ties with china and turning a blind eye to its human right violations , and try to expand business and political relations with india . " we have to act relatively quickly , " merkel said .
" as europeans , we have many chances in a democratic country like india .
we just have to get involved . " business , trade ties gather steam experts admit that germany has been slow to wake up to the opportunities that india , a country of 1.1 billion people with rapid growth rates of around 9 percent a year , has to offer . " the rise of india has come as a surprise to germany , " said joachim beck from the institute for asian studies at the german institute of global and area studies .
" it has been so accustomed to seeing india as poor , as an unstable , multifaceted country .
the german government never thought india could become a world power in economic and political terms . " in recent years , berlin has moved to correct its relative neglect of the rising south asian power by pursuing bilateral business and trade with delhi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with singh at the hanover trade fair last year india is now germany 's fourth largest trading partner in asia - after china , japan and south korea .
bilateral trade stands at roughly 10.6 billion euros with german exports to india last year surging by more than 50 percent .
germany is the fourth largest investor in india and newly-confident indian companies are also increasingly making acquisitions in europe 's largest economy . last year 's focus on india at the hanover trade fair as well as the frankfurt book fair helped in filling the gaps in germany 's image of the asian nation .
merkel also enjoys good personal relations with her indian counterpart , prime minister manmohan singh . climate change talks not easy despite those improvements , merkel 's visit , which includes economic cooperation , but also climate change and the region 's fraught politics , is not expected to be entirely smooth . on the business front , merkel 's job will be clear cut - seeking ways to tap what experts say are vast unexplored opportunities in energy and infrastructure among other sectors .
a high-profile business delegation accompanying merkel is expected to use the chancellor 's visit to pressure delhi to tackle familiar problems of overregulation , red tape , corruption , crumbling infrastructure and an unreliable energy supply . politically however , merkel will face complicated talks with singh , particularly on climate change .
merkel who has taken the lead on tackling the issue in europe , clinched a deal to halve greenhouse gases at the g8 summit in germany earlier this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india emits 4.2 percent of the world 's co2 emissions - germany 's emits 3.2 percent india , like other developing nations , is vehemently opposed to capping greenhouse gas emissions , saying it will not compromise its continued 9 percent economic growth to arrest global warming .
it argues it is historical polluters in the industrialized west who must bear the brunt of emission cuts . merkel has welcomed a proposal by indian leader singh for an alternative plan that foresees linking caps on carbon dioxide emissions to the population of a country .
but , india has since held back on elaborating on the plan , underscoring the divide facing developed and developing nations when they meet in december in bali , indonesia to begin negotiations on a new climate change agreement to replace the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 . bernhard steinrücke , head of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai suggested in an interview with deutsche welle that germany should focus instead on what it can offer the indians in the fight against climate change . " compared to germany , the degree of pollution in india is still very low per capita , " steinrücke said .
" german companies have a lot to offer indians in terms of renewable energy , clean coal technology and energy efficiency know-how . " " room for germany as an honest broker " merkel will also need to tread carefully on issues such as the conflict in kashmir and india 's relations with neighboring pakistan , both nuclear powers .
delhi is opposed to critical questions on the topics which it views as international meddling in its internal affairs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india does n't take kindly to international criticism of the kashmir conflict other delicate political topics on the agenda include stalled talks on un reforms and a common desire in delhi and berlin for a permanent seat at the un security council , tough german visa procedures for indian business leaders and a controversial deal on civilian nuclear cooperation between india and the us . given that the indo-us nuclear deal might not materialize in the face of stiff opposition by india 's communist parties , the cdu 's von klaeden hopes there might yet be room for berlin to gain some political clout in the region . " the indians are too clever to only bind themselves to one partner , " von klaeden told the rheinischer merkur newspaper last week .

29 , promising to reverse her government 's china-centric asia policy and expand business and political ties with delhi . india may have increasingly been on the radar of successive german governments in recent years , but it 's been a mere blip compared to china 's overpowering presence . that is likely to change as german chancellor angela merkel heads to delhi and mumbai on her first official visit . last week , members of merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- called for a shift in focus of the government 's asia policy , saying there had been an overemphasis on china at the expense of other rising asian economies . berlin 's relationship with beijing is currently strained after china objected to a meeting between merkel and the exiled tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama in september . " many chances in a democracy like india " germany 's policy towards asia has so far " been too narrowly focused on economic issues and china , " said eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for the cdu 's parliamentary group , last week in the bundestag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party has stressed india 's democratic credentials cdu deputies outlined plans to make relations with asia a cornerstone of germany 's foreign and security policy in order to ensure that the region 's growing economic and political clout does not lead to a decline in german influence .
the plan calls for an asia policy increasingly based on western values and urges germany to close ranks with other democratic asian nations such as india , japan and south korea . merkel signaled last week she is prepared to reverse her predecessor gerhard schröder 's policy on asia .
he was criticized for an overt emphasis on cultivating business ties with china and turning a blind eye to its human right violations , and try to expand business and political relations with india . " we have to act relatively quickly , " merkel said .
" as europeans , we have many chances in a democratic country like india .
we just have to get involved . " business , trade ties gather steam experts admit that germany has been slow to wake up to the opportunities that india , a country of 1.1 billion people with rapid growth rates of around 9 percent a year , has to offer . " the rise of india has come as a surprise to germany , " said joachim beck from the institute for asian studies at the german institute of global and area studies .
" it has been so accustomed to seeing india as poor , as an unstable , multifaceted country .
the german government never thought india could become a world power in economic and political terms . " in recent years , berlin has moved to correct its relative neglect of the rising south asian power by pursuing bilateral business and trade with delhi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with singh at the hanover trade fair last year india is now germany 's fourth largest trading partner in asia - after china , japan and south korea .
bilateral trade stands at roughly 10.6 billion euros with german exports to india last year surging by more than 50 percent .
germany is the fourth largest investor in india and newly-confident indian companies are also increasingly making acquisitions in europe 's largest economy . last year 's focus on india at the hanover trade fair as well as the frankfurt book fair helped in filling the gaps in germany 's image of the asian nation .
merkel also enjoys good personal relations with her indian counterpart , prime minister manmohan singh . climate change talks not easy despite those improvements , merkel 's visit , which includes economic cooperation , but also climate change and the region 's fraught politics , is not expected to be entirely smooth . on the business front , merkel 's job will be clear cut - seeking ways to tap what experts say are vast unexplored opportunities in energy and infrastructure among other sectors .
a high-profile business delegation accompanying merkel is expected to use the chancellor 's visit to pressure delhi to tackle familiar problems of overregulation , red tape , corruption , crumbling infrastructure and an unreliable energy supply . politically however , merkel will face complicated talks with singh , particularly on climate change .
merkel who has taken the lead on tackling the issue in europe , clinched a deal to halve greenhouse gases at the g8 summit in germany earlier this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india emits 4.2 percent of the world 's co2 emissions - germany 's emits 3.2 percent india , like other developing nations , is vehemently opposed to capping greenhouse gas emissions , saying it will not compromise its continued 9 percent economic growth to arrest global warming .
it argues it is historical polluters in the industrialized west who must bear the brunt of emission cuts . merkel has welcomed a proposal by indian leader singh for an alternative plan that foresees linking caps on carbon dioxide emissions to the population of a country .
but , india has since held back on elaborating on the plan , underscoring the divide facing developed and developing nations when they meet in december in bali , indonesia to begin negotiations on a new climate change agreement to replace the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 . bernhard steinrücke , head of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai suggested in an interview with deutsche welle that germany should focus instead on what it can offer the indians in the fight against climate change . " compared to germany , the degree of pollution in india is still very low per capita , " steinrücke said .
" german companies have a lot to offer indians in terms of renewable energy , clean coal technology and energy efficiency know-how . " " room for germany as an honest broker " merkel will also need to tread carefully on issues such as the conflict in kashmir and india 's relations with neighboring pakistan , both nuclear powers .
delhi is opposed to critical questions on the topics which it views as international meddling in its internal affairs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india does n't take kindly to international criticism of the kashmir conflict other delicate political topics on the agenda include stalled talks on un reforms and a common desire in delhi and berlin for a permanent seat at the un security council , tough german visa procedures for indian business leaders and a controversial deal on civilian nuclear cooperation between india and the us . given that the indo-us nuclear deal might not materialize in the face of stiff opposition by india 's communist parties , the cdu 's von klaeden hopes there might yet be room for berlin to gain some political clout in the region .

" the rise of india has come as a surprise to germany , " said joachim beck from the institute for asian studies at the german institute of global and area studies .
" it has been so accustomed to seeing india as poor , as an unstable , multifaceted country .
the german government never thought india could become a world power in economic and political terms . " in recent years , berlin has moved to correct its relative neglect of the rising south asian power by pursuing bilateral business and trade with delhi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with singh at the hanover trade fair last year india is now germany 's fourth largest trading partner in asia - after china , japan and south korea .
bilateral trade stands at roughly 10.6 billion euros with german exports to india last year surging by more than 50 percent .
germany is the fourth largest investor in india and newly-confident indian companies are also increasingly making acquisitions in europe 's largest economy . last year 's focus on india at the hanover trade fair as well as the frankfurt book fair helped in filling the gaps in germany 's image of the asian nation .
merkel also enjoys good personal relations with her indian counterpart , prime minister manmohan singh . climate change talks not easy despite those improvements , merkel 's visit , which includes economic cooperation , but also climate change and the region 's fraught politics , is not expected to be entirely smooth . on the business front , merkel 's job will be clear cut - seeking ways to tap what experts say are vast unexplored opportunities in energy and infrastructure among other sectors .
a high-profile business delegation accompanying merkel is expected to use the chancellor 's visit to pressure delhi to tackle familiar problems of overregulation , red tape , corruption , crumbling infrastructure and an unreliable energy supply . politically however , merkel will face complicated talks with singh , particularly on climate change .
merkel who has taken the lead on tackling the issue in europe , clinched a deal to halve greenhouse gases at the g8 summit in germany earlier this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india emits 4.2 percent of the world 's co2 emissions - germany 's emits 3.2 percent india , like other developing nations , is vehemently opposed to capping greenhouse gas emissions , saying it will not compromise its continued 9 percent economic growth to arrest global warming .
it argues it is historical polluters in the industrialized west who must bear the brunt of emission cuts . merkel has welcomed a proposal by indian leader singh for an alternative plan that foresees linking caps on carbon dioxide emissions to the population of a country .
but , india has since held back on elaborating on the plan , underscoring the divide facing developed and developing nations when they meet in december in bali , indonesia to begin negotiations on a new climate change agreement to replace the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 . bernhard steinrücke , head of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai suggested in an interview with deutsche welle that germany should focus instead on what it can offer the indians in the fight against climate change . " compared to germany , the degree of pollution in india is still very low per capita , " steinrücke said .
" german companies have a lot to offer indians in terms of renewable energy , clean coal technology and energy efficiency know-how . " " room for germany as an honest broker " merkel will also need to tread carefully on issues such as the conflict in kashmir and india 's relations with neighboring pakistan , both nuclear powers .
delhi is opposed to critical questions on the topics which it views as international meddling in its internal affairs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india does n't take kindly to international criticism of the kashmir conflict other delicate political topics on the agenda include stalled talks on un reforms and a common desire in delhi and berlin for a permanent seat at the un security council , tough german visa procedures for indian business leaders and a controversial deal on civilian nuclear cooperation between india and the us . given that the indo-us nuclear deal might not materialize in the face of stiff opposition by india 's communist parties , the cdu 's von klaeden hopes there might yet be room for berlin to gain some political clout in the region .

29 , promising to reverse her government 's china-centric asia policy and expand business and political ties with delhi . india may have increasingly been on the radar of successive german governments in recent years , but it 's been a mere blip compared to china 's overpowering presence . that is likely to change as german chancellor angela merkel heads to delhi and mumbai on her first official visit . last week , members of merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- called for a shift in focus of the government 's asia policy , saying there had been an overemphasis on china at the expense of other rising asian economies . berlin 's relationship with beijing is currently strained after china objected to a meeting between merkel and the exiled tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama in september . " many chances in a democracy like india " germany 's policy towards asia has so far " been too narrowly focused on economic issues and china , " said eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for the cdu 's parliamentary group , last week in the bundestag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party has stressed india 's democratic credentials cdu deputies outlined plans to make relations with asia a cornerstone of germany 's foreign and security policy in order to ensure that the region 's growing economic and political clout does not lead to a decline in german influence .
the plan calls for an asia policy increasingly based on western values and urges germany to close ranks with other democratic asian nations such as india , japan and south korea . merkel signaled last week she is prepared to reverse her predecessor gerhard schröder 's policy on asia .
he was criticized for an overt emphasis on cultivating business ties with china and turning a blind eye to its human right violations , and try to expand business and political relations with india . " we have to act relatively quickly , " merkel said .
" as europeans , we have many chances in a democratic country like india .
we just have to get involved . " business , trade ties gather steam experts admit that germany has been slow to wake up to the opportunities that india , a country of 1.1 billion people with rapid growth rates of around 9 percent a year , has to offer .

28 , which could mark the attempt at a new beginning ahead of elections in 2009 , says dw 's alexander kudascheff . the party conference took place at a difficult time for the spd .
in opinion polls , the social democrats languish at a depressing 25 percent , nearly a historic low .
at the same time , the party is beset by problems from all sides - the left party has successfully snatched away social democratic issues and voters because the necessary reform of germany 's social welfare state under chancellor gerhard schröder cost the spd its political credibility as a leftist , social power - even though the reforms were successful . the party is also squeezed by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , who have forgotten all their earlier market reform ambitions since they 've been in government and now behave more like social democrats than the spd itself .
over the last two years , that has plunged the spd into doubts and near resignation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburg party conference was meant to do one thing above all : to make a new beginning in order to gain self-confidence .
party chief kurt beck , who 's been in office for over a year and a half , was responsible for it .
he was considered a weak boss until just before hamburg , but at the conference he established himself as the absolute no. 1 .
he proved that he is both skilled in tactics and projecting power .
his public demeanor and elocution do n't shine , but they show him as a down-to-earth politician .
in any case , the party values his style . whether it has an impact on germany 's voters has yet to be seen .
moreover , the spd passed a new party program in which it defined itself as the largest , left-wing , mainstream party .
the social democrats profess the values of democratic socialism and want to make globalization humane and fair .
above all , they strive for a society in which everyone has the same opportunities for advancement - a downright classic social democratic idea .
the new program serves to boost self-affirmation within the party and it 's meant to sharpen its profile outside the party .
as a party , the spd also suffers from having to govern as part of a " grand coalition " in berlin .
it clearly suffers from the pragmatism of everyday politicis and its obvious inherent necessities .
nevertheless , in hamburg , the social democrats strongly backed the afghanistan policies of spd member and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
they even endorsed the us-led anti-terror mission , operation enduring freedom , which was not an easy step for a party with a peaceful tradition .
thus , they demonstrated an astonishing measure of foreign policy realism .
the spd showed itself in unity , with the internal strife between its opposing wings relegated to the past .
it rallied behind party chief beck .
with its party program , it gave itself a rather traditional left-wing profile - and bid farewell to all the new directions , and even the " neue mitte , " the new middle way , it had long courted .
the spd is prepared to take up the battle - against the left party and also against chancellor merkel , who has so far remained vague and noncommittal on domestic issues but has nevertheless basked in the glow of political success .
after the hamburg party conference , governing in the grand coalition is going to become more difficult - not when it comes to foreign policy , but when it comes to domestic issues .
the long campaign leading up to parliamentary elections in two years has begun .

the agency is meant to become a stronger " service provider , " a spokesman said . " the service will undergo a thorough reform process , " said bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- spokesman stefan borchert on saturday , oct .

" antiquated and crusty structures will be broken up . " the aim was for the agency to become stronger as a " service provider " for the german government and parliament , borchert said , adding that berlin 's control over the agency was meant to be strengthened .
the reform of the bnd , which has 6,000 employees , is due to be completed by 2009 , the same year as germany 's next parliamentary elections , and three years before the agency is due to complete its move from pullach , near munich , to berlin .

the " self-protection " department , which did the spying , would only be responsible for protecting the service 's own agents after the reform , der spiegel newsmagazine reported .
borchert stressed that the reform plans were not the result of " alleged or real existing scandals . "
he said an overhaul had been under debate for a long time in order to prepare the bnd for " future challenges , " but that the events had made reform more urgent . bnd president ernst uhrlau had touted the reform in employee meetings in pullach and berlin as a profound change to the service .

29 , promising to reverse her government 's china-centric asia policy and expand business and political ties with delhi . india may have increasingly been on the radar of successive german governments in recent years , but it 's been a mere blip compared to china 's overpowering presence . that is likely to change as german chancellor angela merkel heads to delhi and mumbai on her first official visit . last week , members of merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- called for a shift in focus of the government 's asia policy , saying there had been an overemphasis on china at the expense of other rising asian economies . berlin 's relationship with beijing is currently strained after china objected to a meeting between merkel and the exiled tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama in september . " many chances in a democracy like india " germany 's policy towards asia has so far " been too narrowly focused on economic issues and china , " said eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for the cdu 's parliamentary group , last week in the bundestag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party has stressed india 's democratic credentials cdu deputies outlined plans to make relations with asia a cornerstone of germany 's foreign and security policy in order to ensure that the region 's growing economic and political clout does not lead to a decline in german influence .
the plan calls for an asia policy increasingly based on western values and urges germany to close ranks with other democratic asian nations such as india , japan and south korea . merkel signaled last week she is prepared to reverse her predecessor gerhard schröder 's policy on asia .
he was criticized for an overt emphasis on cultivating business ties with china and turning a blind eye to its human right violations , and try to expand business and political relations with india . " we have to act relatively quickly , " merkel said .
" as europeans , we have many chances in a democratic country like india .
we just have to get involved . " business , trade ties gather steam experts admit that germany has been slow to wake up to the opportunities that india , a country of 1.1 billion people with rapid growth rates of around 9 percent a year , has to offer . " the rise of india has come as a surprise to germany , " said joachim beck from the institute for asian studies at the german institute of global and area studies .
" it has been so accustomed to seeing india as poor , as an unstable , multifaceted country .
the german government never thought india could become a world power in economic and political terms . " in recent years , berlin has moved to correct its relative neglect of the rising south asian power by pursuing bilateral business and trade with delhi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with singh at the hanover trade fair last year india is now germany 's fourth largest trading partner in asia - after china , japan and south korea .
bilateral trade stands at roughly 10.6 billion euros with german exports to india last year surging by more than 50 percent .
germany is the fourth largest investor in india and newly-confident indian companies are also increasingly making acquisitions in europe 's largest economy . last year 's focus on india at the hanover trade fair as well as the frankfurt book fair helped in filling the gaps in germany 's image of the asian nation .
merkel also enjoys good personal relations with her indian counterpart , prime minister manmohan singh . climate change talks not easy despite those improvements , merkel 's visit , which includes economic cooperation , but also climate change and the region 's fraught politics , is not expected to be entirely smooth . on the business front , merkel 's job will be clear cut - seeking ways to tap what experts say are vast unexplored opportunities in energy and infrastructure among other sectors .
a high-profile business delegation accompanying merkel is expected to use the chancellor 's visit to pressure delhi to tackle familiar problems of overregulation , red tape , corruption , crumbling infrastructure and an unreliable energy supply . politically however , merkel will face complicated talks with singh , particularly on climate change .
merkel who has taken the lead on tackling the issue in europe , clinched a deal to halve greenhouse gases at the g8 summit in germany earlier this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india emits 4.2 percent of the world 's co2 emissions - germany 's emits 3.2 percent india , like other developing nations , is vehemently opposed to capping greenhouse gas emissions , saying it will not compromise its continued 9 percent economic growth to arrest global warming .
it argues it is historical polluters in the industrialized west who must bear the brunt of emission cuts . merkel has welcomed a proposal by indian leader singh for an alternative plan that foresees linking caps on carbon dioxide emissions to the population of a country .
but , india has since held back on elaborating on the plan , underscoring the divide facing developed and developing nations when they meet in december in bali , indonesia to begin negotiations on a new climate change agreement to replace the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 . bernhard steinrücke , head of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai suggested in an interview with deutsche welle that germany should focus instead on what it can offer the indians in the fight against climate change . " compared to germany , the degree of pollution in india is still very low per capita , " steinrücke said .
" german companies have a lot to offer indians in terms of renewable energy , clean coal technology and energy efficiency know-how . " " room for germany as an honest broker " merkel will also need to tread carefully on issues such as the conflict in kashmir and india 's relations with neighboring pakistan , both nuclear powers .
delhi is opposed to critical questions on the topics which it views as international meddling in its internal affairs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india does n't take kindly to international criticism of the kashmir conflict other delicate political topics on the agenda include stalled talks on un reforms and a common desire in delhi and berlin for a permanent seat at the un security council , tough german visa procedures for indian business leaders and a controversial deal on civilian nuclear cooperation between india and the us . given that the indo-us nuclear deal might not materialize in the face of stiff opposition by india 's communist parties , the cdu 's von klaeden hopes there might yet be room for berlin to gain some political clout in the region . " the indians are too clever to only bind themselves to one partner , " von klaeden told the rheinischer merkur newspaper last week .

29 , promising to reverse her government 's china-centric asia policy and expand business and political ties with delhi . india may have increasingly been on the radar of successive german governments in recent years , but it 's been a mere blip compared to china 's overpowering presence . that is likely to change as german chancellor angela merkel heads to delhi and mumbai on her first official visit . last week , members of merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- called for a shift in focus of the government 's asia policy , saying there had been an overemphasis on china at the expense of other rising asian economies . berlin 's relationship with beijing is currently strained after china objected to a meeting between merkel and the exiled tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama in september . " many chances in a democracy like india " germany 's policy towards asia has so far " been too narrowly focused on economic issues and china , " said eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for the cdu 's parliamentary group , last week in the bundestag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party has stressed india 's democratic credentials cdu deputies outlined plans to make relations with asia a cornerstone of germany 's foreign and security policy in order to ensure that the region 's growing economic and political clout does not lead to a decline in german influence .
the plan calls for an asia policy increasingly based on western values and urges germany to close ranks with other democratic asian nations such as india , japan and south korea . merkel signaled last week she is prepared to reverse her predecessor gerhard schröder 's policy on asia .
he was criticized for an overt emphasis on cultivating business ties with china and turning a blind eye to its human right violations , and try to expand business and political relations with india . " we have to act relatively quickly , " merkel said .
" as europeans , we have many chances in a democratic country like india .
we just have to get involved . " business , trade ties gather steam experts admit that germany has been slow to wake up to the opportunities that india , a country of 1.1 billion people with rapid growth rates of around 9 percent a year , has to offer . " the rise of india has come as a surprise to germany , " said joachim beck from the institute for asian studies at the german institute of global and area studies .
" it has been so accustomed to seeing india as poor , as an unstable , multifaceted country .
the german government never thought india could become a world power in economic and political terms . " in recent years , berlin has moved to correct its relative neglect of the rising south asian power by pursuing bilateral business and trade with delhi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with singh at the hanover trade fair last year india is now germany 's fourth largest trading partner in asia - after china , japan and south korea .
bilateral trade stands at roughly 10.6 billion euros with german exports to india last year surging by more than 50 percent .
germany is the fourth largest investor in india and newly-confident indian companies are also increasingly making acquisitions in europe 's largest economy . last year 's focus on india at the hanover trade fair as well as the frankfurt book fair helped in filling the gaps in germany 's image of the asian nation .
merkel also enjoys good personal relations with her indian counterpart , prime minister manmohan singh . climate change talks not easy despite those improvements , merkel 's visit , which includes economic cooperation , but also climate change and the region 's fraught politics , is not expected to be entirely smooth . on the business front , merkel 's job will be clear cut - seeking ways to tap what experts say are vast unexplored opportunities in energy and infrastructure among other sectors .
a high-profile business delegation accompanying merkel is expected to use the chancellor 's visit to pressure delhi to tackle familiar problems of overregulation , red tape , corruption , crumbling infrastructure and an unreliable energy supply . politically however , merkel will face complicated talks with singh , particularly on climate change .
merkel who has taken the lead on tackling the issue in europe , clinched a deal to halve greenhouse gases at the g8 summit in germany earlier this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india emits 4.2 percent of the world 's co2 emissions - germany 's emits 3.2 percent india , like other developing nations , is vehemently opposed to capping greenhouse gas emissions , saying it will not compromise its continued 9 percent economic growth to arrest global warming .
it argues it is historical polluters in the industrialized west who must bear the brunt of emission cuts . merkel has welcomed a proposal by indian leader singh for an alternative plan that foresees linking caps on carbon dioxide emissions to the population of a country .
but , india has since held back on elaborating on the plan , underscoring the divide facing developed and developing nations when they meet in december in bali , indonesia to begin negotiations on a new climate change agreement to replace the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 . bernhard steinrücke , head of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai suggested in an interview with deutsche welle that germany should focus instead on what it can offer the indians in the fight against climate change . " compared to germany , the degree of pollution in india is still very low per capita , " steinrücke said .
" german companies have a lot to offer indians in terms of renewable energy , clean coal technology and energy efficiency know-how . " " room for germany as an honest broker " merkel will also need to tread carefully on issues such as the conflict in kashmir and india 's relations with neighboring pakistan , both nuclear powers .
delhi is opposed to critical questions on the topics which it views as international meddling in its internal affairs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india does n't take kindly to international criticism of the kashmir conflict other delicate political topics on the agenda include stalled talks on un reforms and a common desire in delhi and berlin for a permanent seat at the un security council , tough german visa procedures for indian business leaders and a controversial deal on civilian nuclear cooperation between india and the us . given that the indo-us nuclear deal might not materialize in the face of stiff opposition by india 's communist parties , the cdu 's von klaeden hopes there might yet be room for berlin to gain some political clout in the region . " the indians are too clever to only bind themselves to one partner , " von klaeden told the rheinischer merkur newspaper last week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 29.10.2007 spain 's border surveillance system remains controversial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish authorities can now track every ship and shape in the strait of gibraltar the spanish government 's controversial high-tech border surveillance system to deter illegal immigration seems to be working .
but critics say it 's inhumane and does nothing to get to the root of the problem . in 2003 , time magazine 's cover story on heroes featured an arresting image of a gray-haired white man , clad in a clergyman 's robes and a gleaming cross around his neck , standing knee-deep in the sea clasping a black baby in his arms .
the man was isidoro macias , a white cross franciscan friar who ran shelters for the hundreds of illegal immigrants at the time who made the perilous journey across the strait of gibraltar to spain in small boats known as pateras in spanish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isidoro macias was dubbed papa patera for his efforts to help illegal immigrants squashed together in the small dinghies , the shivering , dazed africans who arrived on spanish shores included many pregnant women and mothers with babies .
it was this group that isidoro paid special attention to , proving them with food , clothing and shelter - a mission that earned him the nickname " papa patera . "
up to 20 pregnant women lived in isidoro 's shelter at any given time , sleeping on air mattresses .
infrared cameras to deter migrants today , the shelter houses only three women with four children .
" all of a sudden , their numbers have dropped drastically , " isidoro said .
" the spanish security authorities have developed technologies that have led to refugees and criminal people-smugglers taking other routes . "
in 2002 , the spanish government developed a high-tech 300-million-euro -lrb- $ 430-million -rrb- border surveillance system called sive and has since deployed it on its porous southern border .
the control room of the sophisticated tracking system responsible for monitoring a 114-kilometer -lrb- 71-mile -rrb- long stretch of the strait of gibraltar - one of the world 's most-traveled sea routes - is located in a drab block of buildings in the spanish port of algeciras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian augustina gave birth to twins in spain the nerve center , a room bathed in neon light and outfitted with dozens of computer monitors , allows officials to track the movements of boats and fishing vessels with the help of video cameras and infrared systems installed at five points in the strait .
" the significant thing about the system is that , both day and night , it can track and make visible swimming objects that barely stick out of the water 's surface and are less than a meter -lrb- a yard -rrb- long , " said salvador gomez , one of the officials working there .
system working well , say officials the main concern for the spanish coast guard is the sea traffic from the south to the north .
the route is largely used by young migrants from morocco , aware that they ca n't be deported so easily , if they are caught , because they are minors .
" just this morning we caught two young moroccans in the strait , " said gomez .
" they were trying to cross it in a child 's dinghy that you can buy in any supermarket . "
officials say the sophisticated surveillance system is not just meant to deter illegal immigrants but also to save lives .
once the system detects illegal immigrants , the chase is taken on by the spanish coast guard , and emergency services are notified if the rickety boats overturn .
bildunterschrift : the spanish coast guard seizes illegal immigrants once they are detected by the tracking system the surveillance system is also meant to help in the fight against the drugs trade .
morocco is the world 's largest exporter of hashish , and cocaine , too , is often smuggled via north africa to europe .
the tracking system has hugely helped , according to officials .
this year , officials seized less than 1,000 illegal migrants trying to get into spain , down from some 13,000 in 2000 .
a number of other countries , including portugal , estonia and serbia , are following spain 's example and setting up the surveillance system as increasing numbers of illegal immigrants try to make their way into europe to find work .
" a policy that kills " the system , however , has been massively criticized by human rights groups , who say it does nothing to stem the flood of illegal migration but only diverts it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte espuche says the surveillance system is endangering migrant 's lives " the immigrants are increasingly selecting further , dangerous routes - for example via the canary islands , " said brigitte espuche of the pro human rights group in cadiz .
" to me that 's not a policy that saves lives , but rather one that kills , " she said .
not everyone agrees .
manuel fenix of the red cross in tarifa near algeciras , who has been called countless times by the spanish civil guard to take care of newly-arrived illegal immigrants , said the surveillance system has proved to be a life-saver .
" boats that run into rough weather on the seas can be tracked by the system and the emergency services can be sent out on time , " said fenix .
" earlier , the people used to just drown . "
the system , however , wo n't prevent people from trying to get to spain , fenix added .
he remembered the one time authorities pulled out a dead moroccan man from the waters in the strait .
he had bound an old rubber tire to his chest and another to his back .
two table tennis rackets , which he had used as paddles , bobbed from rope tied to his hands .
" africa is just a stone 's throw away from us , " fenix said .
" as long as people believe they can find a better life here , they 'll keep coming .
it does n't matter how many more cameras you install . " steffen leidel -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but critics say it 's inhumane and does nothing to get to the root of the problem . in 2003 , time magazine 's cover story on heroes featured an arresting image of a gray-haired white man , clad in a clergyman 's robes and a gleaming cross around his neck , standing knee-deep in the sea clasping a black baby in his arms .
the man was isidoro macias , a white cross franciscan friar who ran shelters for the hundreds of illegal immigrants at the time who made the perilous journey across the strait of gibraltar to spain in small boats known as pateras in spanish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isidoro macias was dubbed papa patera for his efforts to help illegal immigrants squashed together in the small dinghies , the shivering , dazed africans who arrived on spanish shores included many pregnant women and mothers with babies .
it was this group that isidoro paid special attention to , proving them with food , clothing and shelter - a mission that earned him the nickname " papa patera . "
up to 20 pregnant women lived in isidoro 's shelter at any given time , sleeping on air mattresses .
infrared cameras to deter migrants today , the shelter houses only three women with four children .
" all of a sudden , their numbers have dropped drastically , " isidoro said .
" the spanish security authorities have developed technologies that have led to refugees and criminal people-smugglers taking other routes . "
in 2002 , the spanish government developed a high-tech 300-million-euro -lrb- $ 430-million -rrb- border surveillance system called sive and has since deployed it on its porous southern border .
the control room of the sophisticated tracking system responsible for monitoring a 114-kilometer -lrb- 71-mile -rrb- long stretch of the strait of gibraltar - one of the world 's most-traveled sea routes - is located in a drab block of buildings in the spanish port of algeciras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian augustina gave birth to twins in spain the nerve center , a room bathed in neon light and outfitted with dozens of computer monitors , allows officials to track the movements of boats and fishing vessels with the help of video cameras and infrared systems installed at five points in the strait .
" the significant thing about the system is that , both day and night , it can track and make visible swimming objects that barely stick out of the water 's surface and are less than a meter -lrb- a yard -rrb- long , " said salvador gomez , one of the officials working there .
system working well , say officials the main concern for the spanish coast guard is the sea traffic from the south to the north .
the route is largely used by young migrants from morocco , aware that they ca n't be deported so easily , if they are caught , because they are minors .
" just this morning we caught two young moroccans in the strait , " said gomez .
" they were trying to cross it in a child 's dinghy that you can buy in any supermarket . "
officials say the sophisticated surveillance system is not just meant to deter illegal immigrants but also to save lives .
once the system detects illegal immigrants , the chase is taken on by the spanish coast guard , and emergency services are notified if the rickety boats overturn .
bildunterschrift : the spanish coast guard seizes illegal immigrants once they are detected by the tracking system the surveillance system is also meant to help in the fight against the drugs trade .
morocco is the world 's largest exporter of hashish , and cocaine , too , is often smuggled via north africa to europe .
the tracking system has hugely helped , according to officials .
this year , officials seized less than 1,000 illegal migrants trying to get into spain , down from some 13,000 in 2000 .
a number of other countries , including portugal , estonia and serbia , are following spain 's example and setting up the surveillance system as increasing numbers of illegal immigrants try to make their way into europe to find work .
" a policy that kills " the system , however , has been massively criticized by human rights groups , who say it does nothing to stem the flood of illegal migration but only diverts it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte espuche says the surveillance system is endangering migrant 's lives " the immigrants are increasingly selecting further , dangerous routes - for example via the canary islands , " said brigitte espuche of the pro human rights group in cadiz .

29 , promising to reverse her government 's china-centric asia policy and expand business and political ties with delhi . india may have increasingly been on the radar of successive german governments in recent years , but it 's been a mere blip compared to china 's overpowering presence . that is likely to change as german chancellor angela merkel heads to delhi and mumbai on her first official visit . last week , members of merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- called for a shift in focus of the government 's asia policy , saying there had been an overemphasis on china at the expense of other rising asian economies . berlin 's relationship with beijing is currently strained after china objected to a meeting between merkel and the exiled tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama in september . " many chances in a democracy like india " germany 's policy towards asia has so far " been too narrowly focused on economic issues and china , " said eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for the cdu 's parliamentary group , last week in the bundestag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party has stressed india 's democratic credentials cdu deputies outlined plans to make relations with asia a cornerstone of germany 's foreign and security policy in order to ensure that the region 's growing economic and political clout does not lead to a decline in german influence .
the plan calls for an asia policy increasingly based on western values and urges germany to close ranks with other democratic asian nations such as india , japan and south korea . merkel signaled last week she is prepared to reverse her predecessor gerhard schröder 's policy on asia .
he was criticized for an overt emphasis on cultivating business ties with china and turning a blind eye to its human right violations , and try to expand business and political relations with india . " we have to act relatively quickly , " merkel said .
" as europeans , we have many chances in a democratic country like india .
we just have to get involved . " business , trade ties gather steam experts admit that germany has been slow to wake up to the opportunities that india , a country of 1.1 billion people with rapid growth rates of around 9 percent a year , has to offer . " the rise of india has come as a surprise to germany , " said joachim beck from the institute for asian studies at the german institute of global and area studies .
" it has been so accustomed to seeing india as poor , as an unstable , multifaceted country .
the german government never thought india could become a world power in economic and political terms . " in recent years , berlin has moved to correct its relative neglect of the rising south asian power by pursuing bilateral business and trade with delhi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with singh at the hanover trade fair last year india is now germany 's fourth largest trading partner in asia - after china , japan and south korea .
bilateral trade stands at roughly 10.6 billion euros with german exports to india last year surging by more than 50 percent .
germany is the fourth largest investor in india and newly-confident indian companies are also increasingly making acquisitions in europe 's largest economy . last year 's focus on india at the hanover trade fair as well as the frankfurt book fair helped in filling the gaps in germany 's image of the asian nation .
merkel also enjoys good personal relations with her indian counterpart , prime minister manmohan singh . climate change talks not easy despite those improvements , merkel 's visit , which includes economic cooperation , but also climate change and the region 's fraught politics , is not expected to be entirely smooth . on the business front , merkel 's job will be clear cut - seeking ways to tap what experts say are vast unexplored opportunities in energy and infrastructure among other sectors .
a high-profile business delegation accompanying merkel is expected to use the chancellor 's visit to pressure delhi to tackle familiar problems of overregulation , red tape , corruption , crumbling infrastructure and an unreliable energy supply . politically however , merkel will face complicated talks with singh , particularly on climate change .
merkel who has taken the lead on tackling the issue in europe , clinched a deal to halve greenhouse gases at the g8 summit in germany earlier this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india emits 4.2 percent of the world 's co2 emissions - germany 's emits 3.2 percent india , like other developing nations , is vehemently opposed to capping greenhouse gas emissions , saying it will not compromise its continued 9 percent economic growth to arrest global warming .
it argues it is historical polluters in the industrialized west who must bear the brunt of emission cuts . merkel has welcomed a proposal by indian leader singh for an alternative plan that foresees linking caps on carbon dioxide emissions to the population of a country .
but , india has since held back on elaborating on the plan , underscoring the divide facing developed and developing nations when they meet in december in bali , indonesia to begin negotiations on a new climate change agreement to replace the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 . bernhard steinrücke , head of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai suggested in an interview with deutsche welle that germany should focus instead on what it can offer the indians in the fight against climate change . " compared to germany , the degree of pollution in india is still very low per capita , " steinrücke said .
" german companies have a lot to offer indians in terms of renewable energy , clean coal technology and energy efficiency know-how . " " room for germany as an honest broker " merkel will also need to tread carefully on issues such as the conflict in kashmir and india 's relations with neighboring pakistan , both nuclear powers .
delhi is opposed to critical questions on the topics which it views as international meddling in its internal affairs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india does n't take kindly to international criticism of the kashmir conflict other delicate political topics on the agenda include stalled talks on un reforms and a common desire in delhi and berlin for a permanent seat at the un security council , tough german visa procedures for indian business leaders and a controversial deal on civilian nuclear cooperation between india and the us . given that the indo-us nuclear deal might not materialize in the face of stiff opposition by india 's communist parties , the cdu 's von klaeden hopes there might yet be room for berlin to gain some political clout in the region . " the indians are too clever to only bind themselves to one partner , " von klaeden told the rheinischer merkur newspaper last week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 29.10.2007 spain 's border surveillance system remains controversial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish authorities can now track every ship and shape in the strait of gibraltar the spanish government 's controversial high-tech border surveillance system to deter illegal immigration seems to be working .
but critics say it 's inhumane and does nothing to get to the root of the problem . in 2003 , time magazine 's cover story on heroes featured an arresting image of a gray-haired white man , clad in a clergyman 's robes and a gleaming cross around his neck , standing knee-deep in the sea clasping a black baby in his arms .
the man was isidoro macias , a white cross franciscan friar who ran shelters for the hundreds of illegal immigrants at the time who made the perilous journey across the strait of gibraltar to spain in small boats known as pateras in spanish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isidoro macias was dubbed papa patera for his efforts to help illegal immigrants squashed together in the small dinghies , the shivering , dazed africans who arrived on spanish shores included many pregnant women and mothers with babies .
it was this group that isidoro paid special attention to , proving them with food , clothing and shelter - a mission that earned him the nickname " papa patera . "
up to 20 pregnant women lived in isidoro 's shelter at any given time , sleeping on air mattresses .
infrared cameras to deter migrants today , the shelter houses only three women with four children .
" all of a sudden , their numbers have dropped drastically , " isidoro said .
" the spanish security authorities have developed technologies that have led to refugees and criminal people-smugglers taking other routes . "
in 2002 , the spanish government developed a high-tech 300-million-euro -lrb- $ 430-million -rrb- border surveillance system called sive and has since deployed it on its porous southern border .
the control room of the sophisticated tracking system responsible for monitoring a 114-kilometer -lrb- 71-mile -rrb- long stretch of the strait of gibraltar - one of the world 's most-traveled sea routes - is located in a drab block of buildings in the spanish port of algeciras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian augustina gave birth to twins in spain the nerve center , a room bathed in neon light and outfitted with dozens of computer monitors , allows officials to track the movements of boats and fishing vessels with the help of video cameras and infrared systems installed at five points in the strait .
" the significant thing about the system is that , both day and night , it can track and make visible swimming objects that barely stick out of the water 's surface and are less than a meter -lrb- a yard -rrb- long , " said salvador gomez , one of the officials working there .
system working well , say officials the main concern for the spanish coast guard is the sea traffic from the south to the north .
the route is largely used by young migrants from morocco , aware that they ca n't be deported so easily , if they are caught , because they are minors .
" just this morning we caught two young moroccans in the strait , " said gomez .
" they were trying to cross it in a child 's dinghy that you can buy in any supermarket . "
officials say the sophisticated surveillance system is not just meant to deter illegal immigrants but also to save lives .
once the system detects illegal immigrants , the chase is taken on by the spanish coast guard , and emergency services are notified if the rickety boats overturn .
bildunterschrift : the spanish coast guard seizes illegal immigrants once they are detected by the tracking system the surveillance system is also meant to help in the fight against the drugs trade .
morocco is the world 's largest exporter of hashish , and cocaine , too , is often smuggled via north africa to europe .
the tracking system has hugely helped , according to officials .
this year , officials seized less than 1,000 illegal migrants trying to get into spain , down from some 13,000 in 2000 .

" to me that 's not a policy that saves lives , but rather one that kills , " she said .
not everyone agrees .
manuel fenix of the red cross in tarifa near algeciras , who has been called countless times by the spanish civil guard to take care of newly-arrived illegal immigrants , said the surveillance system has proved to be a life-saver .
" boats that run into rough weather on the seas can be tracked by the system and the emergency services can be sent out on time , " said fenix .

but critics say it 's inhumane and does nothing to get to the root of the problem . in 2003 , time magazine 's cover story on heroes featured an arresting image of a gray-haired white man , clad in a clergyman 's robes and a gleaming cross around his neck , standing knee-deep in the sea clasping a black baby in his arms .
the man was isidoro macias , a white cross franciscan friar who ran shelters for the hundreds of illegal immigrants at the time who made the perilous journey across the strait of gibraltar to spain in small boats known as pateras in spanish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isidoro macias was dubbed papa patera for his efforts to help illegal immigrants squashed together in the small dinghies , the shivering , dazed africans who arrived on spanish shores included many pregnant women and mothers with babies .
it was this group that isidoro paid special attention to , proving them with food , clothing and shelter - a mission that earned him the nickname " papa patera . "
up to 20 pregnant women lived in isidoro 's shelter at any given time , sleeping on air mattresses .
infrared cameras to deter migrants today , the shelter houses only three women with four children .
" all of a sudden , their numbers have dropped drastically , " isidoro said .
" the spanish security authorities have developed technologies that have led to refugees and criminal people-smugglers taking other routes . "
in 2002 , the spanish government developed a high-tech 300-million-euro -lrb- $ 430-million -rrb- border surveillance system called sive and has since deployed it on its porous southern border .
the control room of the sophisticated tracking system responsible for monitoring a 114-kilometer -lrb- 71-mile -rrb- long stretch of the strait of gibraltar - one of the world 's most-traveled sea routes - is located in a drab block of buildings in the spanish port of algeciras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian augustina gave birth to twins in spain the nerve center , a room bathed in neon light and outfitted with dozens of computer monitors , allows officials to track the movements of boats and fishing vessels with the help of video cameras and infrared systems installed at five points in the strait .
" the significant thing about the system is that , both day and night , it can track and make visible swimming objects that barely stick out of the water 's surface and are less than a meter -lrb- a yard -rrb- long , " said salvador gomez , one of the officials working there .
system working well , say officials the main concern for the spanish coast guard is the sea traffic from the south to the north .
the route is largely used by young migrants from morocco , aware that they ca n't be deported so easily , if they are caught , because they are minors .
" just this morning we caught two young moroccans in the strait , " said gomez .
" they were trying to cross it in a child 's dinghy that you can buy in any supermarket . "
officials say the sophisticated surveillance system is not just meant to deter illegal immigrants but also to save lives .
once the system detects illegal immigrants , the chase is taken on by the spanish coast guard , and emergency services are notified if the rickety boats overturn .

but critics say it 's inhumane and does nothing to get to the root of the problem . in 2003 , time magazine 's cover story on heroes featured an arresting image of a gray-haired white man , clad in a clergyman 's robes and a gleaming cross around his neck , standing knee-deep in the sea clasping a black baby in his arms .
the man was isidoro macias , a white cross franciscan friar who ran shelters for the hundreds of illegal immigrants at the time who made the perilous journey across the strait of gibraltar to spain in small boats known as pateras in spanish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isidoro macias was dubbed papa patera for his efforts to help illegal immigrants squashed together in the small dinghies , the shivering , dazed africans who arrived on spanish shores included many pregnant women and mothers with babies .
it was this group that isidoro paid special attention to , proving them with food , clothing and shelter - a mission that earned him the nickname " papa patera . "
up to 20 pregnant women lived in isidoro 's shelter at any given time , sleeping on air mattresses .
infrared cameras to deter migrants today , the shelter houses only three women with four children .
" all of a sudden , their numbers have dropped drastically , " isidoro said .
" the spanish security authorities have developed technologies that have led to refugees and criminal people-smugglers taking other routes . "
in 2002 , the spanish government developed a high-tech 300-million-euro -lrb- $ 430-million -rrb- border surveillance system called sive and has since deployed it on its porous southern border .
the control room of the sophisticated tracking system responsible for monitoring a 114-kilometer -lrb- 71-mile -rrb- long stretch of the strait of gibraltar - one of the world 's most-traveled sea routes - is located in a drab block of buildings in the spanish port of algeciras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian augustina gave birth to twins in spain the nerve center , a room bathed in neon light and outfitted with dozens of computer monitors , allows officials to track the movements of boats and fishing vessels with the help of video cameras and infrared systems installed at five points in the strait .
" the significant thing about the system is that , both day and night , it can track and make visible swimming objects that barely stick out of the water 's surface and are less than a meter -lrb- a yard -rrb- long , " said salvador gomez , one of the officials working there .
system working well , say officials the main concern for the spanish coast guard is the sea traffic from the south to the north .
the route is largely used by young migrants from morocco , aware that they ca n't be deported so easily , if they are caught , because they are minors .
" just this morning we caught two young moroccans in the strait , " said gomez .
" they were trying to cross it in a child 's dinghy that you can buy in any supermarket . "
officials say the sophisticated surveillance system is not just meant to deter illegal immigrants but also to save lives .
once the system detects illegal immigrants , the chase is taken on by the spanish coast guard , and emergency services are notified if the rickety boats overturn .
bildunterschrift : the spanish coast guard seizes illegal immigrants once they are detected by the tracking system the surveillance system is also meant to help in the fight against the drugs trade .
morocco is the world 's largest exporter of hashish , and cocaine , too , is often smuggled via north africa to europe .
the tracking system has hugely helped , according to officials .
this year , officials seized less than 1,000 illegal migrants trying to get into spain , down from some 13,000 in 2000 .
a number of other countries , including portugal , estonia and serbia , are following spain 's example and setting up the surveillance system as increasing numbers of illegal immigrants try to make their way into europe to find work .
" a policy that kills " the system , however , has been massively criticized by human rights groups , who say it does nothing to stem the flood of illegal migration but only diverts it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte espuche says the surveillance system is endangering migrant 's lives " the immigrants are increasingly selecting further , dangerous routes - for example via the canary islands , " said brigitte espuche of the pro human rights group in cadiz .
" to me that 's not a policy that saves lives , but rather one that kills , " she said .
not everyone agrees .
manuel fenix of the red cross in tarifa near algeciras , who has been called countless times by the spanish civil guard to take care of newly-arrived illegal immigrants , said the surveillance system has proved to be a life-saver .
" boats that run into rough weather on the seas can be tracked by the system and the emergency services can be sent out on time , " said fenix .
" earlier , the people used to just drown . "
the system , however , wo n't prevent people from trying to get to spain , fenix added .
he remembered the one time authorities pulled out a dead moroccan man from the waters in the strait .
he had bound an old rubber tire to his chest and another to his back .
two table tennis rackets , which he had used as paddles , bobbed from rope tied to his hands .
" africa is just a stone 's throw away from us , " fenix said .
" as long as people believe they can find a better life here , they 'll keep coming .
it does n't matter how many more cameras you install . " steffen leidel -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

29 , promising to reverse her government 's china-centric asia policy and expand business and political ties with delhi . india may have increasingly been on the radar of successive german governments in recent years , but it 's been a mere blip compared to china 's overpowering presence . that is likely to change as german chancellor angela merkel heads to delhi and mumbai on her first official visit . last week , members of merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- called for a shift in focus of the government 's asia policy , saying there had been an overemphasis on china at the expense of other rising asian economies . berlin 's relationship with beijing is currently strained after china objected to a meeting between merkel and the exiled tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama in september . " many chances in a democracy like india " germany 's policy towards asia has so far " been too narrowly focused on economic issues and china , " said eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for the cdu 's parliamentary group , last week in the bundestag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party has stressed india 's democratic credentials cdu deputies outlined plans to make relations with asia a cornerstone of germany 's foreign and security policy in order to ensure that the region 's growing economic and political clout does not lead to a decline in german influence .
the plan calls for an asia policy increasingly based on western values and urges germany to close ranks with other democratic asian nations such as india , japan and south korea . merkel signaled last week she is prepared to reverse her predecessor gerhard schröder 's policy on asia .
he was criticized for an overt emphasis on cultivating business ties with china and turning a blind eye to its human right violations , and try to expand business and political relations with india . " we have to act relatively quickly , " merkel said .
" as europeans , we have many chances in a democratic country like india .
we just have to get involved . " business , trade ties gather steam experts admit that germany has been slow to wake up to the opportunities that india , a country of 1.1 billion people with rapid growth rates of around 9 percent a year , has to offer . " the rise of india has come as a surprise to germany , " said joachim beck from the institute for asian studies at the german institute of global and area studies .
" it has been so accustomed to seeing india as poor , as an unstable , multifaceted country .
the german government never thought india could become a world power in economic and political terms . " in recent years , berlin has moved to correct its relative neglect of the rising south asian power by pursuing bilateral business and trade with delhi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with singh at the hanover trade fair last year india is now germany 's fourth largest trading partner in asia - after china , japan and south korea .
bilateral trade stands at roughly 10.6 billion euros with german exports to india last year surging by more than 50 percent .
germany is the fourth largest investor in india and newly-confident indian companies are also increasingly making acquisitions in europe 's largest economy . last year 's focus on india at the hanover trade fair as well as the frankfurt book fair helped in filling the gaps in germany 's image of the asian nation .
merkel also enjoys good personal relations with her indian counterpart , prime minister manmohan singh . climate change talks not easy despite those improvements , merkel 's visit , which includes economic cooperation , but also climate change and the region 's fraught politics , is not expected to be entirely smooth . on the business front , merkel 's job will be clear cut - seeking ways to tap what experts say are vast unexplored opportunities in energy and infrastructure among other sectors .
a high-profile business delegation accompanying merkel is expected to use the chancellor 's visit to pressure delhi to tackle familiar problems of overregulation , red tape , corruption , crumbling infrastructure and an unreliable energy supply . politically however , merkel will face complicated talks with singh , particularly on climate change .
merkel who has taken the lead on tackling the issue in europe , clinched a deal to halve greenhouse gases at the g8 summit in germany earlier this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india emits 4.2 percent of the world 's co2 emissions - germany 's emits 3.2 percent india , like other developing nations , is vehemently opposed to capping greenhouse gas emissions , saying it will not compromise its continued 9 percent economic growth to arrest global warming .
it argues it is historical polluters in the industrialized west who must bear the brunt of emission cuts . merkel has welcomed a proposal by indian leader singh for an alternative plan that foresees linking caps on carbon dioxide emissions to the population of a country .
but , india has since held back on elaborating on the plan , underscoring the divide facing developed and developing nations when they meet in december in bali , indonesia to begin negotiations on a new climate change agreement to replace the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 . bernhard steinrücke , head of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai suggested in an interview with deutsche welle that germany should focus instead on what it can offer the indians in the fight against climate change .

" german companies have a lot to offer indians in terms of renewable energy , clean coal technology and energy efficiency know-how . " " room for germany as an honest broker " merkel will also need to tread carefully on issues such as the conflict in kashmir and india 's relations with neighboring pakistan , both nuclear powers .

29 , promising to reverse her government 's china-centric asia policy and expand business and political ties with delhi . india may have increasingly been on the radar of successive german governments in recent years , but it 's been a mere blip compared to china 's overpowering presence . that is likely to change as german chancellor angela merkel heads to delhi and mumbai on her first official visit . last week , members of merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- called for a shift in focus of the government 's asia policy , saying there had been an overemphasis on china at the expense of other rising asian economies . berlin 's relationship with beijing is currently strained after china objected to a meeting between merkel and the exiled tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama in september . " many chances in a democracy like india " germany 's policy towards asia has so far " been too narrowly focused on economic issues and china , " said eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for the cdu 's parliamentary group , last week in the bundestag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party has stressed india 's democratic credentials cdu deputies outlined plans to make relations with asia a cornerstone of germany 's foreign and security policy in order to ensure that the region 's growing economic and political clout does not lead to a decline in german influence .
the plan calls for an asia policy increasingly based on western values and urges germany to close ranks with other democratic asian nations such as india , japan and south korea . merkel signaled last week she is prepared to reverse her predecessor gerhard schröder 's policy on asia .
he was criticized for an overt emphasis on cultivating business ties with china and turning a blind eye to its human right violations , and try to expand business and political relations with india . " we have to act relatively quickly , " merkel said .
" as europeans , we have many chances in a democratic country like india .
we just have to get involved . " business , trade ties gather steam experts admit that germany has been slow to wake up to the opportunities that india , a country of 1.1 billion people with rapid growth rates of around 9 percent a year , has to offer . " the rise of india has come as a surprise to germany , " said joachim beck from the institute for asian studies at the german institute of global and area studies .
" it has been so accustomed to seeing india as poor , as an unstable , multifaceted country .
the german government never thought india could become a world power in economic and political terms . " in recent years , berlin has moved to correct its relative neglect of the rising south asian power by pursuing bilateral business and trade with delhi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with singh at the hanover trade fair last year india is now germany 's fourth largest trading partner in asia - after china , japan and south korea .
bilateral trade stands at roughly 10.6 billion euros with german exports to india last year surging by more than 50 percent .
germany is the fourth largest investor in india and newly-confident indian companies are also increasingly making acquisitions in europe 's largest economy . last year 's focus on india at the hanover trade fair as well as the frankfurt book fair helped in filling the gaps in germany 's image of the asian nation .
merkel also enjoys good personal relations with her indian counterpart , prime minister manmohan singh . climate change talks not easy despite those improvements , merkel 's visit , which includes economic cooperation , but also climate change and the region 's fraught politics , is not expected to be entirely smooth . on the business front , merkel 's job will be clear cut - seeking ways to tap what experts say are vast unexplored opportunities in energy and infrastructure among other sectors .
a high-profile business delegation accompanying merkel is expected to use the chancellor 's visit to pressure delhi to tackle familiar problems of overregulation , red tape , corruption , crumbling infrastructure and an unreliable energy supply . politically however , merkel will face complicated talks with singh , particularly on climate change .
merkel who has taken the lead on tackling the issue in europe , clinched a deal to halve greenhouse gases at the g8 summit in germany earlier this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india emits 4.2 percent of the world 's co2 emissions - germany 's emits 3.2 percent india , like other developing nations , is vehemently opposed to capping greenhouse gas emissions , saying it will not compromise its continued 9 percent economic growth to arrest global warming .
it argues it is historical polluters in the industrialized west who must bear the brunt of emission cuts . merkel has welcomed a proposal by indian leader singh for an alternative plan that foresees linking caps on carbon dioxide emissions to the population of a country .
but , india has since held back on elaborating on the plan , underscoring the divide facing developed and developing nations when they meet in december in bali , indonesia to begin negotiations on a new climate change agreement to replace the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 . bernhard steinrücke , head of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai suggested in an interview with deutsche welle that germany should focus instead on what it can offer the indians in the fight against climate change . " compared to germany , the degree of pollution in india is still very low per capita , " steinrücke said .
" german companies have a lot to offer indians in terms of renewable energy , clean coal technology and energy efficiency know-how . " " room for germany as an honest broker " merkel will also need to tread carefully on issues such as the conflict in kashmir and india 's relations with neighboring pakistan , both nuclear powers .
delhi is opposed to critical questions on the topics which it views as international meddling in its internal affairs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india does n't take kindly to international criticism of the kashmir conflict other delicate political topics on the agenda include stalled talks on un reforms and a common desire in delhi and berlin for a permanent seat at the un security council , tough german visa procedures for indian business leaders and a controversial deal on civilian nuclear cooperation between india and the us . given that the indo-us nuclear deal might not materialize in the face of stiff opposition by india 's communist parties , the cdu 's von klaeden hopes there might yet be room for berlin to gain some political clout in the region . " the indians are too clever to only bind themselves to one partner , " von klaeden told the rheinischer merkur newspaper last week .

29 , promising to reverse her government 's china-centric asia policy and expand business and political ties with delhi . india may have increasingly been on the radar of successive german governments in recent years , but it 's been a mere blip compared to china 's overpowering presence . that is likely to change as german chancellor angela merkel heads to delhi and mumbai on her first official visit . last week , members of merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- called for a shift in focus of the government 's asia policy , saying there had been an overemphasis on china at the expense of other rising asian economies . berlin 's relationship with beijing is currently strained after china objected to a meeting between merkel and the exiled tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama in september . " many chances in a democracy like india " germany 's policy towards asia has so far " been too narrowly focused on economic issues and china , " said eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for the cdu 's parliamentary group , last week in the bundestag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party has stressed india 's democratic credentials cdu deputies outlined plans to make relations with asia a cornerstone of germany 's foreign and security policy in order to ensure that the region 's growing economic and political clout does not lead to a decline in german influence .
the plan calls for an asia policy increasingly based on western values and urges germany to close ranks with other democratic asian nations such as india , japan and south korea . merkel signaled last week she is prepared to reverse her predecessor gerhard schröder 's policy on asia .
he was criticized for an overt emphasis on cultivating business ties with china and turning a blind eye to its human right violations , and try to expand business and political relations with india . " we have to act relatively quickly , " merkel said .
" as europeans , we have many chances in a democratic country like india .
we just have to get involved . " business , trade ties gather steam experts admit that germany has been slow to wake up to the opportunities that india , a country of 1.1 billion people with rapid growth rates of around 9 percent a year , has to offer . " the rise of india has come as a surprise to germany , " said joachim beck from the institute for asian studies at the german institute of global and area studies .
" it has been so accustomed to seeing india as poor , as an unstable , multifaceted country .
the german government never thought india could become a world power in economic and political terms . " in recent years , berlin has moved to correct its relative neglect of the rising south asian power by pursuing bilateral business and trade with delhi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with singh at the hanover trade fair last year india is now germany 's fourth largest trading partner in asia - after china , japan and south korea .
bilateral trade stands at roughly 10.6 billion euros with german exports to india last year surging by more than 50 percent .
germany is the fourth largest investor in india and newly-confident indian companies are also increasingly making acquisitions in europe 's largest economy . last year 's focus on india at the hanover trade fair as well as the frankfurt book fair helped in filling the gaps in germany 's image of the asian nation .
merkel also enjoys good personal relations with her indian counterpart , prime minister manmohan singh . climate change talks not easy despite those improvements , merkel 's visit , which includes economic cooperation , but also climate change and the region 's fraught politics , is not expected to be entirely smooth . on the business front , merkel 's job will be clear cut - seeking ways to tap what experts say are vast unexplored opportunities in energy and infrastructure among other sectors .
a high-profile business delegation accompanying merkel is expected to use the chancellor 's visit to pressure delhi to tackle familiar problems of overregulation , red tape , corruption , crumbling infrastructure and an unreliable energy supply . politically however , merkel will face complicated talks with singh , particularly on climate change .
merkel who has taken the lead on tackling the issue in europe , clinched a deal to halve greenhouse gases at the g8 summit in germany earlier this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india emits 4.2 percent of the world 's co2 emissions - germany 's emits 3.2 percent india , like other developing nations , is vehemently opposed to capping greenhouse gas emissions , saying it will not compromise its continued 9 percent economic growth to arrest global warming .
it argues it is historical polluters in the industrialized west who must bear the brunt of emission cuts . merkel has welcomed a proposal by indian leader singh for an alternative plan that foresees linking caps on carbon dioxide emissions to the population of a country .
but , india has since held back on elaborating on the plan , underscoring the divide facing developed and developing nations when they meet in december in bali , indonesia to begin negotiations on a new climate change agreement to replace the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 . bernhard steinrücke , head of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai suggested in an interview with deutsche welle that germany should focus instead on what it can offer the indians in the fight against climate change . " compared to germany , the degree of pollution in india is still very low per capita , " steinrücke said .
" german companies have a lot to offer indians in terms of renewable energy , clean coal technology and energy efficiency know-how . " " room for germany as an honest broker " merkel will also need to tread carefully on issues such as the conflict in kashmir and india 's relations with neighboring pakistan , both nuclear powers .
delhi is opposed to critical questions on the topics which it views as international meddling in its internal affairs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india does n't take kindly to international criticism of the kashmir conflict other delicate political topics on the agenda include stalled talks on un reforms and a common desire in delhi and berlin for a permanent seat at the un security council , tough german visa procedures for indian business leaders and a controversial deal on civilian nuclear cooperation between india and the us . given that the indo-us nuclear deal might not materialize in the face of stiff opposition by india 's communist parties , the cdu 's von klaeden hopes there might yet be room for berlin to gain some political clout in the region . " the indians are too clever to only bind themselves to one partner , " von klaeden told the rheinischer merkur newspaper last week .

the agency is meant to become a stronger " service provider , " a spokesman said . " the service will undergo a thorough reform process , " said bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- spokesman stefan borchert on saturday , oct .
27 .
" antiquated and crusty structures will be broken up . " the aim was for the agency to become stronger as a " service provider " for the german government and parliament , borchert said , adding that berlin 's control over the agency was meant to be strengthened .
the reform of the bnd , which has 6,000 employees , is due to be completed by 2009 , the same year as germany 's next parliamentary elections , and three years before the agency is due to complete its move from pullach , near munich , to berlin .
" profound changes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bnd 's headquarters will soon be in the capital the service 's upper tiers are supposed to be trimmed down at the same time as its eight departments would grow to 12 .
a new " proliferation " department would deal with illegal weapons deals .
the wall between agents who collect information and those who analyze it was going to be broken down , borchert said , ensuring more transparency .
the bnd 's 50-year history is speckled with scandals , most recently for its agent 's questionable actions in afghanistan and for spying on journalists in germany , a practice that was only suspended in late 2005 .
the " self-protection " department , which did the spying , would only be responsible for protecting the service 's own agents after the reform , der spiegel newsmagazine reported .
borchert stressed that the reform plans were not the result of " alleged or real existing scandals . "
he said an overhaul had been under debate for a long time in order to prepare the bnd for " future challenges , " but that the events had made reform more urgent . bnd president ernst uhrlau had touted the reform in employee meetings in pullach and berlin as a profound change to the service .
high time , opposition says praise for the reform came from opposition politicians over the weekend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd chief uhrlau is prepared to break taboos " it was time for the consequences to be drawn from the apparent aberrations , " hans-christian ströbele , an opposition green party member of the parliamentary commission established to investigate the bnd 's activities in afghanistan , told the taz daily .
" thus the bnd leadership and the federal chancellery would be in a position to better control the agency .
the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party 's secret service expert expressed similar sentiments . " the federal government has recognized that it has to keep the bnd on a shorter leash , " max stadler , told ard television over the weekend .

in opinion polls , the social democrats languish at a depressing 25 percent , nearly a historic low .
at the same time , the party is beset by problems from all sides - the left party has successfully snatched away social democratic issues and voters because the necessary reform of germany 's social welfare state under chancellor gerhard schröder cost the spd its political credibility as a leftist , social power - even though the reforms were successful . the party is also squeezed by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , who have forgotten all their earlier market reform ambitions since they 've been in government and now behave more like social democrats than the spd itself .
over the last two years , that has plunged the spd into doubts and near resignation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburg party conference was meant to do one thing above all : to make a new beginning in order to gain self-confidence .
party chief kurt beck , who 's been in office for over a year and a half , was responsible for it .
he was considered a weak boss until just before hamburg , but at the conference he established himself as the absolute no. 1 .
he proved that he is both skilled in tactics and projecting power .
his public demeanor and elocution do n't shine , but they show him as a down-to-earth politician .
in any case , the party values his style . whether it has an impact on germany 's voters has yet to be seen .
moreover , the spd passed a new party program in which it defined itself as the largest , left-wing , mainstream party .
the social democrats profess the values of democratic socialism and want to make globalization humane and fair .
above all , they strive for a society in which everyone has the same opportunities for advancement - a downright classic social democratic idea .
the new program serves to boost self-affirmation within the party and it 's meant to sharpen its profile outside the party .
as a party , the spd also suffers from having to govern as part of a " grand coalition " in berlin .
it clearly suffers from the pragmatism of everyday politicis and its obvious inherent necessities .
nevertheless , in hamburg , the social democrats strongly backed the afghanistan policies of spd member and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
they even endorsed the us-led anti-terror mission , operation enduring freedom , which was not an easy step for a party with a peaceful tradition .
thus , they demonstrated an astonishing measure of foreign policy realism .
the spd showed itself in unity , with the internal strife between its opposing wings relegated to the past .
it rallied behind party chief beck .
with its party program , it gave itself a rather traditional left-wing profile - and bid farewell to all the new directions , and even the " neue mitte , " the new middle way , it had long courted .
the spd is prepared to take up the battle - against the left party and also against chancellor merkel , who has so far remained vague and noncommittal on domestic issues but has nevertheless basked in the glow of political success .
after the hamburg party conference , governing in the grand coalition is going to become more difficult - not when it comes to foreign policy , but when it comes to domestic issues .
the long campaign leading up to parliamentary elections in two years has begun .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.10.2007 opinion : germany 's social democrats venture a new beginning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's social democrats wrapped up a major party conference on sunday , oct .
28 , which could mark the attempt at a new beginning ahead of elections in 2009 , says dw 's alexander kudascheff . the party conference took place at a difficult time for the spd .
in opinion polls , the social democrats languish at a depressing 25 percent , nearly a historic low .
at the same time , the party is beset by problems from all sides - the left party has successfully snatched away social democratic issues and voters because the necessary reform of germany 's social welfare state under chancellor gerhard schröder cost the spd its political credibility as a leftist , social power - even though the reforms were successful . the party is also squeezed by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , who have forgotten all their earlier market reform ambitions since they 've been in government and now behave more like social democrats than the spd itself .
over the last two years , that has plunged the spd into doubts and near resignation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburg party conference was meant to do one thing above all : to make a new beginning in order to gain self-confidence .
party chief kurt beck , who 's been in office for over a year and a half , was responsible for it .
he was considered a weak boss until just before hamburg , but at the conference he established himself as the absolute no. 1 .
he proved that he is both skilled in tactics and projecting power .
his public demeanor and elocution do n't shine , but they show him as a down-to-earth politician .
in any case , the party values his style . whether it has an impact on germany 's voters has yet to be seen .
moreover , the spd passed a new party program in which it defined itself as the largest , left-wing , mainstream party .
the social democrats profess the values of democratic socialism and want to make globalization humane and fair .
above all , they strive for a society in which everyone has the same opportunities for advancement - a downright classic social democratic idea .
the new program serves to boost self-affirmation within the party and it 's meant to sharpen its profile outside the party .
as a party , the spd also suffers from having to govern as part of a " grand coalition " in berlin .
it clearly suffers from the pragmatism of everyday politicis and its obvious inherent necessities .
nevertheless , in hamburg , the social democrats strongly backed the afghanistan policies of spd member and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
they even endorsed the us-led anti-terror mission , operation enduring freedom , which was not an easy step for a party with a peaceful tradition .
thus , they demonstrated an astonishing measure of foreign policy realism .
the spd showed itself in unity , with the internal strife between its opposing wings relegated to the past .
it rallied behind party chief beck .
with its party program , it gave itself a rather traditional left-wing profile - and bid farewell to all the new directions , and even the " neue mitte , " the new middle way , it had long courted .
the spd is prepared to take up the battle - against the left party and also against chancellor merkel , who has so far remained vague and noncommittal on domestic issues but has nevertheless basked in the glow of political success .
after the hamburg party conference , governing in the grand coalition is going to become more difficult - not when it comes to foreign policy , but when it comes to domestic issues .
the long campaign leading up to parliamentary elections in two years has begun .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 29.10.2007 spain 's border surveillance system remains controversial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish authorities can now track every ship and shape in the strait of gibraltar the spanish government 's controversial high-tech border surveillance system to deter illegal immigration seems to be working .
but critics say it 's inhumane and does nothing to get to the root of the problem . in 2003 , time magazine 's cover story on heroes featured an arresting image of a gray-haired white man , clad in a clergyman 's robes and a gleaming cross around his neck , standing knee-deep in the sea clasping a black baby in his arms .
the man was isidoro macias , a white cross franciscan friar who ran shelters for the hundreds of illegal immigrants at the time who made the perilous journey across the strait of gibraltar to spain in small boats known as pateras in spanish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isidoro macias was dubbed papa patera for his efforts to help illegal immigrants squashed together in the small dinghies , the shivering , dazed africans who arrived on spanish shores included many pregnant women and mothers with babies .
it was this group that isidoro paid special attention to , proving them with food , clothing and shelter - a mission that earned him the nickname " papa patera . "
up to 20 pregnant women lived in isidoro 's shelter at any given time , sleeping on air mattresses .
infrared cameras to deter migrants today , the shelter houses only three women with four children .
" all of a sudden , their numbers have dropped drastically , " isidoro said .
" the spanish security authorities have developed technologies that have led to refugees and criminal people-smugglers taking other routes . "
in 2002 , the spanish government developed a high-tech 300-million-euro -lrb- $ 430-million -rrb- border surveillance system called sive and has since deployed it on its porous southern border .
the control room of the sophisticated tracking system responsible for monitoring a 114-kilometer -lrb- 71-mile -rrb- long stretch of the strait of gibraltar - one of the world 's most-traveled sea routes - is located in a drab block of buildings in the spanish port of algeciras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian augustina gave birth to twins in spain the nerve center , a room bathed in neon light and outfitted with dozens of computer monitors , allows officials to track the movements of boats and fishing vessels with the help of video cameras and infrared systems installed at five points in the strait .
" the significant thing about the system is that , both day and night , it can track and make visible swimming objects that barely stick out of the water 's surface and are less than a meter -lrb- a yard -rrb- long , " said salvador gomez , one of the officials working there .
system working well , say officials the main concern for the spanish coast guard is the sea traffic from the south to the north .
the route is largely used by young migrants from morocco , aware that they ca n't be deported so easily , if they are caught , because they are minors .
" just this morning we caught two young moroccans in the strait , " said gomez .
" they were trying to cross it in a child 's dinghy that you can buy in any supermarket . "
officials say the sophisticated surveillance system is not just meant to deter illegal immigrants but also to save lives .
once the system detects illegal immigrants , the chase is taken on by the spanish coast guard , and emergency services are notified if the rickety boats overturn .
bildunterschrift : the spanish coast guard seizes illegal immigrants once they are detected by the tracking system the surveillance system is also meant to help in the fight against the drugs trade .
morocco is the world 's largest exporter of hashish , and cocaine , too , is often smuggled via north africa to europe .
the tracking system has hugely helped , according to officials .
this year , officials seized less than 1,000 illegal migrants trying to get into spain , down from some 13,000 in 2000 .
a number of other countries , including portugal , estonia and serbia , are following spain 's example and setting up the surveillance system as increasing numbers of illegal immigrants try to make their way into europe to find work .
" a policy that kills " the system , however , has been massively criticized by human rights groups , who say it does nothing to stem the flood of illegal migration but only diverts it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte espuche says the surveillance system is endangering migrant 's lives " the immigrants are increasingly selecting further , dangerous routes - for example via the canary islands , " said brigitte espuche of the pro human rights group in cadiz .
" to me that 's not a policy that saves lives , but rather one that kills , " she said .
not everyone agrees .
manuel fenix of the red cross in tarifa near algeciras , who has been called countless times by the spanish civil guard to take care of newly-arrived illegal immigrants , said the surveillance system has proved to be a life-saver .
" boats that run into rough weather on the seas can be tracked by the system and the emergency services can be sent out on time , " said fenix .
" earlier , the people used to just drown . "
the system , however , wo n't prevent people from trying to get to spain , fenix added .
he remembered the one time authorities pulled out a dead moroccan man from the waters in the strait .
he had bound an old rubber tire to his chest and another to his back .
two table tennis rackets , which he had used as paddles , bobbed from rope tied to his hands .
" africa is just a stone 's throw away from us , " fenix said .
" as long as people believe they can find a better life here , they 'll keep coming .

this year , officials seized less than 1,000 illegal migrants trying to get into spain , down from some 13,000 in 2000 .
a number of other countries , including portugal , estonia and serbia , are following spain 's example and setting up the surveillance system as increasing numbers of illegal immigrants try to make their way into europe to find work .
" a policy that kills " the system , however , has been massively criticized by human rights groups , who say it does nothing to stem the flood of illegal migration but only diverts it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte espuche says the surveillance system is endangering migrant 's lives " the immigrants are increasingly selecting further , dangerous routes - for example via the canary islands , " said brigitte espuche of the pro human rights group in cadiz .
" to me that 's not a policy that saves lives , but rather one that kills , " she said .
not everyone agrees .
manuel fenix of the red cross in tarifa near algeciras , who has been called countless times by the spanish civil guard to take care of newly-arrived illegal immigrants , said the surveillance system has proved to be a life-saver .
" boats that run into rough weather on the seas can be tracked by the system and the emergency services can be sent out on time , " said fenix .
" earlier , the people used to just drown . "
the system , however , wo n't prevent people from trying to get to spain , fenix added .
he remembered the one time authorities pulled out a dead moroccan man from the waters in the strait .
he had bound an old rubber tire to his chest and another to his back .
two table tennis rackets , which he had used as paddles , bobbed from rope tied to his hands .
" africa is just a stone 's throw away from us , " fenix said .
" as long as people believe they can find a better life here , they 'll keep coming .

29 , promising to reverse her government 's china-centric asia policy and expand business and political ties with delhi . india may have increasingly been on the radar of successive german governments in recent years , but it 's been a mere blip compared to china 's overpowering presence . that is likely to change as german chancellor angela merkel heads to delhi and mumbai on her first official visit . last week , members of merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- called for a shift in focus of the government 's asia policy , saying there had been an overemphasis on china at the expense of other rising asian economies . berlin 's relationship with beijing is currently strained after china objected to a meeting between merkel and the exiled tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama in september . " many chances in a democracy like india " germany 's policy towards asia has so far " been too narrowly focused on economic issues and china , " said eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for the cdu 's parliamentary group , last week in the bundestag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party has stressed india 's democratic credentials cdu deputies outlined plans to make relations with asia a cornerstone of germany 's foreign and security policy in order to ensure that the region 's growing economic and political clout does not lead to a decline in german influence .
the plan calls for an asia policy increasingly based on western values and urges germany to close ranks with other democratic asian nations such as india , japan and south korea . merkel signaled last week she is prepared to reverse her predecessor gerhard schröder 's policy on asia .
he was criticized for an overt emphasis on cultivating business ties with china and turning a blind eye to its human right violations , and try to expand business and political relations with india . " we have to act relatively quickly , " merkel said .
" as europeans , we have many chances in a democratic country like india .
we just have to get involved . " business , trade ties gather steam experts admit that germany has been slow to wake up to the opportunities that india , a country of 1.1 billion people with rapid growth rates of around 9 percent a year , has to offer . " the rise of india has come as a surprise to germany , " said joachim beck from the institute for asian studies at the german institute of global and area studies .
" it has been so accustomed to seeing india as poor , as an unstable , multifaceted country .
the german government never thought india could become a world power in economic and political terms . " in recent years , berlin has moved to correct its relative neglect of the rising south asian power by pursuing bilateral business and trade with delhi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with singh at the hanover trade fair last year india is now germany 's fourth largest trading partner in asia - after china , japan and south korea .
bilateral trade stands at roughly 10.6 billion euros with german exports to india last year surging by more than 50 percent .
germany is the fourth largest investor in india and newly-confident indian companies are also increasingly making acquisitions in europe 's largest economy . last year 's focus on india at the hanover trade fair as well as the frankfurt book fair helped in filling the gaps in germany 's image of the asian nation .
merkel also enjoys good personal relations with her indian counterpart , prime minister manmohan singh . climate change talks not easy despite those improvements , merkel 's visit , which includes economic cooperation , but also climate change and the region 's fraught politics , is not expected to be entirely smooth . on the business front , merkel 's job will be clear cut - seeking ways to tap what experts say are vast unexplored opportunities in energy and infrastructure among other sectors .
a high-profile business delegation accompanying merkel is expected to use the chancellor 's visit to pressure delhi to tackle familiar problems of overregulation , red tape , corruption , crumbling infrastructure and an unreliable energy supply . politically however , merkel will face complicated talks with singh , particularly on climate change .
merkel who has taken the lead on tackling the issue in europe , clinched a deal to halve greenhouse gases at the g8 summit in germany earlier this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india emits 4.2 percent of the world 's co2 emissions - germany 's emits 3.2 percent india , like other developing nations , is vehemently opposed to capping greenhouse gas emissions , saying it will not compromise its continued 9 percent economic growth to arrest global warming .
it argues it is historical polluters in the industrialized west who must bear the brunt of emission cuts . merkel has welcomed a proposal by indian leader singh for an alternative plan that foresees linking caps on carbon dioxide emissions to the population of a country .
but , india has since held back on elaborating on the plan , underscoring the divide facing developed and developing nations when they meet in december in bali , indonesia to begin negotiations on a new climate change agreement to replace the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 . bernhard steinrücke , head of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai suggested in an interview with deutsche welle that germany should focus instead on what it can offer the indians in the fight against climate change . " compared to germany , the degree of pollution in india is still very low per capita , " steinrücke said .
" german companies have a lot to offer indians in terms of renewable energy , clean coal technology and energy efficiency know-how . " " room for germany as an honest broker " merkel will also need to tread carefully on issues such as the conflict in kashmir and india 's relations with neighboring pakistan , both nuclear powers .
delhi is opposed to critical questions on the topics which it views as international meddling in its internal affairs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india does n't take kindly to international criticism of the kashmir conflict other delicate political topics on the agenda include stalled talks on un reforms and a common desire in delhi and berlin for a permanent seat at the un security council , tough german visa procedures for indian business leaders and a controversial deal on civilian nuclear cooperation between india and the us . given that the indo-us nuclear deal might not materialize in the face of stiff opposition by india 's communist parties , the cdu 's von klaeden hopes there might yet be room for berlin to gain some political clout in the region .

he was criticized for an overt emphasis on cultivating business ties with china and turning a blind eye to its human right violations , and try to expand business and political relations with india . " we have to act relatively quickly , " merkel said .
" as europeans , we have many chances in a democratic country like india .
we just have to get involved . " business , trade ties gather steam experts admit that germany has been slow to wake up to the opportunities that india , a country of 1.1 billion people with rapid growth rates of around 9 percent a year , has to offer . " the rise of india has come as a surprise to germany , " said joachim beck from the institute for asian studies at the german institute of global and area studies .
" it has been so accustomed to seeing india as poor , as an unstable , multifaceted country .
the german government never thought india could become a world power in economic and political terms . " in recent years , berlin has moved to correct its relative neglect of the rising south asian power by pursuing bilateral business and trade with delhi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with singh at the hanover trade fair last year india is now germany 's fourth largest trading partner in asia - after china , japan and south korea .
bilateral trade stands at roughly 10.6 billion euros with german exports to india last year surging by more than 50 percent .
germany is the fourth largest investor in india and newly-confident indian companies are also increasingly making acquisitions in europe 's largest economy . last year 's focus on india at the hanover trade fair as well as the frankfurt book fair helped in filling the gaps in germany 's image of the asian nation .
merkel also enjoys good personal relations with her indian counterpart , prime minister manmohan singh . climate change talks not easy despite those improvements , merkel 's visit , which includes economic cooperation , but also climate change and the region 's fraught politics , is not expected to be entirely smooth . on the business front , merkel 's job will be clear cut - seeking ways to tap what experts say are vast unexplored opportunities in energy and infrastructure among other sectors .
a high-profile business delegation accompanying merkel is expected to use the chancellor 's visit to pressure delhi to tackle familiar problems of overregulation , red tape , corruption , crumbling infrastructure and an unreliable energy supply . politically however , merkel will face complicated talks with singh , particularly on climate change .
merkel who has taken the lead on tackling the issue in europe , clinched a deal to halve greenhouse gases at the g8 summit in germany earlier this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india emits 4.2 percent of the world 's co2 emissions - germany 's emits 3.2 percent india , like other developing nations , is vehemently opposed to capping greenhouse gas emissions , saying it will not compromise its continued 9 percent economic growth to arrest global warming .
it argues it is historical polluters in the industrialized west who must bear the brunt of emission cuts . merkel has welcomed a proposal by indian leader singh for an alternative plan that foresees linking caps on carbon dioxide emissions to the population of a country .
but , india has since held back on elaborating on the plan , underscoring the divide facing developed and developing nations when they meet in december in bali , indonesia to begin negotiations on a new climate change agreement to replace the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 . bernhard steinrücke , head of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai suggested in an interview with deutsche welle that germany should focus instead on what it can offer the indians in the fight against climate change . " compared to germany , the degree of pollution in india is still very low per capita , " steinrücke said .
" german companies have a lot to offer indians in terms of renewable energy , clean coal technology and energy efficiency know-how . " " room for germany as an honest broker " merkel will also need to tread carefully on issues such as the conflict in kashmir and india 's relations with neighboring pakistan , both nuclear powers .
delhi is opposed to critical questions on the topics which it views as international meddling in its internal affairs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india does n't take kindly to international criticism of the kashmir conflict other delicate political topics on the agenda include stalled talks on un reforms and a common desire in delhi and berlin for a permanent seat at the un security council , tough german visa procedures for indian business leaders and a controversial deal on civilian nuclear cooperation between india and the us . given that the indo-us nuclear deal might not materialize in the face of stiff opposition by india 's communist parties , the cdu 's von klaeden hopes there might yet be room for berlin to gain some political clout in the region . " the indians are too clever to only bind themselves to one partner , " von klaeden told the rheinischer merkur newspaper last week .
" there 's lots of room for germany as an honest broker without a colonial past . " sonia phalnikar and kate hairsine send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 , in the western city of aachen to four people responsible for advancing environmental technology and the public 's awareness of climate change . hans joachim schellnhuber , director of the potsdam institute for climate impact research and advisor to chancellor angela merkel , was the most well-known of the four prize winners . schellnhuber said he was glad to have become " part of a very important community of individuals " that can have a " strong influence on social development in a positive way .

the mandate of the german army is closely linked to the progress of the peace process , he added .
germany heads the international un maritime force charged with patrolling the waters off lebanon to prevent weapons being smuggled to hezbollah guerrillas by sea .
the force was created in accordance with the un-brokered cease-fire that ended last year 's fighting between israel and hezbollah guerrillas .
germany is the main contributor with around 820 german soldiers stationed in the region .
in september , the german parliament extended the unifil mission by another year .
" unifil is a comprehensive mission which involves ground forces which are also helping the army but we germans are responsible for maritime security , " jung said as he visited navy personnel on the frigate bayern , the lead vessel of the maritime taskforce .
german soldiers are also involved in training the lebanese navy .
controversial german deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung has vowed germany will stay put in lebanon for as long as it takes the deployment of the german navy in lebanon is significant because it marks the country 's first peacekeeping mission in the middle east since the end of world war ii .
the mission sparked much debate in germany last year after israel called on berlin to send soldiers to the region as part of a buffer force in south lebanon to police a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah and prevent further fighting . chancellor angela merkel 's government , however , ruled out sending any combat troops given germany 's sensitive historical relationship with israel .
at the time , merkel said there was no question of sending any ground troops to join un forces in lebanon due to the fear , as she put it , that germans could even " accidentally " aim their weapons at israelis .
" this mission comes in view of our special responsibility for israel , " said merkel in reference to the murder of around six million jews by the nazis .
germany currently has about 10,000 troops on foreign missions in the balkans , lebanon and afghanistan .
lebanon is the first leg of jung 's five-day tour of the middle east .
the minister is also to visit the united arab emirates , jordan and israel .
german-led push for mideast peace jung 's visit to the middle east is followed by a trip to the region by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to lay the groundwork for a us mideast conference planned for the end of november .
steinmeier 's trip to egypt , israel and the palestinian territories next week will build on the european union 's so-called middle east action plan , a german-led initiative to help further middle east peace by promoting small and medium-sized businesses in the palestinian territories and building up special economic zones .
the plan also aims to increase eu assistance in the training of palestinian police and judiciary as well as in the educational and civil service sectors with greater eu assistance focused on palestinian universities and students .
steinmeier said earlier this month the aim was to help wean palestinians off development aid by helping to strengthen their private sector .

29 , promising to reverse her government 's china-centric asia policy and expand business and political ties with delhi . india may have increasingly been on the radar of successive german governments in recent years , but it 's been a mere blip compared to china 's overpowering presence . that is likely to change as german chancellor angela merkel heads to delhi and mumbai on her first official visit . last week , members of merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- called for a shift in focus of the government 's asia policy , saying there had been an overemphasis on china at the expense of other rising asian economies . berlin 's relationship with beijing is currently strained after china objected to a meeting between merkel and the exiled tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama in september . " many chances in a democracy like india " germany 's policy towards asia has so far " been too narrowly focused on economic issues and china , " said eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for the cdu 's parliamentary group , last week in the bundestag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party has stressed india 's democratic credentials cdu deputies outlined plans to make relations with asia a cornerstone of germany 's foreign and security policy in order to ensure that the region 's growing economic and political clout does not lead to a decline in german influence .
the plan calls for an asia policy increasingly based on western values and urges germany to close ranks with other democratic asian nations such as india , japan and south korea . merkel signaled last week she is prepared to reverse her predecessor gerhard schröder 's policy on asia .
he was criticized for an overt emphasis on cultivating business ties with china and turning a blind eye to its human right violations , and try to expand business and political relations with india . " we have to act relatively quickly , " merkel said .
" as europeans , we have many chances in a democratic country like india .
we just have to get involved . " business , trade ties gather steam experts admit that germany has been slow to wake up to the opportunities that india , a country of 1.1 billion people with rapid growth rates of around 9 percent a year , has to offer . " the rise of india has come as a surprise to germany , " said joachim beck from the institute for asian studies at the german institute of global and area studies .
" it has been so accustomed to seeing india as poor , as an unstable , multifaceted country .
the german government never thought india could become a world power in economic and political terms . " in recent years , berlin has moved to correct its relative neglect of the rising south asian power by pursuing bilateral business and trade with delhi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with singh at the hanover trade fair last year india is now germany 's fourth largest trading partner in asia - after china , japan and south korea .
bilateral trade stands at roughly 10.6 billion euros with german exports to india last year surging by more than 50 percent .
germany is the fourth largest investor in india and newly-confident indian companies are also increasingly making acquisitions in europe 's largest economy . last year 's focus on india at the hanover trade fair as well as the frankfurt book fair helped in filling the gaps in germany 's image of the asian nation .
merkel also enjoys good personal relations with her indian counterpart , prime minister manmohan singh . climate change talks not easy despite those improvements , merkel 's visit , which includes economic cooperation , but also climate change and the region 's fraught politics , is not expected to be entirely smooth . on the business front , merkel 's job will be clear cut - seeking ways to tap what experts say are vast unexplored opportunities in energy and infrastructure among other sectors .
a high-profile business delegation accompanying merkel is expected to use the chancellor 's visit to pressure delhi to tackle familiar problems of overregulation , red tape , corruption , crumbling infrastructure and an unreliable energy supply . politically however , merkel will face complicated talks with singh , particularly on climate change .
merkel who has taken the lead on tackling the issue in europe , clinched a deal to halve greenhouse gases at the g8 summit in germany earlier this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india emits 4.2 percent of the world 's co2 emissions - germany 's emits 3.2 percent india , like other developing nations , is vehemently opposed to capping greenhouse gas emissions , saying it will not compromise its continued 9 percent economic growth to arrest global warming .
it argues it is historical polluters in the industrialized west who must bear the brunt of emission cuts . merkel has welcomed a proposal by indian leader singh for an alternative plan that foresees linking caps on carbon dioxide emissions to the population of a country .
but , india has since held back on elaborating on the plan , underscoring the divide facing developed and developing nations when they meet in december in bali , indonesia to begin negotiations on a new climate change agreement to replace the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 . bernhard steinrücke , head of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai suggested in an interview with deutsche welle that germany should focus instead on what it can offer the indians in the fight against climate change . " compared to germany , the degree of pollution in india is still very low per capita , " steinrücke said .
" german companies have a lot to offer indians in terms of renewable energy , clean coal technology and energy efficiency know-how . " " room for germany as an honest broker " merkel will also need to tread carefully on issues such as the conflict in kashmir and india 's relations with neighboring pakistan , both nuclear powers .
delhi is opposed to critical questions on the topics which it views as international meddling in its internal affairs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india does n't take kindly to international criticism of the kashmir conflict other delicate political topics on the agenda include stalled talks on un reforms and a common desire in delhi and berlin for a permanent seat at the un security council , tough german visa procedures for indian business leaders and a controversial deal on civilian nuclear cooperation between india and the us . given that the indo-us nuclear deal might not materialize in the face of stiff opposition by india 's communist parties , the cdu 's von klaeden hopes there might yet be room for berlin to gain some political clout in the region . " the indians are too clever to only bind themselves to one partner , " von klaeden told the rheinischer merkur newspaper last week .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 29.10.2007 spain 's border surveillance system remains controversial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish authorities can now track every ship and shape in the strait of gibraltar the spanish government 's controversial high-tech border surveillance system to deter illegal immigration seems to be working .
but critics say it 's inhumane and does nothing to get to the root of the problem . in 2003 , time magazine 's cover story on heroes featured an arresting image of a gray-haired white man , clad in a clergyman 's robes and a gleaming cross around his neck , standing knee-deep in the sea clasping a black baby in his arms .
the man was isidoro macias , a white cross franciscan friar who ran shelters for the hundreds of illegal immigrants at the time who made the perilous journey across the strait of gibraltar to spain in small boats known as pateras in spanish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isidoro macias was dubbed papa patera for his efforts to help illegal immigrants squashed together in the small dinghies , the shivering , dazed africans who arrived on spanish shores included many pregnant women and mothers with babies .
it was this group that isidoro paid special attention to , proving them with food , clothing and shelter - a mission that earned him the nickname " papa patera . "
up to 20 pregnant women lived in isidoro 's shelter at any given time , sleeping on air mattresses .
infrared cameras to deter migrants today , the shelter houses only three women with four children .
" all of a sudden , their numbers have dropped drastically , " isidoro said .
" the spanish security authorities have developed technologies that have led to refugees and criminal people-smugglers taking other routes . "
in 2002 , the spanish government developed a high-tech 300-million-euro -lrb- $ 430-million -rrb- border surveillance system called sive and has since deployed it on its porous southern border .
the control room of the sophisticated tracking system responsible for monitoring a 114-kilometer -lrb- 71-mile -rrb- long stretch of the strait of gibraltar - one of the world 's most-traveled sea routes - is located in a drab block of buildings in the spanish port of algeciras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian augustina gave birth to twins in spain the nerve center , a room bathed in neon light and outfitted with dozens of computer monitors , allows officials to track the movements of boats and fishing vessels with the help of video cameras and infrared systems installed at five points in the strait .
" the significant thing about the system is that , both day and night , it can track and make visible swimming objects that barely stick out of the water 's surface and are less than a meter -lrb- a yard -rrb- long , " said salvador gomez , one of the officials working there .
system working well , say officials the main concern for the spanish coast guard is the sea traffic from the south to the north .
the route is largely used by young migrants from morocco , aware that they ca n't be deported so easily , if they are caught , because they are minors .
" just this morning we caught two young moroccans in the strait , " said gomez .
" they were trying to cross it in a child 's dinghy that you can buy in any supermarket . "
officials say the sophisticated surveillance system is not just meant to deter illegal immigrants but also to save lives .
once the system detects illegal immigrants , the chase is taken on by the spanish coast guard , and emergency services are notified if the rickety boats overturn .
bildunterschrift : the spanish coast guard seizes illegal immigrants once they are detected by the tracking system the surveillance system is also meant to help in the fight against the drugs trade .
morocco is the world 's largest exporter of hashish , and cocaine , too , is often smuggled via north africa to europe .
the tracking system has hugely helped , according to officials .
this year , officials seized less than 1,000 illegal migrants trying to get into spain , down from some 13,000 in 2000 .
a number of other countries , including portugal , estonia and serbia , are following spain 's example and setting up the surveillance system as increasing numbers of illegal immigrants try to make their way into europe to find work .
" a policy that kills " the system , however , has been massively criticized by human rights groups , who say it does nothing to stem the flood of illegal migration but only diverts it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte espuche says the surveillance system is endangering migrant 's lives " the immigrants are increasingly selecting further , dangerous routes - for example via the canary islands , " said brigitte espuche of the pro human rights group in cadiz .
" to me that 's not a policy that saves lives , but rather one that kills , " she said .
not everyone agrees .
manuel fenix of the red cross in tarifa near algeciras , who has been called countless times by the spanish civil guard to take care of newly-arrived illegal immigrants , said the surveillance system has proved to be a life-saver .
" boats that run into rough weather on the seas can be tracked by the system and the emergency services can be sent out on time , " said fenix .
" earlier , the people used to just drown . "
the system , however , wo n't prevent people from trying to get to spain , fenix added .
he remembered the one time authorities pulled out a dead moroccan man from the waters in the strait .
he had bound an old rubber tire to his chest and another to his back .
two table tennis rackets , which he had used as paddles , bobbed from rope tied to his hands .
" africa is just a stone 's throw away from us , " fenix said .
" as long as people believe they can find a better life here , they 'll keep coming .
it does n't matter how many more cameras you install . " steffen leidel -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 29.10.2007 spain 's border surveillance system remains controversial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish authorities can now track every ship and shape in the strait of gibraltar the spanish government 's controversial high-tech border surveillance system to deter illegal immigration seems to be working .
but critics say it 's inhumane and does nothing to get to the root of the problem . in 2003 , time magazine 's cover story on heroes featured an arresting image of a gray-haired white man , clad in a clergyman 's robes and a gleaming cross around his neck , standing knee-deep in the sea clasping a black baby in his arms .
the man was isidoro macias , a white cross franciscan friar who ran shelters for the hundreds of illegal immigrants at the time who made the perilous journey across the strait of gibraltar to spain in small boats known as pateras in spanish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isidoro macias was dubbed papa patera for his efforts to help illegal immigrants squashed together in the small dinghies , the shivering , dazed africans who arrived on spanish shores included many pregnant women and mothers with babies .
it was this group that isidoro paid special attention to , proving them with food , clothing and shelter - a mission that earned him the nickname " papa patera . "
up to 20 pregnant women lived in isidoro 's shelter at any given time , sleeping on air mattresses .
infrared cameras to deter migrants today , the shelter houses only three women with four children .
" all of a sudden , their numbers have dropped drastically , " isidoro said .
" the spanish security authorities have developed technologies that have led to refugees and criminal people-smugglers taking other routes . "
in 2002 , the spanish government developed a high-tech 300-million-euro -lrb- $ 430-million -rrb- border surveillance system called sive and has since deployed it on its porous southern border .
the control room of the sophisticated tracking system responsible for monitoring a 114-kilometer -lrb- 71-mile -rrb- long stretch of the strait of gibraltar - one of the world 's most-traveled sea routes - is located in a drab block of buildings in the spanish port of algeciras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian augustina gave birth to twins in spain the nerve center , a room bathed in neon light and outfitted with dozens of computer monitors , allows officials to track the movements of boats and fishing vessels with the help of video cameras and infrared systems installed at five points in the strait .
" the significant thing about the system is that , both day and night , it can track and make visible swimming objects that barely stick out of the water 's surface and are less than a meter -lrb- a yard -rrb- long , " said salvador gomez , one of the officials working there .
system working well , say officials the main concern for the spanish coast guard is the sea traffic from the south to the north .
the route is largely used by young migrants from morocco , aware that they ca n't be deported so easily , if they are caught , because they are minors .
" just this morning we caught two young moroccans in the strait , " said gomez .
" they were trying to cross it in a child 's dinghy that you can buy in any supermarket . "
officials say the sophisticated surveillance system is not just meant to deter illegal immigrants but also to save lives .
once the system detects illegal immigrants , the chase is taken on by the spanish coast guard , and emergency services are notified if the rickety boats overturn .
bildunterschrift : the spanish coast guard seizes illegal immigrants once they are detected by the tracking system the surveillance system is also meant to help in the fight against the drugs trade .
morocco is the world 's largest exporter of hashish , and cocaine , too , is often smuggled via north africa to europe .
the tracking system has hugely helped , according to officials .
this year , officials seized less than 1,000 illegal migrants trying to get into spain , down from some 13,000 in 2000 .
a number of other countries , including portugal , estonia and serbia , are following spain 's example and setting up the surveillance system as increasing numbers of illegal immigrants try to make their way into europe to find work .
" a policy that kills " the system , however , has been massively criticized by human rights groups , who say it does nothing to stem the flood of illegal migration but only diverts it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte espuche says the surveillance system is endangering migrant 's lives " the immigrants are increasingly selecting further , dangerous routes - for example via the canary islands , " said brigitte espuche of the pro human rights group in cadiz .
" to me that 's not a policy that saves lives , but rather one that kills , " she said .
not everyone agrees .
manuel fenix of the red cross in tarifa near algeciras , who has been called countless times by the spanish civil guard to take care of newly-arrived illegal immigrants , said the surveillance system has proved to be a life-saver .
" boats that run into rough weather on the seas can be tracked by the system and the emergency services can be sent out on time , " said fenix .
" earlier , the people used to just drown . "
the system , however , wo n't prevent people from trying to get to spain , fenix added .
he remembered the one time authorities pulled out a dead moroccan man from the waters in the strait .
he had bound an old rubber tire to his chest and another to his back .
two table tennis rackets , which he had used as paddles , bobbed from rope tied to his hands .
" africa is just a stone 's throw away from us , " fenix said .
" as long as people believe they can find a better life here , they 'll keep coming .
it does n't matter how many more cameras you install . " steffen leidel -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 , which could mark the attempt at a new beginning ahead of elections in 2009 , says dw 's alexander kudascheff . the party conference took place at a difficult time for the spd .
in opinion polls , the social democrats languish at a depressing 25 percent , nearly a historic low .
at the same time , the party is beset by problems from all sides - the left party has successfully snatched away social democratic issues and voters because the necessary reform of germany 's social welfare state under chancellor gerhard schröder cost the spd its political credibility as a leftist , social power - even though the reforms were successful . the party is also squeezed by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , who have forgotten all their earlier market reform ambitions since they 've been in government and now behave more like social democrats than the spd itself .
over the last two years , that has plunged the spd into doubts and near resignation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburg party conference was meant to do one thing above all : to make a new beginning in order to gain self-confidence .
party chief kurt beck , who 's been in office for over a year and a half , was responsible for it .
he was considered a weak boss until just before hamburg , but at the conference he established himself as the absolute no. 1 .
he proved that he is both skilled in tactics and projecting power .
his public demeanor and elocution do n't shine , but they show him as a down-to-earth politician .
in any case , the party values his style . whether it has an impact on germany 's voters has yet to be seen .
moreover , the spd passed a new party program in which it defined itself as the largest , left-wing , mainstream party .
the social democrats profess the values of democratic socialism and want to make globalization humane and fair .
above all , they strive for a society in which everyone has the same opportunities for advancement - a downright classic social democratic idea .
the new program serves to boost self-affirmation within the party and it 's meant to sharpen its profile outside the party .
as a party , the spd also suffers from having to govern as part of a " grand coalition " in berlin .
it clearly suffers from the pragmatism of everyday politicis and its obvious inherent necessities .
nevertheless , in hamburg , the social democrats strongly backed the afghanistan policies of spd member and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
they even endorsed the us-led anti-terror mission , operation enduring freedom , which was not an easy step for a party with a peaceful tradition .
thus , they demonstrated an astonishing measure of foreign policy realism .
the spd showed itself in unity , with the internal strife between its opposing wings relegated to the past .
it rallied behind party chief beck .
with its party program , it gave itself a rather traditional left-wing profile - and bid farewell to all the new directions , and even the " neue mitte , " the new middle way , it had long courted .
the spd is prepared to take up the battle - against the left party and also against chancellor merkel , who has so far remained vague and noncommittal on domestic issues but has nevertheless basked in the glow of political success .
after the hamburg party conference , governing in the grand coalition is going to become more difficult - not when it comes to foreign policy , but when it comes to domestic issues .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.10.2007 opinion : germany 's social democrats venture a new beginning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's social democrats wrapped up a major party conference on sunday , oct .
28 , which could mark the attempt at a new beginning ahead of elections in 2009 , says dw 's alexander kudascheff . the party conference took place at a difficult time for the spd .
in opinion polls , the social democrats languish at a depressing 25 percent , nearly a historic low .
at the same time , the party is beset by problems from all sides - the left party has successfully snatched away social democratic issues and voters because the necessary reform of germany 's social welfare state under chancellor gerhard schröder cost the spd its political credibility as a leftist , social power - even though the reforms were successful . the party is also squeezed by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , who have forgotten all their earlier market reform ambitions since they 've been in government and now behave more like social democrats than the spd itself .
over the last two years , that has plunged the spd into doubts and near resignation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburg party conference was meant to do one thing above all : to make a new beginning in order to gain self-confidence .
party chief kurt beck , who 's been in office for over a year and a half , was responsible for it .
he was considered a weak boss until just before hamburg , but at the conference he established himself as the absolute no. 1 .
he proved that he is both skilled in tactics and projecting power .
his public demeanor and elocution do n't shine , but they show him as a down-to-earth politician .
in any case , the party values his style . whether it has an impact on germany 's voters has yet to be seen .
moreover , the spd passed a new party program in which it defined itself as the largest , left-wing , mainstream party .
the social democrats profess the values of democratic socialism and want to make globalization humane and fair .
above all , they strive for a society in which everyone has the same opportunities for advancement - a downright classic social democratic idea .
the new program serves to boost self-affirmation within the party and it 's meant to sharpen its profile outside the party .
as a party , the spd also suffers from having to govern as part of a " grand coalition " in berlin .
it clearly suffers from the pragmatism of everyday politicis and its obvious inherent necessities .
nevertheless , in hamburg , the social democrats strongly backed the afghanistan policies of spd member and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
they even endorsed the us-led anti-terror mission , operation enduring freedom , which was not an easy step for a party with a peaceful tradition .
thus , they demonstrated an astonishing measure of foreign policy realism .
the spd showed itself in unity , with the internal strife between its opposing wings relegated to the past .
it rallied behind party chief beck .
with its party program , it gave itself a rather traditional left-wing profile - and bid farewell to all the new directions , and even the " neue mitte , " the new middle way , it had long courted .
the spd is prepared to take up the battle - against the left party and also against chancellor merkel , who has so far remained vague and noncommittal on domestic issues but has nevertheless basked in the glow of political success .

the mandate of the german army is closely linked to the progress of the peace process , he added .
germany heads the international un maritime force charged with patrolling the waters off lebanon to prevent weapons being smuggled to hezbollah guerrillas by sea .
the force was created in accordance with the un-brokered cease-fire that ended last year 's fighting between israel and hezbollah guerrillas .
germany is the main contributor with around 820 german soldiers stationed in the region .
in september , the german parliament extended the unifil mission by another year .
" unifil is a comprehensive mission which involves ground forces which are also helping the army but we germans are responsible for maritime security , " jung said as he visited navy personnel on the frigate bayern , the lead vessel of the maritime taskforce .
german soldiers are also involved in training the lebanese navy .
controversial german deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung has vowed germany will stay put in lebanon for as long as it takes the deployment of the german navy in lebanon is significant because it marks the country 's first peacekeeping mission in the middle east since the end of world war ii .
the mission sparked much debate in germany last year after israel called on berlin to send soldiers to the region as part of a buffer force in south lebanon to police a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah and prevent further fighting . chancellor angela merkel 's government , however , ruled out sending any combat troops given germany 's sensitive historical relationship with israel .
at the time , merkel said there was no question of sending any ground troops to join un forces in lebanon due to the fear , as she put it , that germans could even " accidentally " aim their weapons at israelis .
" this mission comes in view of our special responsibility for israel , " said merkel in reference to the murder of around six million jews by the nazis .
germany currently has about 10,000 troops on foreign missions in the balkans , lebanon and afghanistan .
lebanon is the first leg of jung 's five-day tour of the middle east .
the minister is also to visit the united arab emirates , jordan and israel .
german-led push for mideast peace jung 's visit to the middle east is followed by a trip to the region by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to lay the groundwork for a us mideast conference planned for the end of november .
steinmeier 's trip to egypt , israel and the palestinian territories next week will build on the european union 's so-called middle east action plan , a german-led initiative to help further middle east peace by promoting small and medium-sized businesses in the palestinian territories and building up special economic zones .
the plan also aims to increase eu assistance in the training of palestinian police and judiciary as well as in the educational and civil service sectors with greater eu assistance focused on palestinian universities and students .
steinmeier said earlier this month the aim was to help wean palestinians off development aid by helping to strengthen their private sector .
the eu and its member states are estimated to have pumped in financial and humanitarian aid worth around 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.14 billion -rrb- in the region so far this year . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the mandate of the german army is closely linked to the progress of the peace process , he added .
germany heads the international un maritime force charged with patrolling the waters off lebanon to prevent weapons being smuggled to hezbollah guerrillas by sea .
the force was created in accordance with the un-brokered cease-fire that ended last year 's fighting between israel and hezbollah guerrillas .
germany is the main contributor with around 820 german soldiers stationed in the region .
in september , the german parliament extended the unifil mission by another year .
" unifil is a comprehensive mission which involves ground forces which are also helping the army but we germans are responsible for maritime security , " jung said as he visited navy personnel on the frigate bayern , the lead vessel of the maritime taskforce .
german soldiers are also involved in training the lebanese navy .
controversial german deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung has vowed germany will stay put in lebanon for as long as it takes the deployment of the german navy in lebanon is significant because it marks the country 's first peacekeeping mission in the middle east since the end of world war ii .
the mission sparked much debate in germany last year after israel called on berlin to send soldiers to the region as part of a buffer force in south lebanon to police a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah and prevent further fighting . chancellor angela merkel 's government , however , ruled out sending any combat troops given germany 's sensitive historical relationship with israel .
at the time , merkel said there was no question of sending any ground troops to join un forces in lebanon due to the fear , as she put it , that germans could even " accidentally " aim their weapons at israelis .
" this mission comes in view of our special responsibility for israel , " said merkel in reference to the murder of around six million jews by the nazis .
germany currently has about 10,000 troops on foreign missions in the balkans , lebanon and afghanistan .
lebanon is the first leg of jung 's five-day tour of the middle east .
the minister is also to visit the united arab emirates , jordan and israel .
german-led push for mideast peace jung 's visit to the middle east is followed by a trip to the region by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to lay the groundwork for a us mideast conference planned for the end of november .
steinmeier 's trip to egypt , israel and the palestinian territories next week will build on the european union 's so-called middle east action plan , a german-led initiative to help further middle east peace by promoting small and medium-sized businesses in the palestinian territories and building up special economic zones .
the plan also aims to increase eu assistance in the training of palestinian police and judiciary as well as in the educational and civil service sectors with greater eu assistance focused on palestinian universities and students .
steinmeier said earlier this month the aim was to help wean palestinians off development aid by helping to strengthen their private sector .
the eu and its member states are estimated to have pumped in financial and humanitarian aid worth around 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.14 billion -rrb- in the region so far this year . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the agency is meant to become a stronger " service provider , " a spokesman said . " the service will undergo a thorough reform process , " said bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- spokesman stefan borchert on saturday , oct .
27 .
" antiquated and crusty structures will be broken up . " the aim was for the agency to become stronger as a " service provider " for the german government and parliament , borchert said , adding that berlin 's control over the agency was meant to be strengthened .
the reform of the bnd , which has 6,000 employees , is due to be completed by 2009 , the same year as germany 's next parliamentary elections , and three years before the agency is due to complete its move from pullach , near munich , to berlin .

the wall between agents who collect information and those who analyze it was going to be broken down , borchert said , ensuring more transparency .
the bnd 's 50-year history is speckled with scandals , most recently for its agent 's questionable actions in afghanistan and for spying on journalists in germany , a practice that was only suspended in late 2005 .
the " self-protection " department , which did the spying , would only be responsible for protecting the service 's own agents after the reform , der spiegel newsmagazine reported .
borchert stressed that the reform plans were not the result of " alleged or real existing scandals . "
he said an overhaul had been under debate for a long time in order to prepare the bnd for " future challenges , " but that the events had made reform more urgent . bnd president ernst uhrlau had touted the reform in employee meetings in pullach and berlin as a profound change to the service .
high time , opposition says praise for the reform came from opposition politicians over the weekend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd chief uhrlau is prepared to break taboos " it was time for the consequences to be drawn from the apparent aberrations , " hans-christian ströbele , an opposition green party member of the parliamentary commission established to investigate the bnd 's activities in afghanistan , told the taz daily .
" thus the bnd leadership and the federal chancellery would be in a position to better control the agency .
the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party 's secret service expert expressed similar sentiments . " the federal government has recognized that it has to keep the bnd on a shorter leash , " max stadler , told ard television over the weekend .

the mandate of the german army is closely linked to the progress of the peace process , he added .
germany heads the international un maritime force charged with patrolling the waters off lebanon to prevent weapons being smuggled to hezbollah guerrillas by sea .
the force was created in accordance with the un-brokered cease-fire that ended last year 's fighting between israel and hezbollah guerrillas .
germany is the main contributor with around 820 german soldiers stationed in the region .
in september , the german parliament extended the unifil mission by another year .
" unifil is a comprehensive mission which involves ground forces which are also helping the army but we germans are responsible for maritime security , " jung said as he visited navy personnel on the frigate bayern , the lead vessel of the maritime taskforce .
german soldiers are also involved in training the lebanese navy .
controversial german deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung has vowed germany will stay put in lebanon for as long as it takes the deployment of the german navy in lebanon is significant because it marks the country 's first peacekeeping mission in the middle east since the end of world war ii .
the mission sparked much debate in germany last year after israel called on berlin to send soldiers to the region as part of a buffer force in south lebanon to police a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah and prevent further fighting . chancellor angela merkel 's government , however , ruled out sending any combat troops given germany 's sensitive historical relationship with israel .
at the time , merkel said there was no question of sending any ground troops to join un forces in lebanon due to the fear , as she put it , that germans could even " accidentally " aim their weapons at israelis .
" this mission comes in view of our special responsibility for israel , " said merkel in reference to the murder of around six million jews by the nazis .
germany currently has about 10,000 troops on foreign missions in the balkans , lebanon and afghanistan .
lebanon is the first leg of jung 's five-day tour of the middle east .
the minister is also to visit the united arab emirates , jordan and israel .
german-led push for mideast peace jung 's visit to the middle east is followed by a trip to the region by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to lay the groundwork for a us mideast conference planned for the end of november .
steinmeier 's trip to egypt , israel and the palestinian territories next week will build on the european union 's so-called middle east action plan , a german-led initiative to help further middle east peace by promoting small and medium-sized businesses in the palestinian territories and building up special economic zones .
the plan also aims to increase eu assistance in the training of palestinian police and judiciary as well as in the educational and civil service sectors with greater eu assistance focused on palestinian universities and students .
steinmeier said earlier this month the aim was to help wean palestinians off development aid by helping to strengthen their private sector .

the agency is meant to become a stronger " service provider , " a spokesman said . " the service will undergo a thorough reform process , " said bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- spokesman stefan borchert on saturday , oct .
27 .
" antiquated and crusty structures will be broken up . " the aim was for the agency to become stronger as a " service provider " for the german government and parliament , borchert said , adding that berlin 's control over the agency was meant to be strengthened .
the reform of the bnd , which has 6,000 employees , is due to be completed by 2009 , the same year as germany 's next parliamentary elections , and three years before the agency is due to complete its move from pullach , near munich , to berlin .

the wall between agents who collect information and those who analyze it was going to be broken down , borchert said , ensuring more transparency .
the bnd 's 50-year history is speckled with scandals , most recently for its agent 's questionable actions in afghanistan and for spying on journalists in germany , a practice that was only suspended in late 2005 .
the " self-protection " department , which did the spying , would only be responsible for protecting the service 's own agents after the reform , der spiegel newsmagazine reported .
borchert stressed that the reform plans were not the result of " alleged or real existing scandals . "
he said an overhaul had been under debate for a long time in order to prepare the bnd for " future challenges , " but that the events had made reform more urgent . bnd president ernst uhrlau had touted the reform in employee meetings in pullach and berlin as a profound change to the service .
high time , opposition says praise for the reform came from opposition politicians over the weekend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd chief uhrlau is prepared to break taboos " it was time for the consequences to be drawn from the apparent aberrations , " hans-christian ströbele , an opposition green party member of the parliamentary commission established to investigate the bnd 's activities in afghanistan , told the taz daily .
" thus the bnd leadership and the federal chancellery would be in a position to better control the agency .
the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party 's secret service expert expressed similar sentiments . " the federal government has recognized that it has to keep the bnd on a shorter leash , " max stadler , told ard television over the weekend .

us plans to station missile defense stations in poland and the czech republic are widely regarded as being the immediate trigger for moscow 's cfe withdrawal .

" we appeal to the russian government to refrain from the planned suspension and to use the path of negotiation in order to protect its legitimate interests , " they wrote in the article .

russia says that leaves it unable to adequately protect itself from countries on its eastern and southern borders , including iran , india and pakistan , which have growing arsenals .

the man was isidoro macias , a white cross franciscan friar who ran shelters for the hundreds of illegal immigrants at the time who made the perilous journey across the strait of gibraltar to spain in small boats known as pateras in spanish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isidoro macias was dubbed papa patera for his efforts to help illegal immigrants squashed together in the small dinghies , the shivering , dazed africans who arrived on spanish shores included many pregnant women and mothers with babies .
it was this group that isidoro paid special attention to , proving them with food , clothing and shelter - a mission that earned him the nickname " papa patera . "
up to 20 pregnant women lived in isidoro 's shelter at any given time , sleeping on air mattresses .
infrared cameras to deter migrants today , the shelter houses only three women with four children .
" all of a sudden , their numbers have dropped drastically , " isidoro said .
" the spanish security authorities have developed technologies that have led to refugees and criminal people-smugglers taking other routes . "
in 2002 , the spanish government developed a high-tech 300-million-euro -lrb- $ 430-million -rrb- border surveillance system called sive and has since deployed it on its porous southern border .
the control room of the sophisticated tracking system responsible for monitoring a 114-kilometer -lrb- 71-mile -rrb- long stretch of the strait of gibraltar - one of the world 's most-traveled sea routes - is located in a drab block of buildings in the spanish port of algeciras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian augustina gave birth to twins in spain the nerve center , a room bathed in neon light and outfitted with dozens of computer monitors , allows officials to track the movements of boats and fishing vessels with the help of video cameras and infrared systems installed at five points in the strait .
" the significant thing about the system is that , both day and night , it can track and make visible swimming objects that barely stick out of the water 's surface and are less than a meter -lrb- a yard -rrb- long , " said salvador gomez , one of the officials working there .
system working well , say officials the main concern for the spanish coast guard is the sea traffic from the south to the north .
the route is largely used by young migrants from morocco , aware that they ca n't be deported so easily , if they are caught , because they are minors .
" just this morning we caught two young moroccans in the strait , " said gomez .
" they were trying to cross it in a child 's dinghy that you can buy in any supermarket . "
officials say the sophisticated surveillance system is not just meant to deter illegal immigrants but also to save lives .
once the system detects illegal immigrants , the chase is taken on by the spanish coast guard , and emergency services are notified if the rickety boats overturn .
bildunterschrift : the spanish coast guard seizes illegal immigrants once they are detected by the tracking system the surveillance system is also meant to help in the fight against the drugs trade .
morocco is the world 's largest exporter of hashish , and cocaine , too , is often smuggled via north africa to europe .
the tracking system has hugely helped , according to officials .
this year , officials seized less than 1,000 illegal migrants trying to get into spain , down from some 13,000 in 2000 .
a number of other countries , including portugal , estonia and serbia , are following spain 's example and setting up the surveillance system as increasing numbers of illegal immigrants try to make their way into europe to find work .
" a policy that kills " the system , however , has been massively criticized by human rights groups , who say it does nothing to stem the flood of illegal migration but only diverts it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte espuche says the surveillance system is endangering migrant 's lives " the immigrants are increasingly selecting further , dangerous routes - for example via the canary islands , " said brigitte espuche of the pro human rights group in cadiz .
" to me that 's not a policy that saves lives , but rather one that kills , " she said .
not everyone agrees .
manuel fenix of the red cross in tarifa near algeciras , who has been called countless times by the spanish civil guard to take care of newly-arrived illegal immigrants , said the surveillance system has proved to be a life-saver .
" boats that run into rough weather on the seas can be tracked by the system and the emergency services can be sent out on time , " said fenix .
" earlier , the people used to just drown . "
the system , however , wo n't prevent people from trying to get to spain , fenix added .
he remembered the one time authorities pulled out a dead moroccan man from the waters in the strait .
he had bound an old rubber tire to his chest and another to his back .
two table tennis rackets , which he had used as paddles , bobbed from rope tied to his hands .
" africa is just a stone 's throw away from us , " fenix said .
" as long as people believe they can find a better life here , they 'll keep coming .
it does n't matter how many more cameras you install . " steffen leidel -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the stated plan by russia to scrap its participation in the cfe treaty is a matter of concern for us , " the two wrote in a joint article published in germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and france 's le figaro .

us plans to station missile defense stations in poland and the czech republic are widely regarded as being the immediate trigger for moscow 's cfe withdrawal .

it took up arms in 1984 , aiming to create an ethnic homeland in the region .
more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict .

but critics say it 's inhumane and does nothing to get to the root of the problem . in 2003 , time magazine 's cover story on heroes featured an arresting image of a gray-haired white man , clad in a clergyman 's robes and a gleaming cross around his neck , standing knee-deep in the sea clasping a black baby in his arms .
the man was isidoro macias , a white cross franciscan friar who ran shelters for the hundreds of illegal immigrants at the time who made the perilous journey across the strait of gibraltar to spain in small boats known as pateras in spanish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isidoro macias was dubbed papa patera for his efforts to help illegal immigrants squashed together in the small dinghies , the shivering , dazed africans who arrived on spanish shores included many pregnant women and mothers with babies .
it was this group that isidoro paid special attention to , proving them with food , clothing and shelter - a mission that earned him the nickname " papa patera . "
up to 20 pregnant women lived in isidoro 's shelter at any given time , sleeping on air mattresses .
infrared cameras to deter migrants today , the shelter houses only three women with four children .
" all of a sudden , their numbers have dropped drastically , " isidoro said .
" the spanish security authorities have developed technologies that have led to refugees and criminal people-smugglers taking other routes . "
in 2002 , the spanish government developed a high-tech 300-million-euro -lrb- $ 430-million -rrb- border surveillance system called sive and has since deployed it on its porous southern border .
the control room of the sophisticated tracking system responsible for monitoring a 114-kilometer -lrb- 71-mile -rrb- long stretch of the strait of gibraltar - one of the world 's most-traveled sea routes - is located in a drab block of buildings in the spanish port of algeciras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian augustina gave birth to twins in spain the nerve center , a room bathed in neon light and outfitted with dozens of computer monitors , allows officials to track the movements of boats and fishing vessels with the help of video cameras and infrared systems installed at five points in the strait .
" the significant thing about the system is that , both day and night , it can track and make visible swimming objects that barely stick out of the water 's surface and are less than a meter -lrb- a yard -rrb- long , " said salvador gomez , one of the officials working there .
system working well , say officials the main concern for the spanish coast guard is the sea traffic from the south to the north .
the route is largely used by young migrants from morocco , aware that they ca n't be deported so easily , if they are caught , because they are minors .
" just this morning we caught two young moroccans in the strait , " said gomez .
" they were trying to cross it in a child 's dinghy that you can buy in any supermarket . "
officials say the sophisticated surveillance system is not just meant to deter illegal immigrants but also to save lives .
once the system detects illegal immigrants , the chase is taken on by the spanish coast guard , and emergency services are notified if the rickety boats overturn .
bildunterschrift : the spanish coast guard seizes illegal immigrants once they are detected by the tracking system the surveillance system is also meant to help in the fight against the drugs trade .
morocco is the world 's largest exporter of hashish , and cocaine , too , is often smuggled via north africa to europe .
the tracking system has hugely helped , according to officials .
this year , officials seized less than 1,000 illegal migrants trying to get into spain , down from some 13,000 in 2000 .
a number of other countries , including portugal , estonia and serbia , are following spain 's example and setting up the surveillance system as increasing numbers of illegal immigrants try to make their way into europe to find work .
" a policy that kills " the system , however , has been massively criticized by human rights groups , who say it does nothing to stem the flood of illegal migration but only diverts it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte espuche says the surveillance system is endangering migrant 's lives " the immigrants are increasingly selecting further , dangerous routes - for example via the canary islands , " said brigitte espuche of the pro human rights group in cadiz .
" to me that 's not a policy that saves lives , but rather one that kills , " she said .
not everyone agrees .

28 , which could mark the attempt at a new beginning ahead of elections in 2009 , says dw 's alexander kudascheff . the party conference took place at a difficult time for the spd .
in opinion polls , the social democrats languish at a depressing 25 percent , nearly a historic low .
at the same time , the party is beset by problems from all sides - the left party has successfully snatched away social democratic issues and voters because the necessary reform of germany 's social welfare state under chancellor gerhard schröder cost the spd its political credibility as a leftist , social power - even though the reforms were successful . the party is also squeezed by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , who have forgotten all their earlier market reform ambitions since they 've been in government and now behave more like social democrats than the spd itself .
over the last two years , that has plunged the spd into doubts and near resignation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburg party conference was meant to do one thing above all : to make a new beginning in order to gain self-confidence .
party chief kurt beck , who 's been in office for over a year and a half , was responsible for it .
he was considered a weak boss until just before hamburg , but at the conference he established himself as the absolute no. 1 .
he proved that he is both skilled in tactics and projecting power .
his public demeanor and elocution do n't shine , but they show him as a down-to-earth politician .
in any case , the party values his style . whether it has an impact on germany 's voters has yet to be seen .
moreover , the spd passed a new party program in which it defined itself as the largest , left-wing , mainstream party .
the social democrats profess the values of democratic socialism and want to make globalization humane and fair .
above all , they strive for a society in which everyone has the same opportunities for advancement - a downright classic social democratic idea .
the new program serves to boost self-affirmation within the party and it 's meant to sharpen its profile outside the party .
as a party , the spd also suffers from having to govern as part of a " grand coalition " in berlin .
it clearly suffers from the pragmatism of everyday politicis and its obvious inherent necessities .
nevertheless , in hamburg , the social democrats strongly backed the afghanistan policies of spd member and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
they even endorsed the us-led anti-terror mission , operation enduring freedom , which was not an easy step for a party with a peaceful tradition .
thus , they demonstrated an astonishing measure of foreign policy realism .
the spd showed itself in unity , with the internal strife between its opposing wings relegated to the past .
it rallied behind party chief beck .
with its party program , it gave itself a rather traditional left-wing profile - and bid farewell to all the new directions , and even the " neue mitte , " the new middle way , it had long courted .
the spd is prepared to take up the battle - against the left party and also against chancellor merkel , who has so far remained vague and noncommittal on domestic issues but has nevertheless basked in the glow of political success .
after the hamburg party conference , governing in the grand coalition is going to become more difficult - not when it comes to foreign policy , but when it comes to domestic issues .
the long campaign leading up to parliamentary elections in two years has begun .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 29.10.2007 spain 's border surveillance system remains controversial großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanish authorities can now track every ship and shape in the strait of gibraltar the spanish government 's controversial high-tech border surveillance system to deter illegal immigration seems to be working .
but critics say it 's inhumane and does nothing to get to the root of the problem . in 2003 , time magazine 's cover story on heroes featured an arresting image of a gray-haired white man , clad in a clergyman 's robes and a gleaming cross around his neck , standing knee-deep in the sea clasping a black baby in his arms .
the man was isidoro macias , a white cross franciscan friar who ran shelters for the hundreds of illegal immigrants at the time who made the perilous journey across the strait of gibraltar to spain in small boats known as pateras in spanish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isidoro macias was dubbed papa patera for his efforts to help illegal immigrants squashed together in the small dinghies , the shivering , dazed africans who arrived on spanish shores included many pregnant women and mothers with babies .
it was this group that isidoro paid special attention to , proving them with food , clothing and shelter - a mission that earned him the nickname " papa patera . "
up to 20 pregnant women lived in isidoro 's shelter at any given time , sleeping on air mattresses .
infrared cameras to deter migrants today , the shelter houses only three women with four children .
" all of a sudden , their numbers have dropped drastically , " isidoro said .
" the spanish security authorities have developed technologies that have led to refugees and criminal people-smugglers taking other routes . "
in 2002 , the spanish government developed a high-tech 300-million-euro -lrb- $ 430-million -rrb- border surveillance system called sive and has since deployed it on its porous southern border .
the control room of the sophisticated tracking system responsible for monitoring a 114-kilometer -lrb- 71-mile -rrb- long stretch of the strait of gibraltar - one of the world 's most-traveled sea routes - is located in a drab block of buildings in the spanish port of algeciras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian augustina gave birth to twins in spain the nerve center , a room bathed in neon light and outfitted with dozens of computer monitors , allows officials to track the movements of boats and fishing vessels with the help of video cameras and infrared systems installed at five points in the strait .
" the significant thing about the system is that , both day and night , it can track and make visible swimming objects that barely stick out of the water 's surface and are less than a meter -lrb- a yard -rrb- long , " said salvador gomez , one of the officials working there .
system working well , say officials the main concern for the spanish coast guard is the sea traffic from the south to the north .
the route is largely used by young migrants from morocco , aware that they ca n't be deported so easily , if they are caught , because they are minors .
" just this morning we caught two young moroccans in the strait , " said gomez .
" they were trying to cross it in a child 's dinghy that you can buy in any supermarket . "
officials say the sophisticated surveillance system is not just meant to deter illegal immigrants but also to save lives .
once the system detects illegal immigrants , the chase is taken on by the spanish coast guard , and emergency services are notified if the rickety boats overturn .
bildunterschrift : the spanish coast guard seizes illegal immigrants once they are detected by the tracking system the surveillance system is also meant to help in the fight against the drugs trade .
morocco is the world 's largest exporter of hashish , and cocaine , too , is often smuggled via north africa to europe .
the tracking system has hugely helped , according to officials .
this year , officials seized less than 1,000 illegal migrants trying to get into spain , down from some 13,000 in 2000 .
a number of other countries , including portugal , estonia and serbia , are following spain 's example and setting up the surveillance system as increasing numbers of illegal immigrants try to make their way into europe to find work .
" a policy that kills " the system , however , has been massively criticized by human rights groups , who say it does nothing to stem the flood of illegal migration but only diverts it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte espuche says the surveillance system is endangering migrant 's lives " the immigrants are increasingly selecting further , dangerous routes - for example via the canary islands , " said brigitte espuche of the pro human rights group in cadiz .
" to me that 's not a policy that saves lives , but rather one that kills , " she said .
not everyone agrees .
manuel fenix of the red cross in tarifa near algeciras , who has been called countless times by the spanish civil guard to take care of newly-arrived illegal immigrants , said the surveillance system has proved to be a life-saver .
" boats that run into rough weather on the seas can be tracked by the system and the emergency services can be sent out on time , " said fenix .

the agency is meant to become a stronger " service provider , " a spokesman said . " the service will undergo a thorough reform process , " said bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- spokesman stefan borchert on saturday , oct .
27 .
" antiquated and crusty structures will be broken up . " the aim was for the agency to become stronger as a " service provider " for the german government and parliament , borchert said , adding that berlin 's control over the agency was meant to be strengthened .
the reform of the bnd , which has 6,000 employees , is due to be completed by 2009 , the same year as germany 's next parliamentary elections , and three years before the agency is due to complete its move from pullach , near munich , to berlin .
" profound changes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bnd 's headquarters will soon be in the capital the service 's upper tiers are supposed to be trimmed down at the same time as its eight departments would grow to 12 .
a new " proliferation " department would deal with illegal weapons deals .
the wall between agents who collect information and those who analyze it was going to be broken down , borchert said , ensuring more transparency .
the bnd 's 50-year history is speckled with scandals , most recently for its agent 's questionable actions in afghanistan and for spying on journalists in germany , a practice that was only suspended in late 2005 .
the " self-protection " department , which did the spying , would only be responsible for protecting the service 's own agents after the reform , der spiegel newsmagazine reported .
borchert stressed that the reform plans were not the result of " alleged or real existing scandals . "
he said an overhaul had been under debate for a long time in order to prepare the bnd for " future challenges , " but that the events had made reform more urgent . bnd president ernst uhrlau had touted the reform in employee meetings in pullach and berlin as a profound change to the service .
high time , opposition says praise for the reform came from opposition politicians over the weekend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd chief uhrlau is prepared to break taboos " it was time for the consequences to be drawn from the apparent aberrations , " hans-christian ströbele , an opposition green party member of the parliamentary commission established to investigate the bnd 's activities in afghanistan , told the taz daily .
" thus the bnd leadership and the federal chancellery would be in a position to better control the agency .
the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party 's secret service expert expressed similar sentiments . " the federal government has recognized that it has to keep the bnd on a shorter leash , " max stadler , told ard television over the weekend .

but critics say it 's inhumane and does nothing to get to the root of the problem . in 2003 , time magazine 's cover story on heroes featured an arresting image of a gray-haired white man , clad in a clergyman 's robes and a gleaming cross around his neck , standing knee-deep in the sea clasping a black baby in his arms .
the man was isidoro macias , a white cross franciscan friar who ran shelters for the hundreds of illegal immigrants at the time who made the perilous journey across the strait of gibraltar to spain in small boats known as pateras in spanish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isidoro macias was dubbed papa patera for his efforts to help illegal immigrants squashed together in the small dinghies , the shivering , dazed africans who arrived on spanish shores included many pregnant women and mothers with babies .
it was this group that isidoro paid special attention to , proving them with food , clothing and shelter - a mission that earned him the nickname " papa patera . "
up to 20 pregnant women lived in isidoro 's shelter at any given time , sleeping on air mattresses .
infrared cameras to deter migrants today , the shelter houses only three women with four children .
" all of a sudden , their numbers have dropped drastically , " isidoro said .
" the spanish security authorities have developed technologies that have led to refugees and criminal people-smugglers taking other routes . "
in 2002 , the spanish government developed a high-tech 300-million-euro -lrb- $ 430-million -rrb- border surveillance system called sive and has since deployed it on its porous southern border .
the control room of the sophisticated tracking system responsible for monitoring a 114-kilometer -lrb- 71-mile -rrb- long stretch of the strait of gibraltar - one of the world 's most-traveled sea routes - is located in a drab block of buildings in the spanish port of algeciras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian augustina gave birth to twins in spain the nerve center , a room bathed in neon light and outfitted with dozens of computer monitors , allows officials to track the movements of boats and fishing vessels with the help of video cameras and infrared systems installed at five points in the strait .
" the significant thing about the system is that , both day and night , it can track and make visible swimming objects that barely stick out of the water 's surface and are less than a meter -lrb- a yard -rrb- long , " said salvador gomez , one of the officials working there .
system working well , say officials the main concern for the spanish coast guard is the sea traffic from the south to the north .
the route is largely used by young migrants from morocco , aware that they ca n't be deported so easily , if they are caught , because they are minors .
" just this morning we caught two young moroccans in the strait , " said gomez .
" they were trying to cross it in a child 's dinghy that you can buy in any supermarket . "
officials say the sophisticated surveillance system is not just meant to deter illegal immigrants but also to save lives .
once the system detects illegal immigrants , the chase is taken on by the spanish coast guard , and emergency services are notified if the rickety boats overturn .
bildunterschrift : the spanish coast guard seizes illegal immigrants once they are detected by the tracking system the surveillance system is also meant to help in the fight against the drugs trade .
morocco is the world 's largest exporter of hashish , and cocaine , too , is often smuggled via north africa to europe .
the tracking system has hugely helped , according to officials .
this year , officials seized less than 1,000 illegal migrants trying to get into spain , down from some 13,000 in 2000 .
a number of other countries , including portugal , estonia and serbia , are following spain 's example and setting up the surveillance system as increasing numbers of illegal immigrants try to make their way into europe to find work .
" a policy that kills " the system , however , has been massively criticized by human rights groups , who say it does nothing to stem the flood of illegal migration but only diverts it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte espuche says the surveillance system is endangering migrant 's lives " the immigrants are increasingly selecting further , dangerous routes - for example via the canary islands , " said brigitte espuche of the pro human rights group in cadiz .
" to me that 's not a policy that saves lives , but rather one that kills , " she said .
not everyone agrees .
manuel fenix of the red cross in tarifa near algeciras , who has been called countless times by the spanish civil guard to take care of newly-arrived illegal immigrants , said the surveillance system has proved to be a life-saver .
" boats that run into rough weather on the seas can be tracked by the system and the emergency services can be sent out on time , " said fenix .
" earlier , the people used to just drown . "
the system , however , wo n't prevent people from trying to get to spain , fenix added .
he remembered the one time authorities pulled out a dead moroccan man from the waters in the strait .
he had bound an old rubber tire to his chest and another to his back .
two table tennis rackets , which he had used as paddles , bobbed from rope tied to his hands .
" africa is just a stone 's throw away from us , " fenix said .
" as long as people believe they can find a better life here , they 'll keep coming .

but critics say it 's inhumane and does nothing to get to the root of the problem . in 2003 , time magazine 's cover story on heroes featured an arresting image of a gray-haired white man , clad in a clergyman 's robes and a gleaming cross around his neck , standing knee-deep in the sea clasping a black baby in his arms .
the man was isidoro macias , a white cross franciscan friar who ran shelters for the hundreds of illegal immigrants at the time who made the perilous journey across the strait of gibraltar to spain in small boats known as pateras in spanish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isidoro macias was dubbed papa patera for his efforts to help illegal immigrants squashed together in the small dinghies , the shivering , dazed africans who arrived on spanish shores included many pregnant women and mothers with babies .
it was this group that isidoro paid special attention to , proving them with food , clothing and shelter - a mission that earned him the nickname " papa patera . "
up to 20 pregnant women lived in isidoro 's shelter at any given time , sleeping on air mattresses .
infrared cameras to deter migrants today , the shelter houses only three women with four children .
" all of a sudden , their numbers have dropped drastically , " isidoro said .
" the spanish security authorities have developed technologies that have led to refugees and criminal people-smugglers taking other routes . "
in 2002 , the spanish government developed a high-tech 300-million-euro -lrb- $ 430-million -rrb- border surveillance system called sive and has since deployed it on its porous southern border .
the control room of the sophisticated tracking system responsible for monitoring a 114-kilometer -lrb- 71-mile -rrb- long stretch of the strait of gibraltar - one of the world 's most-traveled sea routes - is located in a drab block of buildings in the spanish port of algeciras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian augustina gave birth to twins in spain the nerve center , a room bathed in neon light and outfitted with dozens of computer monitors , allows officials to track the movements of boats and fishing vessels with the help of video cameras and infrared systems installed at five points in the strait .
" the significant thing about the system is that , both day and night , it can track and make visible swimming objects that barely stick out of the water 's surface and are less than a meter -lrb- a yard -rrb- long , " said salvador gomez , one of the officials working there .
system working well , say officials the main concern for the spanish coast guard is the sea traffic from the south to the north .
the route is largely used by young migrants from morocco , aware that they ca n't be deported so easily , if they are caught , because they are minors .
" just this morning we caught two young moroccans in the strait , " said gomez .
" they were trying to cross it in a child 's dinghy that you can buy in any supermarket . "
officials say the sophisticated surveillance system is not just meant to deter illegal immigrants but also to save lives .
once the system detects illegal immigrants , the chase is taken on by the spanish coast guard , and emergency services are notified if the rickety boats overturn .
bildunterschrift : the spanish coast guard seizes illegal immigrants once they are detected by the tracking system the surveillance system is also meant to help in the fight against the drugs trade .
morocco is the world 's largest exporter of hashish , and cocaine , too , is often smuggled via north africa to europe .
the tracking system has hugely helped , according to officials .
this year , officials seized less than 1,000 illegal migrants trying to get into spain , down from some 13,000 in 2000 .
a number of other countries , including portugal , estonia and serbia , are following spain 's example and setting up the surveillance system as increasing numbers of illegal immigrants try to make their way into europe to find work .
" a policy that kills " the system , however , has been massively criticized by human rights groups , who say it does nothing to stem the flood of illegal migration but only diverts it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte espuche says the surveillance system is endangering migrant 's lives " the immigrants are increasingly selecting further , dangerous routes - for example via the canary islands , " said brigitte espuche of the pro human rights group in cadiz .
" to me that 's not a policy that saves lives , but rather one that kills , " she said .
not everyone agrees .
manuel fenix of the red cross in tarifa near algeciras , who has been called countless times by the spanish civil guard to take care of newly-arrived illegal immigrants , said the surveillance system has proved to be a life-saver .
" boats that run into rough weather on the seas can be tracked by the system and the emergency services can be sent out on time , " said fenix .
" earlier , the people used to just drown . "
the system , however , wo n't prevent people from trying to get to spain , fenix added .
he remembered the one time authorities pulled out a dead moroccan man from the waters in the strait .
he had bound an old rubber tire to his chest and another to his back .
two table tennis rackets , which he had used as paddles , bobbed from rope tied to his hands .

28 , as the two groups brought the conflict between turkey and kurdish rebels to germany .
police fear it was only the beginning . " the conflict in the border region to iraq has already spilled over to berlin , " claudia schmid , the berlin head of germany 's domestic intelligence service , the office to protect the constitution , told broadcaster rbb on monday .
the clashes took place in berlin 's kreuzberg district on sunday at the end of a demonstration by turkish nationalists with the slogan " unity and fraternity between turks and kurds . "
turks started to " hunt " kurds , according to germany 's police union dpoig .
only the force of a massive police presence had prevented people from using weapons , the dpoig said , according to the associated press .
schimd said 15 demonstrators had been arrested and 18 police officers injured in the unrest between nationalistic turks and kurds in kreuzberg , which has a large immigrant population .
pkk in berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifteen people were arrested more " emotional unrest " between turks and kurds was likely , she said , adding that around 1,000 people in berlin were associated with the militant kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which is banned in turkey .
the pkk has been waging a bloody campaign for self-rule in southeastern turkey since 1974 .
it took up arms in 1984 , aiming to create an ethnic homeland in the region .
more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict .
turkey 's parliament recently authorized the military to carry out cross-border offensives against kurdish militants in northern iraq after a surge in attacks on turkish soil .
talks between ankara and baghdad aimed at preventing the pkk from attacking from northern iraq and avoiding cross-border military operations broke down on friday after turkey called iraqi proposals ineffective . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 29.10.2007 ahead of india visit , merkel signals shift in asia policy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : changing priorities - merkel with chinese president hu and indian premier singh german chancellor angela merkel heads to india on monday , oct .
29 , promising to reverse her government 's china-centric asia policy and expand business and political ties with delhi . india may have increasingly been on the radar of successive german governments in recent years , but it 's been a mere blip compared to china 's overpowering presence . that is likely to change as german chancellor angela merkel heads to delhi and mumbai on her first official visit . last week , members of merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- called for a shift in focus of the government 's asia policy , saying there had been an overemphasis on china at the expense of other rising asian economies . berlin 's relationship with beijing is currently strained after china objected to a meeting between merkel and the exiled tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama in september . " many chances in a democracy like india " germany 's policy towards asia has so far " been too narrowly focused on economic issues and china , " said eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for the cdu 's parliamentary group , last week in the bundestag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party has stressed india 's democratic credentials cdu deputies outlined plans to make relations with asia a cornerstone of germany 's foreign and security policy in order to ensure that the region 's growing economic and political clout does not lead to a decline in german influence .
the plan calls for an asia policy increasingly based on western values and urges germany to close ranks with other democratic asian nations such as india , japan and south korea . merkel signaled last week she is prepared to reverse her predecessor gerhard schröder 's policy on asia .
he was criticized for an overt emphasis on cultivating business ties with china and turning a blind eye to its human right violations , and try to expand business and political relations with india . " we have to act relatively quickly , " merkel said .
" as europeans , we have many chances in a democratic country like india .
we just have to get involved . " business , trade ties gather steam experts admit that germany has been slow to wake up to the opportunities that india , a country of 1.1 billion people with rapid growth rates of around 9 percent a year , has to offer . " the rise of india has come as a surprise to germany , " said joachim beck from the institute for asian studies at the german institute of global and area studies .
" it has been so accustomed to seeing india as poor , as an unstable , multifaceted country .
the german government never thought india could become a world power in economic and political terms . " in recent years , berlin has moved to correct its relative neglect of the rising south asian power by pursuing bilateral business and trade with delhi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with singh at the hanover trade fair last year india is now germany 's fourth largest trading partner in asia - after china , japan and south korea .
bilateral trade stands at roughly 10.6 billion euros with german exports to india last year surging by more than 50 percent .
germany is the fourth largest investor in india and newly-confident indian companies are also increasingly making acquisitions in europe 's largest economy . last year 's focus on india at the hanover trade fair as well as the frankfurt book fair helped in filling the gaps in germany 's image of the asian nation .
merkel also enjoys good personal relations with her indian counterpart , prime minister manmohan singh . climate change talks not easy despite those improvements , merkel 's visit , which includes economic cooperation , but also climate change and the region 's fraught politics , is not expected to be entirely smooth . on the business front , merkel 's job will be clear cut - seeking ways to tap what experts say are vast unexplored opportunities in energy and infrastructure among other sectors .
a high-profile business delegation accompanying merkel is expected to use the chancellor 's visit to pressure delhi to tackle familiar problems of overregulation , red tape , corruption , crumbling infrastructure and an unreliable energy supply . politically however , merkel will face complicated talks with singh , particularly on climate change .
merkel who has taken the lead on tackling the issue in europe , clinched a deal to halve greenhouse gases at the g8 summit in germany earlier this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india emits 4.2 percent of the world 's co2 emissions - germany 's emits 3.2 percent india , like other developing nations , is vehemently opposed to capping greenhouse gas emissions , saying it will not compromise its continued 9 percent economic growth to arrest global warming .
it argues it is historical polluters in the industrialized west who must bear the brunt of emission cuts . merkel has welcomed a proposal by indian leader singh for an alternative plan that foresees linking caps on carbon dioxide emissions to the population of a country .
but , india has since held back on elaborating on the plan , underscoring the divide facing developed and developing nations when they meet in december in bali , indonesia to begin negotiations on a new climate change agreement to replace the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 . bernhard steinrücke , head of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai suggested in an interview with deutsche welle that germany should focus instead on what it can offer the indians in the fight against climate change .

29 , promising to reverse her government 's china-centric asia policy and expand business and political ties with delhi . india may have increasingly been on the radar of successive german governments in recent years , but it 's been a mere blip compared to china 's overpowering presence . that is likely to change as german chancellor angela merkel heads to delhi and mumbai on her first official visit . last week , members of merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- called for a shift in focus of the government 's asia policy , saying there had been an overemphasis on china at the expense of other rising asian economies . berlin 's relationship with beijing is currently strained after china objected to a meeting between merkel and the exiled tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama in september . " many chances in a democracy like india " germany 's policy towards asia has so far " been too narrowly focused on economic issues and china , " said eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for the cdu 's parliamentary group , last week in the bundestag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party has stressed india 's democratic credentials cdu deputies outlined plans to make relations with asia a cornerstone of germany 's foreign and security policy in order to ensure that the region 's growing economic and political clout does not lead to a decline in german influence .
the plan calls for an asia policy increasingly based on western values and urges germany to close ranks with other democratic asian nations such as india , japan and south korea . merkel signaled last week she is prepared to reverse her predecessor gerhard schröder 's policy on asia .
he was criticized for an overt emphasis on cultivating business ties with china and turning a blind eye to its human right violations , and try to expand business and political relations with india . " we have to act relatively quickly , " merkel said .
" as europeans , we have many chances in a democratic country like india .
we just have to get involved . " business , trade ties gather steam experts admit that germany has been slow to wake up to the opportunities that india , a country of 1.1 billion people with rapid growth rates of around 9 percent a year , has to offer . " the rise of india has come as a surprise to germany , " said joachim beck from the institute for asian studies at the german institute of global and area studies .
" it has been so accustomed to seeing india as poor , as an unstable , multifaceted country .
the german government never thought india could become a world power in economic and political terms . " in recent years , berlin has moved to correct its relative neglect of the rising south asian power by pursuing bilateral business and trade with delhi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with singh at the hanover trade fair last year india is now germany 's fourth largest trading partner in asia - after china , japan and south korea .
bilateral trade stands at roughly 10.6 billion euros with german exports to india last year surging by more than 50 percent .
germany is the fourth largest investor in india and newly-confident indian companies are also increasingly making acquisitions in europe 's largest economy . last year 's focus on india at the hanover trade fair as well as the frankfurt book fair helped in filling the gaps in germany 's image of the asian nation .
merkel also enjoys good personal relations with her indian counterpart , prime minister manmohan singh . climate change talks not easy despite those improvements , merkel 's visit , which includes economic cooperation , but also climate change and the region 's fraught politics , is not expected to be entirely smooth . on the business front , merkel 's job will be clear cut - seeking ways to tap what experts say are vast unexplored opportunities in energy and infrastructure among other sectors .
a high-profile business delegation accompanying merkel is expected to use the chancellor 's visit to pressure delhi to tackle familiar problems of overregulation , red tape , corruption , crumbling infrastructure and an unreliable energy supply . politically however , merkel will face complicated talks with singh , particularly on climate change .
merkel who has taken the lead on tackling the issue in europe , clinched a deal to halve greenhouse gases at the g8 summit in germany earlier this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india emits 4.2 percent of the world 's co2 emissions - germany 's emits 3.2 percent india , like other developing nations , is vehemently opposed to capping greenhouse gas emissions , saying it will not compromise its continued 9 percent economic growth to arrest global warming .
it argues it is historical polluters in the industrialized west who must bear the brunt of emission cuts . merkel has welcomed a proposal by indian leader singh for an alternative plan that foresees linking caps on carbon dioxide emissions to the population of a country .
but , india has since held back on elaborating on the plan , underscoring the divide facing developed and developing nations when they meet in december in bali , indonesia to begin negotiations on a new climate change agreement to replace the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 . bernhard steinrücke , head of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai suggested in an interview with deutsche welle that germany should focus instead on what it can offer the indians in the fight against climate change . " compared to germany , the degree of pollution in india is still very low per capita , " steinrücke said .
" german companies have a lot to offer indians in terms of renewable energy , clean coal technology and energy efficiency know-how .

29 , promising to reverse her government 's china-centric asia policy and expand business and political ties with delhi . india may have increasingly been on the radar of successive german governments in recent years , but it 's been a mere blip compared to china 's overpowering presence . that is likely to change as german chancellor angela merkel heads to delhi and mumbai on her first official visit . last week , members of merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- called for a shift in focus of the government 's asia policy , saying there had been an overemphasis on china at the expense of other rising asian economies . berlin 's relationship with beijing is currently strained after china objected to a meeting between merkel and the exiled tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama in september . " many chances in a democracy like india " germany 's policy towards asia has so far " been too narrowly focused on economic issues and china , " said eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for the cdu 's parliamentary group , last week in the bundestag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party has stressed india 's democratic credentials cdu deputies outlined plans to make relations with asia a cornerstone of germany 's foreign and security policy in order to ensure that the region 's growing economic and political clout does not lead to a decline in german influence .
the plan calls for an asia policy increasingly based on western values and urges germany to close ranks with other democratic asian nations such as india , japan and south korea . merkel signaled last week she is prepared to reverse her predecessor gerhard schröder 's policy on asia .
he was criticized for an overt emphasis on cultivating business ties with china and turning a blind eye to its human right violations , and try to expand business and political relations with india . " we have to act relatively quickly , " merkel said .
" as europeans , we have many chances in a democratic country like india .
we just have to get involved . " business , trade ties gather steam experts admit that germany has been slow to wake up to the opportunities that india , a country of 1.1 billion people with rapid growth rates of around 9 percent a year , has to offer . " the rise of india has come as a surprise to germany , " said joachim beck from the institute for asian studies at the german institute of global and area studies .
" it has been so accustomed to seeing india as poor , as an unstable , multifaceted country .
the german government never thought india could become a world power in economic and political terms . " in recent years , berlin has moved to correct its relative neglect of the rising south asian power by pursuing bilateral business and trade with delhi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with singh at the hanover trade fair last year india is now germany 's fourth largest trading partner in asia - after china , japan and south korea .
bilateral trade stands at roughly 10.6 billion euros with german exports to india last year surging by more than 50 percent .
germany is the fourth largest investor in india and newly-confident indian companies are also increasingly making acquisitions in europe 's largest economy . last year 's focus on india at the hanover trade fair as well as the frankfurt book fair helped in filling the gaps in germany 's image of the asian nation .
merkel also enjoys good personal relations with her indian counterpart , prime minister manmohan singh . climate change talks not easy despite those improvements , merkel 's visit , which includes economic cooperation , but also climate change and the region 's fraught politics , is not expected to be entirely smooth . on the business front , merkel 's job will be clear cut - seeking ways to tap what experts say are vast unexplored opportunities in energy and infrastructure among other sectors .
a high-profile business delegation accompanying merkel is expected to use the chancellor 's visit to pressure delhi to tackle familiar problems of overregulation , red tape , corruption , crumbling infrastructure and an unreliable energy supply . politically however , merkel will face complicated talks with singh , particularly on climate change .
merkel who has taken the lead on tackling the issue in europe , clinched a deal to halve greenhouse gases at the g8 summit in germany earlier this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india emits 4.2 percent of the world 's co2 emissions - germany 's emits 3.2 percent india , like other developing nations , is vehemently opposed to capping greenhouse gas emissions , saying it will not compromise its continued 9 percent economic growth to arrest global warming .
it argues it is historical polluters in the industrialized west who must bear the brunt of emission cuts . merkel has welcomed a proposal by indian leader singh for an alternative plan that foresees linking caps on carbon dioxide emissions to the population of a country .
but , india has since held back on elaborating on the plan , underscoring the divide facing developed and developing nations when they meet in december in bali , indonesia to begin negotiations on a new climate change agreement to replace the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 . bernhard steinrücke , head of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai suggested in an interview with deutsche welle that germany should focus instead on what it can offer the indians in the fight against climate change . " compared to germany , the degree of pollution in india is still very low per capita , " steinrücke said .
" german companies have a lot to offer indians in terms of renewable energy , clean coal technology and energy efficiency know-how . " " room for germany as an honest broker " merkel will also need to tread carefully on issues such as the conflict in kashmir and india 's relations with neighboring pakistan , both nuclear powers .
delhi is opposed to critical questions on the topics which it views as international meddling in its internal affairs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india does n't take kindly to international criticism of the kashmir conflict other delicate political topics on the agenda include stalled talks on un reforms and a common desire in delhi and berlin for a permanent seat at the un security council , tough german visa procedures for indian business leaders and a controversial deal on civilian nuclear cooperation between india and the us . given that the indo-us nuclear deal might not materialize in the face of stiff opposition by india 's communist parties , the cdu 's von klaeden hopes there might yet be room for berlin to gain some political clout in the region . " the indians are too clever to only bind themselves to one partner , " von klaeden told the rheinischer merkur newspaper last week .

the mandate of the german army is closely linked to the progress of the peace process , he added .
germany heads the international un maritime force charged with patrolling the waters off lebanon to prevent weapons being smuggled to hezbollah guerrillas by sea .
the force was created in accordance with the un-brokered cease-fire that ended last year 's fighting between israel and hezbollah guerrillas .
germany is the main contributor with around 820 german soldiers stationed in the region .
in september , the german parliament extended the unifil mission by another year .
" unifil is a comprehensive mission which involves ground forces which are also helping the army but we germans are responsible for maritime security , " jung said as he visited navy personnel on the frigate bayern , the lead vessel of the maritime taskforce .
german soldiers are also involved in training the lebanese navy .
controversial german deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung has vowed germany will stay put in lebanon for as long as it takes the deployment of the german navy in lebanon is significant because it marks the country 's first peacekeeping mission in the middle east since the end of world war ii .
the mission sparked much debate in germany last year after israel called on berlin to send soldiers to the region as part of a buffer force in south lebanon to police a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah and prevent further fighting . chancellor angela merkel 's government , however , ruled out sending any combat troops given germany 's sensitive historical relationship with israel .
at the time , merkel said there was no question of sending any ground troops to join un forces in lebanon due to the fear , as she put it , that germans could even " accidentally " aim their weapons at israelis .
" this mission comes in view of our special responsibility for israel , " said merkel in reference to the murder of around six million jews by the nazis .
germany currently has about 10,000 troops on foreign missions in the balkans , lebanon and afghanistan .
lebanon is the first leg of jung 's five-day tour of the middle east .
the minister is also to visit the united arab emirates , jordan and israel .
german-led push for mideast peace jung 's visit to the middle east is followed by a trip to the region by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to lay the groundwork for a us mideast conference planned for the end of november .
steinmeier 's trip to egypt , israel and the palestinian territories next week will build on the european union 's so-called middle east action plan , a german-led initiative to help further middle east peace by promoting small and medium-sized businesses in the palestinian territories and building up special economic zones .
the plan also aims to increase eu assistance in the training of palestinian police and judiciary as well as in the educational and civil service sectors with greater eu assistance focused on palestinian universities and students .
steinmeier said earlier this month the aim was to help wean palestinians off development aid by helping to strengthen their private sector .
the eu and its member states are estimated to have pumped in financial and humanitarian aid worth around 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.14 billion -rrb- in the region so far this year . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the mandate of the german army is closely linked to the progress of the peace process , he added .
germany heads the international un maritime force charged with patrolling the waters off lebanon to prevent weapons being smuggled to hezbollah guerrillas by sea .
the force was created in accordance with the un-brokered cease-fire that ended last year 's fighting between israel and hezbollah guerrillas .
germany is the main contributor with around 820 german soldiers stationed in the region .
in september , the german parliament extended the unifil mission by another year .
" unifil is a comprehensive mission which involves ground forces which are also helping the army but we germans are responsible for maritime security , " jung said as he visited navy personnel on the frigate bayern , the lead vessel of the maritime taskforce .
german soldiers are also involved in training the lebanese navy .
controversial german deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung has vowed germany will stay put in lebanon for as long as it takes the deployment of the german navy in lebanon is significant because it marks the country 's first peacekeeping mission in the middle east since the end of world war ii .
the mission sparked much debate in germany last year after israel called on berlin to send soldiers to the region as part of a buffer force in south lebanon to police a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah and prevent further fighting . chancellor angela merkel 's government , however , ruled out sending any combat troops given germany 's sensitive historical relationship with israel .
at the time , merkel said there was no question of sending any ground troops to join un forces in lebanon due to the fear , as she put it , that germans could even " accidentally " aim their weapons at israelis .
" this mission comes in view of our special responsibility for israel , " said merkel in reference to the murder of around six million jews by the nazis .
germany currently has about 10,000 troops on foreign missions in the balkans , lebanon and afghanistan .
lebanon is the first leg of jung 's five-day tour of the middle east .
the minister is also to visit the united arab emirates , jordan and israel .
german-led push for mideast peace jung 's visit to the middle east is followed by a trip to the region by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to lay the groundwork for a us mideast conference planned for the end of november .
steinmeier 's trip to egypt , israel and the palestinian territories next week will build on the european union 's so-called middle east action plan , a german-led initiative to help further middle east peace by promoting small and medium-sized businesses in the palestinian territories and building up special economic zones .
the plan also aims to increase eu assistance in the training of palestinian police and judiciary as well as in the educational and civil service sectors with greater eu assistance focused on palestinian universities and students .
steinmeier said earlier this month the aim was to help wean palestinians off development aid by helping to strengthen their private sector .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.10.2007 opinion : germany 's social democrats venture a new beginning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's social democrats wrapped up a major party conference on sunday , oct .
28 , which could mark the attempt at a new beginning ahead of elections in 2009 , says dw 's alexander kudascheff . the party conference took place at a difficult time for the spd .
in opinion polls , the social democrats languish at a depressing 25 percent , nearly a historic low .
at the same time , the party is beset by problems from all sides - the left party has successfully snatched away social democratic issues and voters because the necessary reform of germany 's social welfare state under chancellor gerhard schröder cost the spd its political credibility as a leftist , social power - even though the reforms were successful . the party is also squeezed by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , who have forgotten all their earlier market reform ambitions since they 've been in government and now behave more like social democrats than the spd itself .
over the last two years , that has plunged the spd into doubts and near resignation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburg party conference was meant to do one thing above all : to make a new beginning in order to gain self-confidence .
party chief kurt beck , who 's been in office for over a year and a half , was responsible for it .
he was considered a weak boss until just before hamburg , but at the conference he established himself as the absolute no. 1 .
he proved that he is both skilled in tactics and projecting power .
his public demeanor and elocution do n't shine , but they show him as a down-to-earth politician .
in any case , the party values his style . whether it has an impact on germany 's voters has yet to be seen .
moreover , the spd passed a new party program in which it defined itself as the largest , left-wing , mainstream party .
the social democrats profess the values of democratic socialism and want to make globalization humane and fair .
above all , they strive for a society in which everyone has the same opportunities for advancement - a downright classic social democratic idea .
the new program serves to boost self-affirmation within the party and it 's meant to sharpen its profile outside the party .
as a party , the spd also suffers from having to govern as part of a " grand coalition " in berlin .
it clearly suffers from the pragmatism of everyday politicis and its obvious inherent necessities .
nevertheless , in hamburg , the social democrats strongly backed the afghanistan policies of spd member and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
they even endorsed the us-led anti-terror mission , operation enduring freedom , which was not an easy step for a party with a peaceful tradition .
thus , they demonstrated an astonishing measure of foreign policy realism .
the spd showed itself in unity , with the internal strife between its opposing wings relegated to the past .
it rallied behind party chief beck .
with its party program , it gave itself a rather traditional left-wing profile - and bid farewell to all the new directions , and even the " neue mitte , " the new middle way , it had long courted .
the spd is prepared to take up the battle - against the left party and also against chancellor merkel , who has so far remained vague and noncommittal on domestic issues but has nevertheless basked in the glow of political success .
after the hamburg party conference , governing in the grand coalition is going to become more difficult - not when it comes to foreign policy , but when it comes to domestic issues .

28 , which could mark the attempt at a new beginning ahead of elections in 2009 , says dw 's alexander kudascheff . the party conference took place at a difficult time for the spd .
in opinion polls , the social democrats languish at a depressing 25 percent , nearly a historic low .
at the same time , the party is beset by problems from all sides - the left party has successfully snatched away social democratic issues and voters because the necessary reform of germany 's social welfare state under chancellor gerhard schröder cost the spd its political credibility as a leftist , social power - even though the reforms were successful . the party is also squeezed by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , who have forgotten all their earlier market reform ambitions since they 've been in government and now behave more like social democrats than the spd itself .
over the last two years , that has plunged the spd into doubts and near resignation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburg party conference was meant to do one thing above all : to make a new beginning in order to gain self-confidence .
party chief kurt beck , who 's been in office for over a year and a half , was responsible for it .
he was considered a weak boss until just before hamburg , but at the conference he established himself as the absolute no. 1 .
he proved that he is both skilled in tactics and projecting power .
his public demeanor and elocution do n't shine , but they show him as a down-to-earth politician .
in any case , the party values his style . whether it has an impact on germany 's voters has yet to be seen .
moreover , the spd passed a new party program in which it defined itself as the largest , left-wing , mainstream party .
the social democrats profess the values of democratic socialism and want to make globalization humane and fair .
above all , they strive for a society in which everyone has the same opportunities for advancement - a downright classic social democratic idea .
the new program serves to boost self-affirmation within the party and it 's meant to sharpen its profile outside the party .
as a party , the spd also suffers from having to govern as part of a " grand coalition " in berlin .
it clearly suffers from the pragmatism of everyday politicis and its obvious inherent necessities .
nevertheless , in hamburg , the social democrats strongly backed the afghanistan policies of spd member and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
they even endorsed the us-led anti-terror mission , operation enduring freedom , which was not an easy step for a party with a peaceful tradition .
thus , they demonstrated an astonishing measure of foreign policy realism .
the spd showed itself in unity , with the internal strife between its opposing wings relegated to the past .
it rallied behind party chief beck .
with its party program , it gave itself a rather traditional left-wing profile - and bid farewell to all the new directions , and even the " neue mitte , " the new middle way , it had long courted .
the spd is prepared to take up the battle - against the left party and also against chancellor merkel , who has so far remained vague and noncommittal on domestic issues but has nevertheless basked in the glow of political success .
after the hamburg party conference , governing in the grand coalition is going to become more difficult - not when it comes to foreign policy , but when it comes to domestic issues .
the long campaign leading up to parliamentary elections in two years has begun .

28 , which could mark the attempt at a new beginning ahead of elections in 2009 , says dw 's alexander kudascheff . the party conference took place at a difficult time for the spd .
in opinion polls , the social democrats languish at a depressing 25 percent , nearly a historic low .
at the same time , the party is beset by problems from all sides - the left party has successfully snatched away social democratic issues and voters because the necessary reform of germany 's social welfare state under chancellor gerhard schröder cost the spd its political credibility as a leftist , social power - even though the reforms were successful . the party is also squeezed by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , who have forgotten all their earlier market reform ambitions since they 've been in government and now behave more like social democrats than the spd itself .
over the last two years , that has plunged the spd into doubts and near resignation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburg party conference was meant to do one thing above all : to make a new beginning in order to gain self-confidence .
party chief kurt beck , who 's been in office for over a year and a half , was responsible for it .
he was considered a weak boss until just before hamburg , but at the conference he established himself as the absolute no. 1 .
he proved that he is both skilled in tactics and projecting power .
his public demeanor and elocution do n't shine , but they show him as a down-to-earth politician .
in any case , the party values his style . whether it has an impact on germany 's voters has yet to be seen .
moreover , the spd passed a new party program in which it defined itself as the largest , left-wing , mainstream party .
the social democrats profess the values of democratic socialism and want to make globalization humane and fair .
above all , they strive for a society in which everyone has the same opportunities for advancement - a downright classic social democratic idea .
the new program serves to boost self-affirmation within the party and it 's meant to sharpen its profile outside the party .
as a party , the spd also suffers from having to govern as part of a " grand coalition " in berlin .
it clearly suffers from the pragmatism of everyday politicis and its obvious inherent necessities .
nevertheless , in hamburg , the social democrats strongly backed the afghanistan policies of spd member and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
they even endorsed the us-led anti-terror mission , operation enduring freedom , which was not an easy step for a party with a peaceful tradition .
thus , they demonstrated an astonishing measure of foreign policy realism .
the spd showed itself in unity , with the internal strife between its opposing wings relegated to the past .
it rallied behind party chief beck .
with its party program , it gave itself a rather traditional left-wing profile - and bid farewell to all the new directions , and even the " neue mitte , " the new middle way , it had long courted .
the spd is prepared to take up the battle - against the left party and also against chancellor merkel , who has so far remained vague and noncommittal on domestic issues but has nevertheless basked in the glow of political success .
after the hamburg party conference , governing in the grand coalition is going to become more difficult - not when it comes to foreign policy , but when it comes to domestic issues .

the agency is meant to become a stronger " service provider , " a spokesman said . " the service will undergo a thorough reform process , " said bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- spokesman stefan borchert on saturday , oct .
27 .
" antiquated and crusty structures will be broken up . " the aim was for the agency to become stronger as a " service provider " for the german government and parliament , borchert said , adding that berlin 's control over the agency was meant to be strengthened .
the reform of the bnd , which has 6,000 employees , is due to be completed by 2009 , the same year as germany 's next parliamentary elections , and three years before the agency is due to complete its move from pullach , near munich , to berlin .
" profound changes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bnd 's headquarters will soon be in the capital the service 's upper tiers are supposed to be trimmed down at the same time as its eight departments would grow to 12 .
a new " proliferation " department would deal with illegal weapons deals .
the wall between agents who collect information and those who analyze it was going to be broken down , borchert said , ensuring more transparency .
the bnd 's 50-year history is speckled with scandals , most recently for its agent 's questionable actions in afghanistan and for spying on journalists in germany , a practice that was only suspended in late 2005 .
the " self-protection " department , which did the spying , would only be responsible for protecting the service 's own agents after the reform , der spiegel newsmagazine reported .
borchert stressed that the reform plans were not the result of " alleged or real existing scandals . "
he said an overhaul had been under debate for a long time in order to prepare the bnd for " future challenges , " but that the events had made reform more urgent . bnd president ernst uhrlau had touted the reform in employee meetings in pullach and berlin as a profound change to the service .
high time , opposition says praise for the reform came from opposition politicians over the weekend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd chief uhrlau is prepared to break taboos " it was time for the consequences to be drawn from the apparent aberrations , " hans-christian ströbele , an opposition green party member of the parliamentary commission established to investigate the bnd 's activities in afghanistan , told the taz daily .
" thus the bnd leadership and the federal chancellery would be in a position to better control the agency .
the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party 's secret service expert expressed similar sentiments . " the federal government has recognized that it has to keep the bnd on a shorter leash , " max stadler , told ard television over the weekend .

the agency is meant to become a stronger " service provider , " a spokesman said . " the service will undergo a thorough reform process , " said bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- spokesman stefan borchert on saturday , oct .
27 .
" antiquated and crusty structures will be broken up . " the aim was for the agency to become stronger as a " service provider " for the german government and parliament , borchert said , adding that berlin 's control over the agency was meant to be strengthened .
the reform of the bnd , which has 6,000 employees , is due to be completed by 2009 , the same year as germany 's next parliamentary elections , and three years before the agency is due to complete its move from pullach , near munich , to berlin .

a new " proliferation " department would deal with illegal weapons deals .
the wall between agents who collect information and those who analyze it was going to be broken down , borchert said , ensuring more transparency .
the bnd 's 50-year history is speckled with scandals , most recently for its agent 's questionable actions in afghanistan and for spying on journalists in germany , a practice that was only suspended in late 2005 .
the " self-protection " department , which did the spying , would only be responsible for protecting the service 's own agents after the reform , der spiegel newsmagazine reported .
borchert stressed that the reform plans were not the result of " alleged or real existing scandals . "
he said an overhaul had been under debate for a long time in order to prepare the bnd for " future challenges , " but that the events had made reform more urgent . bnd president ernst uhrlau had touted the reform in employee meetings in pullach and berlin as a profound change to the service .

" thus the bnd leadership and the federal chancellery would be in a position to better control the agency .
the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party 's secret service expert expressed similar sentiments . " the federal government has recognized that it has to keep the bnd on a shorter leash , " max stadler , told ard television over the weekend .

29 , to reconsider plans to suspend compliance with a key 1990 arms control treaty , saying the move risked touching off a new arms race . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and his french counterpart , bernard kouchner , said all european states would lose out if russia went ahead with its plans to withdraw from the conventional forces in europe treaty -lrb- cfe -rrb- .
" the stated plan by russia to scrap its participation in the cfe treaty is a matter of concern for us , " the two wrote in a joint article published in germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and france 's le figaro .
" an erosion of the cfe treaty could spark new arms races and create new conflicts . "
cfe exit linked to us missile shield plans the cfe treaty , signed in 1990 between the then-22 nato member states and the warsaw pact , limits the deployment and storage of military aircraft , tanks , artillery and other heavy non-nuclear weapons from russia 's ural mountains to the atlantic .

russian 's formal withdrawal will come into effect on december 12 .
us plans to station missile defense stations in poland and the czech republic are widely regarded as being the immediate trigger for moscow 's cfe withdrawal .
in 1999 , taking heed of the changes since the initial signing in 1991 , the treaty was adapted to accommodate post-cold war realities .
russia at the time pledged to withdraw troops and ammunition from the breakaway provinces of transnistria in moldova and south ossetia in georgia .
nato 's member states refuse to ratify the adapted treaty unless moscow fulfils the commitments , while russia resents this linkage .
ministers warn of new " cold war " on monday , steinmeier and kouchner called the cfe treaty an " anchor of stability " for european security .
" we appeal to the russian government to refrain from the planned suspension and to use the path of negotiation in order to protect its legitimate interests , " they wrote in the article .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner has joined steinmeier in urging russia to drop its treaty exit plans the two foreign ministers also warned of " the specter of a new cold war . "
" a relapse into old conflict patterns should be avoided .

russia has also been calling for changes to another landmark arms control treaty , the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty -lrb- inf -rrb- , signed by mikhail gorbachev and ronald reagan in 1987 , which bars both russia and the united states from deploying intermediate-range missiles .
russia says that leaves it unable to adequately protect itself from countries on its eastern and southern borders , including iran , india and pakistan , which have growing arsenals .

29 , to reconsider plans to suspend compliance with a key 1990 arms control treaty , saying the move risked touching off a new arms race . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and his french counterpart , bernard kouchner , said all european states would lose out if russia went ahead with its plans to withdraw from the conventional forces in europe treaty -lrb- cfe -rrb- .
" the stated plan by russia to scrap its participation in the cfe treaty is a matter of concern for us , " the two wrote in a joint article published in germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and france 's le figaro .
" an erosion of the cfe treaty could spark new arms races and create new conflicts . "
cfe exit linked to us missile shield plans the cfe treaty , signed in 1990 between the then-22 nato member states and the warsaw pact , limits the deployment and storage of military aircraft , tanks , artillery and other heavy non-nuclear weapons from russia 's ural mountains to the atlantic .

us plans to station missile defense stations in poland and the czech republic are widely regarded as being the immediate trigger for moscow 's cfe withdrawal .
in 1999 , taking heed of the changes since the initial signing in 1991 , the treaty was adapted to accommodate post-cold war realities .
russia at the time pledged to withdraw troops and ammunition from the breakaway provinces of transnistria in moldova and south ossetia in georgia .
nato 's member states refuse to ratify the adapted treaty unless moscow fulfils the commitments , while russia resents this linkage .
ministers warn of new " cold war " on monday , steinmeier and kouchner called the cfe treaty an " anchor of stability " for european security .
" we appeal to the russian government to refrain from the planned suspension and to use the path of negotiation in order to protect its legitimate interests , " they wrote in the article .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner has joined steinmeier in urging russia to drop its treaty exit plans the two foreign ministers also warned of " the specter of a new cold war . "

russia has also been calling for changes to another landmark arms control treaty , the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty -lrb- inf -rrb- , signed by mikhail gorbachev and ronald reagan in 1987 , which bars both russia and the united states from deploying intermediate-range missiles .
russia says that leaves it unable to adequately protect itself from countries on its eastern and southern borders , including iran , india and pakistan , which have growing arsenals .

28 , as the two groups brought the conflict between turkey and kurdish rebels to germany .
police fear it was only the beginning . " the conflict in the border region to iraq has already spilled over to berlin , " claudia schmid , the berlin head of germany 's domestic intelligence service , the office to protect the constitution , told broadcaster rbb on monday .
the clashes took place in berlin 's kreuzberg district on sunday at the end of a demonstration by turkish nationalists with the slogan " unity and fraternity between turks and kurds . "
turks started to " hunt " kurds , according to germany 's police union dpoig .
only the force of a massive police presence had prevented people from using weapons , the dpoig said , according to the associated press .
schimd said 15 demonstrators had been arrested and 18 police officers injured in the unrest between nationalistic turks and kurds in kreuzberg , which has a large immigrant population .
pkk in berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifteen people were arrested more " emotional unrest " between turks and kurds was likely , she said , adding that around 1,000 people in berlin were associated with the militant kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which is banned in turkey .
the pkk has been waging a bloody campaign for self-rule in southeastern turkey since 1974 .
it took up arms in 1984 , aiming to create an ethnic homeland in the region .
more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict .
turkey 's parliament recently authorized the military to carry out cross-border offensives against kurdish militants in northern iraq after a surge in attacks on turkish soil .

the mandate of the german army is closely linked to the progress of the peace process , he added .
germany heads the international un maritime force charged with patrolling the waters off lebanon to prevent weapons being smuggled to hezbollah guerrillas by sea .
the force was created in accordance with the un-brokered cease-fire that ended last year 's fighting between israel and hezbollah guerrillas .
germany is the main contributor with around 820 german soldiers stationed in the region .
in september , the german parliament extended the unifil mission by another year .
" unifil is a comprehensive mission which involves ground forces which are also helping the army but we germans are responsible for maritime security , " jung said as he visited navy personnel on the frigate bayern , the lead vessel of the maritime taskforce .
german soldiers are also involved in training the lebanese navy .
controversial german deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung has vowed germany will stay put in lebanon for as long as it takes the deployment of the german navy in lebanon is significant because it marks the country 's first peacekeeping mission in the middle east since the end of world war ii .
the mission sparked much debate in germany last year after israel called on berlin to send soldiers to the region as part of a buffer force in south lebanon to police a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah and prevent further fighting . chancellor angela merkel 's government , however , ruled out sending any combat troops given germany 's sensitive historical relationship with israel .
at the time , merkel said there was no question of sending any ground troops to join un forces in lebanon due to the fear , as she put it , that germans could even " accidentally " aim their weapons at israelis .
" this mission comes in view of our special responsibility for israel , " said merkel in reference to the murder of around six million jews by the nazis .
germany currently has about 10,000 troops on foreign missions in the balkans , lebanon and afghanistan .
lebanon is the first leg of jung 's five-day tour of the middle east .
the minister is also to visit the united arab emirates , jordan and israel .
german-led push for mideast peace jung 's visit to the middle east is followed by a trip to the region by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to lay the groundwork for a us mideast conference planned for the end of november .
steinmeier 's trip to egypt , israel and the palestinian territories next week will build on the european union 's so-called middle east action plan , a german-led initiative to help further middle east peace by promoting small and medium-sized businesses in the palestinian territories and building up special economic zones .
the plan also aims to increase eu assistance in the training of palestinian police and judiciary as well as in the educational and civil service sectors with greater eu assistance focused on palestinian universities and students .
steinmeier said earlier this month the aim was to help wean palestinians off development aid by helping to strengthen their private sector .

29 , to reconsider plans to suspend compliance with a key 1990 arms control treaty , saying the move risked touching off a new arms race . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and his french counterpart , bernard kouchner , said all european states would lose out if russia went ahead with its plans to withdraw from the conventional forces in europe treaty -lrb- cfe -rrb- .
" the stated plan by russia to scrap its participation in the cfe treaty is a matter of concern for us , " the two wrote in a joint article published in germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and france 's le figaro .
" an erosion of the cfe treaty could spark new arms races and create new conflicts . "
cfe exit linked to us missile shield plans the cfe treaty , signed in 1990 between the then-22 nato member states and the warsaw pact , limits the deployment and storage of military aircraft , tanks , artillery and other heavy non-nuclear weapons from russia 's ural mountains to the atlantic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin is playing hardball with the us in july of this year , russian president vladimir putin signed a decree pulling russia out of the treaty , considered a centerpiece of international disarmament efforts .
russian 's formal withdrawal will come into effect on december 12 .
us plans to station missile defense stations in poland and the czech republic are widely regarded as being the immediate trigger for moscow 's cfe withdrawal .
in 1999 , taking heed of the changes since the initial signing in 1991 , the treaty was adapted to accommodate post-cold war realities .
russia at the time pledged to withdraw troops and ammunition from the breakaway provinces of transnistria in moldova and south ossetia in georgia .
nato 's member states refuse to ratify the adapted treaty unless moscow fulfils the commitments , while russia resents this linkage .
ministers warn of new " cold war " on monday , steinmeier and kouchner called the cfe treaty an " anchor of stability " for european security .
" we appeal to the russian government to refrain from the planned suspension and to use the path of negotiation in order to protect its legitimate interests , " they wrote in the article .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner has joined steinmeier in urging russia to drop its treaty exit plans the two foreign ministers also warned of " the specter of a new cold war . "
" a relapse into old conflict patterns should be avoided .
that calls for flexibility on all sides , " they wrote .
russia has also been calling for changes to another landmark arms control treaty , the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty -lrb- inf -rrb- , signed by mikhail gorbachev and ronald reagan in 1987 , which bars both russia and the united states from deploying intermediate-range missiles .
russia says that leaves it unable to adequately protect itself from countries on its eastern and southern borders , including iran , india and pakistan , which have growing arsenals .
moscow has also called the inf treaty a cold war relic because it did not include countries outside of europe that have since built up their military weaponry . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the mandate of the german army is closely linked to the progress of the peace process , he added .
germany heads the international un maritime force charged with patrolling the waters off lebanon to prevent weapons being smuggled to hezbollah guerrillas by sea .
the force was created in accordance with the un-brokered cease-fire that ended last year 's fighting between israel and hezbollah guerrillas .
germany is the main contributor with around 820 german soldiers stationed in the region .
in september , the german parliament extended the unifil mission by another year .
" unifil is a comprehensive mission which involves ground forces which are also helping the army but we germans are responsible for maritime security , " jung said as he visited navy personnel on the frigate bayern , the lead vessel of the maritime taskforce .
german soldiers are also involved in training the lebanese navy .
controversial german deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung has vowed germany will stay put in lebanon for as long as it takes the deployment of the german navy in lebanon is significant because it marks the country 's first peacekeeping mission in the middle east since the end of world war ii .
the mission sparked much debate in germany last year after israel called on berlin to send soldiers to the region as part of a buffer force in south lebanon to police a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah and prevent further fighting . chancellor angela merkel 's government , however , ruled out sending any combat troops given germany 's sensitive historical relationship with israel .
at the time , merkel said there was no question of sending any ground troops to join un forces in lebanon due to the fear , as she put it , that germans could even " accidentally " aim their weapons at israelis .
" this mission comes in view of our special responsibility for israel , " said merkel in reference to the murder of around six million jews by the nazis .
germany currently has about 10,000 troops on foreign missions in the balkans , lebanon and afghanistan .
lebanon is the first leg of jung 's five-day tour of the middle east .
the minister is also to visit the united arab emirates , jordan and israel .
german-led push for mideast peace jung 's visit to the middle east is followed by a trip to the region by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to lay the groundwork for a us mideast conference planned for the end of november .
steinmeier 's trip to egypt , israel and the palestinian territories next week will build on the european union 's so-called middle east action plan , a german-led initiative to help further middle east peace by promoting small and medium-sized businesses in the palestinian territories and building up special economic zones .
the plan also aims to increase eu assistance in the training of palestinian police and judiciary as well as in the educational and civil service sectors with greater eu assistance focused on palestinian universities and students .
steinmeier said earlier this month the aim was to help wean palestinians off development aid by helping to strengthen their private sector .
the eu and its member states are estimated to have pumped in financial and humanitarian aid worth around 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.14 billion -rrb- in the region so far this year . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

29 , to reconsider plans to suspend compliance with a key 1990 arms control treaty , saying the move risked touching off a new arms race . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and his french counterpart , bernard kouchner , said all european states would lose out if russia went ahead with its plans to withdraw from the conventional forces in europe treaty -lrb- cfe -rrb- .
" the stated plan by russia to scrap its participation in the cfe treaty is a matter of concern for us , " the two wrote in a joint article published in germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and france 's le figaro .
" an erosion of the cfe treaty could spark new arms races and create new conflicts . "
cfe exit linked to us missile shield plans the cfe treaty , signed in 1990 between the then-22 nato member states and the warsaw pact , limits the deployment and storage of military aircraft , tanks , artillery and other heavy non-nuclear weapons from russia 's ural mountains to the atlantic .

russian 's formal withdrawal will come into effect on december 12 .
us plans to station missile defense stations in poland and the czech republic are widely regarded as being the immediate trigger for moscow 's cfe withdrawal .
in 1999 , taking heed of the changes since the initial signing in 1991 , the treaty was adapted to accommodate post-cold war realities .
russia at the time pledged to withdraw troops and ammunition from the breakaway provinces of transnistria in moldova and south ossetia in georgia .
nato 's member states refuse to ratify the adapted treaty unless moscow fulfils the commitments , while russia resents this linkage .
ministers warn of new " cold war " on monday , steinmeier and kouchner called the cfe treaty an " anchor of stability " for european security .
" we appeal to the russian government to refrain from the planned suspension and to use the path of negotiation in order to protect its legitimate interests , " they wrote in the article .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner has joined steinmeier in urging russia to drop its treaty exit plans the two foreign ministers also warned of " the specter of a new cold war . "
" a relapse into old conflict patterns should be avoided .

russia has also been calling for changes to another landmark arms control treaty , the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty -lrb- inf -rrb- , signed by mikhail gorbachev and ronald reagan in 1987 , which bars both russia and the united states from deploying intermediate-range missiles .
russia says that leaves it unable to adequately protect itself from countries on its eastern and southern borders , including iran , india and pakistan , which have growing arsenals .

germany heads the international un maritime force charged with patrolling the waters off lebanon to prevent weapons being smuggled to hezbollah guerrillas by sea .
the force was created in accordance with the un-brokered cease-fire that ended last year 's fighting between israel and hezbollah guerrillas .
germany is the main contributor with around 820 german soldiers stationed in the region .
in september , the german parliament extended the unifil mission by another year .
" unifil is a comprehensive mission which involves ground forces which are also helping the army but we germans are responsible for maritime security , " jung said as he visited navy personnel on the frigate bayern , the lead vessel of the maritime taskforce .
german soldiers are also involved in training the lebanese navy .
controversial german deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung has vowed germany will stay put in lebanon for as long as it takes the deployment of the german navy in lebanon is significant because it marks the country 's first peacekeeping mission in the middle east since the end of world war ii .
the mission sparked much debate in germany last year after israel called on berlin to send soldiers to the region as part of a buffer force in south lebanon to police a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah and prevent further fighting . chancellor angela merkel 's government , however , ruled out sending any combat troops given germany 's sensitive historical relationship with israel .
at the time , merkel said there was no question of sending any ground troops to join un forces in lebanon due to the fear , as she put it , that germans could even " accidentally " aim their weapons at israelis .
" this mission comes in view of our special responsibility for israel , " said merkel in reference to the murder of around six million jews by the nazis .
germany currently has about 10,000 troops on foreign missions in the balkans , lebanon and afghanistan .
lebanon is the first leg of jung 's five-day tour of the middle east .
the minister is also to visit the united arab emirates , jordan and israel .
german-led push for mideast peace jung 's visit to the middle east is followed by a trip to the region by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to lay the groundwork for a us mideast conference planned for the end of november .
steinmeier 's trip to egypt , israel and the palestinian territories next week will build on the european union 's so-called middle east action plan , a german-led initiative to help further middle east peace by promoting small and medium-sized businesses in the palestinian territories and building up special economic zones .
the plan also aims to increase eu assistance in the training of palestinian police and judiciary as well as in the educational and civil service sectors with greater eu assistance focused on palestinian universities and students .
steinmeier said earlier this month the aim was to help wean palestinians off development aid by helping to strengthen their private sector .

but critics say it 's inhumane and does nothing to get to the root of the problem . in 2003 , time magazine 's cover story on heroes featured an arresting image of a gray-haired white man , clad in a clergyman 's robes and a gleaming cross around his neck , standing knee-deep in the sea clasping a black baby in his arms .
the man was isidoro macias , a white cross franciscan friar who ran shelters for the hundreds of illegal immigrants at the time who made the perilous journey across the strait of gibraltar to spain in small boats known as pateras in spanish .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : isidoro macias was dubbed papa patera for his efforts to help illegal immigrants squashed together in the small dinghies , the shivering , dazed africans who arrived on spanish shores included many pregnant women and mothers with babies .
it was this group that isidoro paid special attention to , proving them with food , clothing and shelter - a mission that earned him the nickname " papa patera . "
up to 20 pregnant women lived in isidoro 's shelter at any given time , sleeping on air mattresses .
infrared cameras to deter migrants today , the shelter houses only three women with four children .
" all of a sudden , their numbers have dropped drastically , " isidoro said .
" the spanish security authorities have developed technologies that have led to refugees and criminal people-smugglers taking other routes . "
in 2002 , the spanish government developed a high-tech 300-million-euro -lrb- $ 430-million -rrb- border surveillance system called sive and has since deployed it on its porous southern border .
the control room of the sophisticated tracking system responsible for monitoring a 114-kilometer -lrb- 71-mile -rrb- long stretch of the strait of gibraltar - one of the world 's most-traveled sea routes - is located in a drab block of buildings in the spanish port of algeciras .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian augustina gave birth to twins in spain the nerve center , a room bathed in neon light and outfitted with dozens of computer monitors , allows officials to track the movements of boats and fishing vessels with the help of video cameras and infrared systems installed at five points in the strait .
" the significant thing about the system is that , both day and night , it can track and make visible swimming objects that barely stick out of the water 's surface and are less than a meter -lrb- a yard -rrb- long , " said salvador gomez , one of the officials working there .
system working well , say officials the main concern for the spanish coast guard is the sea traffic from the south to the north .
the route is largely used by young migrants from morocco , aware that they ca n't be deported so easily , if they are caught , because they are minors .
" just this morning we caught two young moroccans in the strait , " said gomez .
" they were trying to cross it in a child 's dinghy that you can buy in any supermarket . "
officials say the sophisticated surveillance system is not just meant to deter illegal immigrants but also to save lives .
once the system detects illegal immigrants , the chase is taken on by the spanish coast guard , and emergency services are notified if the rickety boats overturn .
bildunterschrift : the spanish coast guard seizes illegal immigrants once they are detected by the tracking system the surveillance system is also meant to help in the fight against the drugs trade .
morocco is the world 's largest exporter of hashish , and cocaine , too , is often smuggled via north africa to europe .
the tracking system has hugely helped , according to officials .
this year , officials seized less than 1,000 illegal migrants trying to get into spain , down from some 13,000 in 2000 .
a number of other countries , including portugal , estonia and serbia , are following spain 's example and setting up the surveillance system as increasing numbers of illegal immigrants try to make their way into europe to find work .
" a policy that kills " the system , however , has been massively criticized by human rights groups , who say it does nothing to stem the flood of illegal migration but only diverts it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte espuche says the surveillance system is endangering migrant 's lives " the immigrants are increasingly selecting further , dangerous routes - for example via the canary islands , " said brigitte espuche of the pro human rights group in cadiz .
" to me that 's not a policy that saves lives , but rather one that kills , " she said .
not everyone agrees .
manuel fenix of the red cross in tarifa near algeciras , who has been called countless times by the spanish civil guard to take care of newly-arrived illegal immigrants , said the surveillance system has proved to be a life-saver .
" boats that run into rough weather on the seas can be tracked by the system and the emergency services can be sent out on time , " said fenix .
" earlier , the people used to just drown . "
the system , however , wo n't prevent people from trying to get to spain , fenix added .
he remembered the one time authorities pulled out a dead moroccan man from the waters in the strait .
he had bound an old rubber tire to his chest and another to his back .
two table tennis rackets , which he had used as paddles , bobbed from rope tied to his hands .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nigerian augustina gave birth to twins in spain the nerve center , a room bathed in neon light and outfitted with dozens of computer monitors , allows officials to track the movements of boats and fishing vessels with the help of video cameras and infrared systems installed at five points in the strait .
" the significant thing about the system is that , both day and night , it can track and make visible swimming objects that barely stick out of the water 's surface and are less than a meter -lrb- a yard -rrb- long , " said salvador gomez , one of the officials working there .
system working well , say officials the main concern for the spanish coast guard is the sea traffic from the south to the north .
the route is largely used by young migrants from morocco , aware that they ca n't be deported so easily , if they are caught , because they are minors .
" just this morning we caught two young moroccans in the strait , " said gomez .
" they were trying to cross it in a child 's dinghy that you can buy in any supermarket . "
officials say the sophisticated surveillance system is not just meant to deter illegal immigrants but also to save lives .
once the system detects illegal immigrants , the chase is taken on by the spanish coast guard , and emergency services are notified if the rickety boats overturn .
bildunterschrift : the spanish coast guard seizes illegal immigrants once they are detected by the tracking system the surveillance system is also meant to help in the fight against the drugs trade .
morocco is the world 's largest exporter of hashish , and cocaine , too , is often smuggled via north africa to europe .
the tracking system has hugely helped , according to officials .
this year , officials seized less than 1,000 illegal migrants trying to get into spain , down from some 13,000 in 2000 .
a number of other countries , including portugal , estonia and serbia , are following spain 's example and setting up the surveillance system as increasing numbers of illegal immigrants try to make their way into europe to find work .
" a policy that kills " the system , however , has been massively criticized by human rights groups , who say it does nothing to stem the flood of illegal migration but only diverts it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brigitte espuche says the surveillance system is endangering migrant 's lives " the immigrants are increasingly selecting further , dangerous routes - for example via the canary islands , " said brigitte espuche of the pro human rights group in cadiz .
" to me that 's not a policy that saves lives , but rather one that kills , " she said .
not everyone agrees .
manuel fenix of the red cross in tarifa near algeciras , who has been called countless times by the spanish civil guard to take care of newly-arrived illegal immigrants , said the surveillance system has proved to be a life-saver .
" boats that run into rough weather on the seas can be tracked by the system and the emergency services can be sent out on time , " said fenix .
" earlier , the people used to just drown . "
the system , however , wo n't prevent people from trying to get to spain , fenix added .
he remembered the one time authorities pulled out a dead moroccan man from the waters in the strait .
he had bound an old rubber tire to his chest and another to his back .
two table tennis rackets , which he had used as paddles , bobbed from rope tied to his hands .
" africa is just a stone 's throw away from us , " fenix said .
" as long as people believe they can find a better life here , they 'll keep coming .
it does n't matter how many more cameras you install . " steffen leidel -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the mandate of the german army is closely linked to the progress of the peace process , he added .
germany heads the international un maritime force charged with patrolling the waters off lebanon to prevent weapons being smuggled to hezbollah guerrillas by sea .
the force was created in accordance with the un-brokered cease-fire that ended last year 's fighting between israel and hezbollah guerrillas .
germany is the main contributor with around 820 german soldiers stationed in the region .
in september , the german parliament extended the unifil mission by another year .
" unifil is a comprehensive mission which involves ground forces which are also helping the army but we germans are responsible for maritime security , " jung said as he visited navy personnel on the frigate bayern , the lead vessel of the maritime taskforce .
german soldiers are also involved in training the lebanese navy .
controversial german deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung has vowed germany will stay put in lebanon for as long as it takes the deployment of the german navy in lebanon is significant because it marks the country 's first peacekeeping mission in the middle east since the end of world war ii .
the mission sparked much debate in germany last year after israel called on berlin to send soldiers to the region as part of a buffer force in south lebanon to police a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah and prevent further fighting . chancellor angela merkel 's government , however , ruled out sending any combat troops given germany 's sensitive historical relationship with israel .
at the time , merkel said there was no question of sending any ground troops to join un forces in lebanon due to the fear , as she put it , that germans could even " accidentally " aim their weapons at israelis .
" this mission comes in view of our special responsibility for israel , " said merkel in reference to the murder of around six million jews by the nazis .
germany currently has about 10,000 troops on foreign missions in the balkans , lebanon and afghanistan .
lebanon is the first leg of jung 's five-day tour of the middle east .
the minister is also to visit the united arab emirates , jordan and israel .
german-led push for mideast peace jung 's visit to the middle east is followed by a trip to the region by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to lay the groundwork for a us mideast conference planned for the end of november .
steinmeier 's trip to egypt , israel and the palestinian territories next week will build on the european union 's so-called middle east action plan , a german-led initiative to help further middle east peace by promoting small and medium-sized businesses in the palestinian territories and building up special economic zones .
the plan also aims to increase eu assistance in the training of palestinian police and judiciary as well as in the educational and civil service sectors with greater eu assistance focused on palestinian universities and students .
steinmeier said earlier this month the aim was to help wean palestinians off development aid by helping to strengthen their private sector .
the eu and its member states are estimated to have pumped in financial and humanitarian aid worth around 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.14 billion -rrb- in the region so far this year . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the mandate of the german army is closely linked to the progress of the peace process , he added .
germany heads the international un maritime force charged with patrolling the waters off lebanon to prevent weapons being smuggled to hezbollah guerrillas by sea .
the force was created in accordance with the un-brokered cease-fire that ended last year 's fighting between israel and hezbollah guerrillas .
germany is the main contributor with around 820 german soldiers stationed in the region .
in september , the german parliament extended the unifil mission by another year .
" unifil is a comprehensive mission which involves ground forces which are also helping the army but we germans are responsible for maritime security , " jung said as he visited navy personnel on the frigate bayern , the lead vessel of the maritime taskforce .
german soldiers are also involved in training the lebanese navy .
controversial german deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung has vowed germany will stay put in lebanon for as long as it takes the deployment of the german navy in lebanon is significant because it marks the country 's first peacekeeping mission in the middle east since the end of world war ii .
the mission sparked much debate in germany last year after israel called on berlin to send soldiers to the region as part of a buffer force in south lebanon to police a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah and prevent further fighting . chancellor angela merkel 's government , however , ruled out sending any combat troops given germany 's sensitive historical relationship with israel .
at the time , merkel said there was no question of sending any ground troops to join un forces in lebanon due to the fear , as she put it , that germans could even " accidentally " aim their weapons at israelis .
" this mission comes in view of our special responsibility for israel , " said merkel in reference to the murder of around six million jews by the nazis .
germany currently has about 10,000 troops on foreign missions in the balkans , lebanon and afghanistan .
lebanon is the first leg of jung 's five-day tour of the middle east .
the minister is also to visit the united arab emirates , jordan and israel .
german-led push for mideast peace jung 's visit to the middle east is followed by a trip to the region by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to lay the groundwork for a us mideast conference planned for the end of november .
steinmeier 's trip to egypt , israel and the palestinian territories next week will build on the european union 's so-called middle east action plan , a german-led initiative to help further middle east peace by promoting small and medium-sized businesses in the palestinian territories and building up special economic zones .
the plan also aims to increase eu assistance in the training of palestinian police and judiciary as well as in the educational and civil service sectors with greater eu assistance focused on palestinian universities and students .

29 , to reconsider plans to suspend compliance with a key 1990 arms control treaty , saying the move risked touching off a new arms race . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and his french counterpart , bernard kouchner , said all european states would lose out if russia went ahead with its plans to withdraw from the conventional forces in europe treaty -lrb- cfe -rrb- .
" the stated plan by russia to scrap its participation in the cfe treaty is a matter of concern for us , " the two wrote in a joint article published in germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and france 's le figaro .

the mandate of the german army is closely linked to the progress of the peace process , he added .
germany heads the international un maritime force charged with patrolling the waters off lebanon to prevent weapons being smuggled to hezbollah guerrillas by sea .
the force was created in accordance with the un-brokered cease-fire that ended last year 's fighting between israel and hezbollah guerrillas .
germany is the main contributor with around 820 german soldiers stationed in the region .
in september , the german parliament extended the unifil mission by another year .
" unifil is a comprehensive mission which involves ground forces which are also helping the army but we germans are responsible for maritime security , " jung said as he visited navy personnel on the frigate bayern , the lead vessel of the maritime taskforce .
german soldiers are also involved in training the lebanese navy .
controversial german deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung has vowed germany will stay put in lebanon for as long as it takes the deployment of the german navy in lebanon is significant because it marks the country 's first peacekeeping mission in the middle east since the end of world war ii .
the mission sparked much debate in germany last year after israel called on berlin to send soldiers to the region as part of a buffer force in south lebanon to police a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah and prevent further fighting . chancellor angela merkel 's government , however , ruled out sending any combat troops given germany 's sensitive historical relationship with israel .
at the time , merkel said there was no question of sending any ground troops to join un forces in lebanon due to the fear , as she put it , that germans could even " accidentally " aim their weapons at israelis .
" this mission comes in view of our special responsibility for israel , " said merkel in reference to the murder of around six million jews by the nazis .
germany currently has about 10,000 troops on foreign missions in the balkans , lebanon and afghanistan .
lebanon is the first leg of jung 's five-day tour of the middle east .
the minister is also to visit the united arab emirates , jordan and israel .
german-led push for mideast peace jung 's visit to the middle east is followed by a trip to the region by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to lay the groundwork for a us mideast conference planned for the end of november .
steinmeier 's trip to egypt , israel and the palestinian territories next week will build on the european union 's so-called middle east action plan , a german-led initiative to help further middle east peace by promoting small and medium-sized businesses in the palestinian territories and building up special economic zones .
the plan also aims to increase eu assistance in the training of palestinian police and judiciary as well as in the educational and civil service sectors with greater eu assistance focused on palestinian universities and students .
steinmeier said earlier this month the aim was to help wean palestinians off development aid by helping to strengthen their private sector .
the eu and its member states are estimated to have pumped in financial and humanitarian aid worth around 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.14 billion -rrb- in the region so far this year . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

police fear it was only the beginning . " the conflict in the border region to iraq has already spilled over to berlin , " claudia schmid , the berlin head of germany 's domestic intelligence service , the office to protect the constitution , told broadcaster rbb on monday .
the clashes took place in berlin 's kreuzberg district on sunday at the end of a demonstration by turkish nationalists with the slogan " unity and fraternity between turks and kurds . "
turks started to " hunt " kurds , according to germany 's police union dpoig .
only the force of a massive police presence had prevented people from using weapons , the dpoig said , according to the associated press .

the pkk has been waging a bloody campaign for self-rule in southeastern turkey since 1974 .
it took up arms in 1984 , aiming to create an ethnic homeland in the region .
more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict .

29 , to reconsider plans to suspend compliance with a key 1990 arms control treaty , saying the move risked touching off a new arms race . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and his french counterpart , bernard kouchner , said all european states would lose out if russia went ahead with its plans to withdraw from the conventional forces in europe treaty -lrb- cfe -rrb- .
" the stated plan by russia to scrap its participation in the cfe treaty is a matter of concern for us , " the two wrote in a joint article published in germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and france 's le figaro .
" an erosion of the cfe treaty could spark new arms races and create new conflicts . "
cfe exit linked to us missile shield plans the cfe treaty , signed in 1990 between the then-22 nato member states and the warsaw pact , limits the deployment and storage of military aircraft , tanks , artillery and other heavy non-nuclear weapons from russia 's ural mountains to the atlantic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin is playing hardball with the us in july of this year , russian president vladimir putin signed a decree pulling russia out of the treaty , considered a centerpiece of international disarmament efforts .
russian 's formal withdrawal will come into effect on december 12 .
us plans to station missile defense stations in poland and the czech republic are widely regarded as being the immediate trigger for moscow 's cfe withdrawal .
in 1999 , taking heed of the changes since the initial signing in 1991 , the treaty was adapted to accommodate post-cold war realities .
russia at the time pledged to withdraw troops and ammunition from the breakaway provinces of transnistria in moldova and south ossetia in georgia .
nato 's member states refuse to ratify the adapted treaty unless moscow fulfils the commitments , while russia resents this linkage .
ministers warn of new " cold war " on monday , steinmeier and kouchner called the cfe treaty an " anchor of stability " for european security .
" we appeal to the russian government to refrain from the planned suspension and to use the path of negotiation in order to protect its legitimate interests , " they wrote in the article .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner has joined steinmeier in urging russia to drop its treaty exit plans the two foreign ministers also warned of " the specter of a new cold war . "
" a relapse into old conflict patterns should be avoided .
that calls for flexibility on all sides , " they wrote .
russia has also been calling for changes to another landmark arms control treaty , the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty -lrb- inf -rrb- , signed by mikhail gorbachev and ronald reagan in 1987 , which bars both russia and the united states from deploying intermediate-range missiles .
russia says that leaves it unable to adequately protect itself from countries on its eastern and southern borders , including iran , india and pakistan , which have growing arsenals .
moscow has also called the inf treaty a cold war relic because it did not include countries outside of europe that have since built up their military weaponry . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 , which could mark the attempt at a new beginning ahead of elections in 2009 , says dw 's alexander kudascheff . the party conference took place at a difficult time for the spd .
in opinion polls , the social democrats languish at a depressing 25 percent , nearly a historic low .
at the same time , the party is beset by problems from all sides - the left party has successfully snatched away social democratic issues and voters because the necessary reform of germany 's social welfare state under chancellor gerhard schröder cost the spd its political credibility as a leftist , social power - even though the reforms were successful . the party is also squeezed by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , who have forgotten all their earlier market reform ambitions since they 've been in government and now behave more like social democrats than the spd itself .
over the last two years , that has plunged the spd into doubts and near resignation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburg party conference was meant to do one thing above all : to make a new beginning in order to gain self-confidence .
party chief kurt beck , who 's been in office for over a year and a half , was responsible for it .
he was considered a weak boss until just before hamburg , but at the conference he established himself as the absolute no. 1 .
he proved that he is both skilled in tactics and projecting power .
his public demeanor and elocution do n't shine , but they show him as a down-to-earth politician .
in any case , the party values his style . whether it has an impact on germany 's voters has yet to be seen .
moreover , the spd passed a new party program in which it defined itself as the largest , left-wing , mainstream party .
the social democrats profess the values of democratic socialism and want to make globalization humane and fair .
above all , they strive for a society in which everyone has the same opportunities for advancement - a downright classic social democratic idea .
the new program serves to boost self-affirmation within the party and it 's meant to sharpen its profile outside the party .
as a party , the spd also suffers from having to govern as part of a " grand coalition " in berlin .
it clearly suffers from the pragmatism of everyday politicis and its obvious inherent necessities .
nevertheless , in hamburg , the social democrats strongly backed the afghanistan policies of spd member and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
they even endorsed the us-led anti-terror mission , operation enduring freedom , which was not an easy step for a party with a peaceful tradition .
thus , they demonstrated an astonishing measure of foreign policy realism .
the spd showed itself in unity , with the internal strife between its opposing wings relegated to the past .
it rallied behind party chief beck .
with its party program , it gave itself a rather traditional left-wing profile - and bid farewell to all the new directions , and even the " neue mitte , " the new middle way , it had long courted .
the spd is prepared to take up the battle - against the left party and also against chancellor merkel , who has so far remained vague and noncommittal on domestic issues but has nevertheless basked in the glow of political success .
after the hamburg party conference , governing in the grand coalition is going to become more difficult - not when it comes to foreign policy , but when it comes to domestic issues .
the long campaign leading up to parliamentary elections in two years has begun .

at the same time , the party is beset by problems from all sides - the left party has successfully snatched away social democratic issues and voters because the necessary reform of germany 's social welfare state under chancellor gerhard schröder cost the spd its political credibility as a leftist , social power - even though the reforms were successful . the party is also squeezed by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , who have forgotten all their earlier market reform ambitions since they 've been in government and now behave more like social democrats than the spd itself .
over the last two years , that has plunged the spd into doubts and near resignation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburg party conference was meant to do one thing above all : to make a new beginning in order to gain self-confidence .
party chief kurt beck , who 's been in office for over a year and a half , was responsible for it .
he was considered a weak boss until just before hamburg , but at the conference he established himself as the absolute no. 1 .
he proved that he is both skilled in tactics and projecting power .
his public demeanor and elocution do n't shine , but they show him as a down-to-earth politician .
in any case , the party values his style . whether it has an impact on germany 's voters has yet to be seen .
moreover , the spd passed a new party program in which it defined itself as the largest , left-wing , mainstream party .
the social democrats profess the values of democratic socialism and want to make globalization humane and fair .
above all , they strive for a society in which everyone has the same opportunities for advancement - a downright classic social democratic idea .
the new program serves to boost self-affirmation within the party and it 's meant to sharpen its profile outside the party .
as a party , the spd also suffers from having to govern as part of a " grand coalition " in berlin .
it clearly suffers from the pragmatism of everyday politicis and its obvious inherent necessities .
nevertheless , in hamburg , the social democrats strongly backed the afghanistan policies of spd member and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
they even endorsed the us-led anti-terror mission , operation enduring freedom , which was not an easy step for a party with a peaceful tradition .
thus , they demonstrated an astonishing measure of foreign policy realism .
the spd showed itself in unity , with the internal strife between its opposing wings relegated to the past .
it rallied behind party chief beck .
with its party program , it gave itself a rather traditional left-wing profile - and bid farewell to all the new directions , and even the " neue mitte , " the new middle way , it had long courted .
the spd is prepared to take up the battle - against the left party and also against chancellor merkel , who has so far remained vague and noncommittal on domestic issues but has nevertheless basked in the glow of political success .
after the hamburg party conference , governing in the grand coalition is going to become more difficult - not when it comes to foreign policy , but when it comes to domestic issues .
the long campaign leading up to parliamentary elections in two years has begun .

29 , to reconsider plans to suspend compliance with a key 1990 arms control treaty , saying the move risked touching off a new arms race . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and his french counterpart , bernard kouchner , said all european states would lose out if russia went ahead with its plans to withdraw from the conventional forces in europe treaty -lrb- cfe -rrb- .
" the stated plan by russia to scrap its participation in the cfe treaty is a matter of concern for us , " the two wrote in a joint article published in germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and france 's le figaro .
" an erosion of the cfe treaty could spark new arms races and create new conflicts . "
cfe exit linked to us missile shield plans the cfe treaty , signed in 1990 between the then-22 nato member states and the warsaw pact , limits the deployment and storage of military aircraft , tanks , artillery and other heavy non-nuclear weapons from russia 's ural mountains to the atlantic .

russia says that leaves it unable to adequately protect itself from countries on its eastern and southern borders , including iran , india and pakistan , which have growing arsenals .

the agency is meant to become a stronger " service provider , " a spokesman said . " the service will undergo a thorough reform process , " said bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- spokesman stefan borchert on saturday , oct .
27 .
" antiquated and crusty structures will be broken up . " the aim was for the agency to become stronger as a " service provider " for the german government and parliament , borchert said , adding that berlin 's control over the agency was meant to be strengthened .
the reform of the bnd , which has 6,000 employees , is due to be completed by 2009 , the same year as germany 's next parliamentary elections , and three years before the agency is due to complete its move from pullach , near munich , to berlin .
" profound changes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bnd 's headquarters will soon be in the capital the service 's upper tiers are supposed to be trimmed down at the same time as its eight departments would grow to 12 .
a new " proliferation " department would deal with illegal weapons deals .
the wall between agents who collect information and those who analyze it was going to be broken down , borchert said , ensuring more transparency .
the bnd 's 50-year history is speckled with scandals , most recently for its agent 's questionable actions in afghanistan and for spying on journalists in germany , a practice that was only suspended in late 2005 .
the " self-protection " department , which did the spying , would only be responsible for protecting the service 's own agents after the reform , der spiegel newsmagazine reported .
borchert stressed that the reform plans were not the result of " alleged or real existing scandals . "
he said an overhaul had been under debate for a long time in order to prepare the bnd for " future challenges , " but that the events had made reform more urgent . bnd president ernst uhrlau had touted the reform in employee meetings in pullach and berlin as a profound change to the service .
high time , opposition says praise for the reform came from opposition politicians over the weekend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd chief uhrlau is prepared to break taboos " it was time for the consequences to be drawn from the apparent aberrations , " hans-christian ströbele , an opposition green party member of the parliamentary commission established to investigate the bnd 's activities in afghanistan , told the taz daily .
" thus the bnd leadership and the federal chancellery would be in a position to better control the agency .
the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party 's secret service expert expressed similar sentiments . " the federal government has recognized that it has to keep the bnd on a shorter leash , " max stadler , told ard television over the weekend .
" for that we also need better control by the parliament . " dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the agency is meant to become a stronger " service provider , " a spokesman said . " the service will undergo a thorough reform process , " said bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- spokesman stefan borchert on saturday , oct .
27 .
" antiquated and crusty structures will be broken up . " the aim was for the agency to become stronger as a " service provider " for the german government and parliament , borchert said , adding that berlin 's control over the agency was meant to be strengthened .
the reform of the bnd , which has 6,000 employees , is due to be completed by 2009 , the same year as germany 's next parliamentary elections , and three years before the agency is due to complete its move from pullach , near munich , to berlin .

the wall between agents who collect information and those who analyze it was going to be broken down , borchert said , ensuring more transparency .
the bnd 's 50-year history is speckled with scandals , most recently for its agent 's questionable actions in afghanistan and for spying on journalists in germany , a practice that was only suspended in late 2005 .
the " self-protection " department , which did the spying , would only be responsible for protecting the service 's own agents after the reform , der spiegel newsmagazine reported .
borchert stressed that the reform plans were not the result of " alleged or real existing scandals . "
he said an overhaul had been under debate for a long time in order to prepare the bnd for " future challenges , " but that the events had made reform more urgent . bnd president ernst uhrlau had touted the reform in employee meetings in pullach and berlin as a profound change to the service .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 29.10.2007 germany , france urge russia to rethink arms treaty exit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin has increased arms spending to restore russia 's military capability germany and france urged russia on monday , oct .
29 , to reconsider plans to suspend compliance with a key 1990 arms control treaty , saying the move risked touching off a new arms race . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and his french counterpart , bernard kouchner , said all european states would lose out if russia went ahead with its plans to withdraw from the conventional forces in europe treaty -lrb- cfe -rrb- .
" the stated plan by russia to scrap its participation in the cfe treaty is a matter of concern for us , " the two wrote in a joint article published in germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and france 's le figaro .
" an erosion of the cfe treaty could spark new arms races and create new conflicts . "
cfe exit linked to us missile shield plans the cfe treaty , signed in 1990 between the then-22 nato member states and the warsaw pact , limits the deployment and storage of military aircraft , tanks , artillery and other heavy non-nuclear weapons from russia 's ural mountains to the atlantic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin is playing hardball with the us in july of this year , russian president vladimir putin signed a decree pulling russia out of the treaty , considered a centerpiece of international disarmament efforts .
russian 's formal withdrawal will come into effect on december 12 .
us plans to station missile defense stations in poland and the czech republic are widely regarded as being the immediate trigger for moscow 's cfe withdrawal .
in 1999 , taking heed of the changes since the initial signing in 1991 , the treaty was adapted to accommodate post-cold war realities .
russia at the time pledged to withdraw troops and ammunition from the breakaway provinces of transnistria in moldova and south ossetia in georgia .
nato 's member states refuse to ratify the adapted treaty unless moscow fulfils the commitments , while russia resents this linkage .
ministers warn of new " cold war " on monday , steinmeier and kouchner called the cfe treaty an " anchor of stability " for european security .
" we appeal to the russian government to refrain from the planned suspension and to use the path of negotiation in order to protect its legitimate interests , " they wrote in the article .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner has joined steinmeier in urging russia to drop its treaty exit plans the two foreign ministers also warned of " the specter of a new cold war . "
" a relapse into old conflict patterns should be avoided .
that calls for flexibility on all sides , " they wrote .
russia has also been calling for changes to another landmark arms control treaty , the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty -lrb- inf -rrb- , signed by mikhail gorbachev and ronald reagan in 1987 , which bars both russia and the united states from deploying intermediate-range missiles .
russia says that leaves it unable to adequately protect itself from countries on its eastern and southern borders , including iran , india and pakistan , which have growing arsenals .
moscow has also called the inf treaty a cold war relic because it did not include countries outside of europe that have since built up their military weaponry . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the mandate of the german army is closely linked to the progress of the peace process , he added .
germany heads the international un maritime force charged with patrolling the waters off lebanon to prevent weapons being smuggled to hezbollah guerrillas by sea .
the force was created in accordance with the un-brokered cease-fire that ended last year 's fighting between israel and hezbollah guerrillas .
germany is the main contributor with around 820 german soldiers stationed in the region .
in september , the german parliament extended the unifil mission by another year .
" unifil is a comprehensive mission which involves ground forces which are also helping the army but we germans are responsible for maritime security , " jung said as he visited navy personnel on the frigate bayern , the lead vessel of the maritime taskforce .
german soldiers are also involved in training the lebanese navy .
controversial german deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung has vowed germany will stay put in lebanon for as long as it takes the deployment of the german navy in lebanon is significant because it marks the country 's first peacekeeping mission in the middle east since the end of world war ii .
the mission sparked much debate in germany last year after israel called on berlin to send soldiers to the region as part of a buffer force in south lebanon to police a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah and prevent further fighting . chancellor angela merkel 's government , however , ruled out sending any combat troops given germany 's sensitive historical relationship with israel .
at the time , merkel said there was no question of sending any ground troops to join un forces in lebanon due to the fear , as she put it , that germans could even " accidentally " aim their weapons at israelis .
" this mission comes in view of our special responsibility for israel , " said merkel in reference to the murder of around six million jews by the nazis .
germany currently has about 10,000 troops on foreign missions in the balkans , lebanon and afghanistan .
lebanon is the first leg of jung 's five-day tour of the middle east .
the minister is also to visit the united arab emirates , jordan and israel .
german-led push for mideast peace jung 's visit to the middle east is followed by a trip to the region by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to lay the groundwork for a us mideast conference planned for the end of november .
steinmeier 's trip to egypt , israel and the palestinian territories next week will build on the european union 's so-called middle east action plan , a german-led initiative to help further middle east peace by promoting small and medium-sized businesses in the palestinian territories and building up special economic zones .
the plan also aims to increase eu assistance in the training of palestinian police and judiciary as well as in the educational and civil service sectors with greater eu assistance focused on palestinian universities and students .
steinmeier said earlier this month the aim was to help wean palestinians off development aid by helping to strengthen their private sector .
the eu and its member states are estimated to have pumped in financial and humanitarian aid worth around 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.14 billion -rrb- in the region so far this year . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the mandate of the german army is closely linked to the progress of the peace process , he added .
germany heads the international un maritime force charged with patrolling the waters off lebanon to prevent weapons being smuggled to hezbollah guerrillas by sea .
the force was created in accordance with the un-brokered cease-fire that ended last year 's fighting between israel and hezbollah guerrillas .
germany is the main contributor with around 820 german soldiers stationed in the region .
in september , the german parliament extended the unifil mission by another year .
" unifil is a comprehensive mission which involves ground forces which are also helping the army but we germans are responsible for maritime security , " jung said as he visited navy personnel on the frigate bayern , the lead vessel of the maritime taskforce .
german soldiers are also involved in training the lebanese navy .
controversial german deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung has vowed germany will stay put in lebanon for as long as it takes the deployment of the german navy in lebanon is significant because it marks the country 's first peacekeeping mission in the middle east since the end of world war ii .
the mission sparked much debate in germany last year after israel called on berlin to send soldiers to the region as part of a buffer force in south lebanon to police a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah and prevent further fighting . chancellor angela merkel 's government , however , ruled out sending any combat troops given germany 's sensitive historical relationship with israel .
at the time , merkel said there was no question of sending any ground troops to join un forces in lebanon due to the fear , as she put it , that germans could even " accidentally " aim their weapons at israelis .
" this mission comes in view of our special responsibility for israel , " said merkel in reference to the murder of around six million jews by the nazis .
germany currently has about 10,000 troops on foreign missions in the balkans , lebanon and afghanistan .
lebanon is the first leg of jung 's five-day tour of the middle east .
the minister is also to visit the united arab emirates , jordan and israel .
german-led push for mideast peace jung 's visit to the middle east is followed by a trip to the region by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to lay the groundwork for a us mideast conference planned for the end of november .
steinmeier 's trip to egypt , israel and the palestinian territories next week will build on the european union 's so-called middle east action plan , a german-led initiative to help further middle east peace by promoting small and medium-sized businesses in the palestinian territories and building up special economic zones .
the plan also aims to increase eu assistance in the training of palestinian police and judiciary as well as in the educational and civil service sectors with greater eu assistance focused on palestinian universities and students .
steinmeier said earlier this month the aim was to help wean palestinians off development aid by helping to strengthen their private sector .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.10.2007 opinion : germany 's social democrats venture a new beginning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's social democrats wrapped up a major party conference on sunday , oct .
28 , which could mark the attempt at a new beginning ahead of elections in 2009 , says dw 's alexander kudascheff . the party conference took place at a difficult time for the spd .
in opinion polls , the social democrats languish at a depressing 25 percent , nearly a historic low .
at the same time , the party is beset by problems from all sides - the left party has successfully snatched away social democratic issues and voters because the necessary reform of germany 's social welfare state under chancellor gerhard schröder cost the spd its political credibility as a leftist , social power - even though the reforms were successful . the party is also squeezed by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , who have forgotten all their earlier market reform ambitions since they 've been in government and now behave more like social democrats than the spd itself .
over the last two years , that has plunged the spd into doubts and near resignation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburg party conference was meant to do one thing above all : to make a new beginning in order to gain self-confidence .
party chief kurt beck , who 's been in office for over a year and a half , was responsible for it .
he was considered a weak boss until just before hamburg , but at the conference he established himself as the absolute no. 1 .
he proved that he is both skilled in tactics and projecting power .
his public demeanor and elocution do n't shine , but they show him as a down-to-earth politician .
in any case , the party values his style . whether it has an impact on germany 's voters has yet to be seen .
moreover , the spd passed a new party program in which it defined itself as the largest , left-wing , mainstream party .
the social democrats profess the values of democratic socialism and want to make globalization humane and fair .
above all , they strive for a society in which everyone has the same opportunities for advancement - a downright classic social democratic idea .
the new program serves to boost self-affirmation within the party and it 's meant to sharpen its profile outside the party .
as a party , the spd also suffers from having to govern as part of a " grand coalition " in berlin .
it clearly suffers from the pragmatism of everyday politicis and its obvious inherent necessities .
nevertheless , in hamburg , the social democrats strongly backed the afghanistan policies of spd member and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
they even endorsed the us-led anti-terror mission , operation enduring freedom , which was not an easy step for a party with a peaceful tradition .
thus , they demonstrated an astonishing measure of foreign policy realism .
the spd showed itself in unity , with the internal strife between its opposing wings relegated to the past .
it rallied behind party chief beck .
with its party program , it gave itself a rather traditional left-wing profile - and bid farewell to all the new directions , and even the " neue mitte , " the new middle way , it had long courted .
the spd is prepared to take up the battle - against the left party and also against chancellor merkel , who has so far remained vague and noncommittal on domestic issues but has nevertheless basked in the glow of political success .
after the hamburg party conference , governing in the grand coalition is going to become more difficult - not when it comes to foreign policy , but when it comes to domestic issues .
the long campaign leading up to parliamentary elections in two years has begun .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 29.10.2007 opinion : germany 's social democrats venture a new beginning großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's social democrats wrapped up a major party conference on sunday , oct .
28 , which could mark the attempt at a new beginning ahead of elections in 2009 , says dw 's alexander kudascheff . the party conference took place at a difficult time for the spd .
in opinion polls , the social democrats languish at a depressing 25 percent , nearly a historic low .
at the same time , the party is beset by problems from all sides - the left party has successfully snatched away social democratic issues and voters because the necessary reform of germany 's social welfare state under chancellor gerhard schröder cost the spd its political credibility as a leftist , social power - even though the reforms were successful . the party is also squeezed by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , who have forgotten all their earlier market reform ambitions since they 've been in government and now behave more like social democrats than the spd itself .
over the last two years , that has plunged the spd into doubts and near resignation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburg party conference was meant to do one thing above all : to make a new beginning in order to gain self-confidence .
party chief kurt beck , who 's been in office for over a year and a half , was responsible for it .
he was considered a weak boss until just before hamburg , but at the conference he established himself as the absolute no. 1 .
he proved that he is both skilled in tactics and projecting power .
his public demeanor and elocution do n't shine , but they show him as a down-to-earth politician .
in any case , the party values his style . whether it has an impact on germany 's voters has yet to be seen .
moreover , the spd passed a new party program in which it defined itself as the largest , left-wing , mainstream party .
the social democrats profess the values of democratic socialism and want to make globalization humane and fair .
above all , they strive for a society in which everyone has the same opportunities for advancement - a downright classic social democratic idea .
the new program serves to boost self-affirmation within the party and it 's meant to sharpen its profile outside the party .
as a party , the spd also suffers from having to govern as part of a " grand coalition " in berlin .
it clearly suffers from the pragmatism of everyday politicis and its obvious inherent necessities .
nevertheless , in hamburg , the social democrats strongly backed the afghanistan policies of spd member and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
they even endorsed the us-led anti-terror mission , operation enduring freedom , which was not an easy step for a party with a peaceful tradition .
thus , they demonstrated an astonishing measure of foreign policy realism .
the spd showed itself in unity , with the internal strife between its opposing wings relegated to the past .
it rallied behind party chief beck .
with its party program , it gave itself a rather traditional left-wing profile - and bid farewell to all the new directions , and even the " neue mitte , " the new middle way , it had long courted .
the spd is prepared to take up the battle - against the left party and also against chancellor merkel , who has so far remained vague and noncommittal on domestic issues but has nevertheless basked in the glow of political success .
after the hamburg party conference , governing in the grand coalition is going to become more difficult - not when it comes to foreign policy , but when it comes to domestic issues .
the long campaign leading up to parliamentary elections in two years has begun .

29 , to reconsider plans to suspend compliance with a key 1990 arms control treaty , saying the move risked touching off a new arms race . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and his french counterpart , bernard kouchner , said all european states would lose out if russia went ahead with its plans to withdraw from the conventional forces in europe treaty -lrb- cfe -rrb- .
" the stated plan by russia to scrap its participation in the cfe treaty is a matter of concern for us , " the two wrote in a joint article published in germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and france 's le figaro .
" an erosion of the cfe treaty could spark new arms races and create new conflicts . "
cfe exit linked to us missile shield plans the cfe treaty , signed in 1990 between the then-22 nato member states and the warsaw pact , limits the deployment and storage of military aircraft , tanks , artillery and other heavy non-nuclear weapons from russia 's ural mountains to the atlantic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin is playing hardball with the us in july of this year , russian president vladimir putin signed a decree pulling russia out of the treaty , considered a centerpiece of international disarmament efforts .
russian 's formal withdrawal will come into effect on december 12 .
us plans to station missile defense stations in poland and the czech republic are widely regarded as being the immediate trigger for moscow 's cfe withdrawal .
in 1999 , taking heed of the changes since the initial signing in 1991 , the treaty was adapted to accommodate post-cold war realities .
russia at the time pledged to withdraw troops and ammunition from the breakaway provinces of transnistria in moldova and south ossetia in georgia .
nato 's member states refuse to ratify the adapted treaty unless moscow fulfils the commitments , while russia resents this linkage .
ministers warn of new " cold war " on monday , steinmeier and kouchner called the cfe treaty an " anchor of stability " for european security .
" we appeal to the russian government to refrain from the planned suspension and to use the path of negotiation in order to protect its legitimate interests , " they wrote in the article .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner has joined steinmeier in urging russia to drop its treaty exit plans the two foreign ministers also warned of " the specter of a new cold war . "
" a relapse into old conflict patterns should be avoided .
that calls for flexibility on all sides , " they wrote .
russia has also been calling for changes to another landmark arms control treaty , the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty -lrb- inf -rrb- , signed by mikhail gorbachev and ronald reagan in 1987 , which bars both russia and the united states from deploying intermediate-range missiles .
russia says that leaves it unable to adequately protect itself from countries on its eastern and southern borders , including iran , india and pakistan , which have growing arsenals .
moscow has also called the inf treaty a cold war relic because it did not include countries outside of europe that have since built up their military weaponry . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the agency is meant to become a stronger " service provider , " a spokesman said . " the service will undergo a thorough reform process , " said bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- spokesman stefan borchert on saturday , oct .
27 .
" antiquated and crusty structures will be broken up . " the aim was for the agency to become stronger as a " service provider " for the german government and parliament , borchert said , adding that berlin 's control over the agency was meant to be strengthened .
the reform of the bnd , which has 6,000 employees , is due to be completed by 2009 , the same year as germany 's next parliamentary elections , and three years before the agency is due to complete its move from pullach , near munich , to berlin .
" profound changes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bnd 's headquarters will soon be in the capital the service 's upper tiers are supposed to be trimmed down at the same time as its eight departments would grow to 12 .
a new " proliferation " department would deal with illegal weapons deals .
the wall between agents who collect information and those who analyze it was going to be broken down , borchert said , ensuring more transparency .
the bnd 's 50-year history is speckled with scandals , most recently for its agent 's questionable actions in afghanistan and for spying on journalists in germany , a practice that was only suspended in late 2005 .
the " self-protection " department , which did the spying , would only be responsible for protecting the service 's own agents after the reform , der spiegel newsmagazine reported .
borchert stressed that the reform plans were not the result of " alleged or real existing scandals . "
he said an overhaul had been under debate for a long time in order to prepare the bnd for " future challenges , " but that the events had made reform more urgent . bnd president ernst uhrlau had touted the reform in employee meetings in pullach and berlin as a profound change to the service .
high time , opposition says praise for the reform came from opposition politicians over the weekend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd chief uhrlau is prepared to break taboos " it was time for the consequences to be drawn from the apparent aberrations , " hans-christian ströbele , an opposition green party member of the parliamentary commission established to investigate the bnd 's activities in afghanistan , told the taz daily .
" thus the bnd leadership and the federal chancellery would be in a position to better control the agency .
the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party 's secret service expert expressed similar sentiments . " the federal government has recognized that it has to keep the bnd on a shorter leash , " max stadler , told ard television over the weekend .
" for that we also need better control by the parliament . " dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

28 , which could mark the attempt at a new beginning ahead of elections in 2009 , says dw 's alexander kudascheff . the party conference took place at a difficult time for the spd .
in opinion polls , the social democrats languish at a depressing 25 percent , nearly a historic low .
at the same time , the party is beset by problems from all sides - the left party has successfully snatched away social democratic issues and voters because the necessary reform of germany 's social welfare state under chancellor gerhard schröder cost the spd its political credibility as a leftist , social power - even though the reforms were successful . the party is also squeezed by chancellor angela merkel 's christian democrats , who have forgotten all their earlier market reform ambitions since they 've been in government and now behave more like social democrats than the spd itself .
over the last two years , that has plunged the spd into doubts and near resignation .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the hamburg party conference was meant to do one thing above all : to make a new beginning in order to gain self-confidence .
party chief kurt beck , who 's been in office for over a year and a half , was responsible for it .
he was considered a weak boss until just before hamburg , but at the conference he established himself as the absolute no. 1 .
he proved that he is both skilled in tactics and projecting power .
his public demeanor and elocution do n't shine , but they show him as a down-to-earth politician .
in any case , the party values his style . whether it has an impact on germany 's voters has yet to be seen .
moreover , the spd passed a new party program in which it defined itself as the largest , left-wing , mainstream party .
the social democrats profess the values of democratic socialism and want to make globalization humane and fair .
above all , they strive for a society in which everyone has the same opportunities for advancement - a downright classic social democratic idea .
the new program serves to boost self-affirmation within the party and it 's meant to sharpen its profile outside the party .
as a party , the spd also suffers from having to govern as part of a " grand coalition " in berlin .
it clearly suffers from the pragmatism of everyday politicis and its obvious inherent necessities .
nevertheless , in hamburg , the social democrats strongly backed the afghanistan policies of spd member and german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier .
they even endorsed the us-led anti-terror mission , operation enduring freedom , which was not an easy step for a party with a peaceful tradition .
thus , they demonstrated an astonishing measure of foreign policy realism .
the spd showed itself in unity , with the internal strife between its opposing wings relegated to the past .
it rallied behind party chief beck .
with its party program , it gave itself a rather traditional left-wing profile - and bid farewell to all the new directions , and even the " neue mitte , " the new middle way , it had long courted .
the spd is prepared to take up the battle - against the left party and also against chancellor merkel , who has so far remained vague and noncommittal on domestic issues but has nevertheless basked in the glow of political success .
after the hamburg party conference , governing in the grand coalition is going to become more difficult - not when it comes to foreign policy , but when it comes to domestic issues .
the long campaign leading up to parliamentary elections in two years has begun .

29 , promising to reverse her government 's china-centric asia policy and expand business and political ties with delhi . india may have increasingly been on the radar of successive german governments in recent years , but it 's been a mere blip compared to china 's overpowering presence . that is likely to change as german chancellor angela merkel heads to delhi and mumbai on her first official visit . last week , members of merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- called for a shift in focus of the government 's asia policy , saying there had been an overemphasis on china at the expense of other rising asian economies . berlin 's relationship with beijing is currently strained after china objected to a meeting between merkel and the exiled tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama in september . " many chances in a democracy like india " germany 's policy towards asia has so far " been too narrowly focused on economic issues and china , " said eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for the cdu 's parliamentary group , last week in the bundestag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party has stressed india 's democratic credentials cdu deputies outlined plans to make relations with asia a cornerstone of germany 's foreign and security policy in order to ensure that the region 's growing economic and political clout does not lead to a decline in german influence .
the plan calls for an asia policy increasingly based on western values and urges germany to close ranks with other democratic asian nations such as india , japan and south korea . merkel signaled last week she is prepared to reverse her predecessor gerhard schröder 's policy on asia .
he was criticized for an overt emphasis on cultivating business ties with china and turning a blind eye to its human right violations , and try to expand business and political relations with india . " we have to act relatively quickly , " merkel said .
" as europeans , we have many chances in a democratic country like india .
we just have to get involved . " business , trade ties gather steam experts admit that germany has been slow to wake up to the opportunities that india , a country of 1.1 billion people with rapid growth rates of around 9 percent a year , has to offer . " the rise of india has come as a surprise to germany , " said joachim beck from the institute for asian studies at the german institute of global and area studies .
" it has been so accustomed to seeing india as poor , as an unstable , multifaceted country .
the german government never thought india could become a world power in economic and political terms . " in recent years , berlin has moved to correct its relative neglect of the rising south asian power by pursuing bilateral business and trade with delhi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with singh at the hanover trade fair last year india is now germany 's fourth largest trading partner in asia - after china , japan and south korea .
bilateral trade stands at roughly 10.6 billion euros with german exports to india last year surging by more than 50 percent .
germany is the fourth largest investor in india and newly-confident indian companies are also increasingly making acquisitions in europe 's largest economy . last year 's focus on india at the hanover trade fair as well as the frankfurt book fair helped in filling the gaps in germany 's image of the asian nation .
merkel also enjoys good personal relations with her indian counterpart , prime minister manmohan singh . climate change talks not easy despite those improvements , merkel 's visit , which includes economic cooperation , but also climate change and the region 's fraught politics , is not expected to be entirely smooth . on the business front , merkel 's job will be clear cut - seeking ways to tap what experts say are vast unexplored opportunities in energy and infrastructure among other sectors .
a high-profile business delegation accompanying merkel is expected to use the chancellor 's visit to pressure delhi to tackle familiar problems of overregulation , red tape , corruption , crumbling infrastructure and an unreliable energy supply . politically however , merkel will face complicated talks with singh , particularly on climate change .
merkel who has taken the lead on tackling the issue in europe , clinched a deal to halve greenhouse gases at the g8 summit in germany earlier this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india emits 4.2 percent of the world 's co2 emissions - germany 's emits 3.2 percent india , like other developing nations , is vehemently opposed to capping greenhouse gas emissions , saying it will not compromise its continued 9 percent economic growth to arrest global warming .
it argues it is historical polluters in the industrialized west who must bear the brunt of emission cuts . merkel has welcomed a proposal by indian leader singh for an alternative plan that foresees linking caps on carbon dioxide emissions to the population of a country .
but , india has since held back on elaborating on the plan , underscoring the divide facing developed and developing nations when they meet in december in bali , indonesia to begin negotiations on a new climate change agreement to replace the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 . bernhard steinrücke , head of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai suggested in an interview with deutsche welle that germany should focus instead on what it can offer the indians in the fight against climate change . " compared to germany , the degree of pollution in india is still very low per capita , " steinrücke said .
" german companies have a lot to offer indians in terms of renewable energy , clean coal technology and energy efficiency know-how . " " room for germany as an honest broker " merkel will also need to tread carefully on issues such as the conflict in kashmir and india 's relations with neighboring pakistan , both nuclear powers .
delhi is opposed to critical questions on the topics which it views as international meddling in its internal affairs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india does n't take kindly to international criticism of the kashmir conflict other delicate political topics on the agenda include stalled talks on un reforms and a common desire in delhi and berlin for a permanent seat at the un security council , tough german visa procedures for indian business leaders and a controversial deal on civilian nuclear cooperation between india and the us . given that the indo-us nuclear deal might not materialize in the face of stiff opposition by india 's communist parties , the cdu 's von klaeden hopes there might yet be room for berlin to gain some political clout in the region . " the indians are too clever to only bind themselves to one partner , " von klaeden told the rheinischer merkur newspaper last week .

the mandate of the german army is closely linked to the progress of the peace process , he added .
germany heads the international un maritime force charged with patrolling the waters off lebanon to prevent weapons being smuggled to hezbollah guerrillas by sea .
the force was created in accordance with the un-brokered cease-fire that ended last year 's fighting between israel and hezbollah guerrillas .
germany is the main contributor with around 820 german soldiers stationed in the region .
in september , the german parliament extended the unifil mission by another year .
" unifil is a comprehensive mission which involves ground forces which are also helping the army but we germans are responsible for maritime security , " jung said as he visited navy personnel on the frigate bayern , the lead vessel of the maritime taskforce .
german soldiers are also involved in training the lebanese navy .
controversial german deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung has vowed germany will stay put in lebanon for as long as it takes the deployment of the german navy in lebanon is significant because it marks the country 's first peacekeeping mission in the middle east since the end of world war ii .
the mission sparked much debate in germany last year after israel called on berlin to send soldiers to the region as part of a buffer force in south lebanon to police a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah and prevent further fighting . chancellor angela merkel 's government , however , ruled out sending any combat troops given germany 's sensitive historical relationship with israel .
at the time , merkel said there was no question of sending any ground troops to join un forces in lebanon due to the fear , as she put it , that germans could even " accidentally " aim their weapons at israelis .
" this mission comes in view of our special responsibility for israel , " said merkel in reference to the murder of around six million jews by the nazis .
germany currently has about 10,000 troops on foreign missions in the balkans , lebanon and afghanistan .
lebanon is the first leg of jung 's five-day tour of the middle east .
the minister is also to visit the united arab emirates , jordan and israel .
german-led push for mideast peace jung 's visit to the middle east is followed by a trip to the region by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to lay the groundwork for a us mideast conference planned for the end of november .
steinmeier 's trip to egypt , israel and the palestinian territories next week will build on the european union 's so-called middle east action plan , a german-led initiative to help further middle east peace by promoting small and medium-sized businesses in the palestinian territories and building up special economic zones .
the plan also aims to increase eu assistance in the training of palestinian police and judiciary as well as in the educational and civil service sectors with greater eu assistance focused on palestinian universities and students .
steinmeier said earlier this month the aim was to help wean palestinians off development aid by helping to strengthen their private sector .

the agency is meant to become a stronger " service provider , " a spokesman said . " the service will undergo a thorough reform process , " said bundesnachrichtendienst -lrb- bnd -rrb- spokesman stefan borchert on saturday , oct .
27 .
" antiquated and crusty structures will be broken up . " the aim was for the agency to become stronger as a " service provider " for the german government and parliament , borchert said , adding that berlin 's control over the agency was meant to be strengthened .
the reform of the bnd , which has 6,000 employees , is due to be completed by 2009 , the same year as germany 's next parliamentary elections , and three years before the agency is due to complete its move from pullach , near munich , to berlin .
" profound changes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bnd 's headquarters will soon be in the capital the service 's upper tiers are supposed to be trimmed down at the same time as its eight departments would grow to 12 .
a new " proliferation " department would deal with illegal weapons deals .
the wall between agents who collect information and those who analyze it was going to be broken down , borchert said , ensuring more transparency .
the bnd 's 50-year history is speckled with scandals , most recently for its agent 's questionable actions in afghanistan and for spying on journalists in germany , a practice that was only suspended in late 2005 .
the " self-protection " department , which did the spying , would only be responsible for protecting the service 's own agents after the reform , der spiegel newsmagazine reported .
borchert stressed that the reform plans were not the result of " alleged or real existing scandals . "
he said an overhaul had been under debate for a long time in order to prepare the bnd for " future challenges , " but that the events had made reform more urgent . bnd president ernst uhrlau had touted the reform in employee meetings in pullach and berlin as a profound change to the service .
high time , opposition says praise for the reform came from opposition politicians over the weekend . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bnd chief uhrlau is prepared to break taboos " it was time for the consequences to be drawn from the apparent aberrations , " hans-christian ströbele , an opposition green party member of the parliamentary commission established to investigate the bnd 's activities in afghanistan , told the taz daily .
" thus the bnd leadership and the federal chancellery would be in a position to better control the agency .
the opposition free-market liberal free democratic party 's secret service expert expressed similar sentiments . " the federal government has recognized that it has to keep the bnd on a shorter leash , " max stadler , told ard television over the weekend .
" for that we also need better control by the parliament . " dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

29 , to reconsider plans to suspend compliance with a key 1990 arms control treaty , saying the move risked touching off a new arms race . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and his french counterpart , bernard kouchner , said all european states would lose out if russia went ahead with its plans to withdraw from the conventional forces in europe treaty -lrb- cfe -rrb- .
" the stated plan by russia to scrap its participation in the cfe treaty is a matter of concern for us , " the two wrote in a joint article published in germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and france 's le figaro .
" an erosion of the cfe treaty could spark new arms races and create new conflicts . "
cfe exit linked to us missile shield plans the cfe treaty , signed in 1990 between the then-22 nato member states and the warsaw pact , limits the deployment and storage of military aircraft , tanks , artillery and other heavy non-nuclear weapons from russia 's ural mountains to the atlantic .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin is playing hardball with the us in july of this year , russian president vladimir putin signed a decree pulling russia out of the treaty , considered a centerpiece of international disarmament efforts .
russian 's formal withdrawal will come into effect on december 12 .
us plans to station missile defense stations in poland and the czech republic are widely regarded as being the immediate trigger for moscow 's cfe withdrawal .
in 1999 , taking heed of the changes since the initial signing in 1991 , the treaty was adapted to accommodate post-cold war realities .
russia at the time pledged to withdraw troops and ammunition from the breakaway provinces of transnistria in moldova and south ossetia in georgia .
nato 's member states refuse to ratify the adapted treaty unless moscow fulfils the commitments , while russia resents this linkage .
ministers warn of new " cold war " on monday , steinmeier and kouchner called the cfe treaty an " anchor of stability " for european security .
" we appeal to the russian government to refrain from the planned suspension and to use the path of negotiation in order to protect its legitimate interests , " they wrote in the article .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner has joined steinmeier in urging russia to drop its treaty exit plans the two foreign ministers also warned of " the specter of a new cold war . "
" a relapse into old conflict patterns should be avoided .
that calls for flexibility on all sides , " they wrote .
russia has also been calling for changes to another landmark arms control treaty , the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty -lrb- inf -rrb- , signed by mikhail gorbachev and ronald reagan in 1987 , which bars both russia and the united states from deploying intermediate-range missiles .
russia says that leaves it unable to adequately protect itself from countries on its eastern and southern borders , including iran , india and pakistan , which have growing arsenals .
moscow has also called the inf treaty a cold war relic because it did not include countries outside of europe that have since built up their military weaponry . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

29 , to reconsider plans to suspend compliance with a key 1990 arms control treaty , saying the move risked touching off a new arms race . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and his french counterpart , bernard kouchner , said all european states would lose out if russia went ahead with its plans to withdraw from the conventional forces in europe treaty -lrb- cfe -rrb- .
" the stated plan by russia to scrap its participation in the cfe treaty is a matter of concern for us , " the two wrote in a joint article published in germany 's frankfurter allgemeine zeitung and france 's le figaro .
" an erosion of the cfe treaty could spark new arms races and create new conflicts . "
cfe exit linked to us missile shield plans the cfe treaty , signed in 1990 between the then-22 nato member states and the warsaw pact , limits the deployment and storage of military aircraft , tanks , artillery and other heavy non-nuclear weapons from russia 's ural mountains to the atlantic .

russian 's formal withdrawal will come into effect on december 12 .
us plans to station missile defense stations in poland and the czech republic are widely regarded as being the immediate trigger for moscow 's cfe withdrawal .
in 1999 , taking heed of the changes since the initial signing in 1991 , the treaty was adapted to accommodate post-cold war realities .
russia at the time pledged to withdraw troops and ammunition from the breakaway provinces of transnistria in moldova and south ossetia in georgia .
nato 's member states refuse to ratify the adapted treaty unless moscow fulfils the commitments , while russia resents this linkage .
ministers warn of new " cold war " on monday , steinmeier and kouchner called the cfe treaty an " anchor of stability " for european security .
" we appeal to the russian government to refrain from the planned suspension and to use the path of negotiation in order to protect its legitimate interests , " they wrote in the article .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner has joined steinmeier in urging russia to drop its treaty exit plans the two foreign ministers also warned of " the specter of a new cold war . "
" a relapse into old conflict patterns should be avoided .

russia has also been calling for changes to another landmark arms control treaty , the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty -lrb- inf -rrb- , signed by mikhail gorbachev and ronald reagan in 1987 , which bars both russia and the united states from deploying intermediate-range missiles .
russia says that leaves it unable to adequately protect itself from countries on its eastern and southern borders , including iran , india and pakistan , which have growing arsenals .

the mandate of the german army is closely linked to the progress of the peace process , he added .
germany heads the international un maritime force charged with patrolling the waters off lebanon to prevent weapons being smuggled to hezbollah guerrillas by sea .
the force was created in accordance with the un-brokered cease-fire that ended last year 's fighting between israel and hezbollah guerrillas .
germany is the main contributor with around 820 german soldiers stationed in the region .
in september , the german parliament extended the unifil mission by another year .
" unifil is a comprehensive mission which involves ground forces which are also helping the army but we germans are responsible for maritime security , " jung said as he visited navy personnel on the frigate bayern , the lead vessel of the maritime taskforce .
german soldiers are also involved in training the lebanese navy .
controversial german deployment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jung has vowed germany will stay put in lebanon for as long as it takes the deployment of the german navy in lebanon is significant because it marks the country 's first peacekeeping mission in the middle east since the end of world war ii .
the mission sparked much debate in germany last year after israel called on berlin to send soldiers to the region as part of a buffer force in south lebanon to police a ceasefire between israel and hezbollah and prevent further fighting . chancellor angela merkel 's government , however , ruled out sending any combat troops given germany 's sensitive historical relationship with israel .
at the time , merkel said there was no question of sending any ground troops to join un forces in lebanon due to the fear , as she put it , that germans could even " accidentally " aim their weapons at israelis .
" this mission comes in view of our special responsibility for israel , " said merkel in reference to the murder of around six million jews by the nazis .
germany currently has about 10,000 troops on foreign missions in the balkans , lebanon and afghanistan .
lebanon is the first leg of jung 's five-day tour of the middle east .
the minister is also to visit the united arab emirates , jordan and israel .
german-led push for mideast peace jung 's visit to the middle east is followed by a trip to the region by german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier to lay the groundwork for a us mideast conference planned for the end of november .
steinmeier 's trip to egypt , israel and the palestinian territories next week will build on the european union 's so-called middle east action plan , a german-led initiative to help further middle east peace by promoting small and medium-sized businesses in the palestinian territories and building up special economic zones .
the plan also aims to increase eu assistance in the training of palestinian police and judiciary as well as in the educational and civil service sectors with greater eu assistance focused on palestinian universities and students .
steinmeier said earlier this month the aim was to help wean palestinians off development aid by helping to strengthen their private sector .
the eu and its member states are estimated to have pumped in financial and humanitarian aid worth around 800 million euros -lrb- $ 1.14 billion -rrb- in the region so far this year . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

29 , promising to reverse her government 's china-centric asia policy and expand business and political ties with delhi . india may have increasingly been on the radar of successive german governments in recent years , but it 's been a mere blip compared to china 's overpowering presence . that is likely to change as german chancellor angela merkel heads to delhi and mumbai on her first official visit . last week , members of merkel 's center-right christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- called for a shift in focus of the government 's asia policy , saying there had been an overemphasis on china at the expense of other rising asian economies . berlin 's relationship with beijing is currently strained after china objected to a meeting between merkel and the exiled tibetan spiritual leader , the dalai lama in september . " many chances in a democracy like india " germany 's policy towards asia has so far " been too narrowly focused on economic issues and china , " said eckart von klaeden , foreign policy spokesman for the cdu 's parliamentary group , last week in the bundestag . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's party has stressed india 's democratic credentials cdu deputies outlined plans to make relations with asia a cornerstone of germany 's foreign and security policy in order to ensure that the region 's growing economic and political clout does not lead to a decline in german influence .
the plan calls for an asia policy increasingly based on western values and urges germany to close ranks with other democratic asian nations such as india , japan and south korea . merkel signaled last week she is prepared to reverse her predecessor gerhard schröder 's policy on asia .
he was criticized for an overt emphasis on cultivating business ties with china and turning a blind eye to its human right violations , and try to expand business and political relations with india . " we have to act relatively quickly , " merkel said .
" as europeans , we have many chances in a democratic country like india .
we just have to get involved . " business , trade ties gather steam experts admit that germany has been slow to wake up to the opportunities that india , a country of 1.1 billion people with rapid growth rates of around 9 percent a year , has to offer . " the rise of india has come as a surprise to germany , " said joachim beck from the institute for asian studies at the german institute of global and area studies .
" it has been so accustomed to seeing india as poor , as an unstable , multifaceted country .
the german government never thought india could become a world power in economic and political terms . " in recent years , berlin has moved to correct its relative neglect of the rising south asian power by pursuing bilateral business and trade with delhi . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel with singh at the hanover trade fair last year india is now germany 's fourth largest trading partner in asia - after china , japan and south korea .
bilateral trade stands at roughly 10.6 billion euros with german exports to india last year surging by more than 50 percent .
germany is the fourth largest investor in india and newly-confident indian companies are also increasingly making acquisitions in europe 's largest economy . last year 's focus on india at the hanover trade fair as well as the frankfurt book fair helped in filling the gaps in germany 's image of the asian nation .
merkel also enjoys good personal relations with her indian counterpart , prime minister manmohan singh . climate change talks not easy despite those improvements , merkel 's visit , which includes economic cooperation , but also climate change and the region 's fraught politics , is not expected to be entirely smooth . on the business front , merkel 's job will be clear cut - seeking ways to tap what experts say are vast unexplored opportunities in energy and infrastructure among other sectors .
a high-profile business delegation accompanying merkel is expected to use the chancellor 's visit to pressure delhi to tackle familiar problems of overregulation , red tape , corruption , crumbling infrastructure and an unreliable energy supply . politically however , merkel will face complicated talks with singh , particularly on climate change .
merkel who has taken the lead on tackling the issue in europe , clinched a deal to halve greenhouse gases at the g8 summit in germany earlier this year . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india emits 4.2 percent of the world 's co2 emissions - germany 's emits 3.2 percent india , like other developing nations , is vehemently opposed to capping greenhouse gas emissions , saying it will not compromise its continued 9 percent economic growth to arrest global warming .
it argues it is historical polluters in the industrialized west who must bear the brunt of emission cuts . merkel has welcomed a proposal by indian leader singh for an alternative plan that foresees linking caps on carbon dioxide emissions to the population of a country .
but , india has since held back on elaborating on the plan , underscoring the divide facing developed and developing nations when they meet in december in bali , indonesia to begin negotiations on a new climate change agreement to replace the kyoto protocol which expires in 2012 . bernhard steinrücke , head of the indo-german chamber of commerce in mumbai suggested in an interview with deutsche welle that germany should focus instead on what it can offer the indians in the fight against climate change . " compared to germany , the degree of pollution in india is still very low per capita , " steinrücke said .
" german companies have a lot to offer indians in terms of renewable energy , clean coal technology and energy efficiency know-how . " " room for germany as an honest broker " merkel will also need to tread carefully on issues such as the conflict in kashmir and india 's relations with neighboring pakistan , both nuclear powers .
delhi is opposed to critical questions on the topics which it views as international meddling in its internal affairs . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : india does n't take kindly to international criticism of the kashmir conflict other delicate political topics on the agenda include stalled talks on un reforms and a common desire in delhi and berlin for a permanent seat at the un security council , tough german visa procedures for indian business leaders and a controversial deal on civilian nuclear cooperation between india and the us . given that the indo-us nuclear deal might not materialize in the face of stiff opposition by india 's communist parties , the cdu 's von klaeden hopes there might yet be room for berlin to gain some political clout in the region . " the indians are too clever to only bind themselves to one partner , " von klaeden told the rheinischer merkur newspaper last week .

police fear it was only the beginning . " the conflict in the border region to iraq has already spilled over to berlin , " claudia schmid , the berlin head of germany 's domestic intelligence service , the office to protect the constitution , told broadcaster rbb on monday .
the clashes took place in berlin 's kreuzberg district on sunday at the end of a demonstration by turkish nationalists with the slogan " unity and fraternity between turks and kurds . "
turks started to " hunt " kurds , according to germany 's police union dpoig .
only the force of a massive police presence had prevented people from using weapons , the dpoig said , according to the associated press .
schimd said 15 demonstrators had been arrested and 18 police officers injured in the unrest between nationalistic turks and kurds in kreuzberg , which has a large immigrant population .
pkk in berlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fifteen people were arrested more " emotional unrest " between turks and kurds was likely , she said , adding that around 1,000 people in berlin were associated with the militant kurdistan workers ' party -lrb- pkk -rrb- , which is banned in turkey .
the pkk has been waging a bloody campaign for self-rule in southeastern turkey since 1974 .
it took up arms in 1984 , aiming to create an ethnic homeland in the region .
more than 30,000 people have been killed in the conflict .
turkey 's parliament recently authorized the military to carry out cross-border offensives against kurdish militants in northern iraq after a surge in attacks on turkish soil .
talks between ankara and baghdad aimed at preventing the pkk from attacking from northern iraq and avoiding cross-border military operations broke down on friday after turkey called iraqi proposals ineffective . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

merthyr council 's jeff edwards said low population meant funding was small , but its money should be based on need .
the assembly government said it made deprivation provision in extra grants .
merthyr is one of five south wales areas in a top 10 of councils with the highest percentage of people on benefits for more than five years .
the other south wales regions are blaenau gwent , neath port talbot , rhondda cynon taf and caerphilly .
mr edwards , who is merthyr council 's board member for economic development and regeneration , said the figures reflected the fact that big industries like iron and coal had died off in the region . "
if we did not get objective one funding from europe , our problem would be even more serious " jeff edwards , merthyr tydfil council he denied that the authority was resigned to long-term benefit claimants , and said the authority had worked hard to attract new service industries to the region like t-mobile , as well as cyfarthfa retail park and the welsh assembly government building .
but these mostly attracted younger employees rather than the core group of long-term benefit claimants , he said .
" i think this figure consists largely of a core group of people , who are older and who used to work in the mining industry but because of sickness or a lack of transport , or even a loss in confidence , are unable to take on new work , " said mr edwards .
" we have got a number of schemes and european initiatives to look at re-skilling people who have been on benefits for a long time .
long-term benefit claimants merthyr tydfil 16.8 % easington , co durham 16 % blaenau gwent 15.2 % knowsley , merseyside 14.5 % neath port talbot 14.3 % rhondda cynon taf 13.5 % liverpool 13.3 % glasgow city 13.2 % caerphilly 13.1 % barrow-in-furness , cumbria 11.7 % source : press association " these schemes also try to help them with their self-esteem and their confidence to help them back into the employment market . "
he cited the wheels to work scheme as one which had benefited " thousands " of unemployed people in merthyr .
but he said the authority needed more investment and support from the assembly government into regeneration projects , infrastructure and specialist schemes to help them bring claimants off benefits .
" the challenges we have got are great , " he said .
" the need is far greater in the valleys and the money from the welsh assembly government should reflect this .
the council has been arguing this for a long time .
" if we did not get objective one funding from europe , our problem would be even more serious . "
a spokesman for the welsh assembly government said provision for deprivation was made in the formula for distributing grants to all 22 local authorities in wales .
" in addition , merthyr tydfil benefits from a separate grant paid to local authorities in wales , " he said .
" merthyr tydfil benefits from communities first funding aimed at the most deprived communities in wales and is set to benefit from investment in the transport infrastructure through the heads of valleys scheme . "

mr cable says he will not attend any of the planned ceremonial events - as would be normal for the leader of one of the main opposition parties .
mr cable told the bbc 's today programme that by any assessment of saudi arabia , " the human rights record is appalling " .
he also cited the regime 's arms deal with the british firm bae and the row over alleged corruption surrounding it .
mr cable added : " i think it 's quite wrong that as a country we should give the leader of saudi arabia this honour . "
he said that although britain has a " business-like " relationship with the country , britain would not dream of extending the same invitation to other controversial leaders like libya 's colonel gadaffi ..
he said he had also been critical of the saudi regime 's treatment of britons .
defence deals the saudi ambassador , prince mohammed bin nawaf , said : " we respect all the political parties in the uk and we will continue to work together to pursue our common goals for the best interests of our two kingdoms . "
mr cable 's decision follows the controversy which erupted last year when tony blair halted a long-running serious fraud office inquiry into the £ 40bn al-yamamah deal signed by margaret thatcher in the 1980s .
in my opinion it is quite wrong for the british government to have proposed a state visit at this time vincent cable liberal democrat acting leader mr blair argued that saudi security co-operation in the fight against international terrorism could be jeopardised if the investigation continued .
but critics claimed he was more concerned that britain could lose out on a fresh £ 20bn contract to supply the saudis with 72 eurofighters - which the ministry of defence confirmed last month is going ahead .
in a letter to the saudi ambassador in london , mr cable said : " in my opinion , it is quite wrong for the british government to have proposed a state visit at this time .
" therefore , it would , i believe , be inappropriate for me to participate in a ceremonial state visit against this background . "

british and saudi interests were " intertwined and inseparable " across a range of issues from counter-terrorism to ensuring stability in the middle east .
conservative shadow defence secretary liam fox warned that mr cable 's move would be seen as " juvenile gesture politics " and risked insulting one of britain 's main allies in the gulf .
meanwhile , labour leftwinger john mcdonnell said that protesters would be staging a mass demo outside the saudi embassy on wednesday .

mr cable says he will not attend any of the planned ceremonial events - as would be normal for the leader of one of the main opposition parties .
mr cable told the bbc 's today programme that by any assessment of saudi arabia , " the human rights record is appalling " .
he also cited the regime 's arms deal with the british firm bae and the row over alleged corruption surrounding it .
mr cable added : " i think it 's quite wrong that as a country we should give the leader of saudi arabia this honour . "
he said that although britain has a " business-like " relationship with the country , britain would not dream of extending the same invitation to other controversial leaders like libya 's colonel gadaffi ..
he said he had also been critical of the saudi regime 's treatment of britons .

in a letter to the saudi ambassador in london , mr cable said : " in my opinion , it is quite wrong for the british government to have proposed a state visit at this time .

users will also be able to use skype 's instant messaging service , 3 said .
but while people using skype on their computers are able to make cheap global calls to any phone number , this will not be possible via the new 3 handset .
skype has about 246 million registered users worldwide and is one of the firms reshaping the global phone industry .
mobile potential to date , mobile phone companies have been unwilling to let users freely access skype via their handsets for fear that it would hurt their business .
while it is possible to access skype from a number of handsets , this has involved downloading third-party software , something that has put off the majority of users .
the skype-phone will be the first instance of a phone operator launching a mass market device that is designed to allow free calling over the internet from a mobile , 3 said .
" it takes an innovative operator ... to challenge traditional thinking and offer the kind of product other operators are still shying away from , " said skype 's acting chief executive , michael van swaaij .
" it 's is now truly mobile .
skype has now taken a giant step forward in the mobile arena .
and chief executive of 3 uk , kevin russell , said the firm wanted to make mobile internet more accessible .
" services need to be simple to access and affordable , " he said .
" mobile has the potential to massively increase access to internet calling . "
global reach the service , launching on 2 november , will be accessed by a button on the handset .
as well as the uk , the 3 skype-phone will be launched in countries including australia , denmark , italy and hong kong .

the event planned for monday night in pulborough 's village hall follows 18 previous ones across the county , with two more planned for later this week .
a 20-week public consultation into the proposals is due to end on 14 november .
services at worthing hospital , princess royal hospital in haywards heath and st richard 's , chichester are under threat .
west sussex primary care trust -lrb- pct -rrb- said it had received thousands of responses to its fit for the future proposals since consultation began in june .
a consultation support unit has been responding to inquiries from people wanting more information before having their say , but the cut-off date for getting in touch with representatives there is this friday .
keith richards has a home near chichester john wilderspin , the pct 's chief executive , has said : " we fully recognise the strength of feeling people have for their local hospital and health services .
" it is encouraging that such an important consultation is being engaged with by local people from such a wide area and in such numbers . "
under the plans , only one of the three hospitals would stay as it is with the other two being downgraded .
the pct said the changes would create high-quality and safe services provided by highly-trained staff , but that any other viable options proposed would be independently scrutinised .
campaigns against downgrading have been running in chichester , haywards heath and worthing .
on saturday , rolling stone keith richards joined about 15,000 other people in a protest march through chichester .

the party want welsh labour to distance itself from peter hain 's remarks that there was no consensus on a vote .
plaid cymru mp adam price said the two parties ' coalition was under threat unless welsh labour gave reassurances .
a referendum within four years was part of the one wales deal which led to the labour-plaid assembly government .
adam price mp spoke out after peter hain mp told bbc radio wales ' sunday edition programme that a referendum could not be won by 2011 .
he said there was no consensus on a vote and could not see it happening over the four years of this assembly .
he spoke after it was announced that retired diplomat sir emyr jones parry was to become chair of commission on a referendum by 2011 .
but adam price said his statements were a cause for concern because the issue was one of the main elements of the agreement of a coalition assembly government .
" it 's a very confusing picture with peter hain almost directly contradicting first minister rhodri morgan that there would be a referendum by 2011 , " said mr price .
" what we want is a confirmation from welsh labour that peter hain was not speaking for them .
" the secretary of state is not just a back bench mp , he is a member of the cabinet and we have to get uk agreement for a referendum .
" we need him to clarify his position or withdraw his comments or for rhodri morgan to make it clear that he -lsb- peter hain -rsb- does not speak for welsh labour . "
' pessimistic ' he said he feared for the future of the coalition unless assurances from welsh labour that they were not " reneging " on the issue of the referendum were made .
labour mp paul flynn also spoke out about peter hain describing him as being " pessimistic " about the issue .
he said there was a " feeling from mps of all parties that they do n't want to lose power and they see power flowing down the m4 to cardiff .
" the ' one wales ' agreement is more important than the opinion of one mp , " he said .
" i think the process of devolution is accelerating and i believe peter hain is being pessimistic and he is wrong .
" i believe a referendum would be won handsomely in four years , " he added .

plaid cymru mp adam price said the two parties ' coalition was under threat unless welsh labour gave reassurances .

adam price mp spoke out after peter hain mp told bbc radio wales ' sunday edition programme that a referendum could not be won by 2011 .
he said there was no consensus on a vote and could not see it happening over the four years of this assembly .
adam price demanded reassurances from welsh labour he spoke after it was announced that retired diplomat sir emyr jones parry was to become chair of commission on a referendum by 2011 .

" what we want is a confirmation from welsh labour that peter hain was not speaking for them .
