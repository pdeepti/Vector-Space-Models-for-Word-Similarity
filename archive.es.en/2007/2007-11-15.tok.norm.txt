" if the israeli government wants to talk formally to the german government , we will not refuse to hold talks of this nature , " government spokesman thomas steg on wednesday , nov .

" there has been a continuous policy over the past decades that all german governments have always been prepared to hold negotiations , " said steg , adding that there had as yet been no formal approach from israel on the matter .
" in israel there is now a situation , a phenomenon of immigration of jews from russia and the former soviet republics to israel that was not foreseeable in the discussions in the 1950s and 1960s .
it remains to be seen whether this should lead to new negotiations .

" i welcome the chance to be able to explain to the german minister the demographic changes that have taken place in recent years , " he said .
" the health of survivors continues to worsen because most of them are over 80 . " the most useful aspect on any reparation revision would be if germany were to pay towards the increased expenses of holocaust survivors , flug said . critics say israel can support its own the media in israel has been critical of the expected move to ask germany to provide additional money .
many commentators say modern israel has the financial clout to take care of the ageing jewish survivors of the nazis without asking germany for extra help . germany has so far paid a total of 65 billion euros -lrb- $ 95 billion -rrb- , or about 800 euros per german national , according to flug . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if the israeli government wants to talk formally to the german government , we will not refuse to hold talks of this nature , " government spokesman thomas steg on wednesday , nov .

" there has been a continuous policy over the past decades that all german governments have always been prepared to hold negotiations , " said steg , adding that there had as yet been no formal approach from israel on the matter .
" in israel there is now a situation , a phenomenon of immigration of jews from russia and the former soviet republics to israel that was not foreseeable in the discussions in the 1950s and 1960s .
it remains to be seen whether this should lead to new negotiations . " eitan said israel wanted to reopen the 1952 luxembourg agreement with germany granting reparations for holocaust survivors in remarks published last friday . russian jews increase the strain on the state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eitan said events unforeseen in 1952 made previous agreements outdated the pensions minister said the deal failed to take into account the longevity of the survivors or the arrival of the 175,000 who emigrated from the former soviet union . subsequently his spokeswoman , elle baror , said the minister did not wish to reopen the agreement , but rather wanted teams from israel and germany to meet in order to discuss ways of finding money to cover expenses which were not taken into account when the original deals were signed . a spokesman for german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said talks on the issue were not on the agenda when schäuble visits israel on thursday and friday . holocaust survivors ' associations welcome german news news of germany 's willingness to address the topic of increased reparations should israel make approaches was welcomed by the head of an association which oversees holocaust survivors ' organizations in israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors need help in making ends meet , says flug " we are very happy with berlin 's attitude , which shows continued german concern for the fate of victims of the nazi regime , " noah flug , himself a holocaust survivor , told reporters . flug added that he would meet germany 's finance minister peer steinbrück during his visit to israel next week . " i welcome the chance to be able to explain to the german minister the demographic changes that have taken place in recent years , " he said .
" the health of survivors continues to worsen because most of them are over 80 . " the most useful aspect on any reparation revision would be if germany were to pay towards the increased expenses of holocaust survivors , flug said . critics say israel can support its own the media in israel has been critical of the expected move to ask germany to provide additional money .
many commentators say modern israel has the financial clout to take care of the ageing jewish survivors of the nazis without asking germany for extra help . germany has so far paid a total of 65 billion euros -lrb- $ 95 billion -rrb- , or about 800 euros per german national , according to flug . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

fiat of italy and france 's renault group followed with 144 g / km and 147 g / km , respectively . toyota had the largest drop in emissions over the one-year period - 5 percent - and a relatively low fleet average of 153 g / km .
german cars emitted on average 173 g / km in 2006 . the study , which only included carmakers that had sold at least 200,000 vehicles in europe in 2006 , revealed that the weight of vehicle is directly proportional to the amount of co2 it emits . t & e said that daimler 's poor performance in the co2 study could largely be attributed to the 4.1 percent average weight increase in its fleet between 2005 and 2006 . balancing act between eu , car lobbies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been a major proponent of climate protection " it 's ironic that the country that did so much to get a european consensus on new climate targets earlier this year is also home to the carmakers that are holding back progress on one of the most important ways of achieving them , " said dings . climate issues had topped germany 's agenda during its eu presidency in the first half of 2007 , but pressure from automotive lobbies has hindered stringent co2 limits on cars . in 1994 , the european union set a goal of an average emission level of 120 g / km for new cars by 2012 , but the amount was adjusted to 130 g / km last month .
should german carmakers meet the target , which experts have said is unlikely , it would represent a 25 percent drop in co2 emissions . the eu 's recent upward revision was seen as a blow to german chancellor angela merkel 's attempts to give germany a leading role in the fight against climate change . a recent proposal by the german government to implement a sliding vehicle tax based on co2 emissions - and a tax exemption for particularly low-pollutant cars - may lead consumers to put added pressure on manufacturers .
if approved , the law would go into effect in 2009 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 , to include passenger as well as freight trains .
the economic ramifications are already being felt . the sixth national rail stopping in the three-month dispute between deutsche bahn and the gdl train drivers ' unions began wednesday afternoon with freight trains and escalated early thursday to include passenger trains . " even without exactly quantifying it , the rail strike does have an economic effect and is a burden on an otherwise positive economy , " government spokesman thomas steg said at a news conference in berlin on wednesday . economists have estimated that the freight train strike costs 50 million euros -lrb- $ 73.3 million -rrb- per day .
if the current strike were to continue for more than a week , losses could rise to 500 million euros daily , according to reports .
the gdl , however , has said the industrial action would end on 2:00 a.m. on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi had to halt production due to missing parts the gdl has been trying to force the deutsche bahn into " an unconditional surrender , " deutsche bahn 's human resources manager karl-friedrich rausch told broadcaster ard .
" that wo n't happen . " " if we give in now , the damage to the economy would be even greater , " he said . lack of supplies leads to less work neighboring european countries have also been affected by the strike . the audi factory in brussels , cancelled its early shift thursday morning because parts that were due to be delivered from germany by train had not arrived .
some 800 workers stayed at home .
reduced work hours were expected elsewhere as well . " thousands of workers are threatened by reductions because supplies are lacking , " ludwig georg braun , president of the german chambers of industry and commerce , told germany 's daily bild newspaper . freight trains from germany into france had also been suspended thursday morning .
the germany-wide strike coincides with a rail strike in france over pension reform , compounding the situation there . backup at ports leads to heavy losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freight containers are piling up at the hamburg port germany 's northern ports are scrambling to find extra space to store freight containers waiting for trains or alternative means of transport .
about 30 percent of the goods that pass through hamburg 's heavily trafficked port are usually transported by train . " if the seaports are blocked , the daily economic damage will exceed 500 million euros , " adolf zobel from the national logistics association bgl told the daily passauer neue presse .
" it could reach as much as 2 billion euros a day in extreme cases . "
the steel , automotive and chemical industries are particularly affected , he said . concern over precedence for fragmented unions gdl , one of several train drivers ' unions in germany , says that its members do not receive fair pay compared to other european rail companies .
deutsche bahn agreed in july to a 4.5 percent pay increase for 195,000 rail workers from other unions . gdl initially demanded a 31 percent pay increase , but has said this would be open to negotiation if its 34,000 members were given their own contract .
deutsche bahn wants a standard agreement across the sector and has rejected the possibility of a separate deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some passengers are choosing to fly instead of risking train delays concerns have been raised that , should gdl get its way , this could lead other unions to fragment and push up labor costs by encouraging workers to demand separate wage agreements . airlines , car rentals benefit from strike eastern germany is hit the hardest by the strike , where only about 10 percent of trains were running on thursday .
many train drivers belong to gdl in the region .
in western germany , about half of the trains were reportedly in service . with the strike extended to passenger trains , busses had been brought in to replace cancelled local trains .
many commuters were expected to go by car , leading to heavier traffic on the motorways . car-rental agencies and discount airlines reported higher bookings as stranded travelers sought alternative means of transportation .

15 , to include passenger as well as freight trains .
the economic ramifications are already being felt . the sixth national rail stopping in the three-month dispute between deutsche bahn and the gdl train drivers ' unions began wednesday afternoon with freight trains and escalated early thursday to include passenger trains . " even without exactly quantifying it , the rail strike does have an economic effect and is a burden on an otherwise positive economy , " government spokesman thomas steg said at a news conference in berlin on wednesday . economists have estimated that the freight train strike costs 50 million euros -lrb- $ 73.3 million -rrb- per day .
if the current strike were to continue for more than a week , losses could rise to 500 million euros daily , according to reports .
the gdl , however , has said the industrial action would end on 2:00 a.m. on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi had to halt production due to missing parts the gdl has been trying to force the deutsche bahn into " an unconditional surrender , " deutsche bahn 's human resources manager karl-friedrich rausch told broadcaster ard .
" that wo n't happen . " " if we give in now , the damage to the economy would be even greater , " he said . lack of supplies leads to less work neighboring european countries have also been affected by the strike . the audi factory in brussels , cancelled its early shift thursday morning because parts that were due to be delivered from germany by train had not arrived .
some 800 workers stayed at home .
reduced work hours were expected elsewhere as well . " thousands of workers are threatened by reductions because supplies are lacking , " ludwig georg braun , president of the german chambers of industry and commerce , told germany 's daily bild newspaper . freight trains from germany into france had also been suspended thursday morning .
the germany-wide strike coincides with a rail strike in france over pension reform , compounding the situation there . backup at ports leads to heavy losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freight containers are piling up at the hamburg port germany 's northern ports are scrambling to find extra space to store freight containers waiting for trains or alternative means of transport .
about 30 percent of the goods that pass through hamburg 's heavily trafficked port are usually transported by train . " if the seaports are blocked , the daily economic damage will exceed 500 million euros , " adolf zobel from the national logistics association bgl told the daily passauer neue presse .
" it could reach as much as 2 billion euros a day in extreme cases . "
the steel , automotive and chemical industries are particularly affected , he said . concern over precedence for fragmented unions gdl , one of several train drivers ' unions in germany , says that its members do not receive fair pay compared to other european rail companies .
deutsche bahn agreed in july to a 4.5 percent pay increase for 195,000 rail workers from other unions . gdl initially demanded a 31 percent pay increase , but has said this would be open to negotiation if its 34,000 members were given their own contract .
deutsche bahn wants a standard agreement across the sector and has rejected the possibility of a separate deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some passengers are choosing to fly instead of risking train delays concerns have been raised that , should gdl get its way , this could lead other unions to fragment and push up labor costs by encouraging workers to demand separate wage agreements . airlines , car rentals benefit from strike eastern germany is hit the hardest by the strike , where only about 10 percent of trains were running on thursday .
many train drivers belong to gdl in the region .
in western germany , about half of the trains were reportedly in service . with the strike extended to passenger trains , busses had been brought in to replace cancelled local trains .
many commuters were expected to go by car , leading to heavier traffic on the motorways . car-rental agencies and discount airlines reported higher bookings as stranded travelers sought alternative means of transportation .
on some routes , reservations had risen by 15 to 30 percent , an air berlin spokeswoman told the daily berliner zeitung . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in eastern regions of the country , however , many more passengers were left stranded with 70 percent to 80 percent of regional trains cancelled . a db spokesman confirmed the company had initiated court proceedings , suing gdl for 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.5 million -rrb- .
the case relates to a previous strike called in july but could also set a precedent for thursday 's labor action . unlimited strikes could start next week bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rail strike spread from cargo to passenger trains early thursday morning the gdl , in which some three quarters of germany 's 20,000 train drivers are organized , has raised the stakes in the seven-month pay and conditions dispute , targeting goods , regional and long-distance traffic simultaneously .
about 3,000 union members are reported to have walked out . gdl deputy chairman clause weselsky warned thursday that an unlimited strike could start as early as next week .
the union said it was prepared to strike until christmas if the bahn did n't give in to its demands . the current strike , which hit goods traffic from midday wednesday and passenger services from 2:00 a.m.

unscientific polls taken by news organizations at train stations showed overall support for the train drivers , but one professional poll indicated that sympathy for the union is dropping . a forsa poll for the german mass-market daily bild , showed 45 percent of those asked agree with the gdl , . " any compromise must start with an improved offer , " weselsky said .
db 's current offer did not meet the gdl 's demand for a separate contract from other workers and boosted pay only through increased hours , he added . the gdl stuck by its position of refusing to negotiate on this basis , weselsky said .
db has similarly refused to budge on a separate contract for drivers . db board member karl-friedrich rausch termed the latest strike , the sixth since june , " senseless " and warned the company would not " unconditionally surrender .

in eastern regions of the country , however , many more passengers were left stranded with 70 percent to 80 percent of regional trains cancelled . a db spokesman confirmed the company had initiated court proceedings , suing gdl for 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.5 million -rrb- .
the case relates to a previous strike called in july but could also set a precedent for thursday 's labor action . unlimited strikes could start next week bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rail strike spread from cargo to passenger trains early thursday morning the gdl , in which some three quarters of germany 's 20,000 train drivers are organized , has raised the stakes in the seven-month pay and conditions dispute , targeting goods , regional and long-distance traffic simultaneously .
about 3,000 union members are reported to have walked out . gdl deputy chairman clause weselsky warned thursday that an unlimited strike could start as early as next week .
the union said it was prepared to strike until christmas if the bahn did n't give in to its demands . the current strike , which hit goods traffic from midday wednesday and passenger services from 2:00 a.m.
thursday , is set to end at 2:00 a.m.
saturday . despite carmaker audi closing a plant in brussels due to lack of components , economists were divided on the cost of the strike .
while some said limited strikes would not cause noticeable damage to the german economy other maintained a freight strike costs 50 million euros per day , with costs skyrocketing to 500 million euros daily if train drivers stay off the job longer than a week . sympathy waning for union ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some passengers are starting to get fed up with the lack of departures reports on the public 's support in the labor dispute were split .
unscientific polls taken by news organizations at train stations showed overall support for the train drivers , but one professional poll indicated that sympathy for the union is dropping . a forsa poll for the german mass-market daily bild , showed 45 percent of those asked agree with the gdl , . " any compromise must start with an improved offer , " weselsky said .
db 's current offer did not meet the gdl 's demand for a separate contract from other workers and boosted pay only through increased hours , he added . the gdl stuck by its position of refusing to negotiate on this basis , weselsky said .
db has similarly refused to budge on a separate contract for drivers . db board member karl-friedrich rausch termed the latest strike , the sixth since june , " senseless " and warned the company would not " unconditionally surrender . " " if we give in now , the damage to the economy would be even greater , " he added but db management admitted the goods service situation was " increasingly critical . " government working " behind the scenes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many train passengers found other ways to travel to avoid the strike while the federal government stuck to established german practice of not intervening in labor disputes , transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said officials were " working behind the scenes " to resolve the potentially damaging conflict . tiefensee has repeatedly stressed the harm that would be done to germany 's booming economy by a lengthy strike . commuters responded by switching to cars or working from home .
db said it was maintaining most high-speed long-distance services , and many passengers were checking services on the internet before attempting to travel . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 15.11.2007 heavy german cars pollute more than european competition großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : daimler 's cars got heavier and dirtier last year the average carbon dioxide emission level in new german cars has increased , making them the dirtiest in europe .
a fondness for big , heavy cars is responsible for the hike , according to a european report . german cars scored poorly in an emissions study published thursday , nov .
15 , by the brussels-based european federation for transport and environment -lrb- t & e -rrb- , ranking in as europe 's biggest polluters .
average co2 emissions increased between 2005 and 2006 , for some of the germany 's major car brands . " germany 's fine automotive engineers should be focusing on making cars leaner and more fuel efficient , " said t & e director jos dings .
" launching one or two ' eco ' models is not enough to meet the challenges of climate change , rising fuel prices and europe 's increasing dependence on imported oil . " worst grades for daimler , bmw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co2 emissions is directly related to the weight of the vehicle daimler took last place in the co2 emissions ranking , with a reported increase of 2.5 percent in its fleet 's average emissions between 2005 and 2006 .
volkswagen was also found to have an emissions hike of 0.9 percent .
suzuki , whose co2 emissions increased by 1.8 percent , was the only other manufacture among the 14 in the study that averaged higher pollution rates . among the german carmakers , only bmw reported an average co2 reduction -lrb- 2.5 percent -rrb- , but was still ranked second to last by the study with a fleet average of 184 grams / kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- of emissions .
the german group of daimler , vw and bmw had an overall increase of co2 emission of 0.6 percent and none of the german manufactures emitted less than the european average of 162 g / km in 2006 , according to the report . france , italy take the lead overall , france 's psa peugeot citroen sold the lowest emitting cars in europe in 2006 with a fleet average of 142 g / km , representing a 2.7 percent decrease over 2005 .
fiat of italy and france 's renault group followed with 144 g / km and 147 g / km , respectively . toyota had the largest drop in emissions over the one-year period - 5 percent - and a relatively low fleet average of 153 g / km .
german cars emitted on average 173 g / km in 2006 . the study , which only included carmakers that had sold at least 200,000 vehicles in europe in 2006 , revealed that the weight of vehicle is directly proportional to the amount of co2 it emits . t & e said that daimler 's poor performance in the co2 study could largely be attributed to the 4.1 percent average weight increase in its fleet between 2005 and 2006 . balancing act between eu , car lobbies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been a major proponent of climate protection " it 's ironic that the country that did so much to get a european consensus on new climate targets earlier this year is also home to the carmakers that are holding back progress on one of the most important ways of achieving them , " said dings . climate issues had topped germany 's agenda during its eu presidency in the first half of 2007 , but pressure from automotive lobbies has hindered stringent co2 limits on cars . in 1994 , the european union set a goal of an average emission level of 120 g / km for new cars by 2012 , but the amount was adjusted to 130 g / km last month .
should german carmakers meet the target , which experts have said is unlikely , it would represent a 25 percent drop in co2 emissions . the eu 's recent upward revision was seen as a blow to german chancellor angela merkel 's attempts to give germany a leading role in the fight against climate change . a recent proposal by the german government to implement a sliding vehicle tax based on co2 emissions - and a tax exemption for particularly low-pollutant cars - may lead consumers to put added pressure on manufacturers .
if approved , the law would go into effect in 2009 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if the israeli government wants to talk formally to the german government , we will not refuse to hold talks of this nature , " government spokesman thomas steg on wednesday , nov .
14 , said in response to comments made by israeli pensions minister rafi eitan to an israeli newspaper last week . " there has been a continuous policy over the past decades that all german governments have always been prepared to hold negotiations , " said steg , adding that there had as yet been no formal approach from israel on the matter .
" in israel there is now a situation , a phenomenon of immigration of jews from russia and the former soviet republics to israel that was not foreseeable in the discussions in the 1950s and 1960s .
it remains to be seen whether this should lead to new negotiations . " eitan said israel wanted to reopen the 1952 luxembourg agreement with germany granting reparations for holocaust survivors in remarks published last friday . russian jews increase the strain on the state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eitan said events unforeseen in 1952 made previous agreements outdated the pensions minister said the deal failed to take into account the longevity of the survivors or the arrival of the 175,000 who emigrated from the former soviet union . subsequently his spokeswoman , elle baror , said the minister did not wish to reopen the agreement , but rather wanted teams from israel and germany to meet in order to discuss ways of finding money to cover expenses which were not taken into account when the original deals were signed . a spokesman for german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said talks on the issue were not on the agenda when schäuble visits israel on thursday and friday . holocaust survivors ' associations welcome german news news of germany 's willingness to address the topic of increased reparations should israel make approaches was welcomed by the head of an association which oversees holocaust survivors ' organizations in israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors need help in making ends meet , says flug " we are very happy with berlin 's attitude , which shows continued german concern for the fate of victims of the nazi regime , " noah flug , himself a holocaust survivor , told reporters . flug added that he would meet germany 's finance minister peer steinbrück during his visit to israel next week . " i welcome the chance to be able to explain to the german minister the demographic changes that have taken place in recent years , " he said .
" the health of survivors continues to worsen because most of them are over 80 . " the most useful aspect on any reparation revision would be if germany were to pay towards the increased expenses of holocaust survivors , flug said . critics say israel can support its own the media in israel has been critical of the expected move to ask germany to provide additional money .
many commentators say modern israel has the financial clout to take care of the ageing jewish survivors of the nazis without asking germany for extra help . germany has so far paid a total of 65 billion euros -lrb- $ 95 billion -rrb- , or about 800 euros per german national , according to flug . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the most useful aspect on any reparation revision would be if germany were to pay towards the increased expenses of holocaust survivors , flug said . critics say israel can support its own the media in israel has been critical of the expected move to ask germany to provide additional money .

15 , to include passenger as well as freight trains .
the economic ramifications are already being felt . the sixth national rail stopping in the three-month dispute between deutsche bahn and the gdl train drivers ' unions began wednesday afternoon with freight trains and escalated early thursday to include passenger trains . " even without exactly quantifying it , the rail strike does have an economic effect and is a burden on an otherwise positive economy , " government spokesman thomas steg said at a news conference in berlin on wednesday . economists have estimated that the freight train strike costs 50 million euros -lrb- $ 73.3 million -rrb- per day .
if the current strike were to continue for more than a week , losses could rise to 500 million euros daily , according to reports .
the gdl , however , has said the industrial action would end on 2:00 a.m. on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi had to halt production due to missing parts the gdl has been trying to force the deutsche bahn into " an unconditional surrender , " deutsche bahn 's human resources manager karl-friedrich rausch told broadcaster ard .
" that wo n't happen . " " if we give in now , the damage to the economy would be even greater , " he said . lack of supplies leads to less work neighboring european countries have also been affected by the strike . the audi factory in brussels , cancelled its early shift thursday morning because parts that were due to be delivered from germany by train had not arrived .
some 800 workers stayed at home .
reduced work hours were expected elsewhere as well . " thousands of workers are threatened by reductions because supplies are lacking , " ludwig georg braun , president of the german chambers of industry and commerce , told germany 's daily bild newspaper . freight trains from germany into france had also been suspended thursday morning .
the germany-wide strike coincides with a rail strike in france over pension reform , compounding the situation there . backup at ports leads to heavy losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freight containers are piling up at the hamburg port germany 's northern ports are scrambling to find extra space to store freight containers waiting for trains or alternative means of transport .
about 30 percent of the goods that pass through hamburg 's heavily trafficked port are usually transported by train . " if the seaports are blocked , the daily economic damage will exceed 500 million euros , " adolf zobel from the national logistics association bgl told the daily passauer neue presse .
" it could reach as much as 2 billion euros a day in extreme cases . "
the steel , automotive and chemical industries are particularly affected , he said . concern over precedence for fragmented unions gdl , one of several train drivers ' unions in germany , says that its members do not receive fair pay compared to other european rail companies .
deutsche bahn agreed in july to a 4.5 percent pay increase for 195,000 rail workers from other unions . gdl initially demanded a 31 percent pay increase , but has said this would be open to negotiation if its 34,000 members were given their own contract .
deutsche bahn wants a standard agreement across the sector and has rejected the possibility of a separate deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some passengers are choosing to fly instead of risking train delays concerns have been raised that , should gdl get its way , this could lead other unions to fragment and push up labor costs by encouraging workers to demand separate wage agreements . airlines , car rentals benefit from strike eastern germany is hit the hardest by the strike , where only about 10 percent of trains were running on thursday .
many train drivers belong to gdl in the region .
in western germany , about half of the trains were reportedly in service . with the strike extended to passenger trains , busses had been brought in to replace cancelled local trains .
many commuters were expected to go by car , leading to heavier traffic on the motorways . car-rental agencies and discount airlines reported higher bookings as stranded travelers sought alternative means of transportation .

a fondness for big , heavy cars is responsible for the hike , according to a european report . german cars scored poorly in an emissions study published thursday , nov .
15 , by the brussels-based european federation for transport and environment -lrb- t & e -rrb- , ranking in as europe 's biggest polluters .

" if the israeli government wants to talk formally to the german government , we will not refuse to hold talks of this nature , " government spokesman thomas steg on wednesday , nov .
14 , said in response to comments made by israeli pensions minister rafi eitan to an israeli newspaper last week . " there has been a continuous policy over the past decades that all german governments have always been prepared to hold negotiations , " said steg , adding that there had as yet been no formal approach from israel on the matter .
" in israel there is now a situation , a phenomenon of immigration of jews from russia and the former soviet republics to israel that was not foreseeable in the discussions in the 1950s and 1960s .
it remains to be seen whether this should lead to new negotiations . " eitan said israel wanted to reopen the 1952 luxembourg agreement with germany granting reparations for holocaust survivors in remarks published last friday . russian jews increase the strain on the state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eitan said events unforeseen in 1952 made previous agreements outdated the pensions minister said the deal failed to take into account the longevity of the survivors or the arrival of the 175,000 who emigrated from the former soviet union . subsequently his spokeswoman , elle baror , said the minister did not wish to reopen the agreement , but rather wanted teams from israel and germany to meet in order to discuss ways of finding money to cover expenses which were not taken into account when the original deals were signed . a spokesman for german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said talks on the issue were not on the agenda when schäuble visits israel on thursday and friday . holocaust survivors ' associations welcome german news news of germany 's willingness to address the topic of increased reparations should israel make approaches was welcomed by the head of an association which oversees holocaust survivors ' organizations in israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors need help in making ends meet , says flug " we are very happy with berlin 's attitude , which shows continued german concern for the fate of victims of the nazi regime , " noah flug , himself a holocaust survivor , told reporters . flug added that he would meet germany 's finance minister peer steinbrück during his visit to israel next week . " i welcome the chance to be able to explain to the german minister the demographic changes that have taken place in recent years , " he said .
" the health of survivors continues to worsen because most of them are over 80 .

a fondness for big , heavy cars is responsible for the hike , according to a european report . german cars scored poorly in an emissions study published thursday , nov .
15 , by the brussels-based european federation for transport and environment -lrb- t & e -rrb- , ranking in as europe 's biggest polluters .
average co2 emissions increased between 2005 and 2006 , for some of the germany 's major car brands . " germany 's fine automotive engineers should be focusing on making cars leaner and more fuel efficient , " said t & e director jos dings .
" launching one or two ' eco ' models is not enough to meet the challenges of climate change , rising fuel prices and europe 's increasing dependence on imported oil . " worst grades for daimler , bmw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co2 emissions is directly related to the weight of the vehicle daimler took last place in the co2 emissions ranking , with a reported increase of 2.5 percent in its fleet 's average emissions between 2005 and 2006 .
volkswagen was also found to have an emissions hike of 0.9 percent .
suzuki , whose co2 emissions increased by 1.8 percent , was the only other manufacture among the 14 in the study that averaged higher pollution rates . among the german carmakers , only bmw reported an average co2 reduction -lrb- 2.5 percent -rrb- , but was still ranked second to last by the study with a fleet average of 184 grams / kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- of emissions .
the german group of daimler , vw and bmw had an overall increase of co2 emission of 0.6 percent and none of the german manufactures emitted less than the european average of 162 g / km in 2006 , according to the report . france , italy take the lead overall , france 's psa peugeot citroen sold the lowest emitting cars in europe in 2006 with a fleet average of 142 g / km , representing a 2.7 percent decrease over 2005 .
fiat of italy and france 's renault group followed with 144 g / km and 147 g / km , respectively . toyota had the largest drop in emissions over the one-year period - 5 percent - and a relatively low fleet average of 153 g / km .
german cars emitted on average 173 g / km in 2006 . the study , which only included carmakers that had sold at least 200,000 vehicles in europe in 2006 , revealed that the weight of vehicle is directly proportional to the amount of co2 it emits . t & e said that daimler 's poor performance in the co2 study could largely be attributed to the 4.1 percent average weight increase in its fleet between 2005 and 2006 . balancing act between eu , car lobbies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been a major proponent of climate protection " it 's ironic that the country that did so much to get a european consensus on new climate targets earlier this year is also home to the carmakers that are holding back progress on one of the most important ways of achieving them , " said dings . climate issues had topped germany 's agenda during its eu presidency in the first half of 2007 , but pressure from automotive lobbies has hindered stringent co2 limits on cars . in 1994 , the european union set a goal of an average emission level of 120 g / km for new cars by 2012 , but the amount was adjusted to 130 g / km last month .
should german carmakers meet the target , which experts have said is unlikely , it would represent a 25 percent drop in co2 emissions . the eu 's recent upward revision was seen as a blow to german chancellor angela merkel 's attempts to give germany a leading role in the fight against climate change . a recent proposal by the german government to implement a sliding vehicle tax based on co2 emissions - and a tax exemption for particularly low-pollutant cars - may lead consumers to put added pressure on manufacturers .

the case relates to a previous strike called in july but could also set a precedent for thursday 's labor action . unlimited strikes could start next week bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rail strike spread from cargo to passenger trains early thursday morning the gdl , in which some three quarters of germany 's 20,000 train drivers are organized , has raised the stakes in the seven-month pay and conditions dispute , targeting goods , regional and long-distance traffic simultaneously .
about 3,000 union members are reported to have walked out . gdl deputy chairman clause weselsky warned thursday that an unlimited strike could start as early as next week .
the union said it was prepared to strike until christmas if the bahn did n't give in to its demands . the current strike , which hit goods traffic from midday wednesday and passenger services from 2:00 a.m.
thursday , is set to end at 2:00 a.m.
saturday . despite carmaker audi closing a plant in brussels due to lack of components , economists were divided on the cost of the strike .
while some said limited strikes would not cause noticeable damage to the german economy other maintained a freight strike costs 50 million euros per day , with costs skyrocketing to 500 million euros daily if train drivers stay off the job longer than a week . sympathy waning for union ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some passengers are starting to get fed up with the lack of departures reports on the public 's support in the labor dispute were split .
unscientific polls taken by news organizations at train stations showed overall support for the train drivers , but one professional poll indicated that sympathy for the union is dropping . a forsa poll for the german mass-market daily bild , showed 45 percent of those asked agree with the gdl , . " any compromise must start with an improved offer , " weselsky said .
db 's current offer did not meet the gdl 's demand for a separate contract from other workers and boosted pay only through increased hours , he added . the gdl stuck by its position of refusing to negotiate on this basis , weselsky said .
db has similarly refused to budge on a separate contract for drivers . db board member karl-friedrich rausch termed the latest strike , the sixth since june , " senseless " and warned the company would not " unconditionally surrender . " " if we give in now , the damage to the economy would be even greater , " he added but db management admitted the goods service situation was " increasingly critical . " government working " behind the scenes " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many train passengers found other ways to travel to avoid the strike while the federal government stuck to established german practice of not intervening in labor disputes , transport minister wolfgang tiefensee said officials were " working behind the scenes " to resolve the potentially damaging conflict . tiefensee has repeatedly stressed the harm that would be done to germany 's booming economy by a lengthy strike . commuters responded by switching to cars or working from home .
db said it was maintaining most high-speed long-distance services , and many passengers were checking services on the internet before attempting to travel . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if the israeli government wants to talk formally to the german government , we will not refuse to hold talks of this nature , " government spokesman thomas steg on wednesday , nov .

" there has been a continuous policy over the past decades that all german governments have always been prepared to hold negotiations , " said steg , adding that there had as yet been no formal approach from israel on the matter .
" in israel there is now a situation , a phenomenon of immigration of jews from russia and the former soviet republics to israel that was not foreseeable in the discussions in the 1950s and 1960s .
it remains to be seen whether this should lead to new negotiations . " eitan said israel wanted to reopen the 1952 luxembourg agreement with germany granting reparations for holocaust survivors in remarks published last friday . russian jews increase the strain on the state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eitan said events unforeseen in 1952 made previous agreements outdated the pensions minister said the deal failed to take into account the longevity of the survivors or the arrival of the 175,000 who emigrated from the former soviet union . subsequently his spokeswoman , elle baror , said the minister did not wish to reopen the agreement , but rather wanted teams from israel and germany to meet in order to discuss ways of finding money to cover expenses which were not taken into account when the original deals were signed . a spokesman for german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said talks on the issue were not on the agenda when schäuble visits israel on thursday and friday . holocaust survivors ' associations welcome german news news of germany 's willingness to address the topic of increased reparations should israel make approaches was welcomed by the head of an association which oversees holocaust survivors ' organizations in israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors need help in making ends meet , says flug " we are very happy with berlin 's attitude , which shows continued german concern for the fate of victims of the nazi regime , " noah flug , himself a holocaust survivor , told reporters . flug added that he would meet germany 's finance minister peer steinbrück during his visit to israel next week . " i welcome the chance to be able to explain to the german minister the demographic changes that have taken place in recent years , " he said .
" the health of survivors continues to worsen because most of them are over 80 . " the most useful aspect on any reparation revision would be if germany were to pay towards the increased expenses of holocaust survivors , flug said . critics say israel can support its own the media in israel has been critical of the expected move to ask germany to provide additional money .
many commentators say modern israel has the financial clout to take care of the ageing jewish survivors of the nazis without asking germany for extra help . germany has so far paid a total of 65 billion euros -lrb- $ 95 billion -rrb- , or about 800 euros per german national , according to flug . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if the israeli government wants to talk formally to the german government , we will not refuse to hold talks of this nature , " government spokesman thomas steg on wednesday , nov .
14 , said in response to comments made by israeli pensions minister rafi eitan to an israeli newspaper last week . " there has been a continuous policy over the past decades that all german governments have always been prepared to hold negotiations , " said steg , adding that there had as yet been no formal approach from israel on the matter .
" in israel there is now a situation , a phenomenon of immigration of jews from russia and the former soviet republics to israel that was not foreseeable in the discussions in the 1950s and 1960s .
it remains to be seen whether this should lead to new negotiations . " eitan said israel wanted to reopen the 1952 luxembourg agreement with germany granting reparations for holocaust survivors in remarks published last friday . russian jews increase the strain on the state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eitan said events unforeseen in 1952 made previous agreements outdated the pensions minister said the deal failed to take into account the longevity of the survivors or the arrival of the 175,000 who emigrated from the former soviet union . subsequently his spokeswoman , elle baror , said the minister did not wish to reopen the agreement , but rather wanted teams from israel and germany to meet in order to discuss ways of finding money to cover expenses which were not taken into account when the original deals were signed . a spokesman for german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said talks on the issue were not on the agenda when schäuble visits israel on thursday and friday . holocaust survivors ' associations welcome german news news of germany 's willingness to address the topic of increased reparations should israel make approaches was welcomed by the head of an association which oversees holocaust survivors ' organizations in israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors need help in making ends meet , says flug " we are very happy with berlin 's attitude , which shows continued german concern for the fate of victims of the nazi regime , " noah flug , himself a holocaust survivor , told reporters . flug added that he would meet germany 's finance minister peer steinbrück during his visit to israel next week . " i welcome the chance to be able to explain to the german minister the demographic changes that have taken place in recent years , " he said .
" the health of survivors continues to worsen because most of them are over 80 . " the most useful aspect on any reparation revision would be if germany were to pay towards the increased expenses of holocaust survivors , flug said . critics say israel can support its own the media in israel has been critical of the expected move to ask germany to provide additional money .
many commentators say modern israel has the financial clout to take care of the ageing jewish survivors of the nazis without asking germany for extra help . germany has so far paid a total of 65 billion euros -lrb- $ 95 billion -rrb- , or about 800 euros per german national , according to flug . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 , to include passenger as well as freight trains .
the economic ramifications are already being felt . the sixth national rail stopping in the three-month dispute between deutsche bahn and the gdl train drivers ' unions began wednesday afternoon with freight trains and escalated early thursday to include passenger trains . " even without exactly quantifying it , the rail strike does have an economic effect and is a burden on an otherwise positive economy , " government spokesman thomas steg said at a news conference in berlin on wednesday . economists have estimated that the freight train strike costs 50 million euros -lrb- $ 73.3 million -rrb- per day .
if the current strike were to continue for more than a week , losses could rise to 500 million euros daily , according to reports .
the gdl , however , has said the industrial action would end on 2:00 a.m. on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi had to halt production due to missing parts the gdl has been trying to force the deutsche bahn into " an unconditional surrender , " deutsche bahn 's human resources manager karl-friedrich rausch told broadcaster ard .
" that wo n't happen . " " if we give in now , the damage to the economy would be even greater , " he said . lack of supplies leads to less work neighboring european countries have also been affected by the strike . the audi factory in brussels , cancelled its early shift thursday morning because parts that were due to be delivered from germany by train had not arrived .
some 800 workers stayed at home .
reduced work hours were expected elsewhere as well . " thousands of workers are threatened by reductions because supplies are lacking , " ludwig georg braun , president of the german chambers of industry and commerce , told germany 's daily bild newspaper . freight trains from germany into france had also been suspended thursday morning .
the germany-wide strike coincides with a rail strike in france over pension reform , compounding the situation there . backup at ports leads to heavy losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freight containers are piling up at the hamburg port germany 's northern ports are scrambling to find extra space to store freight containers waiting for trains or alternative means of transport .
about 30 percent of the goods that pass through hamburg 's heavily trafficked port are usually transported by train . " if the seaports are blocked , the daily economic damage will exceed 500 million euros , " adolf zobel from the national logistics association bgl told the daily passauer neue presse .
" it could reach as much as 2 billion euros a day in extreme cases . "
the steel , automotive and chemical industries are particularly affected , he said . concern over precedence for fragmented unions gdl , one of several train drivers ' unions in germany , says that its members do not receive fair pay compared to other european rail companies .
deutsche bahn agreed in july to a 4.5 percent pay increase for 195,000 rail workers from other unions . gdl initially demanded a 31 percent pay increase , but has said this would be open to negotiation if its 34,000 members were given their own contract .
deutsche bahn wants a standard agreement across the sector and has rejected the possibility of a separate deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some passengers are choosing to fly instead of risking train delays concerns have been raised that , should gdl get its way , this could lead other unions to fragment and push up labor costs by encouraging workers to demand separate wage agreements . airlines , car rentals benefit from strike eastern germany is hit the hardest by the strike , where only about 10 percent of trains were running on thursday .
many train drivers belong to gdl in the region .
in western germany , about half of the trains were reportedly in service . with the strike extended to passenger trains , busses had been brought in to replace cancelled local trains .
many commuters were expected to go by car , leading to heavier traffic on the motorways . car-rental agencies and discount airlines reported higher bookings as stranded travelers sought alternative means of transportation .
on some routes , reservations had risen by 15 to 30 percent , an air berlin spokeswoman told the daily berliner zeitung . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 , to include passenger as well as freight trains .
the economic ramifications are already being felt . the sixth national rail stopping in the three-month dispute between deutsche bahn and the gdl train drivers ' unions began wednesday afternoon with freight trains and escalated early thursday to include passenger trains . " even without exactly quantifying it , the rail strike does have an economic effect and is a burden on an otherwise positive economy , " government spokesman thomas steg said at a news conference in berlin on wednesday . economists have estimated that the freight train strike costs 50 million euros -lrb- $ 73.3 million -rrb- per day .
if the current strike were to continue for more than a week , losses could rise to 500 million euros daily , according to reports .
the gdl , however , has said the industrial action would end on 2:00 a.m. on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi had to halt production due to missing parts the gdl has been trying to force the deutsche bahn into " an unconditional surrender , " deutsche bahn 's human resources manager karl-friedrich rausch told broadcaster ard .
" that wo n't happen . " " if we give in now , the damage to the economy would be even greater , " he said . lack of supplies leads to less work neighboring european countries have also been affected by the strike . the audi factory in brussels , cancelled its early shift thursday morning because parts that were due to be delivered from germany by train had not arrived .
some 800 workers stayed at home .
reduced work hours were expected elsewhere as well . " thousands of workers are threatened by reductions because supplies are lacking , " ludwig georg braun , president of the german chambers of industry and commerce , told germany 's daily bild newspaper . freight trains from germany into france had also been suspended thursday morning .
the germany-wide strike coincides with a rail strike in france over pension reform , compounding the situation there . backup at ports leads to heavy losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freight containers are piling up at the hamburg port germany 's northern ports are scrambling to find extra space to store freight containers waiting for trains or alternative means of transport .
about 30 percent of the goods that pass through hamburg 's heavily trafficked port are usually transported by train . " if the seaports are blocked , the daily economic damage will exceed 500 million euros , " adolf zobel from the national logistics association bgl told the daily passauer neue presse .
" it could reach as much as 2 billion euros a day in extreme cases . "
the steel , automotive and chemical industries are particularly affected , he said . concern over precedence for fragmented unions gdl , one of several train drivers ' unions in germany , says that its members do not receive fair pay compared to other european rail companies .
deutsche bahn agreed in july to a 4.5 percent pay increase for 195,000 rail workers from other unions . gdl initially demanded a 31 percent pay increase , but has said this would be open to negotiation if its 34,000 members were given their own contract .
deutsche bahn wants a standard agreement across the sector and has rejected the possibility of a separate deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some passengers are choosing to fly instead of risking train delays concerns have been raised that , should gdl get its way , this could lead other unions to fragment and push up labor costs by encouraging workers to demand separate wage agreements . airlines , car rentals benefit from strike eastern germany is hit the hardest by the strike , where only about 10 percent of trains were running on thursday .
many train drivers belong to gdl in the region .
in western germany , about half of the trains were reportedly in service . with the strike extended to passenger trains , busses had been brought in to replace cancelled local trains .
many commuters were expected to go by car , leading to heavier traffic on the motorways . car-rental agencies and discount airlines reported higher bookings as stranded travelers sought alternative means of transportation .
on some routes , reservations had risen by 15 to 30 percent , an air berlin spokeswoman told the daily berliner zeitung . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if the israeli government wants to talk formally to the german government , we will not refuse to hold talks of this nature , " government spokesman thomas steg on wednesday , nov .
14 , said in response to comments made by israeli pensions minister rafi eitan to an israeli newspaper last week . " there has been a continuous policy over the past decades that all german governments have always been prepared to hold negotiations , " said steg , adding that there had as yet been no formal approach from israel on the matter .
" in israel there is now a situation , a phenomenon of immigration of jews from russia and the former soviet republics to israel that was not foreseeable in the discussions in the 1950s and 1960s .
it remains to be seen whether this should lead to new negotiations . " eitan said israel wanted to reopen the 1952 luxembourg agreement with germany granting reparations for holocaust survivors in remarks published last friday . russian jews increase the strain on the state bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eitan said events unforeseen in 1952 made previous agreements outdated the pensions minister said the deal failed to take into account the longevity of the survivors or the arrival of the 175,000 who emigrated from the former soviet union . subsequently his spokeswoman , elle baror , said the minister did not wish to reopen the agreement , but rather wanted teams from israel and germany to meet in order to discuss ways of finding money to cover expenses which were not taken into account when the original deals were signed . a spokesman for german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said talks on the issue were not on the agenda when schäuble visits israel on thursday and friday . holocaust survivors ' associations welcome german news news of germany 's willingness to address the topic of increased reparations should israel make approaches was welcomed by the head of an association which oversees holocaust survivors ' organizations in israel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : survivors need help in making ends meet , says flug " we are very happy with berlin 's attitude , which shows continued german concern for the fate of victims of the nazi regime , " noah flug , himself a holocaust survivor , told reporters . flug added that he would meet germany 's finance minister peer steinbrück during his visit to israel next week . " i welcome the chance to be able to explain to the german minister the demographic changes that have taken place in recent years , " he said .
" the health of survivors continues to worsen because most of them are over 80 . " the most useful aspect on any reparation revision would be if germany were to pay towards the increased expenses of holocaust survivors , flug said . critics say israel can support its own the media in israel has been critical of the expected move to ask germany to provide additional money .
many commentators say modern israel has the financial clout to take care of the ageing jewish survivors of the nazis without asking germany for extra help . germany has so far paid a total of 65 billion euros -lrb- $ 95 billion -rrb- , or about 800 euros per german national , according to flug . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 , to include passenger as well as freight trains .
the economic ramifications are already being felt . the sixth national rail stopping in the three-month dispute between deutsche bahn and the gdl train drivers ' unions began wednesday afternoon with freight trains and escalated early thursday to include passenger trains . " even without exactly quantifying it , the rail strike does have an economic effect and is a burden on an otherwise positive economy , " government spokesman thomas steg said at a news conference in berlin on wednesday . economists have estimated that the freight train strike costs 50 million euros -lrb- $ 73.3 million -rrb- per day .
if the current strike were to continue for more than a week , losses could rise to 500 million euros daily , according to reports .
the gdl , however , has said the industrial action would end on 2:00 a.m. on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi had to halt production due to missing parts the gdl has been trying to force the deutsche bahn into " an unconditional surrender , " deutsche bahn 's human resources manager karl-friedrich rausch told broadcaster ard .
" that wo n't happen . " " if we give in now , the damage to the economy would be even greater , " he said . lack of supplies leads to less work neighboring european countries have also been affected by the strike . the audi factory in brussels , cancelled its early shift thursday morning because parts that were due to be delivered from germany by train had not arrived .
some 800 workers stayed at home .
reduced work hours were expected elsewhere as well . " thousands of workers are threatened by reductions because supplies are lacking , " ludwig georg braun , president of the german chambers of industry and commerce , told germany 's daily bild newspaper . freight trains from germany into france had also been suspended thursday morning .
the germany-wide strike coincides with a rail strike in france over pension reform , compounding the situation there . backup at ports leads to heavy losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freight containers are piling up at the hamburg port germany 's northern ports are scrambling to find extra space to store freight containers waiting for trains or alternative means of transport .
about 30 percent of the goods that pass through hamburg 's heavily trafficked port are usually transported by train . " if the seaports are blocked , the daily economic damage will exceed 500 million euros , " adolf zobel from the national logistics association bgl told the daily passauer neue presse .
" it could reach as much as 2 billion euros a day in extreme cases . "
the steel , automotive and chemical industries are particularly affected , he said . concern over precedence for fragmented unions gdl , one of several train drivers ' unions in germany , says that its members do not receive fair pay compared to other european rail companies .
deutsche bahn agreed in july to a 4.5 percent pay increase for 195,000 rail workers from other unions . gdl initially demanded a 31 percent pay increase , but has said this would be open to negotiation if its 34,000 members were given their own contract .
deutsche bahn wants a standard agreement across the sector and has rejected the possibility of a separate deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some passengers are choosing to fly instead of risking train delays concerns have been raised that , should gdl get its way , this could lead other unions to fragment and push up labor costs by encouraging workers to demand separate wage agreements . airlines , car rentals benefit from strike eastern germany is hit the hardest by the strike , where only about 10 percent of trains were running on thursday .
many train drivers belong to gdl in the region .
in western germany , about half of the trains were reportedly in service . with the strike extended to passenger trains , busses had been brought in to replace cancelled local trains .
many commuters were expected to go by car , leading to heavier traffic on the motorways . car-rental agencies and discount airlines reported higher bookings as stranded travelers sought alternative means of transportation .

15 , by the brussels-based european federation for transport and environment -lrb- t & e -rrb- , ranking in as europe 's biggest polluters .
average co2 emissions increased between 2005 and 2006 , for some of the germany 's major car brands . " germany 's fine automotive engineers should be focusing on making cars leaner and more fuel efficient , " said t & e director jos dings .
" launching one or two ' eco ' models is not enough to meet the challenges of climate change , rising fuel prices and europe 's increasing dependence on imported oil . " worst grades for daimler , bmw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co2 emissions is directly related to the weight of the vehicle daimler took last place in the co2 emissions ranking , with a reported increase of 2.5 percent in its fleet 's average emissions between 2005 and 2006 .
volkswagen was also found to have an emissions hike of 0.9 percent .
suzuki , whose co2 emissions increased by 1.8 percent , was the only other manufacture among the 14 in the study that averaged higher pollution rates . among the german carmakers , only bmw reported an average co2 reduction -lrb- 2.5 percent -rrb- , but was still ranked second to last by the study with a fleet average of 184 grams / kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- of emissions .
the german group of daimler , vw and bmw had an overall increase of co2 emission of 0.6 percent and none of the german manufactures emitted less than the european average of 162 g / km in 2006 , according to the report . france , italy take the lead overall , france 's psa peugeot citroen sold the lowest emitting cars in europe in 2006 with a fleet average of 142 g / km , representing a 2.7 percent decrease over 2005 .
fiat of italy and france 's renault group followed with 144 g / km and 147 g / km , respectively . toyota had the largest drop in emissions over the one-year period - 5 percent - and a relatively low fleet average of 153 g / km .
german cars emitted on average 173 g / km in 2006 . the study , which only included carmakers that had sold at least 200,000 vehicles in europe in 2006 , revealed that the weight of vehicle is directly proportional to the amount of co2 it emits . t & e said that daimler 's poor performance in the co2 study could largely be attributed to the 4.1 percent average weight increase in its fleet between 2005 and 2006 . balancing act between eu , car lobbies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been a major proponent of climate protection " it 's ironic that the country that did so much to get a european consensus on new climate targets earlier this year is also home to the carmakers that are holding back progress on one of the most important ways of achieving them , " said dings . climate issues had topped germany 's agenda during its eu presidency in the first half of 2007 , but pressure from automotive lobbies has hindered stringent co2 limits on cars . in 1994 , the european union set a goal of an average emission level of 120 g / km for new cars by 2012 , but the amount was adjusted to 130 g / km last month .
should german carmakers meet the target , which experts have said is unlikely , it would represent a 25 percent drop in co2 emissions . the eu 's recent upward revision was seen as a blow to german chancellor angela merkel 's attempts to give germany a leading role in the fight against climate change . a recent proposal by the german government to implement a sliding vehicle tax based on co2 emissions - and a tax exemption for particularly low-pollutant cars - may lead consumers to put added pressure on manufacturers .
if approved , the law would go into effect in 2009 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the economic ramifications are already being felt . the sixth national rail stopping in the three-month dispute between deutsche bahn and the gdl train drivers ' unions began wednesday afternoon with freight trains and escalated early thursday to include passenger trains . " even without exactly quantifying it , the rail strike does have an economic effect and is a burden on an otherwise positive economy , " government spokesman thomas steg said at a news conference in berlin on wednesday . economists have estimated that the freight train strike costs 50 million euros -lrb- $ 73.3 million -rrb- per day .
if the current strike were to continue for more than a week , losses could rise to 500 million euros daily , according to reports .
the gdl , however , has said the industrial action would end on 2:00 a.m. on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi had to halt production due to missing parts the gdl has been trying to force the deutsche bahn into " an unconditional surrender , " deutsche bahn 's human resources manager karl-friedrich rausch told broadcaster ard .
" that wo n't happen . " " if we give in now , the damage to the economy would be even greater , " he said . lack of supplies leads to less work neighboring european countries have also been affected by the strike . the audi factory in brussels , cancelled its early shift thursday morning because parts that were due to be delivered from germany by train had not arrived .
some 800 workers stayed at home .
reduced work hours were expected elsewhere as well . " thousands of workers are threatened by reductions because supplies are lacking , " ludwig georg braun , president of the german chambers of industry and commerce , told germany 's daily bild newspaper . freight trains from germany into france had also been suspended thursday morning .

the steel , automotive and chemical industries are particularly affected , he said . concern over precedence for fragmented unions gdl , one of several train drivers ' unions in germany , says that its members do not receive fair pay compared to other european rail companies .
deutsche bahn agreed in july to a 4.5 percent pay increase for 195,000 rail workers from other unions . gdl initially demanded a 31 percent pay increase , but has said this would be open to negotiation if its 34,000 members were given their own contract .
deutsche bahn wants a standard agreement across the sector and has rejected the possibility of a separate deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some passengers are choosing to fly instead of risking train delays concerns have been raised that , should gdl get its way , this could lead other unions to fragment and push up labor costs by encouraging workers to demand separate wage agreements . airlines , car rentals benefit from strike eastern germany is hit the hardest by the strike , where only about 10 percent of trains were running on thursday .

volkswagen was also found to have an emissions hike of 0.9 percent .

the german group of daimler , vw and bmw had an overall increase of co2 emission of 0.6 percent and none of the german manufactures emitted less than the european average of 162 g / km in 2006 , according to the report . france , italy take the lead overall , france 's psa peugeot citroen sold the lowest emitting cars in europe in 2006 with a fleet average of 142 g / km , representing a 2.7 percent decrease over 2005 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 15.11.2007 german train drivers ' strike a blow to europe 's economy großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : when the wheels on the train do n't go round , neither do those on the economy the biggest train drivers ' strike in the history of german rail operator deutsche bahn was extended on thursday , nov .
15 , to include passenger as well as freight trains .
the economic ramifications are already being felt . the sixth national rail stopping in the three-month dispute between deutsche bahn and the gdl train drivers ' unions began wednesday afternoon with freight trains and escalated early thursday to include passenger trains . " even without exactly quantifying it , the rail strike does have an economic effect and is a burden on an otherwise positive economy , " government spokesman thomas steg said at a news conference in berlin on wednesday . economists have estimated that the freight train strike costs 50 million euros -lrb- $ 73.3 million -rrb- per day .
if the current strike were to continue for more than a week , losses could rise to 500 million euros daily , according to reports .
the gdl , however , has said the industrial action would end on 2:00 a.m. on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi had to halt production due to missing parts the gdl has been trying to force the deutsche bahn into " an unconditional surrender , " deutsche bahn 's human resources manager karl-friedrich rausch told broadcaster ard .
" that wo n't happen . " " if we give in now , the damage to the economy would be even greater , " he said . lack of supplies leads to less work neighboring european countries have also been affected by the strike . the audi factory in brussels , cancelled its early shift thursday morning because parts that were due to be delivered from germany by train had not arrived .
some 800 workers stayed at home .
reduced work hours were expected elsewhere as well . " thousands of workers are threatened by reductions because supplies are lacking , " ludwig georg braun , president of the german chambers of industry and commerce , told germany 's daily bild newspaper . freight trains from germany into france had also been suspended thursday morning .
the germany-wide strike coincides with a rail strike in france over pension reform , compounding the situation there . backup at ports leads to heavy losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freight containers are piling up at the hamburg port germany 's northern ports are scrambling to find extra space to store freight containers waiting for trains or alternative means of transport .
about 30 percent of the goods that pass through hamburg 's heavily trafficked port are usually transported by train . " if the seaports are blocked , the daily economic damage will exceed 500 million euros , " adolf zobel from the national logistics association bgl told the daily passauer neue presse .
" it could reach as much as 2 billion euros a day in extreme cases . "
the steel , automotive and chemical industries are particularly affected , he said . concern over precedence for fragmented unions gdl , one of several train drivers ' unions in germany , says that its members do not receive fair pay compared to other european rail companies .
deutsche bahn agreed in july to a 4.5 percent pay increase for 195,000 rail workers from other unions . gdl initially demanded a 31 percent pay increase , but has said this would be open to negotiation if its 34,000 members were given their own contract .
deutsche bahn wants a standard agreement across the sector and has rejected the possibility of a separate deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some passengers are choosing to fly instead of risking train delays concerns have been raised that , should gdl get its way , this could lead other unions to fragment and push up labor costs by encouraging workers to demand separate wage agreements . airlines , car rentals benefit from strike eastern germany is hit the hardest by the strike , where only about 10 percent of trains were running on thursday .
many train drivers belong to gdl in the region .
in western germany , about half of the trains were reportedly in service . with the strike extended to passenger trains , busses had been brought in to replace cancelled local trains .
many commuters were expected to go by car , leading to heavier traffic on the motorways . car-rental agencies and discount airlines reported higher bookings as stranded travelers sought alternative means of transportation .
on some routes , reservations had risen by 15 to 30 percent , an air berlin spokeswoman told the daily berliner zeitung . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 , to include passenger as well as freight trains .
the economic ramifications are already being felt . the sixth national rail stopping in the three-month dispute between deutsche bahn and the gdl train drivers ' unions began wednesday afternoon with freight trains and escalated early thursday to include passenger trains . " even without exactly quantifying it , the rail strike does have an economic effect and is a burden on an otherwise positive economy , " government spokesman thomas steg said at a news conference in berlin on wednesday . economists have estimated that the freight train strike costs 50 million euros -lrb- $ 73.3 million -rrb- per day .
if the current strike were to continue for more than a week , losses could rise to 500 million euros daily , according to reports .
the gdl , however , has said the industrial action would end on 2:00 a.m. on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi had to halt production due to missing parts the gdl has been trying to force the deutsche bahn into " an unconditional surrender , " deutsche bahn 's human resources manager karl-friedrich rausch told broadcaster ard .
" that wo n't happen . " " if we give in now , the damage to the economy would be even greater , " he said . lack of supplies leads to less work neighboring european countries have also been affected by the strike . the audi factory in brussels , cancelled its early shift thursday morning because parts that were due to be delivered from germany by train had not arrived .
some 800 workers stayed at home .
reduced work hours were expected elsewhere as well . " thousands of workers are threatened by reductions because supplies are lacking , " ludwig georg braun , president of the german chambers of industry and commerce , told germany 's daily bild newspaper . freight trains from germany into france had also been suspended thursday morning .
the germany-wide strike coincides with a rail strike in france over pension reform , compounding the situation there . backup at ports leads to heavy losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freight containers are piling up at the hamburg port germany 's northern ports are scrambling to find extra space to store freight containers waiting for trains or alternative means of transport .
about 30 percent of the goods that pass through hamburg 's heavily trafficked port are usually transported by train . " if the seaports are blocked , the daily economic damage will exceed 500 million euros , " adolf zobel from the national logistics association bgl told the daily passauer neue presse .
" it could reach as much as 2 billion euros a day in extreme cases . "
the steel , automotive and chemical industries are particularly affected , he said . concern over precedence for fragmented unions gdl , one of several train drivers ' unions in germany , says that its members do not receive fair pay compared to other european rail companies .
deutsche bahn agreed in july to a 4.5 percent pay increase for 195,000 rail workers from other unions . gdl initially demanded a 31 percent pay increase , but has said this would be open to negotiation if its 34,000 members were given their own contract .
deutsche bahn wants a standard agreement across the sector and has rejected the possibility of a separate deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some passengers are choosing to fly instead of risking train delays concerns have been raised that , should gdl get its way , this could lead other unions to fragment and push up labor costs by encouraging workers to demand separate wage agreements . airlines , car rentals benefit from strike eastern germany is hit the hardest by the strike , where only about 10 percent of trains were running on thursday .
many train drivers belong to gdl in the region .
in western germany , about half of the trains were reportedly in service . with the strike extended to passenger trains , busses had been brought in to replace cancelled local trains .
many commuters were expected to go by car , leading to heavier traffic on the motorways . car-rental agencies and discount airlines reported higher bookings as stranded travelers sought alternative means of transportation .
on some routes , reservations had risen by 15 to 30 percent , an air berlin spokeswoman told the daily berliner zeitung . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.11.2007 train drivers union threatens to strike until christmas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the snow in germany is likely to get deeper before the bahn and the union reach a deal deutsche bahn filed suit for 5 million euros worth of damages as the longest and most widespread strike in the history of german rail severely affected goods and passenger traffic throughout the country . the strike by train drivers organized in the gdl union virtually paralyzed regional and goods traffic in the east of the country , with state-owned rail company deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- providing only basic services to keep essential goods traffic flowing . in western germany , around 50 percent of regional services were hit , while express trains were less affected .
in eastern regions of the country , however , many more passengers were left stranded with 70 percent to 80 percent of regional trains cancelled . a db spokesman confirmed the company had initiated court proceedings , suing gdl for 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.5 million -rrb- .
the case relates to a previous strike called in july but could also set a precedent for thursday 's labor action . unlimited strikes could start next week bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rail strike spread from cargo to passenger trains early thursday morning the gdl , in which some three quarters of germany 's 20,000 train drivers are organized , has raised the stakes in the seven-month pay and conditions dispute , targeting goods , regional and long-distance traffic simultaneously .
about 3,000 union members are reported to have walked out . gdl deputy chairman clause weselsky warned thursday that an unlimited strike could start as early as next week .
the union said it was prepared to strike until christmas if the bahn did n't give in to its demands . the current strike , which hit goods traffic from midday wednesday and passenger services from 2:00 a.m.
thursday , is set to end at 2:00 a.m.
saturday . despite carmaker audi closing a plant in brussels due to lack of components , economists were divided on the cost of the strike .
while some said limited strikes would not cause noticeable damage to the german economy other maintained a freight strike costs 50 million euros per day , with costs skyrocketing to 500 million euros daily if train drivers stay off the job longer than a week . sympathy waning for union ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some passengers are starting to get fed up with the lack of departures reports on the public 's support in the labor dispute were split .
unscientific polls taken by news organizations at train stations showed overall support for the train drivers , but one professional poll indicated that sympathy for the union is dropping . a forsa poll for the german mass-market daily bild , showed 45 percent of those asked agree with the gdl , . " any compromise must start with an improved offer , " weselsky said .
db 's current offer did not meet the gdl 's demand for a separate contract from other workers and boosted pay only through increased hours , he added . the gdl stuck by its position of refusing to negotiate on this basis , weselsky said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 15.11.2007 european parliament 's far-right bloc collapses großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alessandra mussolini 's comments led to the its group disbanding comments by the granddaughter of italian fascist dictator benito mussolini have proved to be the final nail in the coffin of the far-right identity , tradition and sovereignty -lrb- its -rrb- group in the european parliament . alessandra mussolini , an italian member of the european parliament -lrb- mep -rrb- , caused a storm last week when she described romanians as " habitual lawbreakers " and called for the romanian ambassador to italy to be expelled .
her comments , reported in a bucharest newspaper , led to five romanian legislators leaving the its .
on wednesday , nov .
14 , the meps from the greater romania party confirmed that they had quit , leaving the its with just 18 members , two less than the minimum needed for an official presence in the parliament .
" the greater romania party withdraws from the its group of the european parliament as a sign of protest against the xenophobic attitude and the insults directed toward romanian people by ms. alessandra mussolini , " the romanian statement to parliament read .
" the straw that broke the camel 's back , " said romanian mep and former its deputy chairman eugen mihaescu in a statement , was the " unacceptable amalgam " mussolini made " between criminal gypsies and the entire romanian population . "
news brings happy response from other meps eu assembly vice president edward mcmillan-scott announced the end of the its to loud applause , stating that the group had been disbanded because it fell short of the required number of meps needed to constitute a political group eligible for funds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin schulz welcomed the news of the its demise " we are happy that this group , which does not belong in european democracy , has been dissolved , " martin schulz , a german socialist mep once branded a nazi concentration camp guard by former italian premier silvio berlusconi , told reporters after the announcement .
" the good news is that the -lsb- grouping -rsb- of the ultra-nationalists no longer exists and can not use the money of the european taxpayer to support its xenophobia and neo-fascism . "
" this collection of unsavory european politicians were united only by hatred - be it of other races , nationalities , sexualities or , ironically , the eu , " british green mep jean lambert added .

volkswagen was also found to have an emissions hike of 0.9 percent .

should german carmakers meet the target , which experts have said is unlikely , it would represent a 25 percent drop in co2 emissions . the eu 's recent upward revision was seen as a blow to german chancellor angela merkel 's attempts to give germany a leading role in the fight against climate change . a recent proposal by the german government to implement a sliding vehicle tax based on co2 emissions - and a tax exemption for particularly low-pollutant cars - may lead consumers to put added pressure on manufacturers .

a fondness for big , heavy cars is responsible for the hike , according to a european report . german cars scored poorly in an emissions study published thursday , nov .
15 , by the brussels-based european federation for transport and environment -lrb- t & e -rrb- , ranking in as europe 's biggest polluters .
average co2 emissions increased between 2005 and 2006 , for some of the germany 's major car brands . " germany 's fine automotive engineers should be focusing on making cars leaner and more fuel efficient , " said t & e director jos dings .
" launching one or two ' eco ' models is not enough to meet the challenges of climate change , rising fuel prices and europe 's increasing dependence on imported oil . " worst grades for daimler , bmw bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co2 emissions is directly related to the weight of the vehicle daimler took last place in the co2 emissions ranking , with a reported increase of 2.5 percent in its fleet 's average emissions between 2005 and 2006 .
volkswagen was also found to have an emissions hike of 0.9 percent .
suzuki , whose co2 emissions increased by 1.8 percent , was the only other manufacture among the 14 in the study that averaged higher pollution rates . among the german carmakers , only bmw reported an average co2 reduction -lrb- 2.5 percent -rrb- , but was still ranked second to last by the study with a fleet average of 184 grams / kilometer -lrb- g / km -rrb- of emissions .
the german group of daimler , vw and bmw had an overall increase of co2 emission of 0.6 percent and none of the german manufactures emitted less than the european average of 162 g / km in 2006 , according to the report . france , italy take the lead overall , france 's psa peugeot citroen sold the lowest emitting cars in europe in 2006 with a fleet average of 142 g / km , representing a 2.7 percent decrease over 2005 .
fiat of italy and france 's renault group followed with 144 g / km and 147 g / km , respectively . toyota had the largest drop in emissions over the one-year period - 5 percent - and a relatively low fleet average of 153 g / km .
german cars emitted on average 173 g / km in 2006 . the study , which only included carmakers that had sold at least 200,000 vehicles in europe in 2006 , revealed that the weight of vehicle is directly proportional to the amount of co2 it emits . t & e said that daimler 's poor performance in the co2 study could largely be attributed to the 4.1 percent average weight increase in its fleet between 2005 and 2006 . balancing act between eu , car lobbies bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has been a major proponent of climate protection " it 's ironic that the country that did so much to get a european consensus on new climate targets earlier this year is also home to the carmakers that are holding back progress on one of the most important ways of achieving them , " said dings . climate issues had topped germany 's agenda during its eu presidency in the first half of 2007 , but pressure from automotive lobbies has hindered stringent co2 limits on cars . in 1994 , the european union set a goal of an average emission level of 120 g / km for new cars by 2012 , but the amount was adjusted to 130 g / km last month .
should german carmakers meet the target , which experts have said is unlikely , it would represent a 25 percent drop in co2 emissions . the eu 's recent upward revision was seen as a blow to german chancellor angela merkel 's attempts to give germany a leading role in the fight against climate change . a recent proposal by the german government to implement a sliding vehicle tax based on co2 emissions - and a tax exemption for particularly low-pollutant cars - may lead consumers to put added pressure on manufacturers .

her comments , reported in a bucharest newspaper , led to five romanian legislators leaving the its .
on wednesday , nov .
14 , the meps from the greater romania party confirmed that they had quit , leaving the its with just 18 members , two less than the minimum needed for an official presence in the parliament .
" the greater romania party withdraws from the its group of the european parliament as a sign of protest against the xenophobic attitude and the insults directed toward romanian people by ms. alessandra mussolini , " the romanian statement to parliament read .
" the straw that broke the camel 's back , " said romanian mep and former its deputy chairman eugen mihaescu in a statement , was the " unacceptable amalgam " mussolini made " between criminal gypsies and the entire romanian population . "
news brings happy response from other meps eu assembly vice president edward mcmillan-scott announced the end of the its to loud applause , stating that the group had been disbanded because it fell short of the required number of meps needed to constitute a political group eligible for funds .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : martin schulz welcomed the news of the its demise " we are happy that this group , which does not belong in european democracy , has been dissolved , " martin schulz , a german socialist mep once branded a nazi concentration camp guard by former italian premier silvio berlusconi , told reporters after the announcement .
" the good news is that the -lsb- grouping -rsb- of the ultra-nationalists no longer exists and can not use the money of the european taxpayer to support its xenophobia and neo-fascism . "
" this collection of unsavory european politicians were united only by hatred - be it of other races , nationalities , sexualities or , ironically , the eu , " british green mep jean lambert added .
" it was only a matter of time before they succumbed to a hatred of each other as well . "
the reaction to the news summed up the widespread opposition to the euroskeptic group , which was formed in january when the accession of romania and bulgaria to the eu brought several new far-right meps into the parliament .
far-right 's influence curtailed by boycotts the its had failed to gain a prominent position on any of the influential committees during its short existence after other main groupings joined forces to boycott them .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right groups came under the its banner at the parliament its was widely regarded as the most xenophobic and anti-eu group in the european parliament , uniting far-right parties such as france 's national front and belgium 's vlaams belang .
its dissolution deprives them of a voice as well as eu funds .
the its had been battling to survive ever since mussolini 's comments came to light on nov .
8 , in the midst of heated debate in italy over the alleged crimes committed by romanian migrants .
that debate had been sparked by the murder of an italian woman that was alleged to have been committed by a romanian .
party leaders had been locked in negotiations in a last-ditch effort to save the its and had considered expelling mussolini to placate the romanians .
however , her comments had created more damage than first thought .
" it looks like she went too far , " a parliament source told reuters .
" also mussolini was significant for them from a publicity point of view , so that was also a factor in the talks . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

15 , to include passenger as well as freight trains .
the economic ramifications are already being felt . the sixth national rail stopping in the three-month dispute between deutsche bahn and the gdl train drivers ' unions began wednesday afternoon with freight trains and escalated early thursday to include passenger trains . " even without exactly quantifying it , the rail strike does have an economic effect and is a burden on an otherwise positive economy , " government spokesman thomas steg said at a news conference in berlin on wednesday . economists have estimated that the freight train strike costs 50 million euros -lrb- $ 73.3 million -rrb- per day .
if the current strike were to continue for more than a week , losses could rise to 500 million euros daily , according to reports .
the gdl , however , has said the industrial action would end on 2:00 a.m. on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : audi had to halt production due to missing parts the gdl has been trying to force the deutsche bahn into " an unconditional surrender , " deutsche bahn 's human resources manager karl-friedrich rausch told broadcaster ard .
" that wo n't happen . " " if we give in now , the damage to the economy would be even greater , " he said . lack of supplies leads to less work neighboring european countries have also been affected by the strike . the audi factory in brussels , cancelled its early shift thursday morning because parts that were due to be delivered from germany by train had not arrived .
some 800 workers stayed at home .
reduced work hours were expected elsewhere as well . " thousands of workers are threatened by reductions because supplies are lacking , " ludwig georg braun , president of the german chambers of industry and commerce , told germany 's daily bild newspaper . freight trains from germany into france had also been suspended thursday morning .
the germany-wide strike coincides with a rail strike in france over pension reform , compounding the situation there . backup at ports leads to heavy losses bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : freight containers are piling up at the hamburg port germany 's northern ports are scrambling to find extra space to store freight containers waiting for trains or alternative means of transport .
about 30 percent of the goods that pass through hamburg 's heavily trafficked port are usually transported by train . " if the seaports are blocked , the daily economic damage will exceed 500 million euros , " adolf zobel from the national logistics association bgl told the daily passauer neue presse .
" it could reach as much as 2 billion euros a day in extreme cases . "
the steel , automotive and chemical industries are particularly affected , he said . concern over precedence for fragmented unions gdl , one of several train drivers ' unions in germany , says that its members do not receive fair pay compared to other european rail companies .
deutsche bahn agreed in july to a 4.5 percent pay increase for 195,000 rail workers from other unions . gdl initially demanded a 31 percent pay increase , but has said this would be open to negotiation if its 34,000 members were given their own contract .
deutsche bahn wants a standard agreement across the sector and has rejected the possibility of a separate deal . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some passengers are choosing to fly instead of risking train delays concerns have been raised that , should gdl get its way , this could lead other unions to fragment and push up labor costs by encouraging workers to demand separate wage agreements . airlines , car rentals benefit from strike eastern germany is hit the hardest by the strike , where only about 10 percent of trains were running on thursday .
many train drivers belong to gdl in the region .
in western germany , about half of the trains were reportedly in service . with the strike extended to passenger trains , busses had been brought in to replace cancelled local trains .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 15.11.2007 train drivers union threatens to strike until christmas großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the snow in germany is likely to get deeper before the bahn and the union reach a deal deutsche bahn filed suit for 5 million euros worth of damages as the longest and most widespread strike in the history of german rail severely affected goods and passenger traffic throughout the country . the strike by train drivers organized in the gdl union virtually paralyzed regional and goods traffic in the east of the country , with state-owned rail company deutsche bahn -lrb- db -rrb- providing only basic services to keep essential goods traffic flowing . in western germany , around 50 percent of regional services were hit , while express trains were less affected .
in eastern regions of the country , however , many more passengers were left stranded with 70 percent to 80 percent of regional trains cancelled . a db spokesman confirmed the company had initiated court proceedings , suing gdl for 5 million euros -lrb- $ 7.5 million -rrb- .
the case relates to a previous strike called in july but could also set a precedent for thursday 's labor action . unlimited strikes could start next week bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rail strike spread from cargo to passenger trains early thursday morning the gdl , in which some three quarters of germany 's 20,000 train drivers are organized , has raised the stakes in the seven-month pay and conditions dispute , targeting goods , regional and long-distance traffic simultaneously .
about 3,000 union members are reported to have walked out . gdl deputy chairman clause weselsky warned thursday that an unlimited strike could start as early as next week .
the union said it was prepared to strike until christmas if the bahn did n't give in to its demands . the current strike , which hit goods traffic from midday wednesday and passenger services from 2:00 a.m.
thursday , is set to end at 2:00 a.m.
saturday . despite carmaker audi closing a plant in brussels due to lack of components , economists were divided on the cost of the strike .
while some said limited strikes would not cause noticeable damage to the german economy other maintained a freight strike costs 50 million euros per day , with costs skyrocketing to 500 million euros daily if train drivers stay off the job longer than a week . sympathy waning for union ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some passengers are starting to get fed up with the lack of departures reports on the public 's support in the labor dispute were split .
unscientific polls taken by news organizations at train stations showed overall support for the train drivers , but one professional poll indicated that sympathy for the union is dropping . a forsa poll for the german mass-market daily bild , showed 45 percent of those asked agree with the gdl , . " any compromise must start with an improved offer , " weselsky said .
db 's current offer did not meet the gdl 's demand for a separate contract from other workers and boosted pay only through increased hours , he added . the gdl stuck by its position of refusing to negotiate on this basis , weselsky said .
db has similarly refused to budge on a separate contract for drivers . db board member karl-friedrich rausch termed the latest strike , the sixth since june , " senseless " and warned the company would not " unconditionally surrender .

the officials are investigating the 16 september incident in which 17 iraqis were shot by blackwater staff guarding state department employees .
the revelations come as the us state department 's inspector-general admits his brother is linked to blackwater .
the official admitted the link while giving evidence to congress .
members of congress are conducting an investigation into the activities of private security firms like blackwater .
the state department 's inspector-general , howard krongard , was the latest senior official called to give evidence on capitol hill .
mr krongard is responsible for state department contracts and ensuring that the department behaves ethically .
at the start of the hearing , he wanted to quash what he called ugly rumours that his own family was linked to blackwater .
he said his brother had no financial relationship with the private security firm .
astounding revelation but after a break in proceedings , his testimony dramatically changed .
" during the break , i did contact my brother ...
i learned that he had been at the -lsb- blackwater -rsb- advisory board meeting yesterday , " he said .
" i had not been aware of that and i want to state it on the record right now that i hereby recuse myself from any matters having to do with blackwater . "
that astounding revelation prompted only more questions as to why mr krongard had not previously established his brother 's links to blackwater , especially in the wake of the september 16 shootings that first put blackwater under the spotlight .
the new york times , quoting unnamed us officials , says a preliminary fbi investigation has found that at least 14 of the 17 shootings that day were unjustified and violated blackwater 's rules of engagement .
blackwater still insists its employees came under attack before opening fire .
the fbi investigation is ongoing , but the state department 's links to blackwater have already proved damaging .

" we have been working with the welsh assembly government on waiting times and the information we currently have up until the end of august is that there are 120 people in north wales who need this facility , " said mike denman , cais ' strategic planning officer .
" seventy-five per cent have alcohol problems and the rest are drugs .

council leaders say they want to build on the area 's " outstanding " eco-record by cutting the millions of bags used every year in the area .
although plastic bags would not be banned , retailers and shoppers would be encouraged to use alternatives .
this could mean more paper or reusable bags offered in shops , or distributed .
across the uk an estimated 10bn plastic bags are used every year - an average of more than 150 per person , according to the council .
the bags account for a fifth of all plastic packaging used in the uk . "
if we can support , promote and expand on these measures and work with all the retailers in the city i am sure we will be well on the way to making newport a plastic bag-free city " councillor ray truman last month newport was named as having one of the lowest ecological footprints in britain by the environmental group wwf .
research found residents were best at using public transport and reducing energy wastage at home as well as eating more locally-produced food .
if there is enough support for the plastic bag scheme , newport council plans to lobby governments in westminster and cardiff bay to push for a ban or levy on plastic bags .
ray truman , newport 's cabinet member for community safety and sustainability , said people already had the choice not to use plastic bags .
but he continued : " you can take your reusable bags shopping , specifically not ask for plastic bags at checkouts or take advantage of the bags for life that are on offer in many shops today .
" if we can support , promote and expand on these measures and work with all the retailers in the city , i am sure we will be well on the way to making newport a plastic bag-free city . "
the proposal to make newport a plastic bag-free city is part of the authority 's pride in newport campaign , which aims to protect and improve the local environment .
people are being asked to e-mail their views and opinions to rethink.rubbish @ newport.gov.uk cowbridge in the vale of glamorgan is also bidding to banish plastic bags .

ray truman , newport 's cabinet member for community safety and sustainability , said people already had the choice not to use plastic bags .

saadi , doctor , al-yarmouk hospital , baghdad " i have been working in this hospital for about eight months and the security situation has definitely improved during that time .
we used to receive about 10-15 injuries and five to 10 bodies overnight - caused by bombs or bullets .
the numbers have dropped to about two or three injuries a night and maybe just one body - or none .
this improvement started six to eight weeks ago .
i think it 's because the american and iraqi troops have started to attack the mehdi army .
they have been arresting leaders of the mehdi army and also al-qaeda .
i live in the hospital with other doctors , so nobody kills us .
we used not to go outside , now we are free to go outside anywhere we want .
i have seen many doctors leave for sweden , syria and malaysia - but we do have enough medical staff , both doctors and nurses . "
shireen , khadra district , baghdad " i live in khadra district -lsb- on the west bank of the tigris -rsb- which used to be mixed , but is mainly sunni now .
things have changed : there are fewer bombings and more shops are open .
but we still see dead bodies in the street , we still hear about militias attacking people and we still can not walk in the street after dark .
overall though , i think it is better somehow , a little easier .
the american and iraqi troops are challenging the militia - and the mehdi militia is not active .
we heard that us troops are giving $ 2,500 to people to reopen their shops .
about 20 shops opened in arabiya street last month .
most of the shops on our street are damaged .
it 's not nice , you feel no life going on . "
noor , karrada district , baghdad " the situation is better : less bombing , better shopping and people are able to travel more safely .
some of the streets which were previously closed because of bombings and insecurity are open again .
some people have returned to the houses they left when their area became dangerous .
cars and buses are moving safely through ramadi and anbar provinces on routes between baghdad , jordan and syria , even after midnight .
the reason may be due to the hard work by the government and the help of people who realised who the real enemy was - and tried to get rid of it .
somehow we feel more comfortable .
but we are still worried and we are not sure it will last . "
murtada , green zone , baghdad " on wednesday morning , for first time in three or four weeks i heard a bomb , right outside the green zone .
it has been getting better over the last three months , but for the past three weeks or more things have actually been quiet .
so , the bomb came as a surprise .
generally , in salihiya district , -lsb- near the green zone -rsb- and in karrada district , shops are opening up , flowers are being planted in the streets , pavements are being laid , and roads are being repaired .
people are also staying out at night later .
today i was in mansour district and i saw something new .
it used to be really dangerous - but today people were out shopping and they looked different , more relaxed .
i think it 's mainly because both the american and iraqi armies are working on it really hard .
people are also fed up with terrorism .
plus the mehdi army has stopped its activities .
thousands of people are returning to iraq from syria .
i was on the syria-iraqi border filming for a few days recently .
during this time i could see up to 50 coaches a day coming back from syria .
the people on board told me they felt it was safe enough to return - and they wanted to get back to their lives . "

we used to receive about 10-15 injuries and five to 10 bodies overnight - caused by bombs or bullets .
the numbers have dropped to about two or three injuries a night and maybe just one body - or none .
this improvement started six to eight weeks ago .
i think it 's because the american and iraqi troops have started to attack the mehdi army .
they have been arresting leaders of the mehdi army and also al-qaeda .
i live in the hospital with other doctors , so nobody kills us .
we used not to go outside , now we are free to go outside anywhere we want .
i have seen many doctors leave for sweden , syria and malaysia - but we do have enough medical staff , both doctors and nurses .
shireen , khadra district , baghdad recent image of shireen 's street taken on a mobile phone i live in khadra district -lsb- on the west bank of the tigris -rsb- which used to be mixed , but is mainly sunni now .
things have changed : there are fewer bombings and more shops are open .
but we still see dead bodies in the street , we still hear about militias attacking people and we still can not walk in the street after dark .
overall though , i think it is better somehow , a little easier .
the american and iraqi troops are challenging the militia - and the mehdi militia is not active .
we heard that us troops are giving $ 2,500 to people to reopen their shops .
about 20 shops opened in arabiya street last month .
most of the shops on our street are damaged .
it 's not nice , you feel no life going on .
noor , karrada district , baghdad iraqis shop for clothes in baghdad 's commercial karrada district the situation is better : less bombing , better shopping and people are able to travel more safely .
some of the streets which were previously closed because of bombings and insecurity are open again .
some people have returned to the houses they left when their area became dangerous .
cars and buses are moving safely through ramadi and anbar provinces on routes between baghdad , jordan and syria , even after midnight .
the reason may be due to the hard work by the government and the help of people who realised who the real enemy was - and tried to get rid of it .
somehow we feel more comfortable .
but we are still worried and we are not sure it will last .
murtada , green zone , baghdad on wednesday morning , for first time in three or four weeks i heard a bomb , right outside the green zone .
it has been getting better over the last three months , but for the past three weeks or more things have actually been quiet .
so , the bomb came as a surprise .
generally , in salihiya district , -lsb- near the green zone -rsb- and in karrada district , shops are opening up , flowers are being planted in the streets , pavements are being laid , and roads are being repaired .
people are also staying out at night later .
today i was in mansour district and i saw something new .
it used to be really dangerous - but today people were out shopping and they looked different , more relaxed .
i think it 's mainly because both the american and iraqi armies are working on it really hard .
people are also fed up with terrorism .
plus the mehdi army has stopped its activities .
thousands of people are returning to iraq from syria .
i was on the syria-iraqi border filming for a few days recently .
during this time i could see up to 50 coaches a day coming back from syria .
the people on board told me they felt it was safe enough to return - and they wanted to get back to their lives .

bbc news -pipe- technology -pipe- cleaning up in ' fab world ' bbc news / technology graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- 08:07 gmt , thursday , 15 november 2007 cleaning up in ' fab world ' by peter wilson the process of making silicon chips is as complex as the chips themselves .
each manufacturing plant , or " fab " , may cost billions of dollars and is a triumph of engineering .
but working inside these hi-tech plants can be a surreal experience , says dr peter wilson of the university of southampton . "
" fab world " is like no other place on earth .
its pristine white walls , secure air locks , sterile air and ethereal yellow lighting makes it seem like you have arrived in the belly of an orbiting space station .
i can still remember the first time i went there .
it was set in classic " tumbleweed " territory - a small town in arizona with just one road and the factory .
the temperature was over 100 degrees outside , with dust everywhere , but when you crossed the threshold into the plant , the air-conditioning kicked in and you felt like you were in a different world .
this is a common experience to anyone who works in the silicon manufacturing sector .
the world outside and the fab world inside are on two different planes .
the boundary can transcend geographic and political boundaries - it can become impossible to tell which country you are in , when everyone is wearing a mask , and is dressed head to foot in shapeless , white hooded-suits .
' bunny men ' outside , we worry about dirt on our shoes and wipe our feet , or perhaps wipe some dust off our laptop screen .
in fab world , we worry about a few atoms contaminating the environment .
if dust falls on the delicate silicon wafers on which chips are printed it can render them useless .
modern transistors - the tiny switches at the heart of these devices - are described in terms of the smallest feature sizes that can be made , such as a 45 nanometres , or 45 billionths of a meter .
to put this in perspective , the average human hair will be between 20 and 100 micrometers across - over a thousand times larger - and a typical dust particle will be anything from 1 to 100 micrometres .
dust and contaminants must be kept out .
the fab is a place for chips , not for people .
as a result , only the pure and the clean are given permission to penetrate its ' inner chambers .
anyone that enters must go through a strict set of procedures .
all of the trappings of the outside world must be left behind , whether clothes , jewellery or even make-up .

each manufacturing plant , or " fab " , may cost billions of dollars and is a triumph of engineering .
but working inside these hi-tech plants can be a surreal experience , says dr peter wilson of the university of southampton .
" fab world " is like no other place on earth .
its pristine white walls , secure air locks , sterile air and ethereal yellow lighting makes it seem like you have arrived in the belly of an orbiting space station .
i can still remember the first time i went there .
it was set in classic " tumbleweed " territory - a small town in arizona with just one road and the factory .
the temperature was over 100 degrees outside , with dust everywhere , but when you crossed the threshold into the plant , the air-conditioning kicked in and you felt like you were in a different world .
this is a common experience to anyone who works in the silicon manufacturing sector .
the world outside and the fab world inside are on two different planes .
the boundary can transcend geographic and political boundaries - it can become impossible to tell which country you are in , when everyone is wearing a mask , and is dressed head to foot in shapeless , white hooded-suits .
' bunny men ' outside , we worry about dirt on our shoes and wipe our feet , or perhaps wipe some dust off our laptop screen .
in fab world , we worry about a few atoms contaminating the environment .
if dust falls on the delicate silicon wafers on which chips are printed it can render them useless .
how a microchip is made microchips are built from wafers that consist of 99.9 % pure silicon .
the silicon is made from common beach sand .
the chips are made in incredibly clean environments - the air is more than 1000 times purer than that of a hospital .
the silicon wafers are produced by a specialist company and sent to the chip manufacturer for processing .
the silicon wafer consists of 4 layers .
a mask that is created during the design phase defines the cicuit pattern .
a mask is placed over the wafer , under a uv light .
patterns are repeatedly projected on the wafer , light can only reach the wafer through the openings .
the uv light reacts with the photoresist to create the circuit patterns .
impurities are then implanted into areas of the wafer to alter the electrical properties of specific regions .
this is called doping .
electrical contacts are formed by masking and etching the wafer to provide links between the different layers .
multiple layers of metal are applied to form the electrical connections between the chips 's layers .
the final chip is housed in a protective case that contains wires to connect it to the computer 's circuit boards .
back next 1 of 11 modern transistors - the tiny switches at the heart of these devices - are described in terms of the smallest feature sizes that can be made , such as a 45 nanometres , or 45 billionths of a meter .
to put this in perspective , the average human hair will be between 20 and 100 micrometers across - over a thousand times larger - and a typical dust particle will be anything from 1 to 100 micrometres .
dust and contaminants must be kept out .
the fab is a place for chips , not for people .
as a result , only the pure and the clean are given permission to penetrate its ' inner chambers .
anyone that enters must go through a strict set of procedures .
all of the trappings of the outside world must be left behind , whether clothes , jewellery or even make-up .
a series of ante-chambers serve as prep rooms where workers change into a series of gowns and gloves , collectively known as a " bunny suit " .

each manufacturing plant , or " fab " , may cost billions of dollars and is a triumph of engineering .
but working inside these hi-tech plants can be a surreal experience , says dr peter wilson of the university of southampton .
" fab world " is like no other place on earth .
its pristine white walls , secure air locks , sterile air and ethereal yellow lighting makes it seem like you have arrived in the belly of an orbiting space station .
i can still remember the first time i went there .
it was set in classic " tumbleweed " territory - a small town in arizona with just one road and the factory .
the temperature was over 100 degrees outside , with dust everywhere , but when you crossed the threshold into the plant , the air-conditioning kicked in and you felt like you were in a different world .
this is a common experience to anyone who works in the silicon manufacturing sector .
the world outside and the fab world inside are on two different planes .
the boundary can transcend geographic and political boundaries - it can become impossible to tell which country you are in , when everyone is wearing a mask , and is dressed head to foot in shapeless , white hooded-suits .
' bunny men ' outside , we worry about dirt on our shoes and wipe our feet , or perhaps wipe some dust off our laptop screen .
in fab world , we worry about a few atoms contaminating the environment .
if dust falls on the delicate silicon wafers on which chips are printed it can render them useless .
how a microchip is made microchips are built from wafers that consist of 99.9 % pure silicon .
the silicon is made from common beach sand .
the chips are made in incredibly clean environments - the air is more than 1000 times purer than that of a hospital .
the silicon wafers are produced by a specialist company and sent to the chip manufacturer for processing .
the silicon wafer consists of 4 layers .
a mask that is created during the design phase defines the cicuit pattern .
a mask is placed over the wafer , under a uv light .
patterns are repeatedly projected on the wafer , light can only reach the wafer through the openings .
the uv light reacts with the photoresist to create the circuit patterns .
impurities are then implanted into areas of the wafer to alter the electrical properties of specific regions .
this is called doping .
electrical contacts are formed by masking and etching the wafer to provide links between the different layers .
multiple layers of metal are applied to form the electrical connections between the chips 's layers .
the final chip is housed in a protective case that contains wires to connect it to the computer 's circuit boards .
back next 1 of 11 modern transistors - the tiny switches at the heart of these devices - are described in terms of the smallest feature sizes that can be made , such as a 45 nanometres , or 45 billionths of a meter .
to put this in perspective , the average human hair will be between 20 and 100 micrometers across - over a thousand times larger - and a typical dust particle will be anything from 1 to 100 micrometres .
dust and contaminants must be kept out .
the fab is a place for chips , not for people .
as a result , only the pure and the clean are given permission to penetrate its ' inner chambers .
anyone that enters must go through a strict set of procedures .
all of the trappings of the outside world must be left behind , whether clothes , jewellery or even make-up .
a series of ante-chambers serve as prep rooms where workers change into a series of gowns and gloves , collectively known as a " bunny suit " .
sticky floors make sure that no one treads in any contaminants and an air shower before entry makes certain that any loose particles are stripped away .
skin flakes , lint , hair and anything else gets sucked into the grate in the floor .
pure products and then it 's onwards into the hum of the clean rooms .
stark white walls reflect the yellow sodium lights from above and a constant breeze blows down from the ceiling taking any particles through the gridded floor .
fab world is an expensive place and , hence , it never stops peter wilson sand to silicon chip in modern fabs , ultra high tech chips are manufactured in what are known as class 1 rooms that contain just one tiny particle per metre cubed .
in contrast , a room where open heart surgery takes place may have as many as 20,000 .
everything taken in either needs to be cleaned with alcohol or specially designed .
even the paper we use to take notes is designed from a special lint-free material .
inside , humans very rarely come into contact with the rainbow-streaked discs of reflective silicon on which the chips are cut .
instead , they are there to trouble shoot and monitor that everything goes correctly .
the silicon wafers are handled on monorails that move above the fab floor and the processing is done by complex vacuum sealed robots .
the wafers enter one end of the line costing a couple of hundred dollars and appear at the other - weeks later - patterned with billions of transistors and worth tens of thousands of pounds .
the silicon itself is not made at the fab - the ultra pure ingots -lrb- up to 99.99999999 % pure -rrb- are produced and cut by specialist companies and sold to the chip makers .
the fab world 's magic is creating the incredibly complex patterns of wires and circuitry on chips the size of a postage stamp time and time again that alchemy can cost billions of dollars .
non-stop each layer of a processor is constructed using a mask which is like a stencil , to highlight the areas to be deposited , etched or doped .
each plant can cost billions of dollars nano chip designer doping involves adding impurities to the silicon to change its electrical characteristics - something which has to be done with astonishing precision .
each mask used to cost several thousand pounds but as the complexity of chips has increased , and the smallest possible feature size has reduced , the number and intricacy of these masks has increased .
in addition , the size of individual features is now smaller than the wavelength of light that used to be used to pattern them , which means the use of some clever optics is required .
the yellowish lights used inside the fab are to make sure that they do not interfere with this process .
the result of all of this is that an individual silicon integrated circuit may require masks that cost hundreds of thousands of pounds , or perhaps even millions of pounds , to produce and machines that cost a similar amount .
fab world is an expensive place and , hence , it never stops .
the plants churn out chips every single day of every year .
so called giga-fabs may process more than 100,000 wafers every month , each containing hundreds of chips .
each one of the 10mm by 10mm silicon squares is a triumph of design .
as a chip designer , the impact of the incredible complexity of fab world has led to an amazing transformation in what we can do on a single chip .
the products of this strange and surreal place have burst out of its confines and have pervaded every facet of the outside world from computers and mobile phones to aircraft and microwave ovens .
yet , incredible as it is to visit , fab world is also a place that is blissful to leave .
at the end of the day there 's no better feeling than being able to rip off the itchy bunny suit , step outside into the searing heat and once again get dirty .

each manufacturing plant , or " fab " , may cost billions of dollars and is a triumph of engineering .
but working inside these hi-tech plants can be a surreal experience , says dr peter wilson of the university of southampton .
" fab world " is like no other place on earth .
its pristine white walls , secure air locks , sterile air and ethereal yellow lighting makes it seem like you have arrived in the belly of an orbiting space station .
i can still remember the first time i went there .
it was set in classic " tumbleweed " territory - a small town in arizona with just one road and the factory .
the temperature was over 100 degrees outside , with dust everywhere , but when you crossed the threshold into the plant , the air-conditioning kicked in and you felt like you were in a different world .
this is a common experience to anyone who works in the silicon manufacturing sector .
the world outside and the fab world inside are on two different planes .
the boundary can transcend geographic and political boundaries - it can become impossible to tell which country you are in , when everyone is wearing a mask , and is dressed head to foot in shapeless , white hooded-suits .
' bunny men ' outside , we worry about dirt on our shoes and wipe our feet , or perhaps wipe some dust off our laptop screen .
in fab world , we worry about a few atoms contaminating the environment .
if dust falls on the delicate silicon wafers on which chips are printed it can render them useless .
how a microchip is made microchips are built from wafers that consist of 99.9 % pure silicon .
the silicon is made from common beach sand .
the chips are made in incredibly clean environments - the air is more than 1000 times purer than that of a hospital .
the silicon wafers are produced by a specialist company and sent to the chip manufacturer for processing .
the silicon wafer consists of 4 layers .
a mask that is created during the design phase defines the cicuit pattern .
a mask is placed over the wafer , under a uv light .
patterns are repeatedly projected on the wafer , light can only reach the wafer through the openings .
the uv light reacts with the photoresist to create the circuit patterns .
impurities are then implanted into areas of the wafer to alter the electrical properties of specific regions .
this is called doping .
electrical contacts are formed by masking and etching the wafer to provide links between the different layers .
multiple layers of metal are applied to form the electrical connections between the chips 's layers .
the final chip is housed in a protective case that contains wires to connect it to the computer 's circuit boards .
back next 1 of 11 modern transistors - the tiny switches at the heart of these devices - are described in terms of the smallest feature sizes that can be made , such as a 45 nanometres , or 45 billionths of a meter .
to put this in perspective , the average human hair will be between 20 and 100 micrometers across - over a thousand times larger - and a typical dust particle will be anything from 1 to 100 micrometres .
dust and contaminants must be kept out .
the fab is a place for chips , not for people .
as a result , only the pure and the clean are given permission to penetrate its ' inner chambers .
anyone that enters must go through a strict set of procedures .
all of the trappings of the outside world must be left behind , whether clothes , jewellery or even make-up .
a series of ante-chambers serve as prep rooms where workers change into a series of gowns and gloves , collectively known as a " bunny suit " .
sticky floors make sure that no one treads in any contaminants and an air shower before entry makes certain that any loose particles are stripped away .
skin flakes , lint , hair and anything else gets sucked into the grate in the floor .
pure products and then it 's onwards into the hum of the clean rooms .
stark white walls reflect the yellow sodium lights from above and a constant breeze blows down from the ceiling taking any particles through the gridded floor .
fab world is an expensive place and , hence , it never stops peter wilson sand to silicon chip in modern fabs , ultra high tech chips are manufactured in what are known as class 1 rooms that contain just one tiny particle per metre cubed .
in contrast , a room where open heart surgery takes place may have as many as 20,000 .
everything taken in either needs to be cleaned with alcohol or specially designed .
even the paper we use to take notes is designed from a special lint-free material .
inside , humans very rarely come into contact with the rainbow-streaked discs of reflective silicon on which the chips are cut .
instead , they are there to trouble shoot and monitor that everything goes correctly .
the silicon wafers are handled on monorails that move above the fab floor and the processing is done by complex vacuum sealed robots .
the wafers enter one end of the line costing a couple of hundred dollars and appear at the other - weeks later - patterned with billions of transistors and worth tens of thousands of pounds .
the silicon itself is not made at the fab - the ultra pure ingots -lrb- up to 99.99999999 % pure -rrb- are produced and cut by specialist companies and sold to the chip makers .
the fab world 's magic is creating the incredibly complex patterns of wires and circuitry on chips the size of a postage stamp time and time again that alchemy can cost billions of dollars .
non-stop each layer of a processor is constructed using a mask which is like a stencil , to highlight the areas to be deposited , etched or doped .
each plant can cost billions of dollars nano chip designer doping involves adding impurities to the silicon to change its electrical characteristics - something which has to be done with astonishing precision .
each mask used to cost several thousand pounds but as the complexity of chips has increased , and the smallest possible feature size has reduced , the number and intricacy of these masks has increased .
in addition , the size of individual features is now smaller than the wavelength of light that used to be used to pattern them , which means the use of some clever optics is required .
the yellowish lights used inside the fab are to make sure that they do not interfere with this process .
the result of all of this is that an individual silicon integrated circuit may require masks that cost hundreds of thousands of pounds , or perhaps even millions of pounds , to produce and machines that cost a similar amount .
fab world is an expensive place and , hence , it never stops .
the plants churn out chips every single day of every year .
so called giga-fabs may process more than 100,000 wafers every month , each containing hundreds of chips .
each one of the 10mm by 10mm silicon squares is a triumph of design .
as a chip designer , the impact of the incredible complexity of fab world has led to an amazing transformation in what we can do on a single chip .
the products of this strange and surreal place have burst out of its confines and have pervaded every facet of the outside world from computers and mobile phones to aircraft and microwave ovens .
yet , incredible as it is to visit , fab world is also a place that is blissful to leave .
at the end of the day there 's no better feeling than being able to rip off the itchy bunny suit , step outside into the searing heat and once again get dirty .
dr peter wilson is senior lecturer in electronics at the university of southampton , school of electronics and computer science .

this is called doping .
electrical contacts are formed by masking and etching the wafer to provide links between the different layers .

each manufacturing plant , or " fab " , may cost billions of dollars and is a triumph of engineering .
but working inside these hi-tech plants can be a surreal experience , says dr peter wilson of the university of southampton .
" fab world " is like no other place on earth .
its pristine white walls , secure air locks , sterile air and ethereal yellow lighting makes it seem like you have arrived in the belly of an orbiting space station .
i can still remember the first time i went there .
it was set in classic " tumbleweed " territory - a small town in arizona with just one road and the factory .
the temperature was over 100 degrees outside , with dust everywhere , but when you crossed the threshold into the plant , the air-conditioning kicked in and you felt like you were in a different world .
this is a common experience to anyone who works in the silicon manufacturing sector .
the world outside and the fab world inside are on two different planes .
the boundary can transcend geographic and political boundaries - it can become impossible to tell which country you are in , when everyone is wearing a mask , and is dressed head to foot in shapeless , white hooded-suits .
' bunny men ' outside , we worry about dirt on our shoes and wipe our feet , or perhaps wipe some dust off our laptop screen .
in fab world , we worry about a few atoms contaminating the environment .

as their latest collaboration , american gangster , is released in the uk , the new zealand-born actor says it is time his director won one himself .
washington and crowe previously co-starred in 1995 thriller virtuosity in a career spanning five decades , veteran british filmmaker sir ridley scott has received countless accolades .
he has been named best director at the baftas -lrb- for thelma and louise -rrb- and the golden globes -lrb- for gladiator -rrb- .
but , despite three nominations , sir ridley - who celebrates his 70th birthday this month - has yet to win his industry 's biggest prize : an oscar .
having taken home an academy award for his career-defining role in gladiator , russell crowe is ideally placed to offer his thoughts on what many consider a serious oversight .
" if there 's any director i know who deserves an oscar , it 's ridley scott , " he said during a recent visit to london .
" he is one of the greatest visual artists of our time and deserving of any honour that comes his way . "
with crowe joined on screen by two-time oscar recipient denzel washington , and a script by schindler 's list writer steve zaillian , many predict american gangster will be the film that breaks scott 's duck .
' cadaver connection ' it certainly boasts a fascinating story - that of frank lucas , a real-life gangster from harlem , new york who revolutionised the drug trade in the early 1970s .
lucas , a former gang lieutenant , hit on a scheme to smuggle pure heroin from south-east asia inside the coffins of us servicemen being flown back from war-torn vietnam .
in american gangster they play adversaries on either side of the law this daring scam - nicknamed " the cadaver connection " - turned him into one of the most wealthy , feared and influential criminals of his era .
" this is a guy who had $ 250 million -lrb- £ 120 million -rrb- in the bank when he was arrested in 1974 , which would be a couple of billion today , " says crowe .
" the brilliance and genius which he applied to his particular thing was equivalent to what bill gates brought to his . "
the microsoft founder might not welcome the comparison , but it is clear lucas - played by washington in sir ridley 's film - caught crowe 's imagination .
indeed , the actor reveals , it was the lucas part he wanted to play when he read zaillian 's script .
' glamorous and compelling ' instead crowe was cast as richie roberts , the new york detective who played a key role in bringing lucas to justice .
american gangster follows both their trajectories , juxtaposing lucas 's rise to power with the policeman 's dogged attempts to take him down .
scott says he hopes the film will leave audiences " fully engaged " " you ca n't have such a glamorous and compelling bad guy without bringing him to task , " the actor explains .
" as much as audiences enjoy watching a villain do his thing , once the body count starts to rise they want to know justice will prevail . "
the film marks crowe 's third collaboration with scott after gladiator and the 2006 comedy a good year .
they have since made another film together - political thriller body of lies , set for release in 2008 - and are to team up again on nottingham , a revisionist take on the robin hood myth .
" we knew when we did gladiator that we communicated really well , and that gets stronger each time we work together , " says the actor .
" he has no problem throwing responsibility my way , and i enjoy that .
i feel privileged that he wants to work with me . "
american gangster is out in the uk on 16 november .
