thirty-four women are among the prize winners . * the youngest nobel laureate , lawrence bragg , was just 25 when he accepted the prize .
he shared the 1915 nobel prize in physics with his father . * raymond david jr . , nearly 88 when he was awarded the nobel prize in physics in 2002 , was the oldest nobel laureate . * several would-be nobel recipients either declined to accept their award or were forced to decline for political reasons . jean-paul sartre , who consistently turned down all public honors , did n't accept his 1964 nobel prize in literature .
in 1973 , le duc tho was awarded the nobel peace prize jointly with us secretary of state henry kissinger for negotiating the vietnam peace accord .
tho declined the prize due to the situation in vietnam . three german nobel laureates - richard kuhn , adolf butenandt and gerhard domagk - were forbidden by adolf hitler to accept their prizes .
they received their diplomas and medals belatedly , but not the monetary award .
in 1958 , soviet authorities forced boris pasternak to return the nobel prize in literature he had initially accepted . * four individuals have been awarded two nobel prizes : john bardeen -lrb- physics 1956 , 1972 -rrb- marie curie -lrb- physics 1903 , chemistry 1911 -rrb- linus pauling -lrb- chemistry 1954 , peace 1962 -rrb- frederick sanger -lrb- chemistry 1958 , 1980 -rrb- * the nobel peace prize has been awarded three times to the international committee of the red cross -lrb- 1917 , 1944 , 1963 -rrb- and twice to the un refugee agency -lrb- 1954 , 1981 -rrb- . * together , the curies have collected more nobel prizes than any other family .
marie curie shared half of the physics prize with her husband pierre in 1903 .
their daughter irene shared the chemistry prize with her husband frederic joliot in 1935 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 , russian president vladimir putin said he is dismayed by estonia and latvia 's glorification of nazism .
europe needs to take notice , putin said . putin , speaking in moscow to the european jewish congress , said he was shocked when an annual waffen ss parade took place in latvia in march .
he added that it was disturbing that the european union has largely ignored the problems of pro-nazi groups in these countries .
" some facts which we come up against in several countries of eastern europe have provoked open astonishment and incomprehension , " putin said .
" the activities of the latvian and estonian authorities openly connive at the glorification of nazis and their accomplices .
but these facts remain unnoticed by the european union . "
in 2006 , latvian officials banned an annual parade that glorifies the latvian waffen ss against russia 's red army .
some far right supporters marched anyway .
legacy of mistrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a controversial war memorial putin 's remarks are the latest volley in a political war of words between the baltic countries and russia .
latvia , lithuania and estonia joined the european union in 2004 , in part to seek protection from their domineering former rulers in moscow .
soviet forces annexed the baltic countries during world war ii .
the war split the population between those who fought for nazi germany and those who supported russia .
in russia 's view , it liberated the countries from nazi occupation in a victory that cost it 20 million lives .
germany 's defeat is seen as an important historical event and it rejects the accusation that it occupied eastern european countries .
but many people from the baltic states see the red army 's arrival as the beginning of five decades of soviet rule .
during that time , thousands of estonians were deported to soviet prison camps and russians settled in the country .
strained relations continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paying respects animosity flared up again earlier this year when estonian authorities moved a bronze statue of a red army soldier from a downtown tallinn square and moved it to a military cemetery .
rioting caused by the decision to relocate the war memorial left one person dead and a dozen injured .
further protests by pro-kremlin youths at the estonian consulate in moscow lead to scuffles with bodyguards .
in june , estonia buried the remains of eight soviet soldiers who had been exhumed from the tallinn war memorial .
the soldiers were reburied in the estonian defense forces ' cemetery , the same place where the statue was relocated .
a month before the reburial , estonia came under massive cyber attacks , crippling government and corporate web sites for nearly three weeks .
the estonian government suggested that russia could have been behind the attacks and asked for help from nato , which agreed to investigate the incident .
russia has denied any involvement in the cyber attacks .
germany has participated in some behind-the-scenes negotiating on various issues between russia and the baltic countries , but the eu has largely refrained from inserting itself in the disputes .
russia wants an apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltics have a large population of russian minorities the situation in estonia remains volatile . russia 's eu ambassador has said that estonia still owes russia an apology for moving the monument .
without an apology for moving the monument , protests could continue , he said .
putin brought up the war memorial issue wednesday .
" we are seeing a position on the limit of hypocrisy by certain european structures over the moving of the liberation soldier monument in tallinn , " putin said .
putin noted that since estonia 's independence in 1991 , " not a single nazi criminal has been condemned . "
putin admitted there were acts of anti-semitism in russia as well as " chauvinistic , xenophobic and nationalistic demonstrations . "
moshe kantor , head of the european jewish congress , asked putin to recognize the international holocaust day , which was introduced by the united nations in november 2005 .

soviet forces annexed the baltic countries during world war ii .
the war split the population between those who fought for nazi germany and those who supported russia .
in russia 's view , it liberated the countries from nazi occupation in a victory that cost it 20 million lives .
germany 's defeat is seen as an important historical event and it rejects the accusation that it occupied eastern european countries .
but many people from the baltic states see the red army 's arrival as the beginning of five decades of soviet rule .
during that time , thousands of estonians were deported to soviet prison camps and russians settled in the country .

the soldiers were reburied in the estonian defense forces ' cemetery , the same place where the statue was relocated .
a month before the reburial , estonia came under massive cyber attacks , crippling government and corporate web sites for nearly three weeks .
the estonian government suggested that russia could have been behind the attacks and asked for help from nato , which agreed to investigate the incident .
russia has denied any involvement in the cyber attacks .
germany has participated in some behind-the-scenes negotiating on various issues between russia and the baltic countries , but the eu has largely refrained from inserting itself in the disputes .

putin brought up the war memorial issue wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 11.10.2007 german train bombing suspect appears in lebanese court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two suspects in the attempted train bombing are in separate countries the main lebanese suspect accused of plotting to blow up two trains in germany in july 2006 appeared thursday in court in beirut and was questioned by a lebanese judge , judicial sources said . during the questioning , jihad hamad admitted that he and youssef al-haj dib , who is currently in custody in germany , bought two gas canisters , wires and two bags to put them on the trains to protest caricatures of the prophet mohammed originally published in a danish newspaper .
the two suspected terrorists had placed two suitcases containing bombs on the trains .
had there not been errors in the bombs ' construction , german investigators said the explosions near the cities of hamm and koblenz would have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people , putting the plot on a much larger scale than the terrorist attacks on london in july 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suitcases used in the failed plot hamad denied that he followed any " muslim fundamentalist group or jihadist group . "
he also denied any links with the sunni muslim fundamentalist group al qaeda which is led by osama bin laden .
judge helena iskander decided to issue a warrant to the lebanese police to look into reports that saddam al-haj dib , brother of youssef , and also a suspect in the plot , was killed during the 15-week battle between militants from the fatah al-islam group and the lebanese army in northern lebanon .
associates questioned the judge also questioned three lebanese citizens who were arrested with hamad : khaled al-haj dib , ayman hadad and khalil al-bobo .
khaled al-haj dib said that his connection with hamad went back to university and he denied any links to the german bombing plot .
hadad said he met hamad in tripoli , and denied that he had any knowledge of the bombing plot or belonged to any islamic movement .
al-bobo also denied his links with the german bombing plot , but said he met saddam al-haj dib through a common friend called osama al-shahabi , who usually sent muslims to fight in iraq .
" at the time i was impressed with the way al-haj dib thinks - his jihadist thinking - and we exchanged telephone numbers , " al-bobo told the judge .
he was arrested and put in a lebanese jail because he threw a bomb at a lebanese army checkpoint in the north of the country .
the four suspects hail from areas in northern lebanon where sunni fundamentalist movements have been flourishing for the past few years .
families proclaim sons ' innocence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gas-based bombs would have killed hundreds hamad 's father shahid , who was present during the court session , told german press agency dpa that his son was a student and not a fundamentalist and that he sent his son to a christian school in tripoli , not an islamic extremist one .
shahid said he decided to send his son to germany for the better education and job opportunities that were available there .
jihad hamad turned up at his parents ' house in tripoli shortly after the attempted bombings .
jihad , who had been taking german language classes for six months in germany , explained his sudden appearance by saying that he was worried about his parents because of the july 2006 israeli war against lebanon 's hezbollah movement at the time .
jihad has given a partial confession to lebanese authorities , saying that he deposited a piece of luggage in one of the trains but was not aware of its contents .
he has also told investigators that he and al-haj dib researched bomb-making methods on the internet that could have increased the victims ' suffering in the planned attacks .
the german police have said that the publication of the caricatures of the prophet mohammed in german newspapers may have prompted jihad hamad and youssef al-haj dib to devise their plot .
lebanese chief public prosecutor said mirza has accused jihad hamad of organizing and attempting mass murder .
should he be convicted , he faces life-long imprisonment and forced labor .
the trial was adjourned until november 26 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two suspected terrorists had placed two suitcases containing bombs on the trains .
had there not been errors in the bombs ' construction , german investigators said the explosions near the cities of hamm and koblenz would have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people , putting the plot on a much larger scale than the terrorist attacks on london in july 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suitcases used in the failed plot hamad denied that he followed any " muslim fundamentalist group or jihadist group . "
he also denied any links with the sunni muslim fundamentalist group al qaeda which is led by osama bin laden .
judge helena iskander decided to issue a warrant to the lebanese police to look into reports that saddam al-haj dib , brother of youssef , and also a suspect in the plot , was killed during the 15-week battle between militants from the fatah al-islam group and the lebanese army in northern lebanon .
associates questioned the judge also questioned three lebanese citizens who were arrested with hamad : khaled al-haj dib , ayman hadad and khalil al-bobo .
khaled al-haj dib said that his connection with hamad went back to university and he denied any links to the german bombing plot .
hadad said he met hamad in tripoli , and denied that he had any knowledge of the bombing plot or belonged to any islamic movement .
al-bobo also denied his links with the german bombing plot , but said he met saddam al-haj dib through a common friend called osama al-shahabi , who usually sent muslims to fight in iraq .
" at the time i was impressed with the way al-haj dib thinks - his jihadist thinking - and we exchanged telephone numbers , " al-bobo told the judge .
he was arrested and put in a lebanese jail because he threw a bomb at a lebanese army checkpoint in the north of the country .

shahid said he decided to send his son to germany for the better education and job opportunities that were available there .
jihad hamad turned up at his parents ' house in tripoli shortly after the attempted bombings .
jihad , who had been taking german language classes for six months in germany , explained his sudden appearance by saying that he was worried about his parents because of the july 2006 israeli war against lebanon 's hezbollah movement at the time .
jihad has given a partial confession to lebanese authorities , saying that he deposited a piece of luggage in one of the trains but was not aware of its contents .
he has also told investigators that he and al-haj dib researched bomb-making methods on the internet that could have increased the victims ' suffering in the planned attacks .
the german police have said that the publication of the caricatures of the prophet mohammed in german newspapers may have prompted jihad hamad and youssef al-haj dib to devise their plot .
lebanese chief public prosecutor said mirza has accused jihad hamad of organizing and attempting mass murder .

judge helena iskander decided to issue a warrant to the lebanese police to look into reports that saddam al-haj dib , brother of youssef , and also a suspect in the plot , was killed during the 15-week battle between militants from the fatah al-islam group and the lebanese army in northern lebanon .
associates questioned the judge also questioned three lebanese citizens who were arrested with hamad : khaled al-haj dib , ayman hadad and khalil al-bobo .
khaled al-haj dib said that his connection with hamad went back to university and he denied any links to the german bombing plot .
hadad said he met hamad in tripoli , and denied that he had any knowledge of the bombing plot or belonged to any islamic movement .
al-bobo also denied his links with the german bombing plot , but said he met saddam al-haj dib through a common friend called osama al-shahabi , who usually sent muslims to fight in iraq .
" at the time i was impressed with the way al-haj dib thinks - his jihadist thinking - and we exchanged telephone numbers , " al-bobo told the judge .
he was arrested and put in a lebanese jail because he threw a bomb at a lebanese army checkpoint in the north of the country .
the four suspects hail from areas in northern lebanon where sunni fundamentalist movements have been flourishing for the past few years .
families proclaim sons ' innocence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gas-based bombs would have killed hundreds hamad 's father shahid , who was present during the court session , told german press agency dpa that his son was a student and not a fundamentalist and that he sent his son to a christian school in tripoli , not an islamic extremist one .
shahid said he decided to send his son to germany for the better education and job opportunities that were available there .
jihad hamad turned up at his parents ' house in tripoli shortly after the attempted bombings .
jihad , who had been taking german language classes for six months in germany , explained his sudden appearance by saying that he was worried about his parents because of the july 2006 israeli war against lebanon 's hezbollah movement at the time .
jihad has given a partial confession to lebanese authorities , saying that he deposited a piece of luggage in one of the trains but was not aware of its contents .
he has also told investigators that he and al-haj dib researched bomb-making methods on the internet that could have increased the victims ' suffering in the planned attacks .
the german police have said that the publication of the caricatures of the prophet mohammed in german newspapers may have prompted jihad hamad and youssef al-haj dib to devise their plot .
lebanese chief public prosecutor said mirza has accused jihad hamad of organizing and attempting mass murder .
should he be convicted , he faces life-long imprisonment and forced labor .
the trial was adjourned until november 26 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both darabi and rhayel could now be released as early as december , federal prosecutor frank wallenta said .
under german law , life sentences are reviewed by authorities after 15 years to decide whether the guilty party can be released .
the five years darabi spent in jail before he was convicted counted towards his life sentence .
when darabi was arrested for the murders , the investigation and subsequent trial sparked a diplomatic crisis between berlin and tehran with german authorities accusing the highest levels of the iranian government of responsibility for the attacks .
at the time , darabi was called an iranian secret agent .
at his sentencing in 1997 , the berlin court which tried darabi said that because of the severity of his crime , he should be held in custody beyond the usual 15 years .
thursday ’ s ruling by the federal prosecutor 's office marks a surprise reversal of that ruling .
the decision to release darabi has been criticized by the israeli government which had appealed to germany not to release the iranian .

the newspaper reported that merkel rebuffed his appeal , telling him that the authorities would follow the letter of the law .
the ha 'aretz report also claimed that israel wanted to use darabi as part of a deal brokered between israel and hezbollah in 2004 in which 400 palestinian prisoners were released in exchange for the bodies of three israeli soldiers killed in 2000 and elhanan tannenbaum , an israeli businessman .
another aspect of the deal was that darabi would be released if hezbollah offered information on the captured israeli air force navigator ron arad , but the deal fell through , the report said .

the ha 'aretz report also claimed that israel wanted to use darabi as part of a deal brokered between israel and hezbollah in 2004 in which 400 palestinian prisoners were released in exchange for the bodies of three israeli soldiers killed in 2000 and elhanan tannenbaum , an israeli businessman .
another aspect of the deal was that darabi would be released if hezbollah offered information on the captured israeli air force navigator ron arad , but the deal fell through , the report said .
iran proposed swap for german klein bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald klein served nearly all his 18-month sentence in iran there were also indications that iran , which had strived for the past 10 years to have darabi released , had darabi at the heart of a plan involving prisoner swaps .
the iranian government allegedly spoke with representatives of the german government over a deal involving jailed german fisherman donald klein who was released from prison in tehran earlier this year .
klein had been held captive since 2005 after illegally straying into iranian waters with french companion stephane lherbier while on a fishing expedition .
klein and lherbier were released in march . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

publishers are taking different approaches to google book search , with german publishers launching libreka . german publishers launched libreka , an internet book search machine of their own wednesday , oct .
10 .
they hope libreka will rival google book search while allowing them to keep control .
rüdiger salat , a board executive at holtzbrinck , the top german-based book publisher , said google might someday become a partner to publishers .
but for now it was still " more an enemy . "
google has undertaken a massive project to scan and index book content .
google scans the complete text so that users can find books which contain a specific word or phrase .
under a policy known as " opt out , " google , which is funded by online advertising , says it deletes any books from its search engine if copyright owners request it .
" opt out is not the right way , " said salat , whose group has been a key backer of libreka , the german publishers ' search engine .
a preview was launched at the frankfurt book fair wednesday .
the libreka database contains 8,000 german-language books whose publishers have explicitly " opted in " to the idea .

us publishers and authors began legal action two years ago against google .
peter olson , new york-based chief executive of the world 's biggest book publishing group , random house , said , " i think we are close to resolving our issues .
we have so much in common . "
olson , speaking in a discussion between top industry executives on the first day of the fair , said he wants to see google and publishers charge internet users small fees to see single pages of books online .
olson envisions a set-up similar to popular music downloading services such as itunes , which allow songs to be purchased individually instead of having to buy an entire album .
olson envisions a " pay-per-page " model where a reader could buy single page or chapter .
instead of buying the entire cookbook , a reader could pay for a single carrot cake recipe or get the entire desserts chapter .
giving a share to the book industry would mollify publishers , olson said .

the project was started in 2005 and has been engineered by a delhi , india software house , mps , in which holtzbrinck is a shareholder .
libreka is an offshoot of germany 's books-in-print database .
its target audience seems to be german bookstores , who could put it on their websites to help shoppers find books they want to buy .

the group said it was in negotiations about cooperation deals with the us company .

publishers are taking different approaches to google book search , with german publishers launching libreka . german publishers launched libreka , an internet book search machine of their own wednesday , oct .
10 .
they hope libreka will rival google book search while allowing them to keep control .
rüdiger salat , a board executive at holtzbrinck , the top german-based book publisher , said google might someday become a partner to publishers .
but for now it was still " more an enemy . "
google has undertaken a massive project to scan and index book content .
google scans the complete text so that users can find books which contain a specific word or phrase .
under a policy known as " opt out , " google , which is funded by online advertising , says it deletes any books from its search engine if copyright owners request it .
" opt out is not the right way , " said salat , whose group has been a key backer of libreka , the german publishers ' search engine .
a preview was launched at the frankfurt book fair wednesday .
the libreka database contains 8,000 german-language books whose publishers have explicitly " opted in " to the idea .
us publishing executive sees opportunities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has gotten into the book business while us publishers also have qualms about google 's plans to index books , one executive said that the ruckus might soon come to an end .
us publishers and authors began legal action two years ago against google .
peter olson , new york-based chief executive of the world 's biggest book publishing group , random house , said , " i think we are close to resolving our issues .
we have so much in common . "
olson , speaking in a discussion between top industry executives on the first day of the fair , said he wants to see google and publishers charge internet users small fees to see single pages of books online .
olson envisions a set-up similar to popular music downloading services such as itunes , which allow songs to be purchased individually instead of having to buy an entire album .
olson envisions a " pay-per-page " model where a reader could buy single page or chapter .
instead of buying the entire cookbook , a reader could pay for a single carrot cake recipe or get the entire desserts chapter .
giving a share to the book industry would mollify publishers , olson said .
" i think it makes sense for both sides , " said olson .

the project was started in 2005 and has been engineered by a delhi , india software house , mps , in which holtzbrinck is a shareholder .
libreka is an offshoot of germany 's books-in-print database .
its target audience seems to be german bookstores , who could put it on their websites to help shoppers find books they want to buy .
ronald schild , head of the libreka project , said publishers could decide if part or even all of a book should be freely downloadable .

some commentators have called it the " anti-google , " since it tries to keep the publishing industry in control of book searching .
at the libreka launch , the german association of publishers and booksellers denied any hostility or rivalry with google .
the group said it was in negotiations about cooperation deals with the us company .
" we should not underestimate the potential of libreka . " said jens redmer , google book search 's chief of european operations .

a new study in germany shows that their womenfolk , however , do n't see things the same way . it is accepted in some scientific circles that orangutans , and not chimpanzees , are the closest relatives to humans among the great apes .
ask a human woman about the similarities between the ginger monkeys and their own species and they are likely to add to the burgeoning evidence that man -lrb- but not necessarily woman -rrb- is but an evolutionary side-step from an orangutan .
the list appears endless at times : body hair , personal hygiene , mating techniques … if you listen to some disgruntled females you could be misled into believing that they live in a monkey house bedecked with hanging tires rather than a swanky apartment filled with the latest modern furniture .

sibu -lrb- an orangutan and not a german male -rrb- , had become a pain in the hairy backside by refusing to mate with any of the ape babes which swung his way for some primate lovin ' at the apenheul primate park in amsterdam , holland .

those also sharing sibu 's grooming and hygiene habits may be forced to fight lesser apes over the monkey bars and fling feces at the cropped and manicured males who are more likely to successfully pair up with the females .
according to the gfk survey , every second woman in germany is attracted to clean-shaven men with short hair and manicured nails .
of the 1,031 women questioned , 59.6 percent found a man with manicured nails attractive , while 50.9 percent said they did not like men with stubble on their chin .

those also sharing sibu 's grooming and hygiene habits may be forced to fight lesser apes over the monkey bars and fling feces at the cropped and manicured males who are more likely to successfully pair up with the females .
according to the gfk survey , every second woman in germany is attracted to clean-shaven men with short hair and manicured nails .
of the 1,031 women questioned , 59.6 percent found a man with manicured nails attractive , while 50.9 percent said they did not like men with stubble on their chin .

a new study in germany shows that their womenfolk , however , do n't see things the same way . it is accepted in some scientific circles that orangutans , and not chimpanzees , are the closest relatives to humans among the great apes .
ask a human woman about the similarities between the ginger monkeys and their own species and they are likely to add to the burgeoning evidence that man -lrb- but not necessarily woman -rrb- is but an evolutionary side-step from an orangutan .
the list appears endless at times : body hair , personal hygiene , mating techniques … if you listen to some disgruntled females you could be misled into believing that they live in a monkey house bedecked with hanging tires rather than a swanky apartment filled with the latest modern furniture .
as if to give women even more ammunition , another similarity between german men and orangutans was discovered only last week , courtesy of a certain knuckle-dragger called sibu .
simbu 's blonde ambition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hey baby , feel like gettin ' it on ? "
sibu -lrb- an orangutan and not a german male -rrb- , had become a pain in the hairy backside by refusing to mate with any of the ape babes which swung his way for some primate lovin ' at the apenheul primate park in amsterdam , holland .
instead - and here is where the very tenuous link to german men comes in - he preferred to go monkey nuts over the blonde female humans which attended to him .
sibu 's preference for flaxen-haired female humans , preferably tattooed , fits snugly with documented evidence which says that german gentlemen prefer blondes .
german women , however , do not share sibu 's or their menfolks ' lust for the fair-haired .
well-trimmed , dark-haired men get the nod bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim jong il ticks some , but maybe not all , the boxes a new survey of attractiveness by the gfk research institute on behalf of a german health magazine reveals that when it comes to choosing a mate , german women prefer dark-haired men to blondes .
only 17.2 percent of those questioned found blond men attractive while a total of 28.9 percent favored brown-haired men , and 34.7 percent preferred men with dark hair .
now , while this does n't appear to be such a great problem for the large number of swarthy types out there , the survey showed that german ladies require a little more than just a luxurious inky thatch from their mates .

the decision , however , comes at a time of tension with croatia in a row with italy and slovenia over fishing rights in the adriatic sea which some observers say could muddy the diplomatic waters for zagreb .
the dispute over croatia 's imposition of a fisheries protection zone and another disagreement over tracing the maritime border between slovenia and croatia could hit the membership process at any stage .

despite the row , the croatian government is confident of becoming the eu 's 28th member state and hopes to do so in 2009 .

the decision , however , comes at a time of tension with croatia in a row with italy and slovenia over fishing rights in the adriatic sea which some observers say could muddy the diplomatic waters for zagreb .
the dispute over croatia 's imposition of a fisheries protection zone and another disagreement over tracing the maritime border between slovenia and croatia could hit the membership process at any stage .
european sources said that there is a particular risk of a hiccup in the membership talks when the chapter on security and defense comes up for consideration .
despite row , croatia confident of membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn the european commission urged croatia not to activate the fisheries protection zone unilaterally , recognizing that the decision could have a negative impact on negotiations , said a spokesman for eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn .
despite the row , the croatian government is confident of becoming the eu 's 28th member state and hopes to do so in 2009 .
its progress compares very favorably with fellow eu candidate nation turkey , which began talks at the same time but has so far opened only four policy chapters due to its refusal to trade openly with eu member cyprus . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de takes a look at who and what are behind one of the most prestigious awards in the world . who was alfred nobel ? alfred nobel was born in stockholm in 1833 .
together with his father , who was an engineer , he developed the explosive nitroglycerine , which proved a commercial success . despite the danger of the project - nobel 's brother emil was killed in an experiment in 1864 - he continued his research , patenting what he called dynamite in 1867 .
the invention proved very useful in the construction industry and nobel traveled the world selling his product .
when not on the road , he diligently conducted research and registered 355 patents in his name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel was active as a chemist and physicist and pursued literature in his free time nobel 's talent as both a scientist and a businessman allowed him to amass a considerable fortune .
he was also fluent in several languages , wrote poetry and drama , and had a deep interest in philosophy and literature . how did the nobel prize come about ? after his death in 1896 , the opening of nobel 's will caused a considerable stir : he had left the majority of his money to the establishment of " prizes to those who , during the preceding year , shall have conferred the greatest benefit to mankind " in physics , chemistry , medicine , literature and peace . family members contested the will .
others were irked at the international nature of the new prizes .
the biggest shock , however , was the peace prize .
the name nobel had been associated with explosives and weapons - not with peace . nobel 's friend and former secretary countess bertha von suttner , a vocal pacifist , is credited with having had a significant impact on the millionaire , and was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1905 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel thought hard about the ramifications of his inventions for humanity " perhaps my factories will put an end to war sooner than your congresses , " he wrote the countess in 1891 .
two-and-a-half decades before world war one , nobel could n't have foreseen just how wrong he would be . because nobel had not composed his will with the help of a lawyer nor specified how the prizes should be awarded , it took five years to sort out the details before the first nobel prize could be awarded in 1901 . in 1968 , sweden 's central bank established the sveriges riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of alfred nobel .
the five original prizes are administered by the nobel foundation in stockholm . how are the winners selected ? candidates are nominated a year in advance by qualified parties in the six relevant fields .
academics , politicians , prominent scientists , previous nobel laureates and others receive personal invitations each year to nominate a candidate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertha von suttner worked for nobel for only a few months the nominators are selected in such a way so that as many different countries as possible are represented over time .
their nominations are kept secret for 50 years . in his will , alfred nobel specifically indicated five swedish institutions responsible for choosing the prize recipients in each category . the royal swedish academy of sciences has selected the economics prize laureates since 1969 . interesting facts : * 772 individuals and 19 organizations have been awarded the nobel prize , some more than once .
thirty-four women are among the prize winners . * the youngest nobel laureate , lawrence bragg , was just 25 when he accepted the prize .
he shared the 1915 nobel prize in physics with his father . * raymond david jr . , nearly 88 when he was awarded the nobel prize in physics in 2002 , was the oldest nobel laureate . * several would-be nobel recipients either declined to accept their award or were forced to decline for political reasons . jean-paul sartre , who consistently turned down all public honors , did n't accept his 1964 nobel prize in literature .
in 1973 , le duc tho was awarded the nobel peace prize jointly with us secretary of state henry kissinger for negotiating the vietnam peace accord .
tho declined the prize due to the situation in vietnam . three german nobel laureates - richard kuhn , adolf butenandt and gerhard domagk - were forbidden by adolf hitler to accept their prizes .
they received their diplomas and medals belatedly , but not the monetary award .
in 1958 , soviet authorities forced boris pasternak to return the nobel prize in literature he had initially accepted . * four individuals have been awarded two nobel prizes : john bardeen -lrb- physics 1956 , 1972 -rrb- marie curie -lrb- physics 1903 , chemistry 1911 -rrb- linus pauling -lrb- chemistry 1954 , peace 1962 -rrb- frederick sanger -lrb- chemistry 1958 , 1980 -rrb- * the nobel peace prize has been awarded three times to the international committee of the red cross -lrb- 1917 , 1944 , 1963 -rrb- and twice to the un refugee agency -lrb- 1954 , 1981 -rrb- . * together , the curies have collected more nobel prizes than any other family .
marie curie shared half of the physics prize with her husband pierre in 1903 .
their daughter irene shared the chemistry prize with her husband frederic joliot in 1935 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de takes a look at who and what are behind one of the most prestigious awards in the world . who was alfred nobel ? alfred nobel was born in stockholm in 1833 .
together with his father , who was an engineer , he developed the explosive nitroglycerine , which proved a commercial success . despite the danger of the project - nobel 's brother emil was killed in an experiment in 1864 - he continued his research , patenting what he called dynamite in 1867 .
the invention proved very useful in the construction industry and nobel traveled the world selling his product .
when not on the road , he diligently conducted research and registered 355 patents in his name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel was active as a chemist and physicist and pursued literature in his free time nobel 's talent as both a scientist and a businessman allowed him to amass a considerable fortune .
he was also fluent in several languages , wrote poetry and drama , and had a deep interest in philosophy and literature . how did the nobel prize come about ? after his death in 1896 , the opening of nobel 's will caused a considerable stir : he had left the majority of his money to the establishment of " prizes to those who , during the preceding year , shall have conferred the greatest benefit to mankind " in physics , chemistry , medicine , literature and peace . family members contested the will .
others were irked at the international nature of the new prizes .
the biggest shock , however , was the peace prize .
the name nobel had been associated with explosives and weapons - not with peace . nobel 's friend and former secretary countess bertha von suttner , a vocal pacifist , is credited with having had a significant impact on the millionaire , and was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1905 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel thought hard about the ramifications of his inventions for humanity " perhaps my factories will put an end to war sooner than your congresses , " he wrote the countess in 1891 .
two-and-a-half decades before world war one , nobel could n't have foreseen just how wrong he would be . because nobel had not composed his will with the help of a lawyer nor specified how the prizes should be awarded , it took five years to sort out the details before the first nobel prize could be awarded in 1901 . in 1968 , sweden 's central bank established the sveriges riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of alfred nobel .
the five original prizes are administered by the nobel foundation in stockholm . how are the winners selected ? candidates are nominated a year in advance by qualified parties in the six relevant fields .
academics , politicians , prominent scientists , previous nobel laureates and others receive personal invitations each year to nominate a candidate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertha von suttner worked for nobel for only a few months the nominators are selected in such a way so that as many different countries as possible are represented over time .
their nominations are kept secret for 50 years . in his will , alfred nobel specifically indicated five swedish institutions responsible for choosing the prize recipients in each category . the royal swedish academy of sciences has selected the economics prize laureates since 1969 . interesting facts : * 772 individuals and 19 organizations have been awarded the nobel prize , some more than once .
thirty-four women are among the prize winners . * the youngest nobel laureate , lawrence bragg , was just 25 when he accepted the prize .
he shared the 1915 nobel prize in physics with his father . * raymond david jr . , nearly 88 when he was awarded the nobel prize in physics in 2002 , was the oldest nobel laureate . * several would-be nobel recipients either declined to accept their award or were forced to decline for political reasons . jean-paul sartre , who consistently turned down all public honors , did n't accept his 1964 nobel prize in literature .
in 1973 , le duc tho was awarded the nobel peace prize jointly with us secretary of state henry kissinger for negotiating the vietnam peace accord .
tho declined the prize due to the situation in vietnam . three german nobel laureates - richard kuhn , adolf butenandt and gerhard domagk - were forbidden by adolf hitler to accept their prizes .
they received their diplomas and medals belatedly , but not the monetary award .
in 1958 , soviet authorities forced boris pasternak to return the nobel prize in literature he had initially accepted . * four individuals have been awarded two nobel prizes : john bardeen -lrb- physics 1956 , 1972 -rrb- marie curie -lrb- physics 1903 , chemistry 1911 -rrb- linus pauling -lrb- chemistry 1954 , peace 1962 -rrb- frederick sanger -lrb- chemistry 1958 , 1980 -rrb- * the nobel peace prize has been awarded three times to the international committee of the red cross -lrb- 1917 , 1944 , 1963 -rrb- and twice to the un refugee agency -lrb- 1954 , 1981 -rrb- . * together , the curies have collected more nobel prizes than any other family .

both darabi and rhayel could now be released as early as december , federal prosecutor frank wallenta said .
under german law , life sentences are reviewed by authorities after 15 years to decide whether the guilty party can be released .
the five years darabi spent in jail before he was convicted counted towards his life sentence .
when darabi was arrested for the murders , the investigation and subsequent trial sparked a diplomatic crisis between berlin and tehran with german authorities accusing the highest levels of the iranian government of responsibility for the attacks .
at the time , darabi was called an iranian secret agent .
at his sentencing in 1997 , the berlin court which tried darabi said that because of the severity of his crime , he should be held in custody beyond the usual 15 years .
thursday ’ s ruling by the federal prosecutor 's office marks a surprise reversal of that ruling .
the decision to release darabi has been criticized by the israeli government which had appealed to germany not to release the iranian .
israel opposes darabi release bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel refused olmert 's plea to keep darabi behind bars according to thursday 's ha 'aretz newspaper , israeli prime minister ehud olmert made a personal plea to german chancellor angela merkel in an attempt to convince berlin not to release darabi .

both darabi and rhayel could now be released as early as december , federal prosecutor frank wallenta said .
under german law , life sentences are reviewed by authorities after 15 years to decide whether the guilty party can be released .
the five years darabi spent in jail before he was convicted counted towards his life sentence .
when darabi was arrested for the murders , the investigation and subsequent trial sparked a diplomatic crisis between berlin and tehran with german authorities accusing the highest levels of the iranian government of responsibility for the attacks .

both darabi and rhayel could now be released as early as december , federal prosecutor frank wallenta said .
under german law , life sentences are reviewed by authorities after 15 years to decide whether the guilty party can be released .
the five years darabi spent in jail before he was convicted counted towards his life sentence .
when darabi was arrested for the murders , the investigation and subsequent trial sparked a diplomatic crisis between berlin and tehran with german authorities accusing the highest levels of the iranian government of responsibility for the attacks .
at the time , darabi was called an iranian secret agent .
at his sentencing in 1997 , the berlin court which tried darabi said that because of the severity of his crime , he should be held in custody beyond the usual 15 years .
thursday ’ s ruling by the federal prosecutor 's office marks a surprise reversal of that ruling .
the decision to release darabi has been criticized by the israeli government which had appealed to germany not to release the iranian .
israel opposes darabi release bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel refused olmert 's plea to keep darabi behind bars according to thursday 's ha 'aretz newspaper , israeli prime minister ehud olmert made a personal plea to german chancellor angela merkel in an attempt to convince berlin not to release darabi .
the newspaper reported that merkel rebuffed his appeal , telling him that the authorities would follow the letter of the law .
the ha 'aretz report also claimed that israel wanted to use darabi as part of a deal brokered between israel and hezbollah in 2004 in which 400 palestinian prisoners were released in exchange for the bodies of three israeli soldiers killed in 2000 and elhanan tannenbaum , an israeli businessman .
another aspect of the deal was that darabi would be released if hezbollah offered information on the captured israeli air force navigator ron arad , but the deal fell through , the report said .
iran proposed swap for german klein bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald klein served nearly all his 18-month sentence in iran there were also indications that iran , which had strived for the past 10 years to have darabi released , had darabi at the heart of a plan involving prisoner swaps .
the iranian government allegedly spoke with representatives of the german government over a deal involving jailed german fisherman donald klein who was released from prison in tehran earlier this year .
klein had been held captive since 2005 after illegally straying into iranian waters with french companion stephane lherbier while on a fishing expedition .

the decision , however , comes at a time of tension with croatia in a row with italy and slovenia over fishing rights in the adriatic sea which some observers say could muddy the diplomatic waters for zagreb .
the dispute over croatia 's imposition of a fisheries protection zone and another disagreement over tracing the maritime border between slovenia and croatia could hit the membership process at any stage .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de book fair -pipe- 11.10.2007 german publishers offer alternative to google books großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reading books the old-fashioned way should publishers see google 's project to make books searchable online as a threat or an opportunity ?
publishers are taking different approaches to google book search , with german publishers launching libreka . german publishers launched libreka , an internet book search machine of their own wednesday , oct .
10 .
they hope libreka will rival google book search while allowing them to keep control .
rüdiger salat , a board executive at holtzbrinck , the top german-based book publisher , said google might someday become a partner to publishers .
but for now it was still " more an enemy . "
google has undertaken a massive project to scan and index book content .
google scans the complete text so that users can find books which contain a specific word or phrase .
under a policy known as " opt out , " google , which is funded by online advertising , says it deletes any books from its search engine if copyright owners request it .
" opt out is not the right way , " said salat , whose group has been a key backer of libreka , the german publishers ' search engine .
a preview was launched at the frankfurt book fair wednesday .
the libreka database contains 8,000 german-language books whose publishers have explicitly " opted in " to the idea .
us publishing executive sees opportunities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has gotten into the book business while us publishers also have qualms about google 's plans to index books , one executive said that the ruckus might soon come to an end .
us publishers and authors began legal action two years ago against google .
peter olson , new york-based chief executive of the world 's biggest book publishing group , random house , said , " i think we are close to resolving our issues .
we have so much in common . "
olson , speaking in a discussion between top industry executives on the first day of the fair , said he wants to see google and publishers charge internet users small fees to see single pages of books online .

publishers are taking different approaches to google book search , with german publishers launching libreka . german publishers launched libreka , an internet book search machine of their own wednesday , oct .

they hope libreka will rival google book search while allowing them to keep control .
rüdiger salat , a board executive at holtzbrinck , the top german-based book publisher , said google might someday become a partner to publishers .
but for now it was still " more an enemy . "
google has undertaken a massive project to scan and index book content .
google scans the complete text so that users can find books which contain a specific word or phrase .
under a policy known as " opt out , " google , which is funded by online advertising , says it deletes any books from its search engine if copyright owners request it .
" opt out is not the right way , " said salat , whose group has been a key backer of libreka , the german publishers ' search engine .
a preview was launched at the frankfurt book fair wednesday .
the libreka database contains 8,000 german-language books whose publishers have explicitly " opted in " to the idea .

peter olson , new york-based chief executive of the world 's biggest book publishing group , random house , said , " i think we are close to resolving our issues .
we have so much in common . "
olson , speaking in a discussion between top industry executives on the first day of the fair , said he wants to see google and publishers charge internet users small fees to see single pages of books online .
olson envisions a set-up similar to popular music downloading services such as itunes , which allow songs to be purchased individually instead of having to buy an entire album .
olson envisions a " pay-per-page " model where a reader could buy single page or chapter .
instead of buying the entire cookbook , a reader could pay for a single carrot cake recipe or get the entire desserts chapter .
giving a share to the book industry would mollify publishers , olson said .

the project was started in 2005 and has been engineered by a delhi , india software house , mps , in which holtzbrinck is a shareholder .
libreka is an offshoot of germany 's books-in-print database .

a new study in germany shows that their womenfolk , however , do n't see things the same way . it is accepted in some scientific circles that orangutans , and not chimpanzees , are the closest relatives to humans among the great apes .
ask a human woman about the similarities between the ginger monkeys and their own species and they are likely to add to the burgeoning evidence that man -lrb- but not necessarily woman -rrb- is but an evolutionary side-step from an orangutan .
the list appears endless at times : body hair , personal hygiene , mating techniques … if you listen to some disgruntled females you could be misled into believing that they live in a monkey house bedecked with hanging tires rather than a swanky apartment filled with the latest modern furniture .
as if to give women even more ammunition , another similarity between german men and orangutans was discovered only last week , courtesy of a certain knuckle-dragger called sibu .
simbu 's blonde ambition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hey baby , feel like gettin ' it on ? "
sibu -lrb- an orangutan and not a german male -rrb- , had become a pain in the hairy backside by refusing to mate with any of the ape babes which swung his way for some primate lovin ' at the apenheul primate park in amsterdam , holland .
instead - and here is where the very tenuous link to german men comes in - he preferred to go monkey nuts over the blonde female humans which attended to him .
sibu 's preference for flaxen-haired female humans , preferably tattooed , fits snugly with documented evidence which says that german gentlemen prefer blondes .
german women , however , do not share sibu 's or their menfolks ' lust for the fair-haired .
well-trimmed , dark-haired men get the nod bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim jong il ticks some , but maybe not all , the boxes a new survey of attractiveness by the gfk research institute on behalf of a german health magazine reveals that when it comes to choosing a mate , german women prefer dark-haired men to blondes .
only 17.2 percent of those questioned found blond men attractive while a total of 28.9 percent favored brown-haired men , and 34.7 percent preferred men with dark hair .
now , while this does n't appear to be such a great problem for the large number of swarthy types out there , the survey showed that german ladies require a little more than just a luxurious inky thatch from their mates .
and this is where our friend sibu comes back in .
grooming high on german women 's list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " lose the beard and then we can talk " if you are a man who has more in common with sibu than his penchant for pneumatic blondes , then even your dusky crowning glory may not save you from being cast aside in the mating game .
those also sharing sibu 's grooming and hygiene habits may be forced to fight lesser apes over the monkey bars and fling feces at the cropped and manicured males who are more likely to successfully pair up with the females .
according to the gfk survey , every second woman in germany is attracted to clean-shaven men with short hair and manicured nails .
of the 1,031 women questioned , 59.6 percent found a man with manicured nails attractive , while 50.9 percent said they did not like men with stubble on their chin .
some 53.9 percent said they preferred men to have short hair , with a mere 4.7 percent saying they were attracted to males with a long , flowing mane .
all is not lost for those deemed unattractive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torsten frings curses his long hair - as many of us have so , if you 're a blonde , long-haired german guy with talon-like fingernails and the habits of an orangutan , you may consider looking elsewhere for a less-fussy mate .
if you have n't had enough of being compared to sibu already , you may want to follow his lead one more time .
after striking out with all the blonde women he had the hots for , our tree-swinging hero finally found love with his own type - in britain . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 11.10.2007 german train bombing suspect appears in lebanese court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two suspects in the attempted train bombing are in separate countries the main lebanese suspect accused of plotting to blow up two trains in germany in july 2006 appeared thursday in court in beirut and was questioned by a lebanese judge , judicial sources said . during the questioning , jihad hamad admitted that he and youssef al-haj dib , who is currently in custody in germany , bought two gas canisters , wires and two bags to put them on the trains to protest caricatures of the prophet mohammed originally published in a danish newspaper .
the two suspected terrorists had placed two suitcases containing bombs on the trains .
had there not been errors in the bombs ' construction , german investigators said the explosions near the cities of hamm and koblenz would have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people , putting the plot on a much larger scale than the terrorist attacks on london in july 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suitcases used in the failed plot hamad denied that he followed any " muslim fundamentalist group or jihadist group . "
he also denied any links with the sunni muslim fundamentalist group al qaeda which is led by osama bin laden .
judge helena iskander decided to issue a warrant to the lebanese police to look into reports that saddam al-haj dib , brother of youssef , and also a suspect in the plot , was killed during the 15-week battle between militants from the fatah al-islam group and the lebanese army in northern lebanon .
associates questioned the judge also questioned three lebanese citizens who were arrested with hamad : khaled al-haj dib , ayman hadad and khalil al-bobo .
khaled al-haj dib said that his connection with hamad went back to university and he denied any links to the german bombing plot .
hadad said he met hamad in tripoli , and denied that he had any knowledge of the bombing plot or belonged to any islamic movement .
al-bobo also denied his links with the german bombing plot , but said he met saddam al-haj dib through a common friend called osama al-shahabi , who usually sent muslims to fight in iraq .
" at the time i was impressed with the way al-haj dib thinks - his jihadist thinking - and we exchanged telephone numbers , " al-bobo told the judge .
he was arrested and put in a lebanese jail because he threw a bomb at a lebanese army checkpoint in the north of the country .
the four suspects hail from areas in northern lebanon where sunni fundamentalist movements have been flourishing for the past few years .
families proclaim sons ' innocence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gas-based bombs would have killed hundreds hamad 's father shahid , who was present during the court session , told german press agency dpa that his son was a student and not a fundamentalist and that he sent his son to a christian school in tripoli , not an islamic extremist one .
shahid said he decided to send his son to germany for the better education and job opportunities that were available there .
jihad hamad turned up at his parents ' house in tripoli shortly after the attempted bombings .
jihad , who had been taking german language classes for six months in germany , explained his sudden appearance by saying that he was worried about his parents because of the july 2006 israeli war against lebanon 's hezbollah movement at the time .
jihad has given a partial confession to lebanese authorities , saying that he deposited a piece of luggage in one of the trains but was not aware of its contents .
he has also told investigators that he and al-haj dib researched bomb-making methods on the internet that could have increased the victims ' suffering in the planned attacks .
the german police have said that the publication of the caricatures of the prophet mohammed in german newspapers may have prompted jihad hamad and youssef al-haj dib to devise their plot .
lebanese chief public prosecutor said mirza has accused jihad hamad of organizing and attempting mass murder .
should he be convicted , he faces life-long imprisonment and forced labor .
the trial was adjourned until november 26 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two suspected terrorists had placed two suitcases containing bombs on the trains .
had there not been errors in the bombs ' construction , german investigators said the explosions near the cities of hamm and koblenz would have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people , putting the plot on a much larger scale than the terrorist attacks on london in july 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suitcases used in the failed plot hamad denied that he followed any " muslim fundamentalist group or jihadist group . "
he also denied any links with the sunni muslim fundamentalist group al qaeda which is led by osama bin laden .
judge helena iskander decided to issue a warrant to the lebanese police to look into reports that saddam al-haj dib , brother of youssef , and also a suspect in the plot , was killed during the 15-week battle between militants from the fatah al-islam group and the lebanese army in northern lebanon .
associates questioned the judge also questioned three lebanese citizens who were arrested with hamad : khaled al-haj dib , ayman hadad and khalil al-bobo .
khaled al-haj dib said that his connection with hamad went back to university and he denied any links to the german bombing plot .
hadad said he met hamad in tripoli , and denied that he had any knowledge of the bombing plot or belonged to any islamic movement .
al-bobo also denied his links with the german bombing plot , but said he met saddam al-haj dib through a common friend called osama al-shahabi , who usually sent muslims to fight in iraq .
" at the time i was impressed with the way al-haj dib thinks - his jihadist thinking - and we exchanged telephone numbers , " al-bobo told the judge .
he was arrested and put in a lebanese jail because he threw a bomb at a lebanese army checkpoint in the north of the country .

shahid said he decided to send his son to germany for the better education and job opportunities that were available there .
jihad hamad turned up at his parents ' house in tripoli shortly after the attempted bombings .
jihad , who had been taking german language classes for six months in germany , explained his sudden appearance by saying that he was worried about his parents because of the july 2006 israeli war against lebanon 's hezbollah movement at the time .
jihad has given a partial confession to lebanese authorities , saying that he deposited a piece of luggage in one of the trains but was not aware of its contents .
he has also told investigators that he and al-haj dib researched bomb-making methods on the internet that could have increased the victims ' suffering in the planned attacks .
the german police have said that the publication of the caricatures of the prophet mohammed in german newspapers may have prompted jihad hamad and youssef al-haj dib to devise their plot .
lebanese chief public prosecutor said mirza has accused jihad hamad of organizing and attempting mass murder .

hadad said he met hamad in tripoli , and denied that he had any knowledge of the bombing plot or belonged to any islamic movement .
al-bobo also denied his links with the german bombing plot , but said he met saddam al-haj dib through a common friend called osama al-shahabi , who usually sent muslims to fight in iraq .
" at the time i was impressed with the way al-haj dib thinks - his jihadist thinking - and we exchanged telephone numbers , " al-bobo told the judge .
he was arrested and put in a lebanese jail because he threw a bomb at a lebanese army checkpoint in the north of the country .
the four suspects hail from areas in northern lebanon where sunni fundamentalist movements have been flourishing for the past few years .
families proclaim sons ' innocence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gas-based bombs would have killed hundreds hamad 's father shahid , who was present during the court session , told german press agency dpa that his son was a student and not a fundamentalist and that he sent his son to a christian school in tripoli , not an islamic extremist one .
shahid said he decided to send his son to germany for the better education and job opportunities that were available there .
jihad hamad turned up at his parents ' house in tripoli shortly after the attempted bombings .
jihad , who had been taking german language classes for six months in germany , explained his sudden appearance by saying that he was worried about his parents because of the july 2006 israeli war against lebanon 's hezbollah movement at the time .
jihad has given a partial confession to lebanese authorities , saying that he deposited a piece of luggage in one of the trains but was not aware of its contents .
he has also told investigators that he and al-haj dib researched bomb-making methods on the internet that could have increased the victims ' suffering in the planned attacks .
the german police have said that the publication of the caricatures of the prophet mohammed in german newspapers may have prompted jihad hamad and youssef al-haj dib to devise their plot .
lebanese chief public prosecutor said mirza has accused jihad hamad of organizing and attempting mass murder .
should he be convicted , he faces life-long imprisonment and forced labor .
the trial was adjourned until november 26 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 11.10.2007 german men , orangutans prefer blondes ; german women do n't großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : long ginger hair , scraggly beard ... this guy is never going to get a german girlfriend it is a well-documented fact that german men , much like most of the men who take this kind of survey , prefer blondes .
a new study in germany shows that their womenfolk , however , do n't see things the same way . it is accepted in some scientific circles that orangutans , and not chimpanzees , are the closest relatives to humans among the great apes .
ask a human woman about the similarities between the ginger monkeys and their own species and they are likely to add to the burgeoning evidence that man -lrb- but not necessarily woman -rrb- is but an evolutionary side-step from an orangutan .
the list appears endless at times : body hair , personal hygiene , mating techniques … if you listen to some disgruntled females you could be misled into believing that they live in a monkey house bedecked with hanging tires rather than a swanky apartment filled with the latest modern furniture .
as if to give women even more ammunition , another similarity between german men and orangutans was discovered only last week , courtesy of a certain knuckle-dragger called sibu .
simbu 's blonde ambition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hey baby , feel like gettin ' it on ? "
sibu -lrb- an orangutan and not a german male -rrb- , had become a pain in the hairy backside by refusing to mate with any of the ape babes which swung his way for some primate lovin ' at the apenheul primate park in amsterdam , holland .
instead - and here is where the very tenuous link to german men comes in - he preferred to go monkey nuts over the blonde female humans which attended to him .
sibu 's preference for flaxen-haired female humans , preferably tattooed , fits snugly with documented evidence which says that german gentlemen prefer blondes .
german women , however , do not share sibu 's or their menfolks ' lust for the fair-haired .
well-trimmed , dark-haired men get the nod bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim jong il ticks some , but maybe not all , the boxes a new survey of attractiveness by the gfk research institute on behalf of a german health magazine reveals that when it comes to choosing a mate , german women prefer dark-haired men to blondes .
only 17.2 percent of those questioned found blond men attractive while a total of 28.9 percent favored brown-haired men , and 34.7 percent preferred men with dark hair .
now , while this does n't appear to be such a great problem for the large number of swarthy types out there , the survey showed that german ladies require a little more than just a luxurious inky thatch from their mates .
and this is where our friend sibu comes back in .
grooming high on german women 's list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " lose the beard and then we can talk " if you are a man who has more in common with sibu than his penchant for pneumatic blondes , then even your dusky crowning glory may not save you from being cast aside in the mating game .
those also sharing sibu 's grooming and hygiene habits may be forced to fight lesser apes over the monkey bars and fling feces at the cropped and manicured males who are more likely to successfully pair up with the females .
according to the gfk survey , every second woman in germany is attracted to clean-shaven men with short hair and manicured nails .
of the 1,031 women questioned , 59.6 percent found a man with manicured nails attractive , while 50.9 percent said they did not like men with stubble on their chin .
some 53.9 percent said they preferred men to have short hair , with a mere 4.7 percent saying they were attracted to males with a long , flowing mane .
all is not lost for those deemed unattractive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torsten frings curses his long hair - as many of us have so , if you 're a blonde , long-haired german guy with talon-like fingernails and the habits of an orangutan , you may consider looking elsewhere for a less-fussy mate .
if you have n't had enough of being compared to sibu already , you may want to follow his lead one more time .
after striking out with all the blonde women he had the hots for , our tree-swinging hero finally found love with his own type - in britain . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new study in germany shows that their womenfolk , however , do n't see things the same way . it is accepted in some scientific circles that orangutans , and not chimpanzees , are the closest relatives to humans among the great apes .
ask a human woman about the similarities between the ginger monkeys and their own species and they are likely to add to the burgeoning evidence that man -lrb- but not necessarily woman -rrb- is but an evolutionary side-step from an orangutan .
the list appears endless at times : body hair , personal hygiene , mating techniques … if you listen to some disgruntled females you could be misled into believing that they live in a monkey house bedecked with hanging tires rather than a swanky apartment filled with the latest modern furniture .
as if to give women even more ammunition , another similarity between german men and orangutans was discovered only last week , courtesy of a certain knuckle-dragger called sibu .
simbu 's blonde ambition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hey baby , feel like gettin ' it on ? "
sibu -lrb- an orangutan and not a german male -rrb- , had become a pain in the hairy backside by refusing to mate with any of the ape babes which swung his way for some primate lovin ' at the apenheul primate park in amsterdam , holland .
instead - and here is where the very tenuous link to german men comes in - he preferred to go monkey nuts over the blonde female humans which attended to him .
sibu 's preference for flaxen-haired female humans , preferably tattooed , fits snugly with documented evidence which says that german gentlemen prefer blondes .
german women , however , do not share sibu 's or their menfolks ' lust for the fair-haired .
well-trimmed , dark-haired men get the nod bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim jong il ticks some , but maybe not all , the boxes a new survey of attractiveness by the gfk research institute on behalf of a german health magazine reveals that when it comes to choosing a mate , german women prefer dark-haired men to blondes .
only 17.2 percent of those questioned found blond men attractive while a total of 28.9 percent favored brown-haired men , and 34.7 percent preferred men with dark hair .

10 , russian president vladimir putin said he is dismayed by estonia and latvia 's glorification of nazism .
europe needs to take notice , putin said . putin , speaking in moscow to the european jewish congress , said he was shocked when an annual waffen ss parade took place in latvia in march .
he added that it was disturbing that the european union has largely ignored the problems of pro-nazi groups in these countries .
" some facts which we come up against in several countries of eastern europe have provoked open astonishment and incomprehension , " putin said .
" the activities of the latvian and estonian authorities openly connive at the glorification of nazis and their accomplices .
but these facts remain unnoticed by the european union . "
in 2006 , latvian officials banned an annual parade that glorifies the latvian waffen ss against russia 's red army .
some far right supporters marched anyway .
legacy of mistrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a controversial war memorial putin 's remarks are the latest volley in a political war of words between the baltic countries and russia .
latvia , lithuania and estonia joined the european union in 2004 , in part to seek protection from their domineering former rulers in moscow .
soviet forces annexed the baltic countries during world war ii .
the war split the population between those who fought for nazi germany and those who supported russia .
in russia 's view , it liberated the countries from nazi occupation in a victory that cost it 20 million lives .
germany 's defeat is seen as an important historical event and it rejects the accusation that it occupied eastern european countries .
but many people from the baltic states see the red army 's arrival as the beginning of five decades of soviet rule .
during that time , thousands of estonians were deported to soviet prison camps and russians settled in the country .
strained relations continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paying respects animosity flared up again earlier this year when estonian authorities moved a bronze statue of a red army soldier from a downtown tallinn square and moved it to a military cemetery .
rioting caused by the decision to relocate the war memorial left one person dead and a dozen injured .
further protests by pro-kremlin youths at the estonian consulate in moscow lead to scuffles with bodyguards .
in june , estonia buried the remains of eight soviet soldiers who had been exhumed from the tallinn war memorial .
the soldiers were reburied in the estonian defense forces ' cemetery , the same place where the statue was relocated .
a month before the reburial , estonia came under massive cyber attacks , crippling government and corporate web sites for nearly three weeks .
the estonian government suggested that russia could have been behind the attacks and asked for help from nato , which agreed to investigate the incident .
russia has denied any involvement in the cyber attacks .
germany has participated in some behind-the-scenes negotiating on various issues between russia and the baltic countries , but the eu has largely refrained from inserting itself in the disputes .
russia wants an apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltics have a large population of russian minorities the situation in estonia remains volatile . russia 's eu ambassador has said that estonia still owes russia an apology for moving the monument .
without an apology for moving the monument , protests could continue , he said .
putin brought up the war memorial issue wednesday .
" we are seeing a position on the limit of hypocrisy by certain european structures over the moving of the liberation soldier monument in tallinn , " putin said .
putin noted that since estonia 's independence in 1991 , " not a single nazi criminal has been condemned . "
putin admitted there were acts of anti-semitism in russia as well as " chauvinistic , xenophobic and nationalistic demonstrations . "
moshe kantor , head of the european jewish congress , asked putin to recognize the international holocaust day , which was introduced by the united nations in november 2005 .

europe needs to take notice , putin said . putin , speaking in moscow to the european jewish congress , said he was shocked when an annual waffen ss parade took place in latvia in march .
he added that it was disturbing that the european union has largely ignored the problems of pro-nazi groups in these countries .
" some facts which we come up against in several countries of eastern europe have provoked open astonishment and incomprehension , " putin said .
" the activities of the latvian and estonian authorities openly connive at the glorification of nazis and their accomplices .
but these facts remain unnoticed by the european union . "
in 2006 , latvian officials banned an annual parade that glorifies the latvian waffen ss against russia 's red army .

10 , not to license huge 60-ton trailer trucks on german roads , saying the trucks posed a danger to automobile traffic on the country 's autobahns . a majority of the ministers from germany 's 16 states , meeting along with federal transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , had taken the decision on the basis of a study prepared by a working group . tiefensee said he was pleased the german ministers came to clear a decision before the european union begins debate on issue next year . the decision refers to 25-meter -lrb- 82-foot -rrb- trucks capable of hauling up to 60 tons of goods and was taken after a trial of the vehicles , comprising three standard 6-meter containers , on some stretches of germany 's highways . potential traffic hazards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german automobile club said gigaliners posed a danger to cars the study , which neither approved nor rejected the use of " gigaliners , " found that traffic would not increase due to the extended-trailers but said the added weight could pose a potential problem over bridges and in tunnels , according to a report in the daily süddeutsche zeitung . in general , trailer trucks on european roads may be no heavier than 40 tons and no longer than 18.75 meters , though longer vehicles are allowed to transport wood in sweden and finland . the use in germany of extra-long trucks that exceed established authorized weights is not possible however " because of the elevated risk to transport security , " the ministers said .
about 75 percent of germans said they were against allowing the extended trailers , according to a survey published by the forsa research institute . proponents of the huge trucks say they would cut freight costs and fuel consumption by 15 percent .
they deny the trucks would have a negative impact on roads , as the weight carried by each axle would not rise .
" this eliminates efficiency increases necessary in commercial transport without presenting other sustainable solutions , " said kay-dirk lindemann a traffic expert for the federation of german industries . european transit country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are over 700,000 trailer trucks registed for use on german highways the adac , germany 's largest automobile club , however , welcomed the ministers ' decision .
" this is a huge success for traffic safety and road infrastructure , " ulrich klaus becker , the association 's vice president , said in a statement .
" the risks for car traffic would have been immense . " the ministers recommended concluding the current gigaliner trial operations underway in three german states but said there was no reason to begin a closer examination of the trucks ' feasibility in germany . a transit country for many of the goods shipped throughout europe , germany 's autobahns are free for cars .

it 's hard work to become a scientist , said manfred lindinger from the german daily faz .
it did n't surprise him a bit that two germans won the nobel prize this year . did the fact that germans got these two nobel prizes come as a surprise ? it was a surprise that two germans got the prizes at the same time - but it was n't a surprise that gerhard ertl and peter grünberg received the prizes .
they were on the list and people knew that they would get it at some point . would you say that germany has recovered from the drain during the 1930s and 40s when many went to the us ? there was a big hole after the second world war and it took a long time for germany to reach the same level of science , especially in physics .
but things changed in the 1960s , 70s and 80s .
there was good science .
still , the competition in great britain and america was very tough , so there were n't many german nobel prize laureates in this time . the discoveries that were honored this year with the nobel prize were made in the late 80s and even in the 60s and 70s , in ertl 's case .
this shows that science was strong in germany at that time .

dw-world.de takes a look at who and what are behind one of the most prestigious awards in the world . who was alfred nobel ? alfred nobel was born in stockholm in 1833 .
together with his father , who was an engineer , he developed the explosive nitroglycerine , which proved a commercial success . despite the danger of the project - nobel 's brother emil was killed in an experiment in 1864 - he continued his research , patenting what he called dynamite in 1867 .
the invention proved very useful in the construction industry and nobel traveled the world selling his product .
when not on the road , he diligently conducted research and registered 355 patents in his name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel was active as a chemist and physicist and pursued literature in his free time nobel 's talent as both a scientist and a businessman allowed him to amass a considerable fortune .
he was also fluent in several languages , wrote poetry and drama , and had a deep interest in philosophy and literature . how did the nobel prize come about ? after his death in 1896 , the opening of nobel 's will caused a considerable stir : he had left the majority of his money to the establishment of " prizes to those who , during the preceding year , shall have conferred the greatest benefit to mankind " in physics , chemistry , medicine , literature and peace . family members contested the will .
others were irked at the international nature of the new prizes .
the biggest shock , however , was the peace prize .
the name nobel had been associated with explosives and weapons - not with peace . nobel 's friend and former secretary countess bertha von suttner , a vocal pacifist , is credited with having had a significant impact on the millionaire , and was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1905 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel thought hard about the ramifications of his inventions for humanity " perhaps my factories will put an end to war sooner than your congresses , " he wrote the countess in 1891 .
two-and-a-half decades before world war one , nobel could n't have foreseen just how wrong he would be . because nobel had not composed his will with the help of a lawyer nor specified how the prizes should be awarded , it took five years to sort out the details before the first nobel prize could be awarded in 1901 . in 1968 , sweden 's central bank established the sveriges riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of alfred nobel .
the five original prizes are administered by the nobel foundation in stockholm . how are the winners selected ? candidates are nominated a year in advance by qualified parties in the six relevant fields .
academics , politicians , prominent scientists , previous nobel laureates and others receive personal invitations each year to nominate a candidate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertha von suttner worked for nobel for only a few months the nominators are selected in such a way so that as many different countries as possible are represented over time .
their nominations are kept secret for 50 years . in his will , alfred nobel specifically indicated five swedish institutions responsible for choosing the prize recipients in each category . the royal swedish academy of sciences has selected the economics prize laureates since 1969 . interesting facts : * 772 individuals and 19 organizations have been awarded the nobel prize , some more than once .
thirty-four women are among the prize winners . * the youngest nobel laureate , lawrence bragg , was just 25 when he accepted the prize .
he shared the 1915 nobel prize in physics with his father . * raymond david jr . , nearly 88 when he was awarded the nobel prize in physics in 2002 , was the oldest nobel laureate . * several would-be nobel recipients either declined to accept their award or were forced to decline for political reasons . jean-paul sartre , who consistently turned down all public honors , did n't accept his 1964 nobel prize in literature .
in 1973 , le duc tho was awarded the nobel peace prize jointly with us secretary of state henry kissinger for negotiating the vietnam peace accord .
tho declined the prize due to the situation in vietnam . three german nobel laureates - richard kuhn , adolf butenandt and gerhard domagk - were forbidden by adolf hitler to accept their prizes .
they received their diplomas and medals belatedly , but not the monetary award .
in 1958 , soviet authorities forced boris pasternak to return the nobel prize in literature he had initially accepted . * four individuals have been awarded two nobel prizes : john bardeen -lrb- physics 1956 , 1972 -rrb- marie curie -lrb- physics 1903 , chemistry 1911 -rrb- linus pauling -lrb- chemistry 1954 , peace 1962 -rrb- frederick sanger -lrb- chemistry 1958 , 1980 -rrb- * the nobel peace prize has been awarded three times to the international committee of the red cross -lrb- 1917 , 1944 , 1963 -rrb- and twice to the un refugee agency -lrb- 1954 , 1981 -rrb- . * together , the curies have collected more nobel prizes than any other family .

it is common knowledge that the manmohan singh government has been rapped on its knuckles by the bhartiya janta party-led opposition , the so-called third front , as well as by its allies from the left because of the nuclear deal issue .

he also added , helpfully to the manmohan singh government , that no formal discussions on the indo-us nuclear deal had taken place between him and the indian officials .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 11.10.2007 india-russia nuclear deal on the cards großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president putin and indian prime minister singh are due to meet in russia in december as the indo-us civilian nuclear energy deal , better known as the 123 agreement , faces the risk of being put in cold storage by the indian government , new delhi may find another way of meeting its growing energy needs by striking a similar deal with russia . an indo-russian nuclear deal , along the lines of the indo-us 123 agreement , would be a politically-correct move and have the potential of emerging as the mother of all political strokes by the indian government .
it is common knowledge that the manmohan singh government has been rapped on its knuckles by the bhartiya janta party-led opposition , the so-called third front , as well as by its allies from the left because of the nuclear deal issue .
while there has been a palpable rapprochement between the indian government and the left parties and the fast – soaring political temperature has been brought down by both sides in the past couple of days , a question mark continues to hang over the future of indo-us nuclear deal .
energy-starved india so a similar deal with russia , india ’ s long-standing tried and tested friend , could do the trick for energy-starved india .
what ’ s more , this deal could be operational much quicker than the 123 agreement with the us , as the russian government has total control over its legislature , unlike the powerful us congress , which ca n't be bypassed by the us president .
sometime in december , the indian prime minister manmohan singh is expected to visit russia for an annual summit meeting , though the dates of his moscow visit are yet to be decided .
a key area for discussion will be civilian nuclear energy co-operation .
moscow has conveyed its keenness to develop civilian nuclear energy co-operation with india along the lines of the indo-us nuclear deal .
russia is understood to have asked india to work on a rough draft for such a nuclear deal .
moscow wants prime minister manmohan singh to have atomic energy commission chief anil kakodkar in his official entourage during the russia trip so that a meaningful discussion on the matter can be held .
123 on the back burner from the indications available , manmohan singh ’ s russia visit is likely to be historic - and a clever political tactic .
the left parties , which are bitterly opposed to indo-us nuclear deal , will not object to a similar deal between india and russia .
indications are that the indian government could be willing to put the 123 agreement on back burner and not take its show-down with the left over the issue to the hilt .
the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- chief mohammad elbaradei , concluded his three-day visit to india on thursday , after meeting prime minister manmohan singh , external affairs minister pranab mukherjee and foreign secretary shivshankar menon .
elbaradei later made it clear that there was no deadline for india to sign an india-specific safeguards agreement with the iaea .
he also added , helpfully to the manmohan singh government , that no formal discussions on the indo-us nuclear deal had taken place between him and the indian officials .
however , to put the 123 agreement on course , the negotiations on the draft text of the safeguards agreement would have to be underway by next week .
the nuclear suppliers group -lrb- nsg -rrb- clearance is not a time-consuming process and could be completed in a matter of a few days .
the time frame is urgent as the us needs to know as soon as possible when to call an emergency meeting of the nuclear suppliers group , which they would prefer to hold sometime in november .
but at this point in time , the 123 agreement does not seem likely to be clinched so fast . r. sharma send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 sri lanka two years ago , sri lanka 's army put a brutal end to a separatist rebellion that lasted 26 years .

four years later , his equally potent film about cambodian prostitutes , which is overshadowed by the khmer rouge 's legacy , made it into the competition of the 5th festival , which came to an end on wednesday . " paper can not wrap up embers " tells the story of seven young women forced to sell their bodies in phnom penh so they can help support their impoverished families in the country .
" the dead are quiet and the living suffer , " says one of the women , whose life rithy pahn follows .
the depiction of women who are exploited as sex slaves in contemporary cambodian society , which still bears the scars of the khmer rouge 's regime is very intimate and moving .
panh has said his film is " as close as one can get to the life - and thus spiritual death - of a prostitute " .
the un estimates there are 30,000 prostitutes in cambodia .
there are also countless numbers of cambodian prostitutes in thailand and malaysia .
pahn portrays their daily existences and listens to their views .
he is not interested in the sleazy underworld of the red light district but depicts the ordinary aspects of the women 's lives .
the viewers get to know the women as they cook , eat , argue , do the accounts , shoot up , cry and they listen to them talk .
they talk about the customers : " they get laid and hit us like animals , " says one .
" we get exploited and crushed like garlic , " explains another .
sold into sex slavery they talk about how they got into prostitution .
some were sold into slavery by their parents , others were abandoned as children , others made their way to the capital to find work .
one woman says she is too old and can only get " tricks " from rickshaw drivers - she explains her husband does n't help her and she needs to work so he can eat his rice .
her two-year-old son was stolen from her .
it turns out she 's only 34 and has been working as a prostitute for nine years .
another was raped by her father ...
the individual reasons are numerous , but collectively it is clear that the khmer rouge also has a large part of responsibility .
the bitter memories of its brutal reign are omnipresent .
many of the women grew up in un refugee camps and did not have access to education .
lack of qualifications drove them to prostitution .
one mother tells her daughter who complains about having to work as a sex slave for a kilo of rice that she has it easy : " under the khmer rouge it was much worse , there was no food and executions ; we had to share watered-down soup . "
at least you can eat is the implication .
driven to despair and although the survival skills honed under the khmer rouge continue to be used in the contemporary era , many of the young women are almost driven to despair - suicide and death are a recurring theme .
the women talk about the violence of their customers - they all know stories of women who have literally been battered to death .
" if we die , nobody cares , " one says matter-of-factly .
aids is also a common cause of death among the prostitutes who discuss the disease 's origin - monkeys and un peacekeepers are but two possibilities ...
a woman says the " bastard white men " who have sex without condoms are not afraid to die .
her friend answers indifferently : " if you have aids you die , if you do n't you die too . "
this is an indication that , emotionally , she already feels dead and this feeling is shared by many others : " lying down on a bed is like lying on the butcher 's block , " one states .
another : " when a client has sex with me , he has sex with a dead girl . "

it is common knowledge that the manmohan singh government has been rapped on its knuckles by the bhartiya janta party-led opposition , the so-called third front , as well as by its allies from the left because of the nuclear deal issue .
while there has been a palpable rapprochement between the indian government and the left parties and the fast – soaring political temperature has been brought down by both sides in the past couple of days , a question mark continues to hang over the future of indo-us nuclear deal .
energy-starved india so a similar deal with russia , india ’ s long-standing tried and tested friend , could do the trick for energy-starved india .
what ’ s more , this deal could be operational much quicker than the 123 agreement with the us , as the russian government has total control over its legislature , unlike the powerful us congress , which ca n't be bypassed by the us president .
sometime in december , the indian prime minister manmohan singh is expected to visit russia for an annual summit meeting , though the dates of his moscow visit are yet to be decided .
a key area for discussion will be civilian nuclear energy co-operation .
moscow has conveyed its keenness to develop civilian nuclear energy co-operation with india along the lines of the indo-us nuclear deal .
russia is understood to have asked india to work on a rough draft for such a nuclear deal .
moscow wants prime minister manmohan singh to have atomic energy commission chief anil kakodkar in his official entourage during the russia trip so that a meaningful discussion on the matter can be held .
123 on the back burner from the indications available , manmohan singh ’ s russia visit is likely to be historic - and a clever political tactic .
the left parties , which are bitterly opposed to indo-us nuclear deal , will not object to a similar deal between india and russia .
indications are that the indian government could be willing to put the 123 agreement on back burner and not take its show-down with the left over the issue to the hilt .
the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- chief mohammad elbaradei , concluded his three-day visit to india on thursday , after meeting prime minister manmohan singh , external affairs minister pranab mukherjee and foreign secretary shivshankar menon .
elbaradei later made it clear that there was no deadline for india to sign an india-specific safeguards agreement with the iaea .
he also added , helpfully to the manmohan singh government , that no formal discussions on the indo-us nuclear deal had taken place between him and the indian officials .
however , to put the 123 agreement on course , the negotiations on the draft text of the safeguards agreement would have to be underway by next week .
the nuclear suppliers group -lrb- nsg -rrb- clearance is not a time-consuming process and could be completed in a matter of a few days .
the time frame is urgent as the us needs to know as soon as possible when to call an emergency meeting of the nuclear suppliers group , which they would prefer to hold sometime in november .
but at this point in time , the 123 agreement does not seem likely to be clinched so fast . r. sharma send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9801 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

both darabi and rhayel could now be released as early as december , federal prosecutor frank wallenta said .
under german law , life sentences are reviewed by authorities after 15 years to decide whether the guilty party can be released .
the five years darabi spent in jail before he was convicted counted towards his life sentence .
when darabi was arrested for the murders , the investigation and subsequent trial sparked a diplomatic crisis between berlin and tehran with german authorities accusing the highest levels of the iranian government of responsibility for the attacks .
at the time , darabi was called an iranian secret agent .
at his sentencing in 1997 , the berlin court which tried darabi said that because of the severity of his crime , he should be held in custody beyond the usual 15 years .
thursday ’ s ruling by the federal prosecutor 's office marks a surprise reversal of that ruling .
the decision to release darabi has been criticized by the israeli government which had appealed to germany not to release the iranian .
israel opposes darabi release bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel refused olmert 's plea to keep darabi behind bars according to thursday 's ha 'aretz newspaper , israeli prime minister ehud olmert made a personal plea to german chancellor angela merkel in an attempt to convince berlin not to release darabi .
the newspaper reported that merkel rebuffed his appeal , telling him that the authorities would follow the letter of the law .
the ha 'aretz report also claimed that israel wanted to use darabi as part of a deal brokered between israel and hezbollah in 2004 in which 400 palestinian prisoners were released in exchange for the bodies of three israeli soldiers killed in 2000 and elhanan tannenbaum , an israeli businessman .
another aspect of the deal was that darabi would be released if hezbollah offered information on the captured israeli air force navigator ron arad , but the deal fell through , the report said .
iran proposed swap for german klein bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald klein served nearly all his 18-month sentence in iran there were also indications that iran , which had strived for the past 10 years to have darabi released , had darabi at the heart of a plan involving prisoner swaps .
the iranian government allegedly spoke with representatives of the german government over a deal involving jailed german fisherman donald klein who was released from prison in tehran earlier this year .
klein had been held captive since 2005 after illegally straying into iranian waters with french companion stephane lherbier while on a fishing expedition .

both darabi and rhayel could now be released as early as december , federal prosecutor frank wallenta said .
under german law , life sentences are reviewed by authorities after 15 years to decide whether the guilty party can be released .
the five years darabi spent in jail before he was convicted counted towards his life sentence .
when darabi was arrested for the murders , the investigation and subsequent trial sparked a diplomatic crisis between berlin and tehran with german authorities accusing the highest levels of the iranian government of responsibility for the attacks .
at the time , darabi was called an iranian secret agent .
at his sentencing in 1997 , the berlin court which tried darabi said that because of the severity of his crime , he should be held in custody beyond the usual 15 years .
thursday ’ s ruling by the federal prosecutor 's office marks a surprise reversal of that ruling .
the decision to release darabi has been criticized by the israeli government which had appealed to germany not to release the iranian .
israel opposes darabi release bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel refused olmert 's plea to keep darabi behind bars according to thursday 's ha 'aretz newspaper , israeli prime minister ehud olmert made a personal plea to german chancellor angela merkel in an attempt to convince berlin not to release darabi .
the newspaper reported that merkel rebuffed his appeal , telling him that the authorities would follow the letter of the law .
the ha 'aretz report also claimed that israel wanted to use darabi as part of a deal brokered between israel and hezbollah in 2004 in which 400 palestinian prisoners were released in exchange for the bodies of three israeli soldiers killed in 2000 and elhanan tannenbaum , an israeli businessman .
another aspect of the deal was that darabi would be released if hezbollah offered information on the captured israeli air force navigator ron arad , but the deal fell through , the report said .

the iranian government allegedly spoke with representatives of the german government over a deal involving jailed german fisherman donald klein who was released from prison in tehran earlier this year .
klein had been held captive since 2005 after illegally straying into iranian waters with french companion stephane lherbier while on a fishing expedition .

the court seemed skeptical . the government argued on wednesday , oct .
10 , that authorities should be able to plant " trojan " spyware on suspects ' computers , saying it was a vital tool in the fight against terrorism . these so-called remote " online searches " are " urgently needed to .. ensure security today and in the future , " said august hanning , deputy interior minister and former head of germany 's foreign intelligence agency , in the written text of a statement to the court . " germany is part of a global danger zone and can at any time become the target of terrorism attacks , " he told judges .
" the internet has become a decisive medium . " the surveillance technique has sparked intense debate in germany , where mistrust of state intrusion into private lives is still high due to germany 's nazi and communist past . key to future terrorism strategy the hearing in front of the court is looking into the legality of such methods in the federal state of north rhine-westphalia , where domestic intelligence officials began using it 10 months ago .
several lawyers , a journalist and a former state interior minister have submitted official protests about the practice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spyware allows authorities unlimited access to remote computers the karlsruhe case could prove key in deciding if chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government can give authorities the right in the future to engage in internet spying .
berlin is watching closely , with the conservative cdu / csu faction wanting legal steps taken immediately to allow the technique .
the social democrats have said they will wait for the court 's decision , which will only be known in several months . privacy advocates have generally come out against the method , including peter schaar , germany 's independent privacy commissioner .
he called the technique " a further alarming step towards ever more sweeping surveillance , " adding that it would not only give authorities access to documents , e-mails and photos , but would allow them to follow every keystroke and activate devices such as cameras and microphones attached to computers . court doubts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates of online-spying say they internet has become an important terror tool the court 's judges , presided over by hans-jürgen papier , indicated in opening remarks that they have serious concerns about cyberspying , since it called into question the balance of freedom and security . they expressed doubts that secret access to computers was necessary to fight terrorism . but the president of the office for the protection of the constitution , heinz fromm , said security services needed this tool because the internet had become a virtual training camp for real terrorism . judges are expected to make a decision by next year . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two suspected terrorists had placed two suitcases containing bombs on the trains .
had there not been errors in the bombs ' construction , german investigators said the explosions near the cities of hamm and koblenz would have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people , putting the plot on a much larger scale than the terrorist attacks on london in july 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suitcases used in the failed plot hamad denied that he followed any " muslim fundamentalist group or jihadist group . "
he also denied any links with the sunni muslim fundamentalist group al qaeda which is led by osama bin laden .
judge helena iskander decided to issue a warrant to the lebanese police to look into reports that saddam al-haj dib , brother of youssef , and also a suspect in the plot , was killed during the 15-week battle between militants from the fatah al-islam group and the lebanese army in northern lebanon .
associates questioned the judge also questioned three lebanese citizens who were arrested with hamad : khaled al-haj dib , ayman hadad and khalil al-bobo .
khaled al-haj dib said that his connection with hamad went back to university and he denied any links to the german bombing plot .
hadad said he met hamad in tripoli , and denied that he had any knowledge of the bombing plot or belonged to any islamic movement .
al-bobo also denied his links with the german bombing plot , but said he met saddam al-haj dib through a common friend called osama al-shahabi , who usually sent muslims to fight in iraq .
" at the time i was impressed with the way al-haj dib thinks - his jihadist thinking - and we exchanged telephone numbers , " al-bobo told the judge .
he was arrested and put in a lebanese jail because he threw a bomb at a lebanese army checkpoint in the north of the country .
the four suspects hail from areas in northern lebanon where sunni fundamentalist movements have been flourishing for the past few years .
families proclaim sons ' innocence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gas-based bombs would have killed hundreds hamad 's father shahid , who was present during the court session , told german press agency dpa that his son was a student and not a fundamentalist and that he sent his son to a christian school in tripoli , not an islamic extremist one .
shahid said he decided to send his son to germany for the better education and job opportunities that were available there .
jihad hamad turned up at his parents ' house in tripoli shortly after the attempted bombings .
jihad , who had been taking german language classes for six months in germany , explained his sudden appearance by saying that he was worried about his parents because of the july 2006 israeli war against lebanon 's hezbollah movement at the time .
jihad has given a partial confession to lebanese authorities , saying that he deposited a piece of luggage in one of the trains but was not aware of its contents .
he has also told investigators that he and al-haj dib researched bomb-making methods on the internet that could have increased the victims ' suffering in the planned attacks .
the german police have said that the publication of the caricatures of the prophet mohammed in german newspapers may have prompted jihad hamad and youssef al-haj dib to devise their plot .
lebanese chief public prosecutor said mirza has accused jihad hamad of organizing and attempting mass murder .
should he be convicted , he faces life-long imprisonment and forced labor .

10 .
performance-enhancing drug use in poplar and youth sports has , however , remained a little-researched field , treutlein said .
that 's why the center plans to approach young athletes about the risks doping pose .
the center also plans to educate coaches and teachers on doping and drug abuse and to create ad campaigns to help prevent doping among young athletes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : educational material and school lessons are part of the center 's plans to cut youth doping " we can show young people alternatives to consider , but it 's up to them to make the decision , " treutlein said .
faith in doping-free international sports has most recently been shaken by china 's top female triathlete being banned from two years of completion for taking performance-enhancing drugs , us sprinter and triple olympic champion marion jones confessing to doping and returning her medals from the sydney olympics , and a tour de france that was marred by doping cases and allegations .
" young athletes have to be strengthened , " said michale hölz , head of the board of trustees for germany 's national doping agency .
" we do not need just responsible citizens , we also need responsible athletes . "
t-mobile sponsoring problem german sports goods maker adidas also announced wednesday that it is unlikely to act as a sponsor of the german t-mobile cycling team beyond 2008 due to doping in the sport .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a doping scandal left t-mobile with a bruised image after the tour de france " i can not imagine this to happen right now , " adidas boss herbert hainer told wednesday 's edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily .
" we want to see success in the fight against doping and the clear will of all involved to act .
then an extension is theoretically possible . "
hainer said adidas could end their engagement instantly if there are new doping cases in the team .
t-mobile earlier this year fired german rider patrick sinkewitz over a positive test and ukrainian rider serhiy honchar over suspicious test results . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" young athletes have to be strengthened , " said michale hölz , head of the board of trustees for germany 's national doping agency .
" we do not need just responsible citizens , we also need responsible athletes . "
t-mobile sponsoring problem german sports goods maker adidas also announced wednesday that it is unlikely to act as a sponsor of the german t-mobile cycling team beyond 2008 due to doping in the sport .

" we want to see success in the fight against doping and the clear will of all involved to act .
then an extension is theoretically possible . "
hainer said adidas could end their engagement instantly if there are new doping cases in the team .
t-mobile earlier this year fired german rider patrick sinkewitz over a positive test and ukrainian rider serhiy honchar over suspicious test results . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 , russian president vladimir putin said he is dismayed by estonia and latvia 's glorification of nazism .
europe needs to take notice , putin said . putin , speaking in moscow to the european jewish congress , said he was shocked when an annual waffen ss parade took place in latvia in march .
he added that it was disturbing that the european union has largely ignored the problems of pro-nazi groups in these countries .
" some facts which we come up against in several countries of eastern europe have provoked open astonishment and incomprehension , " putin said .
" the activities of the latvian and estonian authorities openly connive at the glorification of nazis and their accomplices .
but these facts remain unnoticed by the european union . "
in 2006 , latvian officials banned an annual parade that glorifies the latvian waffen ss against russia 's red army .
some far right supporters marched anyway .
legacy of mistrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a controversial war memorial putin 's remarks are the latest volley in a political war of words between the baltic countries and russia .
latvia , lithuania and estonia joined the european union in 2004 , in part to seek protection from their domineering former rulers in moscow .
soviet forces annexed the baltic countries during world war ii .
the war split the population between those who fought for nazi germany and those who supported russia .
in russia 's view , it liberated the countries from nazi occupation in a victory that cost it 20 million lives .
germany 's defeat is seen as an important historical event and it rejects the accusation that it occupied eastern european countries .
but many people from the baltic states see the red army 's arrival as the beginning of five decades of soviet rule .
during that time , thousands of estonians were deported to soviet prison camps and russians settled in the country .
strained relations continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paying respects animosity flared up again earlier this year when estonian authorities moved a bronze statue of a red army soldier from a downtown tallinn square and moved it to a military cemetery .
rioting caused by the decision to relocate the war memorial left one person dead and a dozen injured .
further protests by pro-kremlin youths at the estonian consulate in moscow lead to scuffles with bodyguards .
in june , estonia buried the remains of eight soviet soldiers who had been exhumed from the tallinn war memorial .
the soldiers were reburied in the estonian defense forces ' cemetery , the same place where the statue was relocated .
a month before the reburial , estonia came under massive cyber attacks , crippling government and corporate web sites for nearly three weeks .
the estonian government suggested that russia could have been behind the attacks and asked for help from nato , which agreed to investigate the incident .
russia has denied any involvement in the cyber attacks .
germany has participated in some behind-the-scenes negotiating on various issues between russia and the baltic countries , but the eu has largely refrained from inserting itself in the disputes .
russia wants an apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltics have a large population of russian minorities the situation in estonia remains volatile . russia 's eu ambassador has said that estonia still owes russia an apology for moving the monument .
without an apology for moving the monument , protests could continue , he said .
putin brought up the war memorial issue wednesday .
" we are seeing a position on the limit of hypocrisy by certain european structures over the moving of the liberation soldier monument in tallinn , " putin said .
putin noted that since estonia 's independence in 1991 , " not a single nazi criminal has been condemned . "
putin admitted there were acts of anti-semitism in russia as well as " chauvinistic , xenophobic and nationalistic demonstrations . "
moshe kantor , head of the european jewish congress , asked putin to recognize the international holocaust day , which was introduced by the united nations in november 2005 .
russia seemed to support the declaration but has not implemented it , kantor said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

latvia , lithuania and estonia joined the european union in 2004 , in part to seek protection from their domineering former rulers in moscow .
soviet forces annexed the baltic countries during world war ii .
the war split the population between those who fought for nazi germany and those who supported russia .
in russia 's view , it liberated the countries from nazi occupation in a victory that cost it 20 million lives .
germany 's defeat is seen as an important historical event and it rejects the accusation that it occupied eastern european countries .
but many people from the baltic states see the red army 's arrival as the beginning of five decades of soviet rule .
during that time , thousands of estonians were deported to soviet prison camps and russians settled in the country .
strained relations continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paying respects animosity flared up again earlier this year when estonian authorities moved a bronze statue of a red army soldier from a downtown tallinn square and moved it to a military cemetery .

further protests by pro-kremlin youths at the estonian consulate in moscow lead to scuffles with bodyguards .
in june , estonia buried the remains of eight soviet soldiers who had been exhumed from the tallinn war memorial .
the soldiers were reburied in the estonian defense forces ' cemetery , the same place where the statue was relocated .
a month before the reburial , estonia came under massive cyber attacks , crippling government and corporate web sites for nearly three weeks .
the estonian government suggested that russia could have been behind the attacks and asked for help from nato , which agreed to investigate the incident .
russia has denied any involvement in the cyber attacks .

10 , russian president vladimir putin said he is dismayed by estonia and latvia 's glorification of nazism .
europe needs to take notice , putin said . putin , speaking in moscow to the european jewish congress , said he was shocked when an annual waffen ss parade took place in latvia in march .
he added that it was disturbing that the european union has largely ignored the problems of pro-nazi groups in these countries .
" some facts which we come up against in several countries of eastern europe have provoked open astonishment and incomprehension , " putin said .
" the activities of the latvian and estonian authorities openly connive at the glorification of nazis and their accomplices .
but these facts remain unnoticed by the european union . "
in 2006 , latvian officials banned an annual parade that glorifies the latvian waffen ss against russia 's red army .
some far right supporters marched anyway .
legacy of mistrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a controversial war memorial putin 's remarks are the latest volley in a political war of words between the baltic countries and russia .
latvia , lithuania and estonia joined the european union in 2004 , in part to seek protection from their domineering former rulers in moscow .
soviet forces annexed the baltic countries during world war ii .
the war split the population between those who fought for nazi germany and those who supported russia .
in russia 's view , it liberated the countries from nazi occupation in a victory that cost it 20 million lives .
germany 's defeat is seen as an important historical event and it rejects the accusation that it occupied eastern european countries .
but many people from the baltic states see the red army 's arrival as the beginning of five decades of soviet rule .
during that time , thousands of estonians were deported to soviet prison camps and russians settled in the country .
strained relations continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paying respects animosity flared up again earlier this year when estonian authorities moved a bronze statue of a red army soldier from a downtown tallinn square and moved it to a military cemetery .
rioting caused by the decision to relocate the war memorial left one person dead and a dozen injured .
further protests by pro-kremlin youths at the estonian consulate in moscow lead to scuffles with bodyguards .
in june , estonia buried the remains of eight soviet soldiers who had been exhumed from the tallinn war memorial .
the soldiers were reburied in the estonian defense forces ' cemetery , the same place where the statue was relocated .
a month before the reburial , estonia came under massive cyber attacks , crippling government and corporate web sites for nearly three weeks .
the estonian government suggested that russia could have been behind the attacks and asked for help from nato , which agreed to investigate the incident .
russia has denied any involvement in the cyber attacks .
germany has participated in some behind-the-scenes negotiating on various issues between russia and the baltic countries , but the eu has largely refrained from inserting itself in the disputes .
russia wants an apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltics have a large population of russian minorities the situation in estonia remains volatile . russia 's eu ambassador has said that estonia still owes russia an apology for moving the monument .
without an apology for moving the monument , protests could continue , he said .
putin brought up the war memorial issue wednesday .
" we are seeing a position on the limit of hypocrisy by certain european structures over the moving of the liberation soldier monument in tallinn , " putin said .
putin noted that since estonia 's independence in 1991 , " not a single nazi criminal has been condemned . "
putin admitted there were acts of anti-semitism in russia as well as " chauvinistic , xenophobic and nationalistic demonstrations . "

both darabi and rhayel could now be released as early as december , federal prosecutor frank wallenta said .
under german law , life sentences are reviewed by authorities after 15 years to decide whether the guilty party can be released .
the five years darabi spent in jail before he was convicted counted towards his life sentence .
when darabi was arrested for the murders , the investigation and subsequent trial sparked a diplomatic crisis between berlin and tehran with german authorities accusing the highest levels of the iranian government of responsibility for the attacks .
at the time , darabi was called an iranian secret agent .
at his sentencing in 1997 , the berlin court which tried darabi said that because of the severity of his crime , he should be held in custody beyond the usual 15 years .
thursday ’ s ruling by the federal prosecutor 's office marks a surprise reversal of that ruling .
the decision to release darabi has been criticized by the israeli government which had appealed to germany not to release the iranian .
israel opposes darabi release bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel refused olmert 's plea to keep darabi behind bars according to thursday 's ha 'aretz newspaper , israeli prime minister ehud olmert made a personal plea to german chancellor angela merkel in an attempt to convince berlin not to release darabi .
the newspaper reported that merkel rebuffed his appeal , telling him that the authorities would follow the letter of the law .
the ha 'aretz report also claimed that israel wanted to use darabi as part of a deal brokered between israel and hezbollah in 2004 in which 400 palestinian prisoners were released in exchange for the bodies of three israeli soldiers killed in 2000 and elhanan tannenbaum , an israeli businessman .
another aspect of the deal was that darabi would be released if hezbollah offered information on the captured israeli air force navigator ron arad , but the deal fell through , the report said .
iran proposed swap for german klein bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald klein served nearly all his 18-month sentence in iran there were also indications that iran , which had strived for the past 10 years to have darabi released , had darabi at the heart of a plan involving prisoner swaps .
the iranian government allegedly spoke with representatives of the german government over a deal involving jailed german fisherman donald klein who was released from prison in tehran earlier this year .
klein had been held captive since 2005 after illegally straying into iranian waters with french companion stephane lherbier while on a fishing expedition .

a new study in germany shows that their womenfolk , however , do n't see things the same way . it is accepted in some scientific circles that orangutans , and not chimpanzees , are the closest relatives to humans among the great apes .
ask a human woman about the similarities between the ginger monkeys and their own species and they are likely to add to the burgeoning evidence that man -lrb- but not necessarily woman -rrb- is but an evolutionary side-step from an orangutan .
the list appears endless at times : body hair , personal hygiene , mating techniques … if you listen to some disgruntled females you could be misled into believing that they live in a monkey house bedecked with hanging tires rather than a swanky apartment filled with the latest modern furniture .
as if to give women even more ammunition , another similarity between german men and orangutans was discovered only last week , courtesy of a certain knuckle-dragger called sibu .
simbu 's blonde ambition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hey baby , feel like gettin ' it on ? "
sibu -lrb- an orangutan and not a german male -rrb- , had become a pain in the hairy backside by refusing to mate with any of the ape babes which swung his way for some primate lovin ' at the apenheul primate park in amsterdam , holland .
instead - and here is where the very tenuous link to german men comes in - he preferred to go monkey nuts over the blonde female humans which attended to him .
sibu 's preference for flaxen-haired female humans , preferably tattooed , fits snugly with documented evidence which says that german gentlemen prefer blondes .
german women , however , do not share sibu 's or their menfolks ' lust for the fair-haired .
well-trimmed , dark-haired men get the nod bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim jong il ticks some , but maybe not all , the boxes a new survey of attractiveness by the gfk research institute on behalf of a german health magazine reveals that when it comes to choosing a mate , german women prefer dark-haired men to blondes .
only 17.2 percent of those questioned found blond men attractive while a total of 28.9 percent favored brown-haired men , and 34.7 percent preferred men with dark hair .
now , while this does n't appear to be such a great problem for the large number of swarthy types out there , the survey showed that german ladies require a little more than just a luxurious inky thatch from their mates .
and this is where our friend sibu comes back in .
grooming high on german women 's list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " lose the beard and then we can talk " if you are a man who has more in common with sibu than his penchant for pneumatic blondes , then even your dusky crowning glory may not save you from being cast aside in the mating game .

a new study in germany shows that their womenfolk , however , do n't see things the same way . it is accepted in some scientific circles that orangutans , and not chimpanzees , are the closest relatives to humans among the great apes .
ask a human woman about the similarities between the ginger monkeys and their own species and they are likely to add to the burgeoning evidence that man -lrb- but not necessarily woman -rrb- is but an evolutionary side-step from an orangutan .
the list appears endless at times : body hair , personal hygiene , mating techniques … if you listen to some disgruntled females you could be misled into believing that they live in a monkey house bedecked with hanging tires rather than a swanky apartment filled with the latest modern furniture .
as if to give women even more ammunition , another similarity between german men and orangutans was discovered only last week , courtesy of a certain knuckle-dragger called sibu .
simbu 's blonde ambition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hey baby , feel like gettin ' it on ? "
sibu -lrb- an orangutan and not a german male -rrb- , had become a pain in the hairy backside by refusing to mate with any of the ape babes which swung his way for some primate lovin ' at the apenheul primate park in amsterdam , holland .
instead - and here is where the very tenuous link to german men comes in - he preferred to go monkey nuts over the blonde female humans which attended to him .
sibu 's preference for flaxen-haired female humans , preferably tattooed , fits snugly with documented evidence which says that german gentlemen prefer blondes .
german women , however , do not share sibu 's or their menfolks ' lust for the fair-haired .
well-trimmed , dark-haired men get the nod bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim jong il ticks some , but maybe not all , the boxes a new survey of attractiveness by the gfk research institute on behalf of a german health magazine reveals that when it comes to choosing a mate , german women prefer dark-haired men to blondes .
only 17.2 percent of those questioned found blond men attractive while a total of 28.9 percent favored brown-haired men , and 34.7 percent preferred men with dark hair .
now , while this does n't appear to be such a great problem for the large number of swarthy types out there , the survey showed that german ladies require a little more than just a luxurious inky thatch from their mates .
and this is where our friend sibu comes back in .

a new study in germany shows that their womenfolk , however , do n't see things the same way . it is accepted in some scientific circles that orangutans , and not chimpanzees , are the closest relatives to humans among the great apes .
ask a human woman about the similarities between the ginger monkeys and their own species and they are likely to add to the burgeoning evidence that man -lrb- but not necessarily woman -rrb- is but an evolutionary side-step from an orangutan .
the list appears endless at times : body hair , personal hygiene , mating techniques … if you listen to some disgruntled females you could be misled into believing that they live in a monkey house bedecked with hanging tires rather than a swanky apartment filled with the latest modern furniture .
as if to give women even more ammunition , another similarity between german men and orangutans was discovered only last week , courtesy of a certain knuckle-dragger called sibu .
simbu 's blonde ambition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hey baby , feel like gettin ' it on ? "
sibu -lrb- an orangutan and not a german male -rrb- , had become a pain in the hairy backside by refusing to mate with any of the ape babes which swung his way for some primate lovin ' at the apenheul primate park in amsterdam , holland .
instead - and here is where the very tenuous link to german men comes in - he preferred to go monkey nuts over the blonde female humans which attended to him .
sibu 's preference for flaxen-haired female humans , preferably tattooed , fits snugly with documented evidence which says that german gentlemen prefer blondes .
german women , however , do not share sibu 's or their menfolks ' lust for the fair-haired .
well-trimmed , dark-haired men get the nod bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim jong il ticks some , but maybe not all , the boxes a new survey of attractiveness by the gfk research institute on behalf of a german health magazine reveals that when it comes to choosing a mate , german women prefer dark-haired men to blondes .
only 17.2 percent of those questioned found blond men attractive while a total of 28.9 percent favored brown-haired men , and 34.7 percent preferred men with dark hair .
now , while this does n't appear to be such a great problem for the large number of swarthy types out there , the survey showed that german ladies require a little more than just a luxurious inky thatch from their mates .
and this is where our friend sibu comes back in .
grooming high on german women 's list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " lose the beard and then we can talk " if you are a man who has more in common with sibu than his penchant for pneumatic blondes , then even your dusky crowning glory may not save you from being cast aside in the mating game .
those also sharing sibu 's grooming and hygiene habits may be forced to fight lesser apes over the monkey bars and fling feces at the cropped and manicured males who are more likely to successfully pair up with the females .
according to the gfk survey , every second woman in germany is attracted to clean-shaven men with short hair and manicured nails .
of the 1,031 women questioned , 59.6 percent found a man with manicured nails attractive , while 50.9 percent said they did not like men with stubble on their chin .
some 53.9 percent said they preferred men to have short hair , with a mere 4.7 percent saying they were attracted to males with a long , flowing mane .

publishers are taking different approaches to google book search , with german publishers launching libreka . german publishers launched libreka , an internet book search machine of their own wednesday , oct .
10 .
they hope libreka will rival google book search while allowing them to keep control .
rüdiger salat , a board executive at holtzbrinck , the top german-based book publisher , said google might someday become a partner to publishers .
but for now it was still " more an enemy . "
google has undertaken a massive project to scan and index book content .
google scans the complete text so that users can find books which contain a specific word or phrase .
under a policy known as " opt out , " google , which is funded by online advertising , says it deletes any books from its search engine if copyright owners request it .
" opt out is not the right way , " said salat , whose group has been a key backer of libreka , the german publishers ' search engine .
a preview was launched at the frankfurt book fair wednesday .
the libreka database contains 8,000 german-language books whose publishers have explicitly " opted in " to the idea .
us publishing executive sees opportunities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has gotten into the book business while us publishers also have qualms about google 's plans to index books , one executive said that the ruckus might soon come to an end .
us publishers and authors began legal action two years ago against google .
peter olson , new york-based chief executive of the world 's biggest book publishing group , random house , said , " i think we are close to resolving our issues .
we have so much in common . "
olson , speaking in a discussion between top industry executives on the first day of the fair , said he wants to see google and publishers charge internet users small fees to see single pages of books online .
olson envisions a set-up similar to popular music downloading services such as itunes , which allow songs to be purchased individually instead of having to buy an entire album .
olson envisions a " pay-per-page " model where a reader could buy single page or chapter .
instead of buying the entire cookbook , a reader could pay for a single carrot cake recipe or get the entire desserts chapter .
giving a share to the book industry would mollify publishers , olson said .
" i think it makes sense for both sides , " said olson .

the project was started in 2005 and has been engineered by a delhi , india software house , mps , in which holtzbrinck is a shareholder .
libreka is an offshoot of germany 's books-in-print database .
its target audience seems to be german bookstores , who could put it on their websites to help shoppers find books they want to buy .
ronald schild , head of the libreka project , said publishers could decide if part or even all of a book should be freely downloadable .
the name libreka not only suggested " books " but also the latin adjective liber -lrb- free -rrb- and the greek exclamation " eureka " -lrb- i 've found it -rrb- , schild said .
some commentators have called it the " anti-google , " since it tries to keep the publishing industry in control of book searching .
at the libreka launch , the german association of publishers and booksellers denied any hostility or rivalry with google .
the group said it was in negotiations about cooperation deals with the us company .

publishers are taking different approaches to google book search , with german publishers launching libreka . german publishers launched libreka , an internet book search machine of their own wednesday , oct .
10 .
they hope libreka will rival google book search while allowing them to keep control .
rüdiger salat , a board executive at holtzbrinck , the top german-based book publisher , said google might someday become a partner to publishers .
but for now it was still " more an enemy . "
google has undertaken a massive project to scan and index book content .
google scans the complete text so that users can find books which contain a specific word or phrase .
under a policy known as " opt out , " google , which is funded by online advertising , says it deletes any books from its search engine if copyright owners request it .
" opt out is not the right way , " said salat , whose group has been a key backer of libreka , the german publishers ' search engine .
a preview was launched at the frankfurt book fair wednesday .
the libreka database contains 8,000 german-language books whose publishers have explicitly " opted in " to the idea .
us publishing executive sees opportunities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has gotten into the book business while us publishers also have qualms about google 's plans to index books , one executive said that the ruckus might soon come to an end .
us publishers and authors began legal action two years ago against google .
peter olson , new york-based chief executive of the world 's biggest book publishing group , random house , said , " i think we are close to resolving our issues .
we have so much in common . "
olson , speaking in a discussion between top industry executives on the first day of the fair , said he wants to see google and publishers charge internet users small fees to see single pages of books online .
olson envisions a set-up similar to popular music downloading services such as itunes , which allow songs to be purchased individually instead of having to buy an entire album .
olson envisions a " pay-per-page " model where a reader could buy single page or chapter .
instead of buying the entire cookbook , a reader could pay for a single carrot cake recipe or get the entire desserts chapter .
giving a share to the book industry would mollify publishers , olson said .
" i think it makes sense for both sides , " said olson .

the project was started in 2005 and has been engineered by a delhi , india software house , mps , in which holtzbrinck is a shareholder .
libreka is an offshoot of germany 's books-in-print database .
its target audience seems to be german bookstores , who could put it on their websites to help shoppers find books they want to buy .
ronald schild , head of the libreka project , said publishers could decide if part or even all of a book should be freely downloadable .
the name libreka not only suggested " books " but also the latin adjective liber -lrb- free -rrb- and the greek exclamation " eureka " -lrb- i 've found it -rrb- , schild said .
some commentators have called it the " anti-google , " since it tries to keep the publishing industry in control of book searching .
at the libreka launch , the german association of publishers and booksellers denied any hostility or rivalry with google .
the group said it was in negotiations about cooperation deals with the us company .
" we should not underestimate the potential of libreka . " said jens redmer , google book search 's chief of european operations .

dw-world.de takes a look at who and what are behind one of the most prestigious awards in the world . who was alfred nobel ? alfred nobel was born in stockholm in 1833 .
together with his father , who was an engineer , he developed the explosive nitroglycerine , which proved a commercial success . despite the danger of the project - nobel 's brother emil was killed in an experiment in 1864 - he continued his research , patenting what he called dynamite in 1867 .
the invention proved very useful in the construction industry and nobel traveled the world selling his product .
when not on the road , he diligently conducted research and registered 355 patents in his name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel was active as a chemist and physicist and pursued literature in his free time nobel 's talent as both a scientist and a businessman allowed him to amass a considerable fortune .
he was also fluent in several languages , wrote poetry and drama , and had a deep interest in philosophy and literature . how did the nobel prize come about ? after his death in 1896 , the opening of nobel 's will caused a considerable stir : he had left the majority of his money to the establishment of " prizes to those who , during the preceding year , shall have conferred the greatest benefit to mankind " in physics , chemistry , medicine , literature and peace . family members contested the will .
others were irked at the international nature of the new prizes .
the biggest shock , however , was the peace prize .
the name nobel had been associated with explosives and weapons - not with peace . nobel 's friend and former secretary countess bertha von suttner , a vocal pacifist , is credited with having had a significant impact on the millionaire , and was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1905 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel thought hard about the ramifications of his inventions for humanity " perhaps my factories will put an end to war sooner than your congresses , " he wrote the countess in 1891 .
two-and-a-half decades before world war one , nobel could n't have foreseen just how wrong he would be . because nobel had not composed his will with the help of a lawyer nor specified how the prizes should be awarded , it took five years to sort out the details before the first nobel prize could be awarded in 1901 . in 1968 , sweden 's central bank established the sveriges riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of alfred nobel .
the five original prizes are administered by the nobel foundation in stockholm . how are the winners selected ? candidates are nominated a year in advance by qualified parties in the six relevant fields .
academics , politicians , prominent scientists , previous nobel laureates and others receive personal invitations each year to nominate a candidate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertha von suttner worked for nobel for only a few months the nominators are selected in such a way so that as many different countries as possible are represented over time .
their nominations are kept secret for 50 years . in his will , alfred nobel specifically indicated five swedish institutions responsible for choosing the prize recipients in each category . the royal swedish academy of sciences has selected the economics prize laureates since 1969 . interesting facts : * 772 individuals and 19 organizations have been awarded the nobel prize , some more than once .
thirty-four women are among the prize winners . * the youngest nobel laureate , lawrence bragg , was just 25 when he accepted the prize .
he shared the 1915 nobel prize in physics with his father . * raymond david jr . , nearly 88 when he was awarded the nobel prize in physics in 2002 , was the oldest nobel laureate . * several would-be nobel recipients either declined to accept their award or were forced to decline for political reasons . jean-paul sartre , who consistently turned down all public honors , did n't accept his 1964 nobel prize in literature .
in 1973 , le duc tho was awarded the nobel peace prize jointly with us secretary of state henry kissinger for negotiating the vietnam peace accord .
tho declined the prize due to the situation in vietnam . three german nobel laureates - richard kuhn , adolf butenandt and gerhard domagk - were forbidden by adolf hitler to accept their prizes .
they received their diplomas and medals belatedly , but not the monetary award .
in 1958 , soviet authorities forced boris pasternak to return the nobel prize in literature he had initially accepted . * four individuals have been awarded two nobel prizes : john bardeen -lrb- physics 1956 , 1972 -rrb- marie curie -lrb- physics 1903 , chemistry 1911 -rrb- linus pauling -lrb- chemistry 1954 , peace 1962 -rrb- frederick sanger -lrb- chemistry 1958 , 1980 -rrb- * the nobel peace prize has been awarded three times to the international committee of the red cross -lrb- 1917 , 1944 , 1963 -rrb- and twice to the un refugee agency -lrb- 1954 , 1981 -rrb- . * together , the curies have collected more nobel prizes than any other family .

the five original prizes are administered by the nobel foundation in stockholm . how are the winners selected ? candidates are nominated a year in advance by qualified parties in the six relevant fields .
academics , politicians , prominent scientists , previous nobel laureates and others receive personal invitations each year to nominate a candidate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertha von suttner worked for nobel for only a few months the nominators are selected in such a way so that as many different countries as possible are represented over time .
their nominations are kept secret for 50 years . in his will , alfred nobel specifically indicated five swedish institutions responsible for choosing the prize recipients in each category . the royal swedish academy of sciences has selected the economics prize laureates since 1969 . interesting facts : * 772 individuals and 19 organizations have been awarded the nobel prize , some more than once .
thirty-four women are among the prize winners . * the youngest nobel laureate , lawrence bragg , was just 25 when he accepted the prize .
he shared the 1915 nobel prize in physics with his father . * raymond david jr . , nearly 88 when he was awarded the nobel prize in physics in 2002 , was the oldest nobel laureate . * several would-be nobel recipients either declined to accept their award or were forced to decline for political reasons . jean-paul sartre , who consistently turned down all public honors , did n't accept his 1964 nobel prize in literature .
in 1973 , le duc tho was awarded the nobel peace prize jointly with us secretary of state henry kissinger for negotiating the vietnam peace accord .
tho declined the prize due to the situation in vietnam . three german nobel laureates - richard kuhn , adolf butenandt and gerhard domagk - were forbidden by adolf hitler to accept their prizes .
they received their diplomas and medals belatedly , but not the monetary award .
in 1958 , soviet authorities forced boris pasternak to return the nobel prize in literature he had initially accepted . * four individuals have been awarded two nobel prizes : john bardeen -lrb- physics 1956 , 1972 -rrb- marie curie -lrb- physics 1903 , chemistry 1911 -rrb- linus pauling -lrb- chemistry 1954 , peace 1962 -rrb- frederick sanger -lrb- chemistry 1958 , 1980 -rrb- * the nobel peace prize has been awarded three times to the international committee of the red cross -lrb- 1917 , 1944 , 1963 -rrb- and twice to the un refugee agency -lrb- 1954 , 1981 -rrb- . * together , the curies have collected more nobel prizes than any other family .
marie curie shared half of the physics prize with her husband pierre in 1903 .
their daughter irene shared the chemistry prize with her husband frederic joliot in 1935 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the decision , however , comes at a time of tension with croatia in a row with italy and slovenia over fishing rights in the adriatic sea which some observers say could muddy the diplomatic waters for zagreb .
the dispute over croatia 's imposition of a fisheries protection zone and another disagreement over tracing the maritime border between slovenia and croatia could hit the membership process at any stage .
european sources said that there is a particular risk of a hiccup in the membership talks when the chapter on security and defense comes up for consideration .
despite row , croatia confident of membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn the european commission urged croatia not to activate the fisheries protection zone unilaterally , recognizing that the decision could have a negative impact on negotiations , said a spokesman for eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn .
despite the row , the croatian government is confident of becoming the eu 's 28th member state and hopes to do so in 2009 .
its progress compares very favorably with fellow eu candidate nation turkey , which began talks at the same time but has so far opened only four policy chapters due to its refusal to trade openly with eu member cyprus . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 11.10.2007 " crushed like garlic " : cambodian sex slavery großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are over 30,000 sex-workers in cambodia at nuremberg 's 3rd international human rights film festival , cambodian rithy panh won the award for his powerful documentary about the s21 school-turned-detention centre , in which 1000s were interrogated , tortured and executed during the khmer rouge 's brutal rule .
four years later , his equally potent film about cambodian prostitutes , which is overshadowed by the khmer rouge 's legacy , made it into the competition of the 5th festival , which came to an end on wednesday . " paper can not wrap up embers " tells the story of seven young women forced to sell their bodies in phnom penh so they can help support their impoverished families in the country .
" the dead are quiet and the living suffer , " says one of the women , whose life rithy pahn follows .
the depiction of women who are exploited as sex slaves in contemporary cambodian society , which still bears the scars of the khmer rouge 's regime is very intimate and moving .
panh has said his film is " as close as one can get to the life - and thus spiritual death - of a prostitute " .
the un estimates there are 30,000 prostitutes in cambodia .
there are also countless numbers of cambodian prostitutes in thailand and malaysia .
pahn portrays their daily existences and listens to their views .
he is not interested in the sleazy underworld of the red light district but depicts the ordinary aspects of the women 's lives .
the viewers get to know the women as they cook , eat , argue , do the accounts , shoot up , cry and they listen to them talk .
they talk about the customers : " they get laid and hit us like animals , " says one .
" we get exploited and crushed like garlic , " explains another .
sold into sex slavery they talk about how they got into prostitution .
some were sold into slavery by their parents , others were abandoned as children , others made their way to the capital to find work .
one woman says she is too old and can only get " tricks " from rickshaw drivers - she explains her husband does n't help her and she needs to work so he can eat his rice .
her two-year-old son was stolen from her .
it turns out she 's only 34 and has been working as a prostitute for nine years .
another was raped by her father ...
the individual reasons are numerous , but collectively it is clear that the khmer rouge also has a large part of responsibility .
the bitter memories of its brutal reign are omnipresent .
many of the women grew up in un refugee camps and did not have access to education .
lack of qualifications drove them to prostitution .
one mother tells her daughter who complains about having to work as a sex slave for a kilo of rice that she has it easy : " under the khmer rouge it was much worse , there was no food and executions ; we had to share watered-down soup . "
at least you can eat is the implication .
driven to despair and although the survival skills honed under the khmer rouge continue to be used in the contemporary era , many of the young women are almost driven to despair - suicide and death are a recurring theme .
the women talk about the violence of their customers - they all know stories of women who have literally been battered to death .
" if we die , nobody cares , " one says matter-of-factly .
aids is also a common cause of death among the prostitutes who discuss the disease 's origin - monkeys and un peacekeepers are but two possibilities ...
a woman says the " bastard white men " who have sex without condoms are not afraid to die .
her friend answers indifferently : " if you have aids you die , if you do n't you die too . "
this is an indication that , emotionally , she already feels dead and this feeling is shared by many others : " lying down on a bed is like lying on the butcher 's block , " one states .
another : " when a client has sex with me , he has sex with a dead girl . "
rithy pahn thus continues his exploration of death and brutality in cambodian society , depicting the lives of women who , despite all their bitterness and anger , at times laugh and sing , finding refuge in painting or poetry and doing their best to get through their suffering so long as they are still alive . anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 interview suu kyi calls for more support from europe the burmese civil rights activist talks to dw in an exclusive interview .

" paper can not wrap up embers " tells the story of seven young women forced to sell their bodies in phnom penh so they can help support their impoverished families in the country .
" the dead are quiet and the living suffer , " says one of the women , whose life rithy pahn follows .
the depiction of women who are exploited as sex slaves in contemporary cambodian society , which still bears the scars of the khmer rouge 's regime is very intimate and moving .
panh has said his film is " as close as one can get to the life - and thus spiritual death - of a prostitute " .
the un estimates there are 30,000 prostitutes in cambodia .
there are also countless numbers of cambodian prostitutes in thailand and malaysia .
pahn portrays their daily existences and listens to their views .
he is not interested in the sleazy underworld of the red light district but depicts the ordinary aspects of the women 's lives .
the viewers get to know the women as they cook , eat , argue , do the accounts , shoot up , cry and they listen to them talk .
they talk about the customers : " they get laid and hit us like animals , " says one .
" we get exploited and crushed like garlic , " explains another .
sold into sex slavery they talk about how they got into prostitution .
some were sold into slavery by their parents , others were abandoned as children , others made their way to the capital to find work .
one woman says she is too old and can only get " tricks " from rickshaw drivers - she explains her husband does n't help her and she needs to work so he can eat his rice .
her two-year-old son was stolen from her .
it turns out she 's only 34 and has been working as a prostitute for nine years .
another was raped by her father ...
the individual reasons are numerous , but collectively it is clear that the khmer rouge also has a large part of responsibility .
the bitter memories of its brutal reign are omnipresent .
many of the women grew up in un refugee camps and did not have access to education .
lack of qualifications drove them to prostitution .
one mother tells her daughter who complains about having to work as a sex slave for a kilo of rice that she has it easy : " under the khmer rouge it was much worse , there was no food and executions ; we had to share watered-down soup . "
at least you can eat is the implication .
driven to despair and although the survival skills honed under the khmer rouge continue to be used in the contemporary era , many of the young women are almost driven to despair - suicide and death are a recurring theme .
the women talk about the violence of their customers - they all know stories of women who have literally been battered to death .
" if we die , nobody cares , " one says matter-of-factly .
aids is also a common cause of death among the prostitutes who discuss the disease 's origin - monkeys and un peacekeepers are but two possibilities ...
a woman says the " bastard white men " who have sex without condoms are not afraid to die .
her friend answers indifferently : " if you have aids you die , if you do n't you die too . "
this is an indication that , emotionally , she already feels dead and this feeling is shared by many others : " lying down on a bed is like lying on the butcher 's block , " one states .
another : " when a client has sex with me , he has sex with a dead girl . "
rithy pahn thus continues his exploration of death and brutality in cambodian society , depicting the lives of women who , despite all their bitterness and anger , at times laugh and sing , finding refuge in painting or poetry and doing their best to get through their suffering so long as they are still alive . anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 kashmir the indian security forces have arrested kashmir separatist leader syed ali shah geelani prof. javeed alam , expert on kashmir talks about the impact of the arrest on the kashmir issue september asia quiz quiz of the month pakistan floods in pakistan click here to find out more about pakistan 's flood situation and relief work .

four years later , his equally potent film about cambodian prostitutes , which is overshadowed by the khmer rouge 's legacy , made it into the competition of the 5th festival , which came to an end on wednesday . " paper can not wrap up embers " tells the story of seven young women forced to sell their bodies in phnom penh so they can help support their impoverished families in the country .
" the dead are quiet and the living suffer , " says one of the women , whose life rithy pahn follows .
the depiction of women who are exploited as sex slaves in contemporary cambodian society , which still bears the scars of the khmer rouge 's regime is very intimate and moving .
panh has said his film is " as close as one can get to the life - and thus spiritual death - of a prostitute " .
the un estimates there are 30,000 prostitutes in cambodia .
there are also countless numbers of cambodian prostitutes in thailand and malaysia .
pahn portrays their daily existences and listens to their views .
he is not interested in the sleazy underworld of the red light district but depicts the ordinary aspects of the women 's lives .
the viewers get to know the women as they cook , eat , argue , do the accounts , shoot up , cry and they listen to them talk .
they talk about the customers : " they get laid and hit us like animals , " says one .
" we get exploited and crushed like garlic , " explains another .
sold into sex slavery they talk about how they got into prostitution .
some were sold into slavery by their parents , others were abandoned as children , others made their way to the capital to find work .
one woman says she is too old and can only get " tricks " from rickshaw drivers - she explains her husband does n't help her and she needs to work so he can eat his rice .
her two-year-old son was stolen from her .
it turns out she 's only 34 and has been working as a prostitute for nine years .
another was raped by her father ...
the individual reasons are numerous , but collectively it is clear that the khmer rouge also has a large part of responsibility .
the bitter memories of its brutal reign are omnipresent .
many of the women grew up in un refugee camps and did not have access to education .
lack of qualifications drove them to prostitution .
one mother tells her daughter who complains about having to work as a sex slave for a kilo of rice that she has it easy : " under the khmer rouge it was much worse , there was no food and executions ; we had to share watered-down soup . "
at least you can eat is the implication .
driven to despair and although the survival skills honed under the khmer rouge continue to be used in the contemporary era , many of the young women are almost driven to despair - suicide and death are a recurring theme .
the women talk about the violence of their customers - they all know stories of women who have literally been battered to death .
" if we die , nobody cares , " one says matter-of-factly .
aids is also a common cause of death among the prostitutes who discuss the disease 's origin - monkeys and un peacekeepers are but two possibilities ...
a woman says the " bastard white men " who have sex without condoms are not afraid to die .
her friend answers indifferently : " if you have aids you die , if you do n't you die too . "
this is an indication that , emotionally , she already feels dead and this feeling is shared by many others : " lying down on a bed is like lying on the butcher 's block , " one states .
another : " when a client has sex with me , he has sex with a dead girl . "
rithy pahn thus continues his exploration of death and brutality in cambodian society , depicting the lives of women who , despite all their bitterness and anger , at times laugh and sing , finding refuge in painting or poetry and doing their best to get through their suffering so long as they are still alive . anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9798 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

that 's why the center plans to approach young athletes about the risks doping pose .
the center also plans to educate coaches and teachers on doping and drug abuse and to create ad campaigns to help prevent doping among young athletes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : educational material and school lessons are part of the center 's plans to cut youth doping " we can show young people alternatives to consider , but it 's up to them to make the decision , " treutlein said .
faith in doping-free international sports has most recently been shaken by china 's top female triathlete being banned from two years of completion for taking performance-enhancing drugs , us sprinter and triple olympic champion marion jones confessing to doping and returning her medals from the sydney olympics , and a tour de france that was marred by doping cases and allegations .
" young athletes have to be strengthened , " said michale hölz , head of the board of trustees for germany 's national doping agency .
" we do not need just responsible citizens , we also need responsible athletes . "

then an extension is theoretically possible . "
hainer said adidas could end their engagement instantly if there are new doping cases in the team .
t-mobile earlier this year fired german rider patrick sinkewitz over a positive test and ukrainian rider serhiy honchar over suspicious test results . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the two suspected terrorists had placed two suitcases containing bombs on the trains .

shahid said he decided to send his son to germany for the better education and job opportunities that were available there .
jihad hamad turned up at his parents ' house in tripoli shortly after the attempted bombings .
jihad , who had been taking german language classes for six months in germany , explained his sudden appearance by saying that he was worried about his parents because of the july 2006 israeli war against lebanon 's hezbollah movement at the time .
jihad has given a partial confession to lebanese authorities , saying that he deposited a piece of luggage in one of the trains but was not aware of its contents .

performance-enhancing drug use in poplar and youth sports has , however , remained a little-researched field , treutlein said .

faith in doping-free international sports has most recently been shaken by china 's top female triathlete being banned from two years of completion for taking performance-enhancing drugs , us sprinter and triple olympic champion marion jones confessing to doping and returning her medals from the sydney olympics , and a tour de france that was marred by doping cases and allegations .

10 , russian president vladimir putin said he is dismayed by estonia and latvia 's glorification of nazism .
europe needs to take notice , putin said . putin , speaking in moscow to the european jewish congress , said he was shocked when an annual waffen ss parade took place in latvia in march .
he added that it was disturbing that the european union has largely ignored the problems of pro-nazi groups in these countries .
" some facts which we come up against in several countries of eastern europe have provoked open astonishment and incomprehension , " putin said .
" the activities of the latvian and estonian authorities openly connive at the glorification of nazis and their accomplices .
but these facts remain unnoticed by the european union . "
in 2006 , latvian officials banned an annual parade that glorifies the latvian waffen ss against russia 's red army .
some far right supporters marched anyway .
legacy of mistrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a controversial war memorial putin 's remarks are the latest volley in a political war of words between the baltic countries and russia .
latvia , lithuania and estonia joined the european union in 2004 , in part to seek protection from their domineering former rulers in moscow .
soviet forces annexed the baltic countries during world war ii .
the war split the population between those who fought for nazi germany and those who supported russia .
in russia 's view , it liberated the countries from nazi occupation in a victory that cost it 20 million lives .
germany 's defeat is seen as an important historical event and it rejects the accusation that it occupied eastern european countries .
but many people from the baltic states see the red army 's arrival as the beginning of five decades of soviet rule .
during that time , thousands of estonians were deported to soviet prison camps and russians settled in the country .
strained relations continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paying respects animosity flared up again earlier this year when estonian authorities moved a bronze statue of a red army soldier from a downtown tallinn square and moved it to a military cemetery .
rioting caused by the decision to relocate the war memorial left one person dead and a dozen injured .
further protests by pro-kremlin youths at the estonian consulate in moscow lead to scuffles with bodyguards .
in june , estonia buried the remains of eight soviet soldiers who had been exhumed from the tallinn war memorial .
the soldiers were reburied in the estonian defense forces ' cemetery , the same place where the statue was relocated .
a month before the reburial , estonia came under massive cyber attacks , crippling government and corporate web sites for nearly three weeks .
the estonian government suggested that russia could have been behind the attacks and asked for help from nato , which agreed to investigate the incident .
russia has denied any involvement in the cyber attacks .
germany has participated in some behind-the-scenes negotiating on various issues between russia and the baltic countries , but the eu has largely refrained from inserting itself in the disputes .
russia wants an apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltics have a large population of russian minorities the situation in estonia remains volatile . russia 's eu ambassador has said that estonia still owes russia an apology for moving the monument .
without an apology for moving the monument , protests could continue , he said .
putin brought up the war memorial issue wednesday .
" we are seeing a position on the limit of hypocrisy by certain european structures over the moving of the liberation soldier monument in tallinn , " putin said .
putin noted that since estonia 's independence in 1991 , " not a single nazi criminal has been condemned . "
putin admitted there were acts of anti-semitism in russia as well as " chauvinistic , xenophobic and nationalistic demonstrations . "
moshe kantor , head of the european jewish congress , asked putin to recognize the international holocaust day , which was introduced by the united nations in november 2005 .
russia seemed to support the declaration but has not implemented it , kantor said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 , russian president vladimir putin said he is dismayed by estonia and latvia 's glorification of nazism .
europe needs to take notice , putin said . putin , speaking in moscow to the european jewish congress , said he was shocked when an annual waffen ss parade took place in latvia in march .
he added that it was disturbing that the european union has largely ignored the problems of pro-nazi groups in these countries .
" some facts which we come up against in several countries of eastern europe have provoked open astonishment and incomprehension , " putin said .
" the activities of the latvian and estonian authorities openly connive at the glorification of nazis and their accomplices .
but these facts remain unnoticed by the european union . "
in 2006 , latvian officials banned an annual parade that glorifies the latvian waffen ss against russia 's red army .
some far right supporters marched anyway .
legacy of mistrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a controversial war memorial putin 's remarks are the latest volley in a political war of words between the baltic countries and russia .
latvia , lithuania and estonia joined the european union in 2004 , in part to seek protection from their domineering former rulers in moscow .
soviet forces annexed the baltic countries during world war ii .
the war split the population between those who fought for nazi germany and those who supported russia .
in russia 's view , it liberated the countries from nazi occupation in a victory that cost it 20 million lives .
germany 's defeat is seen as an important historical event and it rejects the accusation that it occupied eastern european countries .
but many people from the baltic states see the red army 's arrival as the beginning of five decades of soviet rule .
during that time , thousands of estonians were deported to soviet prison camps and russians settled in the country .
strained relations continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paying respects animosity flared up again earlier this year when estonian authorities moved a bronze statue of a red army soldier from a downtown tallinn square and moved it to a military cemetery .

10 , not to license huge 60-ton trailer trucks on german roads , saying the trucks posed a danger to automobile traffic on the country 's autobahns . a majority of the ministers from germany 's 16 states , meeting along with federal transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , had taken the decision on the basis of a study prepared by a working group . tiefensee said he was pleased the german ministers came to clear a decision before the european union begins debate on issue next year . the decision refers to 25-meter -lrb- 82-foot -rrb- trucks capable of hauling up to 60 tons of goods and was taken after a trial of the vehicles , comprising three standard 6-meter containers , on some stretches of germany 's highways . potential traffic hazards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german automobile club said gigaliners posed a danger to cars the study , which neither approved nor rejected the use of " gigaliners , " found that traffic would not increase due to the extended-trailers but said the added weight could pose a potential problem over bridges and in tunnels , according to a report in the daily süddeutsche zeitung . in general , trailer trucks on european roads may be no heavier than 40 tons and no longer than 18.75 meters , though longer vehicles are allowed to transport wood in sweden and finland . the use in germany of extra-long trucks that exceed established authorized weights is not possible however " because of the elevated risk to transport security , " the ministers said .
about 75 percent of germans said they were against allowing the extended trailers , according to a survey published by the forsa research institute . proponents of the huge trucks say they would cut freight costs and fuel consumption by 15 percent .
they deny the trucks would have a negative impact on roads , as the weight carried by each axle would not rise .
" this eliminates efficiency increases necessary in commercial transport without presenting other sustainable solutions , " said kay-dirk lindemann a traffic expert for the federation of german industries . european transit country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are over 700,000 trailer trucks registed for use on german highways the adac , germany 's largest automobile club , however , welcomed the ministers ' decision .
" this is a huge success for traffic safety and road infrastructure , " ulrich klaus becker , the association 's vice president , said in a statement .
" the risks for car traffic would have been immense . " the ministers recommended concluding the current gigaliner trial operations underway in three german states but said there was no reason to begin a closer examination of the trucks ' feasibility in germany . a transit country for many of the goods shipped throughout europe , germany 's autobahns are free for cars .
the government began charging trailer trucks a per-kilometer fee in 2005 bringing in a total of about 3.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- last year . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both darabi and rhayel could now be released as early as december , federal prosecutor frank wallenta said .
under german law , life sentences are reviewed by authorities after 15 years to decide whether the guilty party can be released .
the five years darabi spent in jail before he was convicted counted towards his life sentence .
when darabi was arrested for the murders , the investigation and subsequent trial sparked a diplomatic crisis between berlin and tehran with german authorities accusing the highest levels of the iranian government of responsibility for the attacks .
at the time , darabi was called an iranian secret agent .
at his sentencing in 1997 , the berlin court which tried darabi said that because of the severity of his crime , he should be held in custody beyond the usual 15 years .
thursday ’ s ruling by the federal prosecutor 's office marks a surprise reversal of that ruling .
the decision to release darabi has been criticized by the israeli government which had appealed to germany not to release the iranian .

the newspaper reported that merkel rebuffed his appeal , telling him that the authorities would follow the letter of the law .
the ha 'aretz report also claimed that israel wanted to use darabi as part of a deal brokered between israel and hezbollah in 2004 in which 400 palestinian prisoners were released in exchange for the bodies of three israeli soldiers killed in 2000 and elhanan tannenbaum , an israeli businessman .
another aspect of the deal was that darabi would be released if hezbollah offered information on the captured israeli air force navigator ron arad , but the deal fell through , the report said .

at his sentencing in 1997 , the berlin court which tried darabi said that because of the severity of his crime , he should be held in custody beyond the usual 15 years .
thursday ’ s ruling by the federal prosecutor 's office marks a surprise reversal of that ruling .
the decision to release darabi has been criticized by the israeli government which had appealed to germany not to release the iranian .

the newspaper reported that merkel rebuffed his appeal , telling him that the authorities would follow the letter of the law .
the ha 'aretz report also claimed that israel wanted to use darabi as part of a deal brokered between israel and hezbollah in 2004 in which 400 palestinian prisoners were released in exchange for the bodies of three israeli soldiers killed in 2000 and elhanan tannenbaum , an israeli businessman .

both darabi and rhayel could now be released as early as december , federal prosecutor frank wallenta said .

publishers are taking different approaches to google book search , with german publishers launching libreka . german publishers launched libreka , an internet book search machine of their own wednesday , oct .
10 .
they hope libreka will rival google book search while allowing them to keep control .
rüdiger salat , a board executive at holtzbrinck , the top german-based book publisher , said google might someday become a partner to publishers .
but for now it was still " more an enemy . "
google has undertaken a massive project to scan and index book content .
google scans the complete text so that users can find books which contain a specific word or phrase .
under a policy known as " opt out , " google , which is funded by online advertising , says it deletes any books from its search engine if copyright owners request it .
" opt out is not the right way , " said salat , whose group has been a key backer of libreka , the german publishers ' search engine .
a preview was launched at the frankfurt book fair wednesday .
the libreka database contains 8,000 german-language books whose publishers have explicitly " opted in " to the idea .
us publishing executive sees opportunities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has gotten into the book business while us publishers also have qualms about google 's plans to index books , one executive said that the ruckus might soon come to an end .
us publishers and authors began legal action two years ago against google .
peter olson , new york-based chief executive of the world 's biggest book publishing group , random house , said , " i think we are close to resolving our issues .
we have so much in common . "
olson , speaking in a discussion between top industry executives on the first day of the fair , said he wants to see google and publishers charge internet users small fees to see single pages of books online .
olson envisions a set-up similar to popular music downloading services such as itunes , which allow songs to be purchased individually instead of having to buy an entire album .
olson envisions a " pay-per-page " model where a reader could buy single page or chapter .
instead of buying the entire cookbook , a reader could pay for a single carrot cake recipe or get the entire desserts chapter .
giving a share to the book industry would mollify publishers , olson said .

the project was started in 2005 and has been engineered by a delhi , india software house , mps , in which holtzbrinck is a shareholder .
libreka is an offshoot of germany 's books-in-print database .
its target audience seems to be german bookstores , who could put it on their websites to help shoppers find books they want to buy .
ronald schild , head of the libreka project , said publishers could decide if part or even all of a book should be freely downloadable .

some commentators have called it the " anti-google , " since it tries to keep the publishing industry in control of book searching .
at the libreka launch , the german association of publishers and booksellers denied any hostility or rivalry with google .
the group said it was in negotiations about cooperation deals with the us company .

publishers are taking different approaches to google book search , with german publishers launching libreka . german publishers launched libreka , an internet book search machine of their own wednesday , oct .
10 .
they hope libreka will rival google book search while allowing them to keep control .
rüdiger salat , a board executive at holtzbrinck , the top german-based book publisher , said google might someday become a partner to publishers .
but for now it was still " more an enemy . "
google has undertaken a massive project to scan and index book content .
google scans the complete text so that users can find books which contain a specific word or phrase .
under a policy known as " opt out , " google , which is funded by online advertising , says it deletes any books from its search engine if copyright owners request it .
" opt out is not the right way , " said salat , whose group has been a key backer of libreka , the german publishers ' search engine .
a preview was launched at the frankfurt book fair wednesday .
the libreka database contains 8,000 german-language books whose publishers have explicitly " opted in " to the idea .

peter olson , new york-based chief executive of the world 's biggest book publishing group , random house , said , " i think we are close to resolving our issues .
we have so much in common . "
olson , speaking in a discussion between top industry executives on the first day of the fair , said he wants to see google and publishers charge internet users small fees to see single pages of books online .
olson envisions a set-up similar to popular music downloading services such as itunes , which allow songs to be purchased individually instead of having to buy an entire album .
olson envisions a " pay-per-page " model where a reader could buy single page or chapter .
instead of buying the entire cookbook , a reader could pay for a single carrot cake recipe or get the entire desserts chapter .

a new study in germany shows that their womenfolk , however , do n't see things the same way . it is accepted in some scientific circles that orangutans , and not chimpanzees , are the closest relatives to humans among the great apes .
ask a human woman about the similarities between the ginger monkeys and their own species and they are likely to add to the burgeoning evidence that man -lrb- but not necessarily woman -rrb- is but an evolutionary side-step from an orangutan .
the list appears endless at times : body hair , personal hygiene , mating techniques … if you listen to some disgruntled females you could be misled into believing that they live in a monkey house bedecked with hanging tires rather than a swanky apartment filled with the latest modern furniture .
as if to give women even more ammunition , another similarity between german men and orangutans was discovered only last week , courtesy of a certain knuckle-dragger called sibu .
simbu 's blonde ambition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hey baby , feel like gettin ' it on ? "
sibu -lrb- an orangutan and not a german male -rrb- , had become a pain in the hairy backside by refusing to mate with any of the ape babes which swung his way for some primate lovin ' at the apenheul primate park in amsterdam , holland .
instead - and here is where the very tenuous link to german men comes in - he preferred to go monkey nuts over the blonde female humans which attended to him .
sibu 's preference for flaxen-haired female humans , preferably tattooed , fits snugly with documented evidence which says that german gentlemen prefer blondes .
german women , however , do not share sibu 's or their menfolks ' lust for the fair-haired .
well-trimmed , dark-haired men get the nod bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim jong il ticks some , but maybe not all , the boxes a new survey of attractiveness by the gfk research institute on behalf of a german health magazine reveals that when it comes to choosing a mate , german women prefer dark-haired men to blondes .
only 17.2 percent of those questioned found blond men attractive while a total of 28.9 percent favored brown-haired men , and 34.7 percent preferred men with dark hair .
now , while this does n't appear to be such a great problem for the large number of swarthy types out there , the survey showed that german ladies require a little more than just a luxurious inky thatch from their mates .
and this is where our friend sibu comes back in .
grooming high on german women 's list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " lose the beard and then we can talk " if you are a man who has more in common with sibu than his penchant for pneumatic blondes , then even your dusky crowning glory may not save you from being cast aside in the mating game .
those also sharing sibu 's grooming and hygiene habits may be forced to fight lesser apes over the monkey bars and fling feces at the cropped and manicured males who are more likely to successfully pair up with the females .
according to the gfk survey , every second woman in germany is attracted to clean-shaven men with short hair and manicured nails .
of the 1,031 women questioned , 59.6 percent found a man with manicured nails attractive , while 50.9 percent said they did not like men with stubble on their chin .
some 53.9 percent said they preferred men to have short hair , with a mere 4.7 percent saying they were attracted to males with a long , flowing mane .
all is not lost for those deemed unattractive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : torsten frings curses his long hair - as many of us have so , if you 're a blonde , long-haired german guy with talon-like fingernails and the habits of an orangutan , you may consider looking elsewhere for a less-fussy mate .
if you have n't had enough of being compared to sibu already , you may want to follow his lead one more time .
after striking out with all the blonde women he had the hots for , our tree-swinging hero finally found love with his own type - in britain . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the court seemed skeptical . the government argued on wednesday , oct .

" germany is part of a global danger zone and can at any time become the target of terrorism attacks , " he told judges .
" the internet has become a decisive medium . " the surveillance technique has sparked intense debate in germany , where mistrust of state intrusion into private lives is still high due to germany 's nazi and communist past . key to future terrorism strategy the hearing in front of the court is looking into the legality of such methods in the federal state of north rhine-westphalia , where domestic intelligence officials began using it 10 months ago .
several lawyers , a journalist and a former state interior minister have submitted official protests about the practice . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spyware allows authorities unlimited access to remote computers the karlsruhe case could prove key in deciding if chancellor angela merkel 's coalition government can give authorities the right in the future to engage in internet spying .

the social democrats have said they will wait for the court 's decision , which will only be known in several months . privacy advocates have generally come out against the method , including peter schaar , germany 's independent privacy commissioner .
he called the technique " a further alarming step towards ever more sweeping surveillance , " adding that it would not only give authorities access to documents , e-mails and photos , but would allow them to follow every keystroke and activate devices such as cameras and microphones attached to computers . court doubts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates of online-spying say they internet has become an important terror tool the court 's judges , presided over by hans-jürgen papier , indicated in opening remarks that they have serious concerns about cyberspying , since it called into question the balance of freedom and security . they expressed doubts that secret access to computers was necessary to fight terrorism . but the president of the office for the protection of the constitution , heinz fromm , said security services needed this tool because the internet had become a virtual training camp for real terrorism . judges are expected to make a decision by next year . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de takes a look at who and what are behind one of the most prestigious awards in the world . who was alfred nobel ? alfred nobel was born in stockholm in 1833 .
together with his father , who was an engineer , he developed the explosive nitroglycerine , which proved a commercial success . despite the danger of the project - nobel 's brother emil was killed in an experiment in 1864 - he continued his research , patenting what he called dynamite in 1867 .
the invention proved very useful in the construction industry and nobel traveled the world selling his product .
when not on the road , he diligently conducted research and registered 355 patents in his name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel was active as a chemist and physicist and pursued literature in his free time nobel 's talent as both a scientist and a businessman allowed him to amass a considerable fortune .
he was also fluent in several languages , wrote poetry and drama , and had a deep interest in philosophy and literature . how did the nobel prize come about ? after his death in 1896 , the opening of nobel 's will caused a considerable stir : he had left the majority of his money to the establishment of " prizes to those who , during the preceding year , shall have conferred the greatest benefit to mankind " in physics , chemistry , medicine , literature and peace . family members contested the will .
others were irked at the international nature of the new prizes .
the biggest shock , however , was the peace prize .
the name nobel had been associated with explosives and weapons - not with peace . nobel 's friend and former secretary countess bertha von suttner , a vocal pacifist , is credited with having had a significant impact on the millionaire , and was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1905 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel thought hard about the ramifications of his inventions for humanity " perhaps my factories will put an end to war sooner than your congresses , " he wrote the countess in 1891 .
two-and-a-half decades before world war one , nobel could n't have foreseen just how wrong he would be . because nobel had not composed his will with the help of a lawyer nor specified how the prizes should be awarded , it took five years to sort out the details before the first nobel prize could be awarded in 1901 . in 1968 , sweden 's central bank established the sveriges riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of alfred nobel .
the five original prizes are administered by the nobel foundation in stockholm . how are the winners selected ? candidates are nominated a year in advance by qualified parties in the six relevant fields .
academics , politicians , prominent scientists , previous nobel laureates and others receive personal invitations each year to nominate a candidate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertha von suttner worked for nobel for only a few months the nominators are selected in such a way so that as many different countries as possible are represented over time .
their nominations are kept secret for 50 years . in his will , alfred nobel specifically indicated five swedish institutions responsible for choosing the prize recipients in each category . the royal swedish academy of sciences has selected the economics prize laureates since 1969 . interesting facts : * 772 individuals and 19 organizations have been awarded the nobel prize , some more than once .
thirty-four women are among the prize winners . * the youngest nobel laureate , lawrence bragg , was just 25 when he accepted the prize .
he shared the 1915 nobel prize in physics with his father . * raymond david jr . , nearly 88 when he was awarded the nobel prize in physics in 2002 , was the oldest nobel laureate . * several would-be nobel recipients either declined to accept their award or were forced to decline for political reasons . jean-paul sartre , who consistently turned down all public honors , did n't accept his 1964 nobel prize in literature .
in 1973 , le duc tho was awarded the nobel peace prize jointly with us secretary of state henry kissinger for negotiating the vietnam peace accord .
tho declined the prize due to the situation in vietnam . three german nobel laureates - richard kuhn , adolf butenandt and gerhard domagk - were forbidden by adolf hitler to accept their prizes .
they received their diplomas and medals belatedly , but not the monetary award .

dw-world.de takes a look at who and what are behind one of the most prestigious awards in the world . who was alfred nobel ? alfred nobel was born in stockholm in 1833 .
together with his father , who was an engineer , he developed the explosive nitroglycerine , which proved a commercial success . despite the danger of the project - nobel 's brother emil was killed in an experiment in 1864 - he continued his research , patenting what he called dynamite in 1867 .
the invention proved very useful in the construction industry and nobel traveled the world selling his product .
when not on the road , he diligently conducted research and registered 355 patents in his name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel was active as a chemist and physicist and pursued literature in his free time nobel 's talent as both a scientist and a businessman allowed him to amass a considerable fortune .
he was also fluent in several languages , wrote poetry and drama , and had a deep interest in philosophy and literature . how did the nobel prize come about ? after his death in 1896 , the opening of nobel 's will caused a considerable stir : he had left the majority of his money to the establishment of " prizes to those who , during the preceding year , shall have conferred the greatest benefit to mankind " in physics , chemistry , medicine , literature and peace . family members contested the will .
others were irked at the international nature of the new prizes .
the biggest shock , however , was the peace prize .
the name nobel had been associated with explosives and weapons - not with peace . nobel 's friend and former secretary countess bertha von suttner , a vocal pacifist , is credited with having had a significant impact on the millionaire , and was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1905 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel thought hard about the ramifications of his inventions for humanity " perhaps my factories will put an end to war sooner than your congresses , " he wrote the countess in 1891 .
two-and-a-half decades before world war one , nobel could n't have foreseen just how wrong he would be . because nobel had not composed his will with the help of a lawyer nor specified how the prizes should be awarded , it took five years to sort out the details before the first nobel prize could be awarded in 1901 . in 1968 , sweden 's central bank established the sveriges riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of alfred nobel .
the five original prizes are administered by the nobel foundation in stockholm . how are the winners selected ? candidates are nominated a year in advance by qualified parties in the six relevant fields .
academics , politicians , prominent scientists , previous nobel laureates and others receive personal invitations each year to nominate a candidate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertha von suttner worked for nobel for only a few months the nominators are selected in such a way so that as many different countries as possible are represented over time .
their nominations are kept secret for 50 years . in his will , alfred nobel specifically indicated five swedish institutions responsible for choosing the prize recipients in each category . the royal swedish academy of sciences has selected the economics prize laureates since 1969 . interesting facts : * 772 individuals and 19 organizations have been awarded the nobel prize , some more than once .
thirty-four women are among the prize winners . * the youngest nobel laureate , lawrence bragg , was just 25 when he accepted the prize .
he shared the 1915 nobel prize in physics with his father . * raymond david jr . , nearly 88 when he was awarded the nobel prize in physics in 2002 , was the oldest nobel laureate . * several would-be nobel recipients either declined to accept their award or were forced to decline for political reasons . jean-paul sartre , who consistently turned down all public honors , did n't accept his 1964 nobel prize in literature .
in 1973 , le duc tho was awarded the nobel peace prize jointly with us secretary of state henry kissinger for negotiating the vietnam peace accord .
tho declined the prize due to the situation in vietnam . three german nobel laureates - richard kuhn , adolf butenandt and gerhard domagk - were forbidden by adolf hitler to accept their prizes .
they received their diplomas and medals belatedly , but not the monetary award .
in 1958 , soviet authorities forced boris pasternak to return the nobel prize in literature he had initially accepted . * four individuals have been awarded two nobel prizes : john bardeen -lrb- physics 1956 , 1972 -rrb- marie curie -lrb- physics 1903 , chemistry 1911 -rrb- linus pauling -lrb- chemistry 1954 , peace 1962 -rrb- frederick sanger -lrb- chemistry 1958 , 1980 -rrb- * the nobel peace prize has been awarded three times to the international committee of the red cross -lrb- 1917 , 1944 , 1963 -rrb- and twice to the un refugee agency -lrb- 1954 , 1981 -rrb- . * together , the curies have collected more nobel prizes than any other family .

10 , russian president vladimir putin said he is dismayed by estonia and latvia 's glorification of nazism .
europe needs to take notice , putin said . putin , speaking in moscow to the european jewish congress , said he was shocked when an annual waffen ss parade took place in latvia in march .
he added that it was disturbing that the european union has largely ignored the problems of pro-nazi groups in these countries .
" some facts which we come up against in several countries of eastern europe have provoked open astonishment and incomprehension , " putin said .
" the activities of the latvian and estonian authorities openly connive at the glorification of nazis and their accomplices .
but these facts remain unnoticed by the european union . "
in 2006 , latvian officials banned an annual parade that glorifies the latvian waffen ss against russia 's red army .
some far right supporters marched anyway .
legacy of mistrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a controversial war memorial putin 's remarks are the latest volley in a political war of words between the baltic countries and russia .
latvia , lithuania and estonia joined the european union in 2004 , in part to seek protection from their domineering former rulers in moscow .
soviet forces annexed the baltic countries during world war ii .
the war split the population between those who fought for nazi germany and those who supported russia .
in russia 's view , it liberated the countries from nazi occupation in a victory that cost it 20 million lives .
germany 's defeat is seen as an important historical event and it rejects the accusation that it occupied eastern european countries .
but many people from the baltic states see the red army 's arrival as the beginning of five decades of soviet rule .
during that time , thousands of estonians were deported to soviet prison camps and russians settled in the country .
strained relations continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paying respects animosity flared up again earlier this year when estonian authorities moved a bronze statue of a red army soldier from a downtown tallinn square and moved it to a military cemetery .
rioting caused by the decision to relocate the war memorial left one person dead and a dozen injured .
further protests by pro-kremlin youths at the estonian consulate in moscow lead to scuffles with bodyguards .
in june , estonia buried the remains of eight soviet soldiers who had been exhumed from the tallinn war memorial .
the soldiers were reburied in the estonian defense forces ' cemetery , the same place where the statue was relocated .
a month before the reburial , estonia came under massive cyber attacks , crippling government and corporate web sites for nearly three weeks .
the estonian government suggested that russia could have been behind the attacks and asked for help from nato , which agreed to investigate the incident .
russia has denied any involvement in the cyber attacks .
germany has participated in some behind-the-scenes negotiating on various issues between russia and the baltic countries , but the eu has largely refrained from inserting itself in the disputes .
russia wants an apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltics have a large population of russian minorities the situation in estonia remains volatile . russia 's eu ambassador has said that estonia still owes russia an apology for moving the monument .
without an apology for moving the monument , protests could continue , he said .
putin brought up the war memorial issue wednesday .
" we are seeing a position on the limit of hypocrisy by certain european structures over the moving of the liberation soldier monument in tallinn , " putin said .
putin noted that since estonia 's independence in 1991 , " not a single nazi criminal has been condemned . "
putin admitted there were acts of anti-semitism in russia as well as " chauvinistic , xenophobic and nationalistic demonstrations . "
moshe kantor , head of the european jewish congress , asked putin to recognize the international holocaust day , which was introduced by the united nations in november 2005 .

the decision , however , comes at a time of tension with croatia in a row with italy and slovenia over fishing rights in the adriatic sea which some observers say could muddy the diplomatic waters for zagreb .
the dispute over croatia 's imposition of a fisheries protection zone and another disagreement over tracing the maritime border between slovenia and croatia could hit the membership process at any stage .
european sources said that there is a particular risk of a hiccup in the membership talks when the chapter on security and defense comes up for consideration .
despite row , croatia confident of membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn the european commission urged croatia not to activate the fisheries protection zone unilaterally , recognizing that the decision could have a negative impact on negotiations , said a spokesman for eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn .
despite the row , the croatian government is confident of becoming the eu 's 28th member state and hopes to do so in 2009 .
its progress compares very favorably with fellow eu candidate nation turkey , which began talks at the same time but has so far opened only four policy chapters due to its refusal to trade openly with eu member cyprus . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

four years later , his equally potent film about cambodian prostitutes , which is overshadowed by the khmer rouge 's legacy , made it into the competition of the 5th festival , which came to an end on wednesday . " paper can not wrap up embers " tells the story of seven young women forced to sell their bodies in phnom penh so they can help support their impoverished families in the country .
" the dead are quiet and the living suffer , " says one of the women , whose life rithy pahn follows .
the depiction of women who are exploited as sex slaves in contemporary cambodian society , which still bears the scars of the khmer rouge 's regime is very intimate and moving .
panh has said his film is " as close as one can get to the life - and thus spiritual death - of a prostitute " .
the un estimates there are 30,000 prostitutes in cambodia .
there are also countless numbers of cambodian prostitutes in thailand and malaysia .
pahn portrays their daily existences and listens to their views .
he is not interested in the sleazy underworld of the red light district but depicts the ordinary aspects of the women 's lives .
the viewers get to know the women as they cook , eat , argue , do the accounts , shoot up , cry and they listen to them talk .
they talk about the customers : " they get laid and hit us like animals , " says one .
" we get exploited and crushed like garlic , " explains another .
sold into sex slavery they talk about how they got into prostitution .
some were sold into slavery by their parents , others were abandoned as children , others made their way to the capital to find work .
one woman says she is too old and can only get " tricks " from rickshaw drivers - she explains her husband does n't help her and she needs to work so he can eat his rice .
her two-year-old son was stolen from her .
it turns out she 's only 34 and has been working as a prostitute for nine years .
another was raped by her father ...
the individual reasons are numerous , but collectively it is clear that the khmer rouge also has a large part of responsibility .
the bitter memories of its brutal reign are omnipresent .
many of the women grew up in un refugee camps and did not have access to education .
lack of qualifications drove them to prostitution .
one mother tells her daughter who complains about having to work as a sex slave for a kilo of rice that she has it easy : " under the khmer rouge it was much worse , there was no food and executions ; we had to share watered-down soup . "
at least you can eat is the implication .
driven to despair and although the survival skills honed under the khmer rouge continue to be used in the contemporary era , many of the young women are almost driven to despair - suicide and death are a recurring theme .
the women talk about the violence of their customers - they all know stories of women who have literally been battered to death .
" if we die , nobody cares , " one says matter-of-factly .
aids is also a common cause of death among the prostitutes who discuss the disease 's origin - monkeys and un peacekeepers are but two possibilities ...
a woman says the " bastard white men " who have sex without condoms are not afraid to die .
her friend answers indifferently : " if you have aids you die , if you do n't you die too . "
this is an indication that , emotionally , she already feels dead and this feeling is shared by many others : " lying down on a bed is like lying on the butcher 's block , " one states .
another : " when a client has sex with me , he has sex with a dead girl . "
rithy pahn thus continues his exploration of death and brutality in cambodian society , depicting the lives of women who , despite all their bitterness and anger , at times laugh and sing , finding refuge in painting or poetry and doing their best to get through their suffering so long as they are still alive . anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 myanmar myanmar 's junta chief than shwe has begun a visit to china .

it is common knowledge that the manmohan singh government has been rapped on its knuckles by the bhartiya janta party-led opposition , the so-called third front , as well as by its allies from the left because of the nuclear deal issue .

while there has been a palpable rapprochement between the indian government and the left parties and the fast – soaring political temperature has been brought down by both sides in the past couple of days , a question mark continues to hang over the future of indo-us nuclear deal .
energy-starved india so a similar deal with russia , india ’ s long-standing tried and tested friend , could do the trick for energy-starved india .
what ’ s more , this deal could be operational much quicker than the 123 agreement with the us , as the russian government has total control over its legislature , unlike the powerful us congress , which ca n't be bypassed by the us president .
sometime in december , the indian prime minister manmohan singh is expected to visit russia for an annual summit meeting , though the dates of his moscow visit are yet to be decided .
a key area for discussion will be civilian nuclear energy co-operation .
moscow has conveyed its keenness to develop civilian nuclear energy co-operation with india along the lines of the indo-us nuclear deal .
russia is understood to have asked india to work on a rough draft for such a nuclear deal .
moscow wants prime minister manmohan singh to have atomic energy commission chief anil kakodkar in his official entourage during the russia trip so that a meaningful discussion on the matter can be held .
123 on the back burner from the indications available , manmohan singh ’ s russia visit is likely to be historic - and a clever political tactic .
the left parties , which are bitterly opposed to indo-us nuclear deal , will not object to a similar deal between india and russia .
indications are that the indian government could be willing to put the 123 agreement on back burner and not take its show-down with the left over the issue to the hilt .
the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- chief mohammad elbaradei , concluded his three-day visit to india on thursday , after meeting prime minister manmohan singh , external affairs minister pranab mukherjee and foreign secretary shivshankar menon .
elbaradei later made it clear that there was no deadline for india to sign an india-specific safeguards agreement with the iaea .
he also added , helpfully to the manmohan singh government , that no formal discussions on the indo-us nuclear deal had taken place between him and the indian officials .
however , to put the 123 agreement on course , the negotiations on the draft text of the safeguards agreement would have to be underway by next week .
the nuclear suppliers group -lrb- nsg -rrb- clearance is not a time-consuming process and could be completed in a matter of a few days .
the time frame is urgent as the us needs to know as soon as possible when to call an emergency meeting of the nuclear suppliers group , which they would prefer to hold sometime in november .
but at this point in time , the 123 agreement does not seem likely to be clinched so fast . r. sharma send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 afghanistan the results of the polls are finally out , but there is doubt as to their ' success ' .

four years later , his equally potent film about cambodian prostitutes , which is overshadowed by the khmer rouge 's legacy , made it into the competition of the 5th festival , which came to an end on wednesday . " paper can not wrap up embers " tells the story of seven young women forced to sell their bodies in phnom penh so they can help support their impoverished families in the country .
" the dead are quiet and the living suffer , " says one of the women , whose life rithy pahn follows .
the depiction of women who are exploited as sex slaves in contemporary cambodian society , which still bears the scars of the khmer rouge 's regime is very intimate and moving .
panh has said his film is " as close as one can get to the life - and thus spiritual death - of a prostitute " .
the un estimates there are 30,000 prostitutes in cambodia .
there are also countless numbers of cambodian prostitutes in thailand and malaysia .
pahn portrays their daily existences and listens to their views .
he is not interested in the sleazy underworld of the red light district but depicts the ordinary aspects of the women 's lives .
the viewers get to know the women as they cook , eat , argue , do the accounts , shoot up , cry and they listen to them talk .
they talk about the customers : " they get laid and hit us like animals , " says one .
" we get exploited and crushed like garlic , " explains another .
sold into sex slavery they talk about how they got into prostitution .
some were sold into slavery by their parents , others were abandoned as children , others made their way to the capital to find work .
one woman says she is too old and can only get " tricks " from rickshaw drivers - she explains her husband does n't help her and she needs to work so he can eat his rice .
her two-year-old son was stolen from her .
it turns out she 's only 34 and has been working as a prostitute for nine years .
another was raped by her father ...
the individual reasons are numerous , but collectively it is clear that the khmer rouge also has a large part of responsibility .
the bitter memories of its brutal reign are omnipresent .
many of the women grew up in un refugee camps and did not have access to education .
lack of qualifications drove them to prostitution .
one mother tells her daughter who complains about having to work as a sex slave for a kilo of rice that she has it easy : " under the khmer rouge it was much worse , there was no food and executions ; we had to share watered-down soup . "
at least you can eat is the implication .
driven to despair and although the survival skills honed under the khmer rouge continue to be used in the contemporary era , many of the young women are almost driven to despair - suicide and death are a recurring theme .
the women talk about the violence of their customers - they all know stories of women who have literally been battered to death .
" if we die , nobody cares , " one says matter-of-factly .
aids is also a common cause of death among the prostitutes who discuss the disease 's origin - monkeys and un peacekeepers are but two possibilities ...
a woman says the " bastard white men " who have sex without condoms are not afraid to die .
her friend answers indifferently : " if you have aids you die , if you do n't you die too . "
this is an indication that , emotionally , she already feels dead and this feeling is shared by many others : " lying down on a bed is like lying on the butcher 's block , " one states .
another : " when a client has sex with me , he has sex with a dead girl . "
rithy pahn thus continues his exploration of death and brutality in cambodian society , depicting the lives of women who , despite all their bitterness and anger , at times laugh and sing , finding refuge in painting or poetry and doing their best to get through their suffering so long as they are still alive . anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9797 kashmir earthquake five years ago , an earthquake struck pakistan-administered kashmir , killing some 80,000 people .

the depiction of women who are exploited as sex slaves in contemporary cambodian society , which still bears the scars of the khmer rouge 's regime is very intimate and moving .
panh has said his film is " as close as one can get to the life - and thus spiritual death - of a prostitute " .
the un estimates there are 30,000 prostitutes in cambodia .
there are also countless numbers of cambodian prostitutes in thailand and malaysia .
pahn portrays their daily existences and listens to their views .
he is not interested in the sleazy underworld of the red light district but depicts the ordinary aspects of the women 's lives .
the viewers get to know the women as they cook , eat , argue , do the accounts , shoot up , cry and they listen to them talk .
they talk about the customers : " they get laid and hit us like animals , " says one .
" we get exploited and crushed like garlic , " explains another .
sold into sex slavery they talk about how they got into prostitution .
some were sold into slavery by their parents , others were abandoned as children , others made their way to the capital to find work .
one woman says she is too old and can only get " tricks " from rickshaw drivers - she explains her husband does n't help her and she needs to work so he can eat his rice .
her two-year-old son was stolen from her .
it turns out she 's only 34 and has been working as a prostitute for nine years .
another was raped by her father ...
the individual reasons are numerous , but collectively it is clear that the khmer rouge also has a large part of responsibility .
the bitter memories of its brutal reign are omnipresent .
many of the women grew up in un refugee camps and did not have access to education .
lack of qualifications drove them to prostitution .
one mother tells her daughter who complains about having to work as a sex slave for a kilo of rice that she has it easy : " under the khmer rouge it was much worse , there was no food and executions ; we had to share watered-down soup . "
at least you can eat is the implication .
driven to despair and although the survival skills honed under the khmer rouge continue to be used in the contemporary era , many of the young women are almost driven to despair - suicide and death are a recurring theme .
the women talk about the violence of their customers - they all know stories of women who have literally been battered to death .
" if we die , nobody cares , " one says matter-of-factly .
aids is also a common cause of death among the prostitutes who discuss the disease 's origin - monkeys and un peacekeepers are but two possibilities ...
a woman says the " bastard white men " who have sex without condoms are not afraid to die .
her friend answers indifferently : " if you have aids you die , if you do n't you die too . "
this is an indication that , emotionally , she already feels dead and this feeling is shared by many others : " lying down on a bed is like lying on the butcher 's block , " one states .
another : " when a client has sex with me , he has sex with a dead girl . "
rithy pahn thus continues his exploration of death and brutality in cambodian society , depicting the lives of women who , despite all their bitterness and anger , at times laugh and sing , finding refuge in painting or poetry and doing their best to get through their suffering so long as they are still alive . anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 afghan parliament afghan president hamid karzai yields to the pressure and agrees to inaugurate the new parliament .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 11.10.2007 india-russia nuclear deal on the cards großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president putin and indian prime minister singh are due to meet in russia in december as the indo-us civilian nuclear energy deal , better known as the 123 agreement , faces the risk of being put in cold storage by the indian government , new delhi may find another way of meeting its growing energy needs by striking a similar deal with russia . an indo-russian nuclear deal , along the lines of the indo-us 123 agreement , would be a politically-correct move and have the potential of emerging as the mother of all political strokes by the indian government .
it is common knowledge that the manmohan singh government has been rapped on its knuckles by the bhartiya janta party-led opposition , the so-called third front , as well as by its allies from the left because of the nuclear deal issue .
while there has been a palpable rapprochement between the indian government and the left parties and the fast – soaring political temperature has been brought down by both sides in the past couple of days , a question mark continues to hang over the future of indo-us nuclear deal .
energy-starved india so a similar deal with russia , india ’ s long-standing tried and tested friend , could do the trick for energy-starved india .
what ’ s more , this deal could be operational much quicker than the 123 agreement with the us , as the russian government has total control over its legislature , unlike the powerful us congress , which ca n't be bypassed by the us president .
sometime in december , the indian prime minister manmohan singh is expected to visit russia for an annual summit meeting , though the dates of his moscow visit are yet to be decided .
a key area for discussion will be civilian nuclear energy co-operation .
moscow has conveyed its keenness to develop civilian nuclear energy co-operation with india along the lines of the indo-us nuclear deal .
russia is understood to have asked india to work on a rough draft for such a nuclear deal .
moscow wants prime minister manmohan singh to have atomic energy commission chief anil kakodkar in his official entourage during the russia trip so that a meaningful discussion on the matter can be held .
123 on the back burner from the indications available , manmohan singh ’ s russia visit is likely to be historic - and a clever political tactic .
the left parties , which are bitterly opposed to indo-us nuclear deal , will not object to a similar deal between india and russia .
indications are that the indian government could be willing to put the 123 agreement on back burner and not take its show-down with the left over the issue to the hilt .
the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- chief mohammad elbaradei , concluded his three-day visit to india on thursday , after meeting prime minister manmohan singh , external affairs minister pranab mukherjee and foreign secretary shivshankar menon .
elbaradei later made it clear that there was no deadline for india to sign an india-specific safeguards agreement with the iaea .
he also added , helpfully to the manmohan singh government , that no formal discussions on the indo-us nuclear deal had taken place between him and the indian officials .
however , to put the 123 agreement on course , the negotiations on the draft text of the safeguards agreement would have to be underway by next week .
the nuclear suppliers group -lrb- nsg -rrb- clearance is not a time-consuming process and could be completed in a matter of a few days .
the time frame is urgent as the us needs to know as soon as possible when to call an emergency meeting of the nuclear suppliers group , which they would prefer to hold sometime in november .
but at this point in time , the 123 agreement does not seem likely to be clinched so fast . r. sharma send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9800 april asia quiz quiz of the month religion human rights watch says vietnam persecutes indigenous christian montagnards in the highlands .

10 , not to license huge 60-ton trailer trucks on german roads , saying the trucks posed a danger to automobile traffic on the country 's autobahns . a majority of the ministers from germany 's 16 states , meeting along with federal transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , had taken the decision on the basis of a study prepared by a working group . tiefensee said he was pleased the german ministers came to clear a decision before the european union begins debate on issue next year . the decision refers to 25-meter -lrb- 82-foot -rrb- trucks capable of hauling up to 60 tons of goods and was taken after a trial of the vehicles , comprising three standard 6-meter containers , on some stretches of germany 's highways . potential traffic hazards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german automobile club said gigaliners posed a danger to cars the study , which neither approved nor rejected the use of " gigaliners , " found that traffic would not increase due to the extended-trailers but said the added weight could pose a potential problem over bridges and in tunnels , according to a report in the daily süddeutsche zeitung . in general , trailer trucks on european roads may be no heavier than 40 tons and no longer than 18.75 meters , though longer vehicles are allowed to transport wood in sweden and finland . the use in germany of extra-long trucks that exceed established authorized weights is not possible however " because of the elevated risk to transport security , " the ministers said .
about 75 percent of germans said they were against allowing the extended trailers , according to a survey published by the forsa research institute . proponents of the huge trucks say they would cut freight costs and fuel consumption by 15 percent .
they deny the trucks would have a negative impact on roads , as the weight carried by each axle would not rise .
" this eliminates efficiency increases necessary in commercial transport without presenting other sustainable solutions , " said kay-dirk lindemann a traffic expert for the federation of german industries . european transit country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are over 700,000 trailer trucks registed for use on german highways the adac , germany 's largest automobile club , however , welcomed the ministers ' decision .
" this is a huge success for traffic safety and road infrastructure , " ulrich klaus becker , the association 's vice president , said in a statement .
" the risks for car traffic would have been immense . " the ministers recommended concluding the current gigaliner trial operations underway in three german states but said there was no reason to begin a closer examination of the trucks ' feasibility in germany . a transit country for many of the goods shipped throughout europe , germany 's autobahns are free for cars .

10 , russian president vladimir putin said he is dismayed by estonia and latvia 's glorification of nazism .
europe needs to take notice , putin said . putin , speaking in moscow to the european jewish congress , said he was shocked when an annual waffen ss parade took place in latvia in march .
he added that it was disturbing that the european union has largely ignored the problems of pro-nazi groups in these countries .
" some facts which we come up against in several countries of eastern europe have provoked open astonishment and incomprehension , " putin said .
" the activities of the latvian and estonian authorities openly connive at the glorification of nazis and their accomplices .
but these facts remain unnoticed by the european union . "
in 2006 , latvian officials banned an annual parade that glorifies the latvian waffen ss against russia 's red army .
some far right supporters marched anyway .
legacy of mistrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a controversial war memorial putin 's remarks are the latest volley in a political war of words between the baltic countries and russia .
latvia , lithuania and estonia joined the european union in 2004 , in part to seek protection from their domineering former rulers in moscow .
soviet forces annexed the baltic countries during world war ii .
the war split the population between those who fought for nazi germany and those who supported russia .
in russia 's view , it liberated the countries from nazi occupation in a victory that cost it 20 million lives .
germany 's defeat is seen as an important historical event and it rejects the accusation that it occupied eastern european countries .
but many people from the baltic states see the red army 's arrival as the beginning of five decades of soviet rule .
during that time , thousands of estonians were deported to soviet prison camps and russians settled in the country .
strained relations continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paying respects animosity flared up again earlier this year when estonian authorities moved a bronze statue of a red army soldier from a downtown tallinn square and moved it to a military cemetery .
rioting caused by the decision to relocate the war memorial left one person dead and a dozen injured .
further protests by pro-kremlin youths at the estonian consulate in moscow lead to scuffles with bodyguards .
in june , estonia buried the remains of eight soviet soldiers who had been exhumed from the tallinn war memorial .
the soldiers were reburied in the estonian defense forces ' cemetery , the same place where the statue was relocated .
a month before the reburial , estonia came under massive cyber attacks , crippling government and corporate web sites for nearly three weeks .
the estonian government suggested that russia could have been behind the attacks and asked for help from nato , which agreed to investigate the incident .
russia has denied any involvement in the cyber attacks .
germany has participated in some behind-the-scenes negotiating on various issues between russia and the baltic countries , but the eu has largely refrained from inserting itself in the disputes .
russia wants an apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltics have a large population of russian minorities the situation in estonia remains volatile . russia 's eu ambassador has said that estonia still owes russia an apology for moving the monument .
without an apology for moving the monument , protests could continue , he said .
putin brought up the war memorial issue wednesday .
" we are seeing a position on the limit of hypocrisy by certain european structures over the moving of the liberation soldier monument in tallinn , " putin said .
putin noted that since estonia 's independence in 1991 , " not a single nazi criminal has been condemned . "
putin admitted there were acts of anti-semitism in russia as well as " chauvinistic , xenophobic and nationalistic demonstrations . "

strained relations continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paying respects animosity flared up again earlier this year when estonian authorities moved a bronze statue of a red army soldier from a downtown tallinn square and moved it to a military cemetery .
rioting caused by the decision to relocate the war memorial left one person dead and a dozen injured .
further protests by pro-kremlin youths at the estonian consulate in moscow lead to scuffles with bodyguards .
in june , estonia buried the remains of eight soviet soldiers who had been exhumed from the tallinn war memorial .
the soldiers were reburied in the estonian defense forces ' cemetery , the same place where the statue was relocated .
a month before the reburial , estonia came under massive cyber attacks , crippling government and corporate web sites for nearly three weeks .
the estonian government suggested that russia could have been behind the attacks and asked for help from nato , which agreed to investigate the incident .
russia has denied any involvement in the cyber attacks .
germany has participated in some behind-the-scenes negotiating on various issues between russia and the baltic countries , but the eu has largely refrained from inserting itself in the disputes .
russia wants an apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltics have a large population of russian minorities the situation in estonia remains volatile . russia 's eu ambassador has said that estonia still owes russia an apology for moving the monument .
without an apology for moving the monument , protests could continue , he said .
putin brought up the war memorial issue wednesday .
" we are seeing a position on the limit of hypocrisy by certain european structures over the moving of the liberation soldier monument in tallinn , " putin said .
putin noted that since estonia 's independence in 1991 , " not a single nazi criminal has been condemned . "
putin admitted there were acts of anti-semitism in russia as well as " chauvinistic , xenophobic and nationalistic demonstrations . "
moshe kantor , head of the european jewish congress , asked putin to recognize the international holocaust day , which was introduced by the united nations in november 2005 .
russia seemed to support the declaration but has not implemented it , kantor said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

both darabi and rhayel could now be released as early as december , federal prosecutor frank wallenta said .
under german law , life sentences are reviewed by authorities after 15 years to decide whether the guilty party can be released .
the five years darabi spent in jail before he was convicted counted towards his life sentence .
when darabi was arrested for the murders , the investigation and subsequent trial sparked a diplomatic crisis between berlin and tehran with german authorities accusing the highest levels of the iranian government of responsibility for the attacks .
at the time , darabi was called an iranian secret agent .
at his sentencing in 1997 , the berlin court which tried darabi said that because of the severity of his crime , he should be held in custody beyond the usual 15 years .
thursday ’ s ruling by the federal prosecutor 's office marks a surprise reversal of that ruling .
the decision to release darabi has been criticized by the israeli government which had appealed to germany not to release the iranian .
israel opposes darabi release bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel refused olmert 's plea to keep darabi behind bars according to thursday 's ha 'aretz newspaper , israeli prime minister ehud olmert made a personal plea to german chancellor angela merkel in an attempt to convince berlin not to release darabi .
the newspaper reported that merkel rebuffed his appeal , telling him that the authorities would follow the letter of the law .
the ha 'aretz report also claimed that israel wanted to use darabi as part of a deal brokered between israel and hezbollah in 2004 in which 400 palestinian prisoners were released in exchange for the bodies of three israeli soldiers killed in 2000 and elhanan tannenbaum , an israeli businessman .
another aspect of the deal was that darabi would be released if hezbollah offered information on the captured israeli air force navigator ron arad , but the deal fell through , the report said .

the iranian government allegedly spoke with representatives of the german government over a deal involving jailed german fisherman donald klein who was released from prison in tehran earlier this year .

publishers are taking different approaches to google book search , with german publishers launching libreka . german publishers launched libreka , an internet book search machine of their own wednesday , oct .
10 .
they hope libreka will rival google book search while allowing them to keep control .
rüdiger salat , a board executive at holtzbrinck , the top german-based book publisher , said google might someday become a partner to publishers .
but for now it was still " more an enemy . "
google has undertaken a massive project to scan and index book content .
google scans the complete text so that users can find books which contain a specific word or phrase .
under a policy known as " opt out , " google , which is funded by online advertising , says it deletes any books from its search engine if copyright owners request it .
" opt out is not the right way , " said salat , whose group has been a key backer of libreka , the german publishers ' search engine .
a preview was launched at the frankfurt book fair wednesday .
the libreka database contains 8,000 german-language books whose publishers have explicitly " opted in " to the idea .
us publishing executive sees opportunities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has gotten into the book business while us publishers also have qualms about google 's plans to index books , one executive said that the ruckus might soon come to an end .
us publishers and authors began legal action two years ago against google .
peter olson , new york-based chief executive of the world 's biggest book publishing group , random house , said , " i think we are close to resolving our issues .
we have so much in common . "
olson , speaking in a discussion between top industry executives on the first day of the fair , said he wants to see google and publishers charge internet users small fees to see single pages of books online .
olson envisions a set-up similar to popular music downloading services such as itunes , which allow songs to be purchased individually instead of having to buy an entire album .
olson envisions a " pay-per-page " model where a reader could buy single page or chapter .
instead of buying the entire cookbook , a reader could pay for a single carrot cake recipe or get the entire desserts chapter .
giving a share to the book industry would mollify publishers , olson said .

the project was started in 2005 and has been engineered by a delhi , india software house , mps , in which holtzbrinck is a shareholder .
libreka is an offshoot of germany 's books-in-print database .
its target audience seems to be german bookstores , who could put it on their websites to help shoppers find books they want to buy .
ronald schild , head of the libreka project , said publishers could decide if part or even all of a book should be freely downloadable .

some commentators have called it the " anti-google , " since it tries to keep the publishing industry in control of book searching .

the group said it was in negotiations about cooperation deals with the us company .

publishers are taking different approaches to google book search , with german publishers launching libreka . german publishers launched libreka , an internet book search machine of their own wednesday , oct .
10 .
they hope libreka will rival google book search while allowing them to keep control .
rüdiger salat , a board executive at holtzbrinck , the top german-based book publisher , said google might someday become a partner to publishers .
but for now it was still " more an enemy . "
google has undertaken a massive project to scan and index book content .
google scans the complete text so that users can find books which contain a specific word or phrase .
under a policy known as " opt out , " google , which is funded by online advertising , says it deletes any books from its search engine if copyright owners request it .
" opt out is not the right way , " said salat , whose group has been a key backer of libreka , the german publishers ' search engine .
a preview was launched at the frankfurt book fair wednesday .
the libreka database contains 8,000 german-language books whose publishers have explicitly " opted in " to the idea .
us publishing executive sees opportunities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has gotten into the book business while us publishers also have qualms about google 's plans to index books , one executive said that the ruckus might soon come to an end .
us publishers and authors began legal action two years ago against google .
peter olson , new york-based chief executive of the world 's biggest book publishing group , random house , said , " i think we are close to resolving our issues .
we have so much in common . "
olson , speaking in a discussion between top industry executives on the first day of the fair , said he wants to see google and publishers charge internet users small fees to see single pages of books online .
olson envisions a set-up similar to popular music downloading services such as itunes , which allow songs to be purchased individually instead of having to buy an entire album .
olson envisions a " pay-per-page " model where a reader could buy single page or chapter .
instead of buying the entire cookbook , a reader could pay for a single carrot cake recipe or get the entire desserts chapter .
giving a share to the book industry would mollify publishers , olson said .
" i think it makes sense for both sides , " said olson .
libreka seen as the " anti-google " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oversize encyclopedias at the frankfurt book fair that 's a view german publishers do n't share , and many have signed on to the libreka project .
unregistered users of the libreka.de web site enter a search word and are shown the titles of german books which contain that word , including images of the front covers , but not the contents .
the project was started in 2005 and has been engineered by a delhi , india software house , mps , in which holtzbrinck is a shareholder .
libreka is an offshoot of germany 's books-in-print database .
its target audience seems to be german bookstores , who could put it on their websites to help shoppers find books they want to buy .
ronald schild , head of the libreka project , said publishers could decide if part or even all of a book should be freely downloadable .
the name libreka not only suggested " books " but also the latin adjective liber -lrb- free -rrb- and the greek exclamation " eureka " -lrb- i 've found it -rrb- , schild said .
some commentators have called it the " anti-google , " since it tries to keep the publishing industry in control of book searching .
at the libreka launch , the german association of publishers and booksellers denied any hostility or rivalry with google .
the group said it was in negotiations about cooperation deals with the us company .
" we should not underestimate the potential of libreka . " said jens redmer , google book search 's chief of european operations .
but he said google book search had far more books indexed .
he would n't say how many german publishers had signed up for the google plan . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a new study in germany shows that their womenfolk , however , do n't see things the same way . it is accepted in some scientific circles that orangutans , and not chimpanzees , are the closest relatives to humans among the great apes .
ask a human woman about the similarities between the ginger monkeys and their own species and they are likely to add to the burgeoning evidence that man -lrb- but not necessarily woman -rrb- is but an evolutionary side-step from an orangutan .
the list appears endless at times : body hair , personal hygiene , mating techniques … if you listen to some disgruntled females you could be misled into believing that they live in a monkey house bedecked with hanging tires rather than a swanky apartment filled with the latest modern furniture .
as if to give women even more ammunition , another similarity between german men and orangutans was discovered only last week , courtesy of a certain knuckle-dragger called sibu .
simbu 's blonde ambition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hey baby , feel like gettin ' it on ? "
sibu -lrb- an orangutan and not a german male -rrb- , had become a pain in the hairy backside by refusing to mate with any of the ape babes which swung his way for some primate lovin ' at the apenheul primate park in amsterdam , holland .
instead - and here is where the very tenuous link to german men comes in - he preferred to go monkey nuts over the blonde female humans which attended to him .
sibu 's preference for flaxen-haired female humans , preferably tattooed , fits snugly with documented evidence which says that german gentlemen prefer blondes .
german women , however , do not share sibu 's or their menfolks ' lust for the fair-haired .
well-trimmed , dark-haired men get the nod bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim jong il ticks some , but maybe not all , the boxes a new survey of attractiveness by the gfk research institute on behalf of a german health magazine reveals that when it comes to choosing a mate , german women prefer dark-haired men to blondes .
only 17.2 percent of those questioned found blond men attractive while a total of 28.9 percent favored brown-haired men , and 34.7 percent preferred men with dark hair .
now , while this does n't appear to be such a great problem for the large number of swarthy types out there , the survey showed that german ladies require a little more than just a luxurious inky thatch from their mates .
and this is where our friend sibu comes back in .
grooming high on german women 's list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " lose the beard and then we can talk " if you are a man who has more in common with sibu than his penchant for pneumatic blondes , then even your dusky crowning glory may not save you from being cast aside in the mating game .
those also sharing sibu 's grooming and hygiene habits may be forced to fight lesser apes over the monkey bars and fling feces at the cropped and manicured males who are more likely to successfully pair up with the females .
according to the gfk survey , every second woman in germany is attracted to clean-shaven men with short hair and manicured nails .
of the 1,031 women questioned , 59.6 percent found a man with manicured nails attractive , while 50.9 percent said they did not like men with stubble on their chin .
some 53.9 percent said they preferred men to have short hair , with a mere 4.7 percent saying they were attracted to males with a long , flowing mane .

the decision , however , comes at a time of tension with croatia in a row with italy and slovenia over fishing rights in the adriatic sea which some observers say could muddy the diplomatic waters for zagreb .
the dispute over croatia 's imposition of a fisheries protection zone and another disagreement over tracing the maritime border between slovenia and croatia could hit the membership process at any stage .

despite row , croatia confident of membership bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn the european commission urged croatia not to activate the fisheries protection zone unilaterally , recognizing that the decision could have a negative impact on negotiations , said a spokesman for eu enlargement commissioner olli rehn .
despite the row , the croatian government is confident of becoming the eu 's 28th member state and hopes to do so in 2009 .

the two suspected terrorists had placed two suitcases containing bombs on the trains .
had there not been errors in the bombs ' construction , german investigators said the explosions near the cities of hamm and koblenz would have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people , putting the plot on a much larger scale than the terrorist attacks on london in july 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suitcases used in the failed plot hamad denied that he followed any " muslim fundamentalist group or jihadist group . "
he also denied any links with the sunni muslim fundamentalist group al qaeda which is led by osama bin laden .
judge helena iskander decided to issue a warrant to the lebanese police to look into reports that saddam al-haj dib , brother of youssef , and also a suspect in the plot , was killed during the 15-week battle between militants from the fatah al-islam group and the lebanese army in northern lebanon .
associates questioned the judge also questioned three lebanese citizens who were arrested with hamad : khaled al-haj dib , ayman hadad and khalil al-bobo .
khaled al-haj dib said that his connection with hamad went back to university and he denied any links to the german bombing plot .
hadad said he met hamad in tripoli , and denied that he had any knowledge of the bombing plot or belonged to any islamic movement .
al-bobo also denied his links with the german bombing plot , but said he met saddam al-haj dib through a common friend called osama al-shahabi , who usually sent muslims to fight in iraq .
" at the time i was impressed with the way al-haj dib thinks - his jihadist thinking - and we exchanged telephone numbers , " al-bobo told the judge .
he was arrested and put in a lebanese jail because he threw a bomb at a lebanese army checkpoint in the north of the country .

shahid said he decided to send his son to germany for the better education and job opportunities that were available there .
jihad hamad turned up at his parents ' house in tripoli shortly after the attempted bombings .
jihad , who had been taking german language classes for six months in germany , explained his sudden appearance by saying that he was worried about his parents because of the july 2006 israeli war against lebanon 's hezbollah movement at the time .
jihad has given a partial confession to lebanese authorities , saying that he deposited a piece of luggage in one of the trains but was not aware of its contents .
he has also told investigators that he and al-haj dib researched bomb-making methods on the internet that could have increased the victims ' suffering in the planned attacks .
the german police have said that the publication of the caricatures of the prophet mohammed in german newspapers may have prompted jihad hamad and youssef al-haj dib to devise their plot .
lebanese chief public prosecutor said mirza has accused jihad hamad of organizing and attempting mass murder .
should he be convicted , he faces life-long imprisonment and forced labor .

performance-enhancing drug use in poplar and youth sports has , however , remained a little-researched field , treutlein said .
that 's why the center plans to approach young athletes about the risks doping pose .
the center also plans to educate coaches and teachers on doping and drug abuse and to create ad campaigns to help prevent doping among young athletes .

faith in doping-free international sports has most recently been shaken by china 's top female triathlete being banned from two years of completion for taking performance-enhancing drugs , us sprinter and triple olympic champion marion jones confessing to doping and returning her medals from the sydney olympics , and a tour de france that was marred by doping cases and allegations .
" young athletes have to be strengthened , " said michale hölz , head of the board of trustees for germany 's national doping agency .
" we do not need just responsible citizens , we also need responsible athletes . "

" we want to see success in the fight against doping and the clear will of all involved to act .
then an extension is theoretically possible . "
hainer said adidas could end their engagement instantly if there are new doping cases in the team .

10 , not to license huge 60-ton trailer trucks on german roads , saying the trucks posed a danger to automobile traffic on the country 's autobahns . a majority of the ministers from germany 's 16 states , meeting along with federal transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , had taken the decision on the basis of a study prepared by a working group . tiefensee said he was pleased the german ministers came to clear a decision before the european union begins debate on issue next year . the decision refers to 25-meter -lrb- 82-foot -rrb- trucks capable of hauling up to 60 tons of goods and was taken after a trial of the vehicles , comprising three standard 6-meter containers , on some stretches of germany 's highways . potential traffic hazards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german automobile club said gigaliners posed a danger to cars the study , which neither approved nor rejected the use of " gigaliners , " found that traffic would not increase due to the extended-trailers but said the added weight could pose a potential problem over bridges and in tunnels , according to a report in the daily süddeutsche zeitung . in general , trailer trucks on european roads may be no heavier than 40 tons and no longer than 18.75 meters , though longer vehicles are allowed to transport wood in sweden and finland . the use in germany of extra-long trucks that exceed established authorized weights is not possible however " because of the elevated risk to transport security , " the ministers said .
about 75 percent of germans said they were against allowing the extended trailers , according to a survey published by the forsa research institute . proponents of the huge trucks say they would cut freight costs and fuel consumption by 15 percent .
they deny the trucks would have a negative impact on roads , as the weight carried by each axle would not rise .
" this eliminates efficiency increases necessary in commercial transport without presenting other sustainable solutions , " said kay-dirk lindemann a traffic expert for the federation of german industries . european transit country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are over 700,000 trailer trucks registed for use on german highways the adac , germany 's largest automobile club , however , welcomed the ministers ' decision .

" the risks for car traffic would have been immense . " the ministers recommended concluding the current gigaliner trial operations underway in three german states but said there was no reason to begin a closer examination of the trucks ' feasibility in germany . a transit country for many of the goods shipped throughout europe , germany 's autobahns are free for cars .

10 , not to license huge 60-ton trailer trucks on german roads , saying the trucks posed a danger to automobile traffic on the country 's autobahns . a majority of the ministers from germany 's 16 states , meeting along with federal transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , had taken the decision on the basis of a study prepared by a working group . tiefensee said he was pleased the german ministers came to clear a decision before the european union begins debate on issue next year . the decision refers to 25-meter -lrb- 82-foot -rrb- trucks capable of hauling up to 60 tons of goods and was taken after a trial of the vehicles , comprising three standard 6-meter containers , on some stretches of germany 's highways . potential traffic hazards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german automobile club said gigaliners posed a danger to cars the study , which neither approved nor rejected the use of " gigaliners , " found that traffic would not increase due to the extended-trailers but said the added weight could pose a potential problem over bridges and in tunnels , according to a report in the daily süddeutsche zeitung . in general , trailer trucks on european roads may be no heavier than 40 tons and no longer than 18.75 meters , though longer vehicles are allowed to transport wood in sweden and finland . the use in germany of extra-long trucks that exceed established authorized weights is not possible however " because of the elevated risk to transport security , " the ministers said .
about 75 percent of germans said they were against allowing the extended trailers , according to a survey published by the forsa research institute . proponents of the huge trucks say they would cut freight costs and fuel consumption by 15 percent .
they deny the trucks would have a negative impact on roads , as the weight carried by each axle would not rise .
" this eliminates efficiency increases necessary in commercial transport without presenting other sustainable solutions , " said kay-dirk lindemann a traffic expert for the federation of german industries . european transit country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are over 700,000 trailer trucks registed for use on german highways the adac , germany 's largest automobile club , however , welcomed the ministers ' decision .
" this is a huge success for traffic safety and road infrastructure , " ulrich klaus becker , the association 's vice president , said in a statement .
" the risks for car traffic would have been immense . " the ministers recommended concluding the current gigaliner trial operations underway in three german states but said there was no reason to begin a closer examination of the trucks ' feasibility in germany . a transit country for many of the goods shipped throughout europe , germany 's autobahns are free for cars .
the government began charging trailer trucks a per-kilometer fee in 2005 bringing in a total of about 3.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- last year . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

four years later , his equally potent film about cambodian prostitutes , which is overshadowed by the khmer rouge 's legacy , made it into the competition of the 5th festival , which came to an end on wednesday . " paper can not wrap up embers " tells the story of seven young women forced to sell their bodies in phnom penh so they can help support their impoverished families in the country .
" the dead are quiet and the living suffer , " says one of the women , whose life rithy pahn follows .
the depiction of women who are exploited as sex slaves in contemporary cambodian society , which still bears the scars of the khmer rouge 's regime is very intimate and moving .
panh has said his film is " as close as one can get to the life - and thus spiritual death - of a prostitute " .
the un estimates there are 30,000 prostitutes in cambodia .
there are also countless numbers of cambodian prostitutes in thailand and malaysia .
pahn portrays their daily existences and listens to their views .
he is not interested in the sleazy underworld of the red light district but depicts the ordinary aspects of the women 's lives .
the viewers get to know the women as they cook , eat , argue , do the accounts , shoot up , cry and they listen to them talk .
they talk about the customers : " they get laid and hit us like animals , " says one .
" we get exploited and crushed like garlic , " explains another .
sold into sex slavery they talk about how they got into prostitution .
some were sold into slavery by their parents , others were abandoned as children , others made their way to the capital to find work .
one woman says she is too old and can only get " tricks " from rickshaw drivers - she explains her husband does n't help her and she needs to work so he can eat his rice .
her two-year-old son was stolen from her .
it turns out she 's only 34 and has been working as a prostitute for nine years .
another was raped by her father ...
the individual reasons are numerous , but collectively it is clear that the khmer rouge also has a large part of responsibility .
the bitter memories of its brutal reign are omnipresent .
many of the women grew up in un refugee camps and did not have access to education .
lack of qualifications drove them to prostitution .
one mother tells her daughter who complains about having to work as a sex slave for a kilo of rice that she has it easy : " under the khmer rouge it was much worse , there was no food and executions ; we had to share watered-down soup . "
at least you can eat is the implication .
driven to despair and although the survival skills honed under the khmer rouge continue to be used in the contemporary era , many of the young women are almost driven to despair - suicide and death are a recurring theme .
the women talk about the violence of their customers - they all know stories of women who have literally been battered to death .
" if we die , nobody cares , " one says matter-of-factly .
aids is also a common cause of death among the prostitutes who discuss the disease 's origin - monkeys and un peacekeepers are but two possibilities ...
a woman says the " bastard white men " who have sex without condoms are not afraid to die .
her friend answers indifferently : " if you have aids you die , if you do n't you die too . "
this is an indication that , emotionally , she already feels dead and this feeling is shared by many others : " lying down on a bed is like lying on the butcher 's block , " one states .
another : " when a client has sex with me , he has sex with a dead girl . "
rithy pahn thus continues his exploration of death and brutality in cambodian society , depicting the lives of women who , despite all their bitterness and anger , at times laugh and sing , finding refuge in painting or poetry and doing their best to get through their suffering so long as they are still alive . anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 07 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

it is common knowledge that the manmohan singh government has been rapped on its knuckles by the bhartiya janta party-led opposition , the so-called third front , as well as by its allies from the left because of the nuclear deal issue .

indications are that the indian government could be willing to put the 123 agreement on back burner and not take its show-down with the left over the issue to the hilt .
the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- chief mohammad elbaradei , concluded his three-day visit to india on thursday , after meeting prime minister manmohan singh , external affairs minister pranab mukherjee and foreign secretary shivshankar menon .
elbaradei later made it clear that there was no deadline for india to sign an india-specific safeguards agreement with the iaea .
he also added , helpfully to the manmohan singh government , that no formal discussions on the indo-us nuclear deal had taken place between him and the indian officials .

it is common knowledge that the manmohan singh government has been rapped on its knuckles by the bhartiya janta party-led opposition , the so-called third front , as well as by its allies from the left because of the nuclear deal issue .
while there has been a palpable rapprochement between the indian government and the left parties and the fast – soaring political temperature has been brought down by both sides in the past couple of days , a question mark continues to hang over the future of indo-us nuclear deal .
energy-starved india so a similar deal with russia , india ’ s long-standing tried and tested friend , could do the trick for energy-starved india .
what ’ s more , this deal could be operational much quicker than the 123 agreement with the us , as the russian government has total control over its legislature , unlike the powerful us congress , which ca n't be bypassed by the us president .
sometime in december , the indian prime minister manmohan singh is expected to visit russia for an annual summit meeting , though the dates of his moscow visit are yet to be decided .
a key area for discussion will be civilian nuclear energy co-operation .
moscow has conveyed its keenness to develop civilian nuclear energy co-operation with india along the lines of the indo-us nuclear deal .
russia is understood to have asked india to work on a rough draft for such a nuclear deal .
moscow wants prime minister manmohan singh to have atomic energy commission chief anil kakodkar in his official entourage during the russia trip so that a meaningful discussion on the matter can be held .
123 on the back burner from the indications available , manmohan singh ’ s russia visit is likely to be historic - and a clever political tactic .
the left parties , which are bitterly opposed to indo-us nuclear deal , will not object to a similar deal between india and russia .
indications are that the indian government could be willing to put the 123 agreement on back burner and not take its show-down with the left over the issue to the hilt .
the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- chief mohammad elbaradei , concluded his three-day visit to india on thursday , after meeting prime minister manmohan singh , external affairs minister pranab mukherjee and foreign secretary shivshankar menon .
elbaradei later made it clear that there was no deadline for india to sign an india-specific safeguards agreement with the iaea .
he also added , helpfully to the manmohan singh government , that no formal discussions on the indo-us nuclear deal had taken place between him and the indian officials .
however , to put the 123 agreement on course , the negotiations on the draft text of the safeguards agreement would have to be underway by next week .
the nuclear suppliers group -lrb- nsg -rrb- clearance is not a time-consuming process and could be completed in a matter of a few days .
the time frame is urgent as the us needs to know as soon as possible when to call an emergency meeting of the nuclear suppliers group , which they would prefer to hold sometime in november .

four years later , his equally potent film about cambodian prostitutes , which is overshadowed by the khmer rouge 's legacy , made it into the competition of the 5th festival , which came to an end on wednesday . " paper can not wrap up embers " tells the story of seven young women forced to sell their bodies in phnom penh so they can help support their impoverished families in the country .
" the dead are quiet and the living suffer , " says one of the women , whose life rithy pahn follows .
the depiction of women who are exploited as sex slaves in contemporary cambodian society , which still bears the scars of the khmer rouge 's regime is very intimate and moving .
panh has said his film is " as close as one can get to the life - and thus spiritual death - of a prostitute " .
the un estimates there are 30,000 prostitutes in cambodia .
there are also countless numbers of cambodian prostitutes in thailand and malaysia .
pahn portrays their daily existences and listens to their views .
he is not interested in the sleazy underworld of the red light district but depicts the ordinary aspects of the women 's lives .
the viewers get to know the women as they cook , eat , argue , do the accounts , shoot up , cry and they listen to them talk .
they talk about the customers : " they get laid and hit us like animals , " says one .
" we get exploited and crushed like garlic , " explains another .
sold into sex slavery they talk about how they got into prostitution .
some were sold into slavery by their parents , others were abandoned as children , others made their way to the capital to find work .
one woman says she is too old and can only get " tricks " from rickshaw drivers - she explains her husband does n't help her and she needs to work so he can eat his rice .
her two-year-old son was stolen from her .
it turns out she 's only 34 and has been working as a prostitute for nine years .
another was raped by her father ...
the individual reasons are numerous , but collectively it is clear that the khmer rouge also has a large part of responsibility .
the bitter memories of its brutal reign are omnipresent .
many of the women grew up in un refugee camps and did not have access to education .
lack of qualifications drove them to prostitution .
one mother tells her daughter who complains about having to work as a sex slave for a kilo of rice that she has it easy : " under the khmer rouge it was much worse , there was no food and executions ; we had to share watered-down soup . "
at least you can eat is the implication .
driven to despair and although the survival skills honed under the khmer rouge continue to be used in the contemporary era , many of the young women are almost driven to despair - suicide and death are a recurring theme .
the women talk about the violence of their customers - they all know stories of women who have literally been battered to death .
" if we die , nobody cares , " one says matter-of-factly .
aids is also a common cause of death among the prostitutes who discuss the disease 's origin - monkeys and un peacekeepers are but two possibilities ...
a woman says the " bastard white men " who have sex without condoms are not afraid to die .
her friend answers indifferently : " if you have aids you die , if you do n't you die too . "
this is an indication that , emotionally , she already feels dead and this feeling is shared by many others : " lying down on a bed is like lying on the butcher 's block , " one states .
another : " when a client has sex with me , he has sex with a dead girl . "
rithy pahn thus continues his exploration of death and brutality in cambodian society , depicting the lives of women who , despite all their bitterness and anger , at times laugh and sing , finding refuge in painting or poetry and doing their best to get through their suffering so long as they are still alive . anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic threatened communities preserving tribal communities and their habitats can help sustain the environment .

four years later , his equally potent film about cambodian prostitutes , which is overshadowed by the khmer rouge 's legacy , made it into the competition of the 5th festival , which came to an end on wednesday . " paper can not wrap up embers " tells the story of seven young women forced to sell their bodies in phnom penh so they can help support their impoverished families in the country .
" the dead are quiet and the living suffer , " says one of the women , whose life rithy pahn follows .
the depiction of women who are exploited as sex slaves in contemporary cambodian society , which still bears the scars of the khmer rouge 's regime is very intimate and moving .
panh has said his film is " as close as one can get to the life - and thus spiritual death - of a prostitute " .
the un estimates there are 30,000 prostitutes in cambodia .
there are also countless numbers of cambodian prostitutes in thailand and malaysia .
pahn portrays their daily existences and listens to their views .
he is not interested in the sleazy underworld of the red light district but depicts the ordinary aspects of the women 's lives .
the viewers get to know the women as they cook , eat , argue , do the accounts , shoot up , cry and they listen to them talk .
they talk about the customers : " they get laid and hit us like animals , " says one .
" we get exploited and crushed like garlic , " explains another .
sold into sex slavery they talk about how they got into prostitution .
some were sold into slavery by their parents , others were abandoned as children , others made their way to the capital to find work .
one woman says she is too old and can only get " tricks " from rickshaw drivers - she explains her husband does n't help her and she needs to work so he can eat his rice .
her two-year-old son was stolen from her .
it turns out she 's only 34 and has been working as a prostitute for nine years .
another was raped by her father ...
the individual reasons are numerous , but collectively it is clear that the khmer rouge also has a large part of responsibility .
the bitter memories of its brutal reign are omnipresent .
many of the women grew up in un refugee camps and did not have access to education .
lack of qualifications drove them to prostitution .
one mother tells her daughter who complains about having to work as a sex slave for a kilo of rice that she has it easy : " under the khmer rouge it was much worse , there was no food and executions ; we had to share watered-down soup . "
at least you can eat is the implication .
driven to despair and although the survival skills honed under the khmer rouge continue to be used in the contemporary era , many of the young women are almost driven to despair - suicide and death are a recurring theme .
the women talk about the violence of their customers - they all know stories of women who have literally been battered to death .
" if we die , nobody cares , " one says matter-of-factly .
aids is also a common cause of death among the prostitutes who discuss the disease 's origin - monkeys and un peacekeepers are but two possibilities ...
a woman says the " bastard white men " who have sex without condoms are not afraid to die .
her friend answers indifferently : " if you have aids you die , if you do n't you die too . "
this is an indication that , emotionally , she already feels dead and this feeling is shared by many others : " lying down on a bed is like lying on the butcher 's block , " one states .
another : " when a client has sex with me , he has sex with a dead girl . "
rithy pahn thus continues his exploration of death and brutality in cambodian society , depicting the lives of women who , despite all their bitterness and anger , at times laugh and sing , finding refuge in painting or poetry and doing their best to get through their suffering so long as they are still alive . anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic us japan drills us-japanese military drills have begun in the sea of japan as the region seethes with conflict .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de asia -pipe- 11.10.2007 india-russia nuclear deal on the cards großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president putin and indian prime minister singh are due to meet in russia in december as the indo-us civilian nuclear energy deal , better known as the 123 agreement , faces the risk of being put in cold storage by the indian government , new delhi may find another way of meeting its growing energy needs by striking a similar deal with russia . an indo-russian nuclear deal , along the lines of the indo-us 123 agreement , would be a politically-correct move and have the potential of emerging as the mother of all political strokes by the indian government .
it is common knowledge that the manmohan singh government has been rapped on its knuckles by the bhartiya janta party-led opposition , the so-called third front , as well as by its allies from the left because of the nuclear deal issue .
while there has been a palpable rapprochement between the indian government and the left parties and the fast – soaring political temperature has been brought down by both sides in the past couple of days , a question mark continues to hang over the future of indo-us nuclear deal .
energy-starved india so a similar deal with russia , india ’ s long-standing tried and tested friend , could do the trick for energy-starved india .
what ’ s more , this deal could be operational much quicker than the 123 agreement with the us , as the russian government has total control over its legislature , unlike the powerful us congress , which ca n't be bypassed by the us president .
sometime in december , the indian prime minister manmohan singh is expected to visit russia for an annual summit meeting , though the dates of his moscow visit are yet to be decided .
a key area for discussion will be civilian nuclear energy co-operation .
moscow has conveyed its keenness to develop civilian nuclear energy co-operation with india along the lines of the indo-us nuclear deal .
russia is understood to have asked india to work on a rough draft for such a nuclear deal .
moscow wants prime minister manmohan singh to have atomic energy commission chief anil kakodkar in his official entourage during the russia trip so that a meaningful discussion on the matter can be held .
123 on the back burner from the indications available , manmohan singh ’ s russia visit is likely to be historic - and a clever political tactic .
the left parties , which are bitterly opposed to indo-us nuclear deal , will not object to a similar deal between india and russia .
indications are that the indian government could be willing to put the 123 agreement on back burner and not take its show-down with the left over the issue to the hilt .
the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- chief mohammad elbaradei , concluded his three-day visit to india on thursday , after meeting prime minister manmohan singh , external affairs minister pranab mukherjee and foreign secretary shivshankar menon .
elbaradei later made it clear that there was no deadline for india to sign an india-specific safeguards agreement with the iaea .
he also added , helpfully to the manmohan singh government , that no formal discussions on the indo-us nuclear deal had taken place between him and the indian officials .
however , to put the 123 agreement on course , the negotiations on the draft text of the safeguards agreement would have to be underway by next week .
the nuclear suppliers group -lrb- nsg -rrb- clearance is not a time-consuming process and could be completed in a matter of a few days .
the time frame is urgent as the us needs to know as soon as possible when to call an emergency meeting of the nuclear suppliers group , which they would prefer to hold sometime in november .
but at this point in time , the 123 agreement does not seem likely to be clinched so fast . r. sharma send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

10 , russian president vladimir putin said he is dismayed by estonia and latvia 's glorification of nazism .
europe needs to take notice , putin said . putin , speaking in moscow to the european jewish congress , said he was shocked when an annual waffen ss parade took place in latvia in march .
he added that it was disturbing that the european union has largely ignored the problems of pro-nazi groups in these countries .
" some facts which we come up against in several countries of eastern europe have provoked open astonishment and incomprehension , " putin said .
" the activities of the latvian and estonian authorities openly connive at the glorification of nazis and their accomplices .
but these facts remain unnoticed by the european union . "
in 2006 , latvian officials banned an annual parade that glorifies the latvian waffen ss against russia 's red army .
some far right supporters marched anyway .
legacy of mistrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a controversial war memorial putin 's remarks are the latest volley in a political war of words between the baltic countries and russia .
latvia , lithuania and estonia joined the european union in 2004 , in part to seek protection from their domineering former rulers in moscow .
soviet forces annexed the baltic countries during world war ii .
the war split the population between those who fought for nazi germany and those who supported russia .
in russia 's view , it liberated the countries from nazi occupation in a victory that cost it 20 million lives .
germany 's defeat is seen as an important historical event and it rejects the accusation that it occupied eastern european countries .
but many people from the baltic states see the red army 's arrival as the beginning of five decades of soviet rule .
during that time , thousands of estonians were deported to soviet prison camps and russians settled in the country .
strained relations continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paying respects animosity flared up again earlier this year when estonian authorities moved a bronze statue of a red army soldier from a downtown tallinn square and moved it to a military cemetery .
rioting caused by the decision to relocate the war memorial left one person dead and a dozen injured .
further protests by pro-kremlin youths at the estonian consulate in moscow lead to scuffles with bodyguards .
in june , estonia buried the remains of eight soviet soldiers who had been exhumed from the tallinn war memorial .
the soldiers were reburied in the estonian defense forces ' cemetery , the same place where the statue was relocated .
a month before the reburial , estonia came under massive cyber attacks , crippling government and corporate web sites for nearly three weeks .
the estonian government suggested that russia could have been behind the attacks and asked for help from nato , which agreed to investigate the incident .
russia has denied any involvement in the cyber attacks .
germany has participated in some behind-the-scenes negotiating on various issues between russia and the baltic countries , but the eu has largely refrained from inserting itself in the disputes .
russia wants an apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltics have a large population of russian minorities the situation in estonia remains volatile . russia 's eu ambassador has said that estonia still owes russia an apology for moving the monument .
without an apology for moving the monument , protests could continue , he said .
putin brought up the war memorial issue wednesday .
" we are seeing a position on the limit of hypocrisy by certain european structures over the moving of the liberation soldier monument in tallinn , " putin said .
putin noted that since estonia 's independence in 1991 , " not a single nazi criminal has been condemned . "
putin admitted there were acts of anti-semitism in russia as well as " chauvinistic , xenophobic and nationalistic demonstrations . "
moshe kantor , head of the european jewish congress , asked putin to recognize the international holocaust day , which was introduced by the united nations in november 2005 .
russia seemed to support the declaration but has not implemented it , kantor said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 , not to license huge 60-ton trailer trucks on german roads , saying the trucks posed a danger to automobile traffic on the country 's autobahns . a majority of the ministers from germany 's 16 states , meeting along with federal transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , had taken the decision on the basis of a study prepared by a working group . tiefensee said he was pleased the german ministers came to clear a decision before the european union begins debate on issue next year . the decision refers to 25-meter -lrb- 82-foot -rrb- trucks capable of hauling up to 60 tons of goods and was taken after a trial of the vehicles , comprising three standard 6-meter containers , on some stretches of germany 's highways . potential traffic hazards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german automobile club said gigaliners posed a danger to cars the study , which neither approved nor rejected the use of " gigaliners , " found that traffic would not increase due to the extended-trailers but said the added weight could pose a potential problem over bridges and in tunnels , according to a report in the daily süddeutsche zeitung . in general , trailer trucks on european roads may be no heavier than 40 tons and no longer than 18.75 meters , though longer vehicles are allowed to transport wood in sweden and finland . the use in germany of extra-long trucks that exceed established authorized weights is not possible however " because of the elevated risk to transport security , " the ministers said .
about 75 percent of germans said they were against allowing the extended trailers , according to a survey published by the forsa research institute . proponents of the huge trucks say they would cut freight costs and fuel consumption by 15 percent .
they deny the trucks would have a negative impact on roads , as the weight carried by each axle would not rise .
" this eliminates efficiency increases necessary in commercial transport without presenting other sustainable solutions , " said kay-dirk lindemann a traffic expert for the federation of german industries . european transit country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are over 700,000 trailer trucks registed for use on german highways the adac , germany 's largest automobile club , however , welcomed the ministers ' decision .
" this is a huge success for traffic safety and road infrastructure , " ulrich klaus becker , the association 's vice president , said in a statement .
" the risks for car traffic would have been immense . " the ministers recommended concluding the current gigaliner trial operations underway in three german states but said there was no reason to begin a closer examination of the trucks ' feasibility in germany . a transit country for many of the goods shipped throughout europe , germany 's autobahns are free for cars .

10 , not to license huge 60-ton trailer trucks on german roads , saying the trucks posed a danger to automobile traffic on the country 's autobahns . a majority of the ministers from germany 's 16 states , meeting along with federal transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , had taken the decision on the basis of a study prepared by a working group . tiefensee said he was pleased the german ministers came to clear a decision before the european union begins debate on issue next year . the decision refers to 25-meter -lrb- 82-foot -rrb- trucks capable of hauling up to 60 tons of goods and was taken after a trial of the vehicles , comprising three standard 6-meter containers , on some stretches of germany 's highways . potential traffic hazards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german automobile club said gigaliners posed a danger to cars the study , which neither approved nor rejected the use of " gigaliners , " found that traffic would not increase due to the extended-trailers but said the added weight could pose a potential problem over bridges and in tunnels , according to a report in the daily süddeutsche zeitung . in general , trailer trucks on european roads may be no heavier than 40 tons and no longer than 18.75 meters , though longer vehicles are allowed to transport wood in sweden and finland . the use in germany of extra-long trucks that exceed established authorized weights is not possible however " because of the elevated risk to transport security , " the ministers said .
about 75 percent of germans said they were against allowing the extended trailers , according to a survey published by the forsa research institute . proponents of the huge trucks say they would cut freight costs and fuel consumption by 15 percent .
they deny the trucks would have a negative impact on roads , as the weight carried by each axle would not rise .
" this eliminates efficiency increases necessary in commercial transport without presenting other sustainable solutions , " said kay-dirk lindemann a traffic expert for the federation of german industries . european transit country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are over 700,000 trailer trucks registed for use on german highways the adac , germany 's largest automobile club , however , welcomed the ministers ' decision .
" this is a huge success for traffic safety and road infrastructure , " ulrich klaus becker , the association 's vice president , said in a statement .
" the risks for car traffic would have been immense . " the ministers recommended concluding the current gigaliner trial operations underway in three german states but said there was no reason to begin a closer examination of the trucks ' feasibility in germany . a transit country for many of the goods shipped throughout europe , germany 's autobahns are free for cars .
the government began charging trailer trucks a per-kilometer fee in 2005 bringing in a total of about 3.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- last year . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's hard work to become a scientist , said manfred lindinger from the german daily faz .
it did n't surprise him a bit that two germans won the nobel prize this year . did the fact that germans got these two nobel prizes come as a surprise ? it was a surprise that two germans got the prizes at the same time - but it was n't a surprise that gerhard ertl and peter grünberg received the prizes .
they were on the list and people knew that they would get it at some point . would you say that germany has recovered from the drain during the 1930s and 40s when many went to the us ? there was a big hole after the second world war and it took a long time for germany to reach the same level of science , especially in physics .
but things changed in the 1960s , 70s and 80s .
there was good science .
still , the competition in great britain and america was very tough , so there were n't many german nobel prize laureates in this time . the discoveries that were honored this year with the nobel prize were made in the late 80s and even in the 60s and 70s , in ertl 's case .
this shows that science was strong in germany at that time .
and the whole world benefits from this research . do you think these prizes will help promote the sciences in germany ? things may change .
science in germany does n't just take place in germany .
researchers collaborate in the us , in the uk and all over the world .
there 's a big network of scientists .
even when the nobel prize is given to an american , there may have been germans involved in the research . it takes hard work to become a really important scientist .
in the fields of politics and economics , people expect results quickly , but this is n't true of science .
the nobel prize makes it evident that it takes a long time . i think there 's a big chance now that we 'll make a switch from the media superstars to the real superstars , who are in science . manfred lindinger is a science author for the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . interview : dagmar breitenbach -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de takes a look at who and what are behind one of the most prestigious awards in the world . who was alfred nobel ? alfred nobel was born in stockholm in 1833 .
together with his father , who was an engineer , he developed the explosive nitroglycerine , which proved a commercial success . despite the danger of the project - nobel 's brother emil was killed in an experiment in 1864 - he continued his research , patenting what he called dynamite in 1867 .
the invention proved very useful in the construction industry and nobel traveled the world selling his product .
when not on the road , he diligently conducted research and registered 355 patents in his name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel was active as a chemist and physicist and pursued literature in his free time nobel 's talent as both a scientist and a businessman allowed him to amass a considerable fortune .
he was also fluent in several languages , wrote poetry and drama , and had a deep interest in philosophy and literature . how did the nobel prize come about ? after his death in 1896 , the opening of nobel 's will caused a considerable stir : he had left the majority of his money to the establishment of " prizes to those who , during the preceding year , shall have conferred the greatest benefit to mankind " in physics , chemistry , medicine , literature and peace . family members contested the will .
others were irked at the international nature of the new prizes .
the biggest shock , however , was the peace prize .
the name nobel had been associated with explosives and weapons - not with peace . nobel 's friend and former secretary countess bertha von suttner , a vocal pacifist , is credited with having had a significant impact on the millionaire , and was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1905 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel thought hard about the ramifications of his inventions for humanity " perhaps my factories will put an end to war sooner than your congresses , " he wrote the countess in 1891 .
two-and-a-half decades before world war one , nobel could n't have foreseen just how wrong he would be . because nobel had not composed his will with the help of a lawyer nor specified how the prizes should be awarded , it took five years to sort out the details before the first nobel prize could be awarded in 1901 . in 1968 , sweden 's central bank established the sveriges riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of alfred nobel .
the five original prizes are administered by the nobel foundation in stockholm . how are the winners selected ? candidates are nominated a year in advance by qualified parties in the six relevant fields .
academics , politicians , prominent scientists , previous nobel laureates and others receive personal invitations each year to nominate a candidate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertha von suttner worked for nobel for only a few months the nominators are selected in such a way so that as many different countries as possible are represented over time .
their nominations are kept secret for 50 years . in his will , alfred nobel specifically indicated five swedish institutions responsible for choosing the prize recipients in each category . the royal swedish academy of sciences has selected the economics prize laureates since 1969 . interesting facts : * 772 individuals and 19 organizations have been awarded the nobel prize , some more than once .

both darabi and rhayel could now be released as early as december , federal prosecutor frank wallenta said .
under german law , life sentences are reviewed by authorities after 15 years to decide whether the guilty party can be released .
the five years darabi spent in jail before he was convicted counted towards his life sentence .
when darabi was arrested for the murders , the investigation and subsequent trial sparked a diplomatic crisis between berlin and tehran with german authorities accusing the highest levels of the iranian government of responsibility for the attacks .
at the time , darabi was called an iranian secret agent .
at his sentencing in 1997 , the berlin court which tried darabi said that because of the severity of his crime , he should be held in custody beyond the usual 15 years .
thursday ’ s ruling by the federal prosecutor 's office marks a surprise reversal of that ruling .
the decision to release darabi has been criticized by the israeli government which had appealed to germany not to release the iranian .

the newspaper reported that merkel rebuffed his appeal , telling him that the authorities would follow the letter of the law .
the ha 'aretz report also claimed that israel wanted to use darabi as part of a deal brokered between israel and hezbollah in 2004 in which 400 palestinian prisoners were released in exchange for the bodies of three israeli soldiers killed in 2000 and elhanan tannenbaum , an israeli businessman .
another aspect of the deal was that darabi would be released if hezbollah offered information on the captured israeli air force navigator ron arad , but the deal fell through , the report said .

performance-enhancing drug use in poplar and youth sports has , however , remained a little-researched field , treutlein said .
that 's why the center plans to approach young athletes about the risks doping pose .
the center also plans to educate coaches and teachers on doping and drug abuse and to create ad campaigns to help prevent doping among young athletes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : educational material and school lessons are part of the center 's plans to cut youth doping " we can show young people alternatives to consider , but it 's up to them to make the decision , " treutlein said .
faith in doping-free international sports has most recently been shaken by china 's top female triathlete being banned from two years of completion for taking performance-enhancing drugs , us sprinter and triple olympic champion marion jones confessing to doping and returning her medals from the sydney olympics , and a tour de france that was marred by doping cases and allegations .
" young athletes have to be strengthened , " said michale hölz , head of the board of trustees for germany 's national doping agency .
" we do not need just responsible citizens , we also need responsible athletes . "

then an extension is theoretically possible . "
hainer said adidas could end their engagement instantly if there are new doping cases in the team .

" germany is part of a global danger zone and can at any time become the target of terrorism attacks , " he told judges .
" the internet has become a decisive medium . " the surveillance technique has sparked intense debate in germany , where mistrust of state intrusion into private lives is still high due to germany 's nazi and communist past . key to future terrorism strategy the hearing in front of the court is looking into the legality of such methods in the federal state of north rhine-westphalia , where domestic intelligence officials began using it 10 months ago .

the social democrats have said they will wait for the court 's decision , which will only be known in several months . privacy advocates have generally come out against the method , including peter schaar , germany 's independent privacy commissioner .
he called the technique " a further alarming step towards ever more sweeping surveillance , " adding that it would not only give authorities access to documents , e-mails and photos , but would allow them to follow every keystroke and activate devices such as cameras and microphones attached to computers . court doubts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates of online-spying say they internet has become an important terror tool the court 's judges , presided over by hans-jürgen papier , indicated in opening remarks that they have serious concerns about cyberspying , since it called into question the balance of freedom and security . they expressed doubts that secret access to computers was necessary to fight terrorism . but the president of the office for the protection of the constitution , heinz fromm , said security services needed this tool because the internet had become a virtual training camp for real terrorism . judges are expected to make a decision by next year . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

publishers are taking different approaches to google book search , with german publishers launching libreka . german publishers launched libreka , an internet book search machine of their own wednesday , oct .
10 .
they hope libreka will rival google book search while allowing them to keep control .
rüdiger salat , a board executive at holtzbrinck , the top german-based book publisher , said google might someday become a partner to publishers .
but for now it was still " more an enemy . "
google has undertaken a massive project to scan and index book content .
google scans the complete text so that users can find books which contain a specific word or phrase .
under a policy known as " opt out , " google , which is funded by online advertising , says it deletes any books from its search engine if copyright owners request it .
" opt out is not the right way , " said salat , whose group has been a key backer of libreka , the german publishers ' search engine .
a preview was launched at the frankfurt book fair wednesday .
the libreka database contains 8,000 german-language books whose publishers have explicitly " opted in " to the idea .
us publishing executive sees opportunities bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : google has gotten into the book business while us publishers also have qualms about google 's plans to index books , one executive said that the ruckus might soon come to an end .
us publishers and authors began legal action two years ago against google .
peter olson , new york-based chief executive of the world 's biggest book publishing group , random house , said , " i think we are close to resolving our issues .
we have so much in common . "
olson , speaking in a discussion between top industry executives on the first day of the fair , said he wants to see google and publishers charge internet users small fees to see single pages of books online .
olson envisions a set-up similar to popular music downloading services such as itunes , which allow songs to be purchased individually instead of having to buy an entire album .
olson envisions a " pay-per-page " model where a reader could buy single page or chapter .
instead of buying the entire cookbook , a reader could pay for a single carrot cake recipe or get the entire desserts chapter .
giving a share to the book industry would mollify publishers , olson said .
" i think it makes sense for both sides , " said olson .

the project was started in 2005 and has been engineered by a delhi , india software house , mps , in which holtzbrinck is a shareholder .
libreka is an offshoot of germany 's books-in-print database .
its target audience seems to be german bookstores , who could put it on their websites to help shoppers find books they want to buy .
ronald schild , head of the libreka project , said publishers could decide if part or even all of a book should be freely downloadable .

the group said it was in negotiations about cooperation deals with the us company .

google has undertaken a massive project to scan and index book content .
google scans the complete text so that users can find books which contain a specific word or phrase .
under a policy known as " opt out , " google , which is funded by online advertising , says it deletes any books from its search engine if copyright owners request it .
" opt out is not the right way , " said salat , whose group has been a key backer of libreka , the german publishers ' search engine .

a new study in germany shows that their womenfolk , however , do n't see things the same way . it is accepted in some scientific circles that orangutans , and not chimpanzees , are the closest relatives to humans among the great apes .
ask a human woman about the similarities between the ginger monkeys and their own species and they are likely to add to the burgeoning evidence that man -lrb- but not necessarily woman -rrb- is but an evolutionary side-step from an orangutan .
the list appears endless at times : body hair , personal hygiene , mating techniques … if you listen to some disgruntled females you could be misled into believing that they live in a monkey house bedecked with hanging tires rather than a swanky apartment filled with the latest modern furniture .
as if to give women even more ammunition , another similarity between german men and orangutans was discovered only last week , courtesy of a certain knuckle-dragger called sibu .
simbu 's blonde ambition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hey baby , feel like gettin ' it on ? "
sibu -lrb- an orangutan and not a german male -rrb- , had become a pain in the hairy backside by refusing to mate with any of the ape babes which swung his way for some primate lovin ' at the apenheul primate park in amsterdam , holland .
instead - and here is where the very tenuous link to german men comes in - he preferred to go monkey nuts over the blonde female humans which attended to him .
sibu 's preference for flaxen-haired female humans , preferably tattooed , fits snugly with documented evidence which says that german gentlemen prefer blondes .
german women , however , do not share sibu 's or their menfolks ' lust for the fair-haired .

only 17.2 percent of those questioned found blond men attractive while a total of 28.9 percent favored brown-haired men , and 34.7 percent preferred men with dark hair .
now , while this does n't appear to be such a great problem for the large number of swarthy types out there , the survey showed that german ladies require a little more than just a luxurious inky thatch from their mates .

those also sharing sibu 's grooming and hygiene habits may be forced to fight lesser apes over the monkey bars and fling feces at the cropped and manicured males who are more likely to successfully pair up with the females .
according to the gfk survey , every second woman in germany is attracted to clean-shaven men with short hair and manicured nails .
of the 1,031 women questioned , 59.6 percent found a man with manicured nails attractive , while 50.9 percent said they did not like men with stubble on their chin .
some 53.9 percent said they preferred men to have short hair , with a mere 4.7 percent saying they were attracted to males with a long , flowing mane .

a new study in germany shows that their womenfolk , however , do n't see things the same way . it is accepted in some scientific circles that orangutans , and not chimpanzees , are the closest relatives to humans among the great apes .
ask a human woman about the similarities between the ginger monkeys and their own species and they are likely to add to the burgeoning evidence that man -lrb- but not necessarily woman -rrb- is but an evolutionary side-step from an orangutan .
the list appears endless at times : body hair , personal hygiene , mating techniques … if you listen to some disgruntled females you could be misled into believing that they live in a monkey house bedecked with hanging tires rather than a swanky apartment filled with the latest modern furniture .
as if to give women even more ammunition , another similarity between german men and orangutans was discovered only last week , courtesy of a certain knuckle-dragger called sibu .
simbu 's blonde ambition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hey baby , feel like gettin ' it on ? "
sibu -lrb- an orangutan and not a german male -rrb- , had become a pain in the hairy backside by refusing to mate with any of the ape babes which swung his way for some primate lovin ' at the apenheul primate park in amsterdam , holland .
instead - and here is where the very tenuous link to german men comes in - he preferred to go monkey nuts over the blonde female humans which attended to him .
sibu 's preference for flaxen-haired female humans , preferably tattooed , fits snugly with documented evidence which says that german gentlemen prefer blondes .
german women , however , do not share sibu 's or their menfolks ' lust for the fair-haired .
well-trimmed , dark-haired men get the nod bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim jong il ticks some , but maybe not all , the boxes a new survey of attractiveness by the gfk research institute on behalf of a german health magazine reveals that when it comes to choosing a mate , german women prefer dark-haired men to blondes .
only 17.2 percent of those questioned found blond men attractive while a total of 28.9 percent favored brown-haired men , and 34.7 percent preferred men with dark hair .
now , while this does n't appear to be such a great problem for the large number of swarthy types out there , the survey showed that german ladies require a little more than just a luxurious inky thatch from their mates .
and this is where our friend sibu comes back in .
grooming high on german women 's list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " lose the beard and then we can talk " if you are a man who has more in common with sibu than his penchant for pneumatic blondes , then even your dusky crowning glory may not save you from being cast aside in the mating game .
those also sharing sibu 's grooming and hygiene habits may be forced to fight lesser apes over the monkey bars and fling feces at the cropped and manicured males who are more likely to successfully pair up with the females .
according to the gfk survey , every second woman in germany is attracted to clean-shaven men with short hair and manicured nails .
of the 1,031 women questioned , 59.6 percent found a man with manicured nails attractive , while 50.9 percent said they did not like men with stubble on their chin .
some 53.9 percent said they preferred men to have short hair , with a mere 4.7 percent saying they were attracted to males with a long , flowing mane .

10 , not to license huge 60-ton trailer trucks on german roads , saying the trucks posed a danger to automobile traffic on the country 's autobahns . a majority of the ministers from germany 's 16 states , meeting along with federal transport minister wolfgang tiefensee , had taken the decision on the basis of a study prepared by a working group . tiefensee said he was pleased the german ministers came to clear a decision before the european union begins debate on issue next year . the decision refers to 25-meter -lrb- 82-foot -rrb- trucks capable of hauling up to 60 tons of goods and was taken after a trial of the vehicles , comprising three standard 6-meter containers , on some stretches of germany 's highways . potential traffic hazards bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german automobile club said gigaliners posed a danger to cars the study , which neither approved nor rejected the use of " gigaliners , " found that traffic would not increase due to the extended-trailers but said the added weight could pose a potential problem over bridges and in tunnels , according to a report in the daily süddeutsche zeitung . in general , trailer trucks on european roads may be no heavier than 40 tons and no longer than 18.75 meters , though longer vehicles are allowed to transport wood in sweden and finland . the use in germany of extra-long trucks that exceed established authorized weights is not possible however " because of the elevated risk to transport security , " the ministers said .
about 75 percent of germans said they were against allowing the extended trailers , according to a survey published by the forsa research institute . proponents of the huge trucks say they would cut freight costs and fuel consumption by 15 percent .
they deny the trucks would have a negative impact on roads , as the weight carried by each axle would not rise .
" this eliminates efficiency increases necessary in commercial transport without presenting other sustainable solutions , " said kay-dirk lindemann a traffic expert for the federation of german industries . european transit country bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are over 700,000 trailer trucks registed for use on german highways the adac , germany 's largest automobile club , however , welcomed the ministers ' decision .
" this is a huge success for traffic safety and road infrastructure , " ulrich klaus becker , the association 's vice president , said in a statement .
" the risks for car traffic would have been immense . " the ministers recommended concluding the current gigaliner trial operations underway in three german states but said there was no reason to begin a closer examination of the trucks ' feasibility in germany . a transit country for many of the goods shipped throughout europe , germany 's autobahns are free for cars .
the government began charging trailer trucks a per-kilometer fee in 2005 bringing in a total of about 3.5 billion euros -lrb- $ 5 billion -rrb- last year . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's hard work to become a scientist , said manfred lindinger from the german daily faz .
it did n't surprise him a bit that two germans won the nobel prize this year . did the fact that germans got these two nobel prizes come as a surprise ? it was a surprise that two germans got the prizes at the same time - but it was n't a surprise that gerhard ertl and peter grünberg received the prizes .
they were on the list and people knew that they would get it at some point . would you say that germany has recovered from the drain during the 1930s and 40s when many went to the us ? there was a big hole after the second world war and it took a long time for germany to reach the same level of science , especially in physics .
but things changed in the 1960s , 70s and 80s .
there was good science .
still , the competition in great britain and america was very tough , so there were n't many german nobel prize laureates in this time . the discoveries that were honored this year with the nobel prize were made in the late 80s and even in the 60s and 70s , in ertl 's case .
this shows that science was strong in germany at that time .
and the whole world benefits from this research . do you think these prizes will help promote the sciences in germany ? things may change .
science in germany does n't just take place in germany .
researchers collaborate in the us , in the uk and all over the world .
there 's a big network of scientists .
even when the nobel prize is given to an american , there may have been germans involved in the research . it takes hard work to become a really important scientist .
in the fields of politics and economics , people expect results quickly , but this is n't true of science .
the nobel prize makes it evident that it takes a long time . i think there 's a big chance now that we 'll make a switch from the media superstars to the real superstars , who are in science . manfred lindinger is a science author for the german daily frankfurter allgemeine zeitung . interview : dagmar breitenbach -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de takes a look at who and what are behind one of the most prestigious awards in the world . who was alfred nobel ? alfred nobel was born in stockholm in 1833 .
together with his father , who was an engineer , he developed the explosive nitroglycerine , which proved a commercial success . despite the danger of the project - nobel 's brother emil was killed in an experiment in 1864 - he continued his research , patenting what he called dynamite in 1867 .
the invention proved very useful in the construction industry and nobel traveled the world selling his product .
when not on the road , he diligently conducted research and registered 355 patents in his name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel was active as a chemist and physicist and pursued literature in his free time nobel 's talent as both a scientist and a businessman allowed him to amass a considerable fortune .
he was also fluent in several languages , wrote poetry and drama , and had a deep interest in philosophy and literature . how did the nobel prize come about ? after his death in 1896 , the opening of nobel 's will caused a considerable stir : he had left the majority of his money to the establishment of " prizes to those who , during the preceding year , shall have conferred the greatest benefit to mankind " in physics , chemistry , medicine , literature and peace . family members contested the will .
others were irked at the international nature of the new prizes .
the biggest shock , however , was the peace prize .
the name nobel had been associated with explosives and weapons - not with peace . nobel 's friend and former secretary countess bertha von suttner , a vocal pacifist , is credited with having had a significant impact on the millionaire , and was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1905 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel thought hard about the ramifications of his inventions for humanity " perhaps my factories will put an end to war sooner than your congresses , " he wrote the countess in 1891 .
two-and-a-half decades before world war one , nobel could n't have foreseen just how wrong he would be . because nobel had not composed his will with the help of a lawyer nor specified how the prizes should be awarded , it took five years to sort out the details before the first nobel prize could be awarded in 1901 . in 1968 , sweden 's central bank established the sveriges riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of alfred nobel .
the five original prizes are administered by the nobel foundation in stockholm . how are the winners selected ? candidates are nominated a year in advance by qualified parties in the six relevant fields .
academics , politicians , prominent scientists , previous nobel laureates and others receive personal invitations each year to nominate a candidate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertha von suttner worked for nobel for only a few months the nominators are selected in such a way so that as many different countries as possible are represented over time .
their nominations are kept secret for 50 years . in his will , alfred nobel specifically indicated five swedish institutions responsible for choosing the prize recipients in each category . the royal swedish academy of sciences has selected the economics prize laureates since 1969 . interesting facts : * 772 individuals and 19 organizations have been awarded the nobel prize , some more than once .
thirty-four women are among the prize winners . * the youngest nobel laureate , lawrence bragg , was just 25 when he accepted the prize .
he shared the 1915 nobel prize in physics with his father . * raymond david jr . , nearly 88 when he was awarded the nobel prize in physics in 2002 , was the oldest nobel laureate . * several would-be nobel recipients either declined to accept their award or were forced to decline for political reasons . jean-paul sartre , who consistently turned down all public honors , did n't accept his 1964 nobel prize in literature .
in 1973 , le duc tho was awarded the nobel peace prize jointly with us secretary of state henry kissinger for negotiating the vietnam peace accord .
tho declined the prize due to the situation in vietnam . three german nobel laureates - richard kuhn , adolf butenandt and gerhard domagk - were forbidden by adolf hitler to accept their prizes .

the court seemed skeptical . the government argued on wednesday , oct .

" germany is part of a global danger zone and can at any time become the target of terrorism attacks , " he told judges .
" the internet has become a decisive medium . " the surveillance technique has sparked intense debate in germany , where mistrust of state intrusion into private lives is still high due to germany 's nazi and communist past . key to future terrorism strategy the hearing in front of the court is looking into the legality of such methods in the federal state of north rhine-westphalia , where domestic intelligence officials began using it 10 months ago .

the social democrats have said they will wait for the court 's decision , which will only be known in several months . privacy advocates have generally come out against the method , including peter schaar , germany 's independent privacy commissioner .
he called the technique " a further alarming step towards ever more sweeping surveillance , " adding that it would not only give authorities access to documents , e-mails and photos , but would allow them to follow every keystroke and activate devices such as cameras and microphones attached to computers . court doubts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates of online-spying say they internet has become an important terror tool the court 's judges , presided over by hans-jürgen papier , indicated in opening remarks that they have serious concerns about cyberspying , since it called into question the balance of freedom and security . they expressed doubts that secret access to computers was necessary to fight terrorism . but the president of the office for the protection of the constitution , heinz fromm , said security services needed this tool because the internet had become a virtual training camp for real terrorism . judges are expected to make a decision by next year . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 11.10.2007 german train bombing suspect appears in lebanese court großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the two suspects in the attempted train bombing are in separate countries the main lebanese suspect accused of plotting to blow up two trains in germany in july 2006 appeared thursday in court in beirut and was questioned by a lebanese judge , judicial sources said . during the questioning , jihad hamad admitted that he and youssef al-haj dib , who is currently in custody in germany , bought two gas canisters , wires and two bags to put them on the trains to protest caricatures of the prophet mohammed originally published in a danish newspaper .
the two suspected terrorists had placed two suitcases containing bombs on the trains .
had there not been errors in the bombs ' construction , german investigators said the explosions near the cities of hamm and koblenz would have resulted in the deaths of hundreds of people , putting the plot on a much larger scale than the terrorist attacks on london in july 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suitcases used in the failed plot hamad denied that he followed any " muslim fundamentalist group or jihadist group . "
he also denied any links with the sunni muslim fundamentalist group al qaeda which is led by osama bin laden .
judge helena iskander decided to issue a warrant to the lebanese police to look into reports that saddam al-haj dib , brother of youssef , and also a suspect in the plot , was killed during the 15-week battle between militants from the fatah al-islam group and the lebanese army in northern lebanon .
associates questioned the judge also questioned three lebanese citizens who were arrested with hamad : khaled al-haj dib , ayman hadad and khalil al-bobo .
khaled al-haj dib said that his connection with hamad went back to university and he denied any links to the german bombing plot .
hadad said he met hamad in tripoli , and denied that he had any knowledge of the bombing plot or belonged to any islamic movement .
al-bobo also denied his links with the german bombing plot , but said he met saddam al-haj dib through a common friend called osama al-shahabi , who usually sent muslims to fight in iraq .
" at the time i was impressed with the way al-haj dib thinks - his jihadist thinking - and we exchanged telephone numbers , " al-bobo told the judge .
he was arrested and put in a lebanese jail because he threw a bomb at a lebanese army checkpoint in the north of the country .
the four suspects hail from areas in northern lebanon where sunni fundamentalist movements have been flourishing for the past few years .
families proclaim sons ' innocence bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the gas-based bombs would have killed hundreds hamad 's father shahid , who was present during the court session , told german press agency dpa that his son was a student and not a fundamentalist and that he sent his son to a christian school in tripoli , not an islamic extremist one .
shahid said he decided to send his son to germany for the better education and job opportunities that were available there .
jihad hamad turned up at his parents ' house in tripoli shortly after the attempted bombings .
jihad , who had been taking german language classes for six months in germany , explained his sudden appearance by saying that he was worried about his parents because of the july 2006 israeli war against lebanon 's hezbollah movement at the time .
jihad has given a partial confession to lebanese authorities , saying that he deposited a piece of luggage in one of the trains but was not aware of its contents .
he has also told investigators that he and al-haj dib researched bomb-making methods on the internet that could have increased the victims ' suffering in the planned attacks .
the german police have said that the publication of the caricatures of the prophet mohammed in german newspapers may have prompted jihad hamad and youssef al-haj dib to devise their plot .
lebanese chief public prosecutor said mirza has accused jihad hamad of organizing and attempting mass murder .
should he be convicted , he faces life-long imprisonment and forced labor .

he added that it was disturbing that the european union has largely ignored the problems of pro-nazi groups in these countries .
" some facts which we come up against in several countries of eastern europe have provoked open astonishment and incomprehension , " putin said .
" the activities of the latvian and estonian authorities openly connive at the glorification of nazis and their accomplices .
but these facts remain unnoticed by the european union . "
in 2006 , latvian officials banned an annual parade that glorifies the latvian waffen ss against russia 's red army .
some far right supporters marched anyway .
legacy of mistrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a controversial war memorial putin 's remarks are the latest volley in a political war of words between the baltic countries and russia .
latvia , lithuania and estonia joined the european union in 2004 , in part to seek protection from their domineering former rulers in moscow .
soviet forces annexed the baltic countries during world war ii .
the war split the population between those who fought for nazi germany and those who supported russia .
in russia 's view , it liberated the countries from nazi occupation in a victory that cost it 20 million lives .
germany 's defeat is seen as an important historical event and it rejects the accusation that it occupied eastern european countries .
but many people from the baltic states see the red army 's arrival as the beginning of five decades of soviet rule .
during that time , thousands of estonians were deported to soviet prison camps and russians settled in the country .
strained relations continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paying respects animosity flared up again earlier this year when estonian authorities moved a bronze statue of a red army soldier from a downtown tallinn square and moved it to a military cemetery .
rioting caused by the decision to relocate the war memorial left one person dead and a dozen injured .
further protests by pro-kremlin youths at the estonian consulate in moscow lead to scuffles with bodyguards .
in june , estonia buried the remains of eight soviet soldiers who had been exhumed from the tallinn war memorial .
the soldiers were reburied in the estonian defense forces ' cemetery , the same place where the statue was relocated .
a month before the reburial , estonia came under massive cyber attacks , crippling government and corporate web sites for nearly three weeks .
the estonian government suggested that russia could have been behind the attacks and asked for help from nato , which agreed to investigate the incident .
russia has denied any involvement in the cyber attacks .
germany has participated in some behind-the-scenes negotiating on various issues between russia and the baltic countries , but the eu has largely refrained from inserting itself in the disputes .
russia wants an apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltics have a large population of russian minorities the situation in estonia remains volatile . russia 's eu ambassador has said that estonia still owes russia an apology for moving the monument .
without an apology for moving the monument , protests could continue , he said .
putin brought up the war memorial issue wednesday .
" we are seeing a position on the limit of hypocrisy by certain european structures over the moving of the liberation soldier monument in tallinn , " putin said .
putin noted that since estonia 's independence in 1991 , " not a single nazi criminal has been condemned . "
putin admitted there were acts of anti-semitism in russia as well as " chauvinistic , xenophobic and nationalistic demonstrations . "
moshe kantor , head of the european jewish congress , asked putin to recognize the international holocaust day , which was introduced by the united nations in november 2005 .

" germany is part of a global danger zone and can at any time become the target of terrorism attacks , " he told judges .
" the internet has become a decisive medium . " the surveillance technique has sparked intense debate in germany , where mistrust of state intrusion into private lives is still high due to germany 's nazi and communist past . key to future terrorism strategy the hearing in front of the court is looking into the legality of such methods in the federal state of north rhine-westphalia , where domestic intelligence officials began using it 10 months ago .

the social democrats have said they will wait for the court 's decision , which will only be known in several months . privacy advocates have generally come out against the method , including peter schaar , germany 's independent privacy commissioner .
he called the technique " a further alarming step towards ever more sweeping surveillance , " adding that it would not only give authorities access to documents , e-mails and photos , but would allow them to follow every keystroke and activate devices such as cameras and microphones attached to computers . court doubts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates of online-spying say they internet has become an important terror tool the court 's judges , presided over by hans-jürgen papier , indicated in opening remarks that they have serious concerns about cyberspying , since it called into question the balance of freedom and security . they expressed doubts that secret access to computers was necessary to fight terrorism . but the president of the office for the protection of the constitution , heinz fromm , said security services needed this tool because the internet had become a virtual training camp for real terrorism . judges are expected to make a decision by next year . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 , russian president vladimir putin said he is dismayed by estonia and latvia 's glorification of nazism .
europe needs to take notice , putin said . putin , speaking in moscow to the european jewish congress , said he was shocked when an annual waffen ss parade took place in latvia in march .
he added that it was disturbing that the european union has largely ignored the problems of pro-nazi groups in these countries .
" some facts which we come up against in several countries of eastern europe have provoked open astonishment and incomprehension , " putin said .
" the activities of the latvian and estonian authorities openly connive at the glorification of nazis and their accomplices .
but these facts remain unnoticed by the european union . "
in 2006 , latvian officials banned an annual parade that glorifies the latvian waffen ss against russia 's red army .
some far right supporters marched anyway .
legacy of mistrust bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a controversial war memorial putin 's remarks are the latest volley in a political war of words between the baltic countries and russia .
latvia , lithuania and estonia joined the european union in 2004 , in part to seek protection from their domineering former rulers in moscow .
soviet forces annexed the baltic countries during world war ii .
the war split the population between those who fought for nazi germany and those who supported russia .
in russia 's view , it liberated the countries from nazi occupation in a victory that cost it 20 million lives .
germany 's defeat is seen as an important historical event and it rejects the accusation that it occupied eastern european countries .
but many people from the baltic states see the red army 's arrival as the beginning of five decades of soviet rule .
during that time , thousands of estonians were deported to soviet prison camps and russians settled in the country .
strained relations continue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : paying respects animosity flared up again earlier this year when estonian authorities moved a bronze statue of a red army soldier from a downtown tallinn square and moved it to a military cemetery .
rioting caused by the decision to relocate the war memorial left one person dead and a dozen injured .
further protests by pro-kremlin youths at the estonian consulate in moscow lead to scuffles with bodyguards .
in june , estonia buried the remains of eight soviet soldiers who had been exhumed from the tallinn war memorial .
the soldiers were reburied in the estonian defense forces ' cemetery , the same place where the statue was relocated .
a month before the reburial , estonia came under massive cyber attacks , crippling government and corporate web sites for nearly three weeks .
the estonian government suggested that russia could have been behind the attacks and asked for help from nato , which agreed to investigate the incident .
russia has denied any involvement in the cyber attacks .
germany has participated in some behind-the-scenes negotiating on various issues between russia and the baltic countries , but the eu has largely refrained from inserting itself in the disputes .
russia wants an apology bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltics have a large population of russian minorities the situation in estonia remains volatile . russia 's eu ambassador has said that estonia still owes russia an apology for moving the monument .
without an apology for moving the monument , protests could continue , he said .
putin brought up the war memorial issue wednesday .
" we are seeing a position on the limit of hypocrisy by certain european structures over the moving of the liberation soldier monument in tallinn , " putin said .
putin noted that since estonia 's independence in 1991 , " not a single nazi criminal has been condemned . "
putin admitted there were acts of anti-semitism in russia as well as " chauvinistic , xenophobic and nationalistic demonstrations . "
moshe kantor , head of the european jewish congress , asked putin to recognize the international holocaust day , which was introduced by the united nations in november 2005 .

10 .
performance-enhancing drug use in poplar and youth sports has , however , remained a little-researched field , treutlein said .
that 's why the center plans to approach young athletes about the risks doping pose .
the center also plans to educate coaches and teachers on doping and drug abuse and to create ad campaigns to help prevent doping among young athletes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : educational material and school lessons are part of the center 's plans to cut youth doping " we can show young people alternatives to consider , but it 's up to them to make the decision , " treutlein said .
faith in doping-free international sports has most recently been shaken by china 's top female triathlete being banned from two years of completion for taking performance-enhancing drugs , us sprinter and triple olympic champion marion jones confessing to doping and returning her medals from the sydney olympics , and a tour de france that was marred by doping cases and allegations .
" young athletes have to be strengthened , " said michale hölz , head of the board of trustees for germany 's national doping agency .
" we do not need just responsible citizens , we also need responsible athletes . "
t-mobile sponsoring problem german sports goods maker adidas also announced wednesday that it is unlikely to act as a sponsor of the german t-mobile cycling team beyond 2008 due to doping in the sport .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a doping scandal left t-mobile with a bruised image after the tour de france " i can not imagine this to happen right now , " adidas boss herbert hainer told wednesday 's edition of the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung daily .
" we want to see success in the fight against doping and the clear will of all involved to act .
then an extension is theoretically possible . "
hainer said adidas could end their engagement instantly if there are new doping cases in the team .

it is common knowledge that the manmohan singh government has been rapped on its knuckles by the bhartiya janta party-led opposition , the so-called third front , as well as by its allies from the left because of the nuclear deal issue .
while there has been a palpable rapprochement between the indian government and the left parties and the fast – soaring political temperature has been brought down by both sides in the past couple of days , a question mark continues to hang over the future of indo-us nuclear deal .
energy-starved india so a similar deal with russia , india ’ s long-standing tried and tested friend , could do the trick for energy-starved india .
what ’ s more , this deal could be operational much quicker than the 123 agreement with the us , as the russian government has total control over its legislature , unlike the powerful us congress , which ca n't be bypassed by the us president .
sometime in december , the indian prime minister manmohan singh is expected to visit russia for an annual summit meeting , though the dates of his moscow visit are yet to be decided .
a key area for discussion will be civilian nuclear energy co-operation .
moscow has conveyed its keenness to develop civilian nuclear energy co-operation with india along the lines of the indo-us nuclear deal .
russia is understood to have asked india to work on a rough draft for such a nuclear deal .
moscow wants prime minister manmohan singh to have atomic energy commission chief anil kakodkar in his official entourage during the russia trip so that a meaningful discussion on the matter can be held .
123 on the back burner from the indications available , manmohan singh ’ s russia visit is likely to be historic - and a clever political tactic .
the left parties , which are bitterly opposed to indo-us nuclear deal , will not object to a similar deal between india and russia .
indications are that the indian government could be willing to put the 123 agreement on back burner and not take its show-down with the left over the issue to the hilt .
the international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- chief mohammad elbaradei , concluded his three-day visit to india on thursday , after meeting prime minister manmohan singh , external affairs minister pranab mukherjee and foreign secretary shivshankar menon .
elbaradei later made it clear that there was no deadline for india to sign an india-specific safeguards agreement with the iaea .
he also added , helpfully to the manmohan singh government , that no formal discussions on the indo-us nuclear deal had taken place between him and the indian officials .
however , to put the 123 agreement on course , the negotiations on the draft text of the safeguards agreement would have to be underway by next week .
the nuclear suppliers group -lrb- nsg -rrb- clearance is not a time-consuming process and could be completed in a matter of a few days .
the time frame is urgent as the us needs to know as soon as possible when to call an emergency meeting of the nuclear suppliers group , which they would prefer to hold sometime in november .
but at this point in time , the 123 agreement does not seem likely to be clinched so fast . r. sharma send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

four years later , his equally potent film about cambodian prostitutes , which is overshadowed by the khmer rouge 's legacy , made it into the competition of the 5th festival , which came to an end on wednesday . " paper can not wrap up embers " tells the story of seven young women forced to sell their bodies in phnom penh so they can help support their impoverished families in the country .
" the dead are quiet and the living suffer , " says one of the women , whose life rithy pahn follows .
the depiction of women who are exploited as sex slaves in contemporary cambodian society , which still bears the scars of the khmer rouge 's regime is very intimate and moving .
panh has said his film is " as close as one can get to the life - and thus spiritual death - of a prostitute " .
the un estimates there are 30,000 prostitutes in cambodia .
there are also countless numbers of cambodian prostitutes in thailand and malaysia .
pahn portrays their daily existences and listens to their views .
he is not interested in the sleazy underworld of the red light district but depicts the ordinary aspects of the women 's lives .
the viewers get to know the women as they cook , eat , argue , do the accounts , shoot up , cry and they listen to them talk .
they talk about the customers : " they get laid and hit us like animals , " says one .
" we get exploited and crushed like garlic , " explains another .
sold into sex slavery they talk about how they got into prostitution .
some were sold into slavery by their parents , others were abandoned as children , others made their way to the capital to find work .
one woman says she is too old and can only get " tricks " from rickshaw drivers - she explains her husband does n't help her and she needs to work so he can eat his rice .
her two-year-old son was stolen from her .
it turns out she 's only 34 and has been working as a prostitute for nine years .
another was raped by her father ...
the individual reasons are numerous , but collectively it is clear that the khmer rouge also has a large part of responsibility .
the bitter memories of its brutal reign are omnipresent .
many of the women grew up in un refugee camps and did not have access to education .
lack of qualifications drove them to prostitution .
one mother tells her daughter who complains about having to work as a sex slave for a kilo of rice that she has it easy : " under the khmer rouge it was much worse , there was no food and executions ; we had to share watered-down soup . "
at least you can eat is the implication .
driven to despair and although the survival skills honed under the khmer rouge continue to be used in the contemporary era , many of the young women are almost driven to despair - suicide and death are a recurring theme .
the women talk about the violence of their customers - they all know stories of women who have literally been battered to death .
" if we die , nobody cares , " one says matter-of-factly .
aids is also a common cause of death among the prostitutes who discuss the disease 's origin - monkeys and un peacekeepers are but two possibilities ...
a woman says the " bastard white men " who have sex without condoms are not afraid to die .
her friend answers indifferently : " if you have aids you die , if you do n't you die too . "
this is an indication that , emotionally , she already feels dead and this feeling is shared by many others : " lying down on a bed is like lying on the butcher 's block , " one states .
another : " when a client has sex with me , he has sex with a dead girl . "
rithy pahn thus continues his exploration of death and brutality in cambodian society , depicting the lives of women who , despite all their bitterness and anger , at times laugh and sing , finding refuge in painting or poetry and doing their best to get through their suffering so long as they are still alive . anne thomas send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic 9799 media center watch and listen explore new content daily in dw 's multimedia archive .

the court seemed skeptical . the government argued on wednesday , oct .
10 , that authorities should be able to plant " trojan " spyware on suspects ' computers , saying it was a vital tool in the fight against terrorism . these so-called remote " online searches " are " urgently needed to .. ensure security today and in the future , " said august hanning , deputy interior minister and former head of germany 's foreign intelligence agency , in the written text of a statement to the court . " germany is part of a global danger zone and can at any time become the target of terrorism attacks , " he told judges .
" the internet has become a decisive medium . " the surveillance technique has sparked intense debate in germany , where mistrust of state intrusion into private lives is still high due to germany 's nazi and communist past . key to future terrorism strategy the hearing in front of the court is looking into the legality of such methods in the federal state of north rhine-westphalia , where domestic intelligence officials began using it 10 months ago .

the social democrats have said they will wait for the court 's decision , which will only be known in several months . privacy advocates have generally come out against the method , including peter schaar , germany 's independent privacy commissioner .
he called the technique " a further alarming step towards ever more sweeping surveillance , " adding that it would not only give authorities access to documents , e-mails and photos , but would allow them to follow every keystroke and activate devices such as cameras and microphones attached to computers . court doubts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advocates of online-spying say they internet has become an important terror tool the court 's judges , presided over by hans-jürgen papier , indicated in opening remarks that they have serious concerns about cyberspying , since it called into question the balance of freedom and security . they expressed doubts that secret access to computers was necessary to fight terrorism . but the president of the office for the protection of the constitution , heinz fromm , said security services needed this tool because the internet had become a virtual training camp for real terrorism . judges are expected to make a decision by next year . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

performance-enhancing drug use in poplar and youth sports has , however , remained a little-researched field , treutlein said .
that 's why the center plans to approach young athletes about the risks doping pose .
the center also plans to educate coaches and teachers on doping and drug abuse and to create ad campaigns to help prevent doping among young athletes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : educational material and school lessons are part of the center 's plans to cut youth doping " we can show young people alternatives to consider , but it 's up to them to make the decision , " treutlein said .
faith in doping-free international sports has most recently been shaken by china 's top female triathlete being banned from two years of completion for taking performance-enhancing drugs , us sprinter and triple olympic champion marion jones confessing to doping and returning her medals from the sydney olympics , and a tour de france that was marred by doping cases and allegations .
" young athletes have to be strengthened , " said michale hölz , head of the board of trustees for germany 's national doping agency .
" we do not need just responsible citizens , we also need responsible athletes . "

then an extension is theoretically possible . "
hainer said adidas could end their engagement instantly if there are new doping cases in the team .

a new study in germany shows that their womenfolk , however , do n't see things the same way . it is accepted in some scientific circles that orangutans , and not chimpanzees , are the closest relatives to humans among the great apes .
ask a human woman about the similarities between the ginger monkeys and their own species and they are likely to add to the burgeoning evidence that man -lrb- but not necessarily woman -rrb- is but an evolutionary side-step from an orangutan .
the list appears endless at times : body hair , personal hygiene , mating techniques … if you listen to some disgruntled females you could be misled into believing that they live in a monkey house bedecked with hanging tires rather than a swanky apartment filled with the latest modern furniture .
as if to give women even more ammunition , another similarity between german men and orangutans was discovered only last week , courtesy of a certain knuckle-dragger called sibu .
simbu 's blonde ambition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hey baby , feel like gettin ' it on ? "
sibu -lrb- an orangutan and not a german male -rrb- , had become a pain in the hairy backside by refusing to mate with any of the ape babes which swung his way for some primate lovin ' at the apenheul primate park in amsterdam , holland .
instead - and here is where the very tenuous link to german men comes in - he preferred to go monkey nuts over the blonde female humans which attended to him .
sibu 's preference for flaxen-haired female humans , preferably tattooed , fits snugly with documented evidence which says that german gentlemen prefer blondes .
german women , however , do not share sibu 's or their menfolks ' lust for the fair-haired .
well-trimmed , dark-haired men get the nod bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim jong il ticks some , but maybe not all , the boxes a new survey of attractiveness by the gfk research institute on behalf of a german health magazine reveals that when it comes to choosing a mate , german women prefer dark-haired men to blondes .
only 17.2 percent of those questioned found blond men attractive while a total of 28.9 percent favored brown-haired men , and 34.7 percent preferred men with dark hair .
now , while this does n't appear to be such a great problem for the large number of swarthy types out there , the survey showed that german ladies require a little more than just a luxurious inky thatch from their mates .

a new study in germany shows that their womenfolk , however , do n't see things the same way . it is accepted in some scientific circles that orangutans , and not chimpanzees , are the closest relatives to humans among the great apes .
ask a human woman about the similarities between the ginger monkeys and their own species and they are likely to add to the burgeoning evidence that man -lrb- but not necessarily woman -rrb- is but an evolutionary side-step from an orangutan .
the list appears endless at times : body hair , personal hygiene , mating techniques … if you listen to some disgruntled females you could be misled into believing that they live in a monkey house bedecked with hanging tires rather than a swanky apartment filled with the latest modern furniture .
as if to give women even more ammunition , another similarity between german men and orangutans was discovered only last week , courtesy of a certain knuckle-dragger called sibu .
simbu 's blonde ambition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " hey baby , feel like gettin ' it on ? "
sibu -lrb- an orangutan and not a german male -rrb- , had become a pain in the hairy backside by refusing to mate with any of the ape babes which swung his way for some primate lovin ' at the apenheul primate park in amsterdam , holland .
instead - and here is where the very tenuous link to german men comes in - he preferred to go monkey nuts over the blonde female humans which attended to him .
sibu 's preference for flaxen-haired female humans , preferably tattooed , fits snugly with documented evidence which says that german gentlemen prefer blondes .
german women , however , do not share sibu 's or their menfolks ' lust for the fair-haired .
well-trimmed , dark-haired men get the nod bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kim jong il ticks some , but maybe not all , the boxes a new survey of attractiveness by the gfk research institute on behalf of a german health magazine reveals that when it comes to choosing a mate , german women prefer dark-haired men to blondes .
only 17.2 percent of those questioned found blond men attractive while a total of 28.9 percent favored brown-haired men , and 34.7 percent preferred men with dark hair .
now , while this does n't appear to be such a great problem for the large number of swarthy types out there , the survey showed that german ladies require a little more than just a luxurious inky thatch from their mates .
and this is where our friend sibu comes back in .

dw-world.de takes a look at who and what are behind one of the most prestigious awards in the world . who was alfred nobel ? alfred nobel was born in stockholm in 1833 .
together with his father , who was an engineer , he developed the explosive nitroglycerine , which proved a commercial success . despite the danger of the project - nobel 's brother emil was killed in an experiment in 1864 - he continued his research , patenting what he called dynamite in 1867 .
the invention proved very useful in the construction industry and nobel traveled the world selling his product .
when not on the road , he diligently conducted research and registered 355 patents in his name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel was active as a chemist and physicist and pursued literature in his free time nobel 's talent as both a scientist and a businessman allowed him to amass a considerable fortune .
he was also fluent in several languages , wrote poetry and drama , and had a deep interest in philosophy and literature . how did the nobel prize come about ? after his death in 1896 , the opening of nobel 's will caused a considerable stir : he had left the majority of his money to the establishment of " prizes to those who , during the preceding year , shall have conferred the greatest benefit to mankind " in physics , chemistry , medicine , literature and peace . family members contested the will .
others were irked at the international nature of the new prizes .
the biggest shock , however , was the peace prize .
the name nobel had been associated with explosives and weapons - not with peace . nobel 's friend and former secretary countess bertha von suttner , a vocal pacifist , is credited with having had a significant impact on the millionaire , and was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1905 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel thought hard about the ramifications of his inventions for humanity " perhaps my factories will put an end to war sooner than your congresses , " he wrote the countess in 1891 .
two-and-a-half decades before world war one , nobel could n't have foreseen just how wrong he would be . because nobel had not composed his will with the help of a lawyer nor specified how the prizes should be awarded , it took five years to sort out the details before the first nobel prize could be awarded in 1901 . in 1968 , sweden 's central bank established the sveriges riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of alfred nobel .
the five original prizes are administered by the nobel foundation in stockholm . how are the winners selected ? candidates are nominated a year in advance by qualified parties in the six relevant fields .
academics , politicians , prominent scientists , previous nobel laureates and others receive personal invitations each year to nominate a candidate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertha von suttner worked for nobel for only a few months the nominators are selected in such a way so that as many different countries as possible are represented over time .
their nominations are kept secret for 50 years . in his will , alfred nobel specifically indicated five swedish institutions responsible for choosing the prize recipients in each category . the royal swedish academy of sciences has selected the economics prize laureates since 1969 . interesting facts : * 772 individuals and 19 organizations have been awarded the nobel prize , some more than once .
thirty-four women are among the prize winners . * the youngest nobel laureate , lawrence bragg , was just 25 when he accepted the prize .
he shared the 1915 nobel prize in physics with his father . * raymond david jr . , nearly 88 when he was awarded the nobel prize in physics in 2002 , was the oldest nobel laureate . * several would-be nobel recipients either declined to accept their award or were forced to decline for political reasons . jean-paul sartre , who consistently turned down all public honors , did n't accept his 1964 nobel prize in literature .
in 1973 , le duc tho was awarded the nobel peace prize jointly with us secretary of state henry kissinger for negotiating the vietnam peace accord .
tho declined the prize due to the situation in vietnam . three german nobel laureates - richard kuhn , adolf butenandt and gerhard domagk - were forbidden by adolf hitler to accept their prizes .
they received their diplomas and medals belatedly , but not the monetary award .
in 1958 , soviet authorities forced boris pasternak to return the nobel prize in literature he had initially accepted . * four individuals have been awarded two nobel prizes : john bardeen -lrb- physics 1956 , 1972 -rrb- marie curie -lrb- physics 1903 , chemistry 1911 -rrb- linus pauling -lrb- chemistry 1954 , peace 1962 -rrb- frederick sanger -lrb- chemistry 1958 , 1980 -rrb- * the nobel peace prize has been awarded three times to the international committee of the red cross -lrb- 1917 , 1944 , 1963 -rrb- and twice to the un refugee agency -lrb- 1954 , 1981 -rrb- . * together , the curies have collected more nobel prizes than any other family .
marie curie shared half of the physics prize with her husband pierre in 1903 .
their daughter irene shared the chemistry prize with her husband frederic joliot in 1935 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de takes a look at who and what are behind one of the most prestigious awards in the world . who was alfred nobel ? alfred nobel was born in stockholm in 1833 .
together with his father , who was an engineer , he developed the explosive nitroglycerine , which proved a commercial success . despite the danger of the project - nobel 's brother emil was killed in an experiment in 1864 - he continued his research , patenting what he called dynamite in 1867 .
the invention proved very useful in the construction industry and nobel traveled the world selling his product .
when not on the road , he diligently conducted research and registered 355 patents in his name . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel was active as a chemist and physicist and pursued literature in his free time nobel 's talent as both a scientist and a businessman allowed him to amass a considerable fortune .
he was also fluent in several languages , wrote poetry and drama , and had a deep interest in philosophy and literature . how did the nobel prize come about ? after his death in 1896 , the opening of nobel 's will caused a considerable stir : he had left the majority of his money to the establishment of " prizes to those who , during the preceding year , shall have conferred the greatest benefit to mankind " in physics , chemistry , medicine , literature and peace . family members contested the will .
others were irked at the international nature of the new prizes .
the biggest shock , however , was the peace prize .
the name nobel had been associated with explosives and weapons - not with peace . nobel 's friend and former secretary countess bertha von suttner , a vocal pacifist , is credited with having had a significant impact on the millionaire , and was awarded the nobel peace prize in 1905 . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nobel thought hard about the ramifications of his inventions for humanity " perhaps my factories will put an end to war sooner than your congresses , " he wrote the countess in 1891 .
two-and-a-half decades before world war one , nobel could n't have foreseen just how wrong he would be . because nobel had not composed his will with the help of a lawyer nor specified how the prizes should be awarded , it took five years to sort out the details before the first nobel prize could be awarded in 1901 . in 1968 , sweden 's central bank established the sveriges riksbank prize in economic sciences in memory of alfred nobel .
the five original prizes are administered by the nobel foundation in stockholm . how are the winners selected ? candidates are nominated a year in advance by qualified parties in the six relevant fields .
academics , politicians , prominent scientists , previous nobel laureates and others receive personal invitations each year to nominate a candidate . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bertha von suttner worked for nobel for only a few months the nominators are selected in such a way so that as many different countries as possible are represented over time .
their nominations are kept secret for 50 years . in his will , alfred nobel specifically indicated five swedish institutions responsible for choosing the prize recipients in each category . the royal swedish academy of sciences has selected the economics prize laureates since 1969 . interesting facts : * 772 individuals and 19 organizations have been awarded the nobel prize , some more than once .
thirty-four women are among the prize winners . * the youngest nobel laureate , lawrence bragg , was just 25 when he accepted the prize .
he shared the 1915 nobel prize in physics with his father . * raymond david jr . , nearly 88 when he was awarded the nobel prize in physics in 2002 , was the oldest nobel laureate . * several would-be nobel recipients either declined to accept their award or were forced to decline for political reasons . jean-paul sartre , who consistently turned down all public honors , did n't accept his 1964 nobel prize in literature .
in 1973 , le duc tho was awarded the nobel peace prize jointly with us secretary of state henry kissinger for negotiating the vietnam peace accord .
tho declined the prize due to the situation in vietnam . three german nobel laureates - richard kuhn , adolf butenandt and gerhard domagk - were forbidden by adolf hitler to accept their prizes .
they received their diplomas and medals belatedly , but not the monetary award .
in 1958 , soviet authorities forced boris pasternak to return the nobel prize in literature he had initially accepted . * four individuals have been awarded two nobel prizes : john bardeen -lrb- physics 1956 , 1972 -rrb- marie curie -lrb- physics 1903 , chemistry 1911 -rrb- linus pauling -lrb- chemistry 1954 , peace 1962 -rrb- frederick sanger -lrb- chemistry 1958 , 1980 -rrb- * the nobel peace prize has been awarded three times to the international committee of the red cross -lrb- 1917 , 1944 , 1963 -rrb- and twice to the un refugee agency -lrb- 1954 , 1981 -rrb- . * together , the curies have collected more nobel prizes than any other family .
marie curie shared half of the physics prize with her husband pierre in 1903 .
their daughter irene shared the chemistry prize with her husband frederic joliot in 1935 . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

following the death of their baby son , alistair , who was killed by a gunman in turkey , they had become successful campaigners and agreed to support the control arms campaign .

on the day a new report reveals the cost of conflict on african development , she tells the bbc scotland news website why there should be an arms trade treaty .
when i was pregnant with my first child , the midwife told my group of first-time mothers that such would be our love for our babies that we would ' take a bullet for them ' .
eileen clarkson is from oxfam scotland the costs of armed conflict seven years later i sat and spoke to two mothers in turkana , a remote part of kenya , and heard how they had lost their children to bullets .
between them eworton amudgangi and no poeto lost seven children in one night when raiders attacked their village .
eworton and no described the noise , the screaming , the shooting and the shock of what had happened .
i travelled to turkana as part of the control arms campaign , with david and ozlem grimason , who themselves had lost a child because of firearms .
following the death of their baby son , alistair , who was killed by a gunman in turkey , they had become successful campaigners and agreed to support the control arms campaign .
during our visit we attended a local peace festival , which brought together warring turkanan and dassench factions from neighbouring ethiopia .
tension between the two groups ran high , both david and myself were asked to speak about why we were there .
assault rifles i have not given many speeches in my life , and certainly never one where members of the audience were casually holding ak-47 assault rifles .
despite the intense heat , and my nerves , i did my best .
but it was a turkanan elder who then stood up and made one of the best cases for arms control that i have ever heard .
he asked : ' why do we have guns ?
where are they coming from ?
guns are n't made around here , so how have they become part of our lives ? '
people around the world had been putting pressure on politicians to have the united nations introduce an arms trade treaty , which would make it necessary to have a licence in order to export arms .
eworton amudgangi and no poeto lost seven children in one night i had heard a number of sound intellectual arguments on the subject but it struck me that this man , from a poor and remote part of africa , could argue the case much more convincingly .
he and the people he represents live daily with guns and have to live with the consequences , which are so often tragic .
the control arms report on africa 's missing billions points out that as a result of conflict and armed violence the continent has suffered terribly not only in human terms but in economic ones as well .
like the turkanan elder , the report states most of the guns - 95 % - come from outside africa .
and it estimates that the cost of armed conflict to the poorest continent in the world is at least $ 18bn annually .
the report urges the un to make swift progress towards a strong and effective arms trade treaty -lrb- att -rrb- .
senior politicians around the world , including the defence secretary , scotland 's des browne , must keep up the pressure to ensure an att becomes a reality .
the africa 's missing billions report , like so many reports , points out that conflict disproportionally affects the most vulnerable people - women and children .
given the devastation that firearms have brought to their lives that is something eworton and no understand better than most .

in a video message he said he was " embarrassed " about the " tomfoolery " which led to tuesday 's arrest outside heathrow airport 's hilton hotel .
mr howlett , 29 , was arrested after an incident which resulted in damage to two parked cars .
he was later bailed .
the all blacks were ejected from the world cup after losing to france .
prior to saturday 's defeat , the team had been among the favourites to win the tournament .
' no intent ' in his message , the rugby player - whose bail conditions mean he will return later this month , said : " i apologise to the people back home , family and friends , the new zealand public , fans and my team-mates .
" i am working with the police at the moment to contact owners and fix what i have done wrong .
" it is an embarrassing time but i do take sole responsibility .
there was drink involved and it is not an excuse . "
he added that there had been " no intent to cause anybody or anything any harm whatsoever " .
the winger is the all-time record try scorer for the all blacks with 49 tries .
but he did not play in the pre-tournament favourites ' shock world cup quarter-final defeat against france on saturday .

according to a wildlife charity , for wales to exist within its fair share of the earth 's resources its ecological footprint must be cut by 75 % by 2050 .
but if things continue as they are wales ' footprint will increase by 30 % , wwf cymru has warned .

morgan parry , head of wwf cymru said : " it 's getting away from the idea it 's somebody else 's problem .
" all the different players have got to do their bit . "
wales ' ecological footprint - which measures the resources we use for our economy and lifestyles - is largely made up of transport 17 % , housing 21 % and food 25 % .
behind the campaign entitled " one planet wales " is a report by academics at the university of manchester .
mr parry said : " it leaves little doubt about the need to take action now , and the many challenges and opportunities ahead for change .
" one thing is clear from the report : it will take collective action to achieve the changes that are necessary to deliver a one planet wales , collective action by the welsh assembly government , local authorities , businesses , communities and individuals .
" we all have an essential role to play . "
researchers said that if everyone in the world used natural resources and generated carbon dioxide at the same rate as wales , it would take three planets to support us .
practical recommendations in the report include low-carbon sustainable buildings , standards for sustainable healthy food , and high-quality public transport .
report author joe ravetz from the centre for urban ecology at the university of manchester , said : " this report demonstrates that it is achievable for wales to move towards a one planet wales country .

details of the agreement have not yet been given but the uaw said the strike would end immediately .
uaw members at 19 of the 24 us chrysler factories walked out on wednesday after the deadline for an agreement passed .
among the issues involved was funding for a union-run trust that would handle healthcare bills for retired staff .
' rewarding success ' the uaw said the outline agreement - yet to be ratified by its members - protected their wages , pensions and health care benefits .
uaw workers made it clear to chrysler that we needed an agreement that rewards the contributions they have made to the success of this company ron gettelfinger , uaw president unions had been concerned that cerberus , chrysler 's new private equity owner , wanted to roll back existing pay deals and other benefits for 49,000 workers .
" this agreement was made possible because uaw workers made it clear to chrysler that we needed an agreement that rewards the contributions they have made to the success of this company , " said uaw president ron gettelfinger .
chrysler vice chairman tom lasorda said the accord " balanced the needs of our employees and company by providing a framework to improve our long-term manufacturing competitiveness " .
it was the first time since 1985 that chrysler workers had called a strike during contract negotiations .
the dispute follows a similar strike at gm in september , which was resolved when staff secured guarantees over working conditions .
the uaw has still to reach a settlement with ford .
restructuring loss-making chrysler was formerly part of daimlerchrysler - now renamed daimler .
the german group sold a majority 80.1 % stake in chrysler to cerberus for 7.4bn euros -lrb- $ 10.1bn ; £ 5bn -rrb- .
the separation comes almost a decade after the two firms merged in a $ 36bn deal .
chrysler - like other us firms - has faced increasing competition from more efficient japanese car firms .
in a bid to mitigate against losses , the group announced huge reorganisation plans in february that involved cutting 13,000 jobs .
