program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.04.2007 east germany ’ s former first lady turns 80 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot honecker is still an unrepentant socialist margot honecker , the reclusive widow of former east german head-of-state erich honecker , was known for her authoritarian style and rigid socialist ideology .
dw-world.de looks back at her life as she turns 80 on tuesday . margot honecker dressed elegantly and had a nice figure .
yet she was more than just a trophy wife for the president .
driven by her own ambitions and political convictions , she continually sought out positions of influence and eventually served as minister of education in communist east germany for over a quarter of a century . an unwavering believer in communism , margot honecker used her role as minister to indoctrinate the next generation .
politicized education was a method of gaining support for the repressive communist regime of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , which was then a part of the soviet bloc . “ she saw the school system as an extension of the dictatorship and many people were hurt professionally and mentally , ” said hubertus knabe , expert on former east germany and director of the berlin-hohenschönhausen memorial , which is located in what used to be a prison for political dissidents in the gdr . “ she was a bit fanatical , while erich was more bureaucratic , ” added knabe about the unpopular minister . hanging on to an impossible dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot and erich honecker at a socialist youth festival in 1973 over 17 years after the collapse of the iron curtain , margot honecker is still an unrepentant socialist . “ no one can seriously expect me to sacrifice my world view and my convictions on the altar of contemporary history , ” she said at a presentation of her book “ margot honecker on the other germany , ” which she published in 2001 together with prominent chilean socialist politician luis corvalan . the book originally appeared in chile , where margot honecker has lived in exile since 1992 .
it was a rare exception to her usual silence : after years in the political limelight , the 80-year-old now avoids public interviews and appearances . climbing the political ladder born on april 17 , 1927 in the eastern german city of halle , margot feist was a young woman when world war two ended and the soviet union gained control of eastern germany .
trained as a clerk and a telephone operator , she soon became involved in the free german youth -lrb- fdj -rrb- , a socialist organization for young people .
showing a penchant for leadership , she swiftly climbed its ranks . in 1949 , at the age of 22 , she became the youngest member of east germany ’ s parliament , the volkskammer . margot had met her future husband at fdj meetings .
erich honecker was the director of the youth organization ; he was also 15 years older and married .
when margot became pregnant and gave birth to their daughter sonja in 1952 , erich divorced his wife and he and margot married . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker was released from charges of treason due to ill health in his book “ margot honecker .
the biography , ” literary scholar ed stuhler speculated that the honeckers may have married for political reasons .
indeed , margot did not lack professional and political ambition . in communist east germany , mothers were expected to work - the state provided childcare - and margot honecker followed the party line .
in 1955 she began working at the ministry of education , rising to the top position there in 1963 . “ trained for war ” in east germany and throughout the former soviet union , political education and propaganda were crucial to securing public support for the regime and school curriculum was saturated with socialist doctrine . in 1978 , military training was introduced in the ninth and tenth grades . “ the children and youth in the gdr were trained for war , ” said hubertus knabe , “ both theoretically with textbooks and practically with weapons exercises and military manoeuvres - and that at an age where they were still very impressionable . ” “ it was a politically charged war against the class enemy , against the west , ” added knabe . on the run bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a marriage of love or politics - or both ?
after the fall of the berlin wall , erich honecker resigned as head of state in 1989 .
in march 1991 , the honeckers fled to moscow to evade charges in the federal republic of germany for cold war crimes involving the shooting deaths of east germans attempting to flee to the west . the following year , margot immigrated to chile where daughter sonja was living with her chilean husband .
chile had strong ties to communist east germany after the gdr took in thousands of chilean refugees in the mid-1970s following a bloody military coup led by augusto pinochet . the post-soviet russian government had extradited erich honecker to germany to stand trial , but he was released by german authorities in 1993 due to poor health .
he joined his wife and daughter in chile , where he died of cancer in may 1994 . questioning justice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot was more staunchly dogmatic than her husband , said gdr expert hubertus knabe in his new book “ the culprits are among us , ” which came out in germany several weeks ago , knabe argues that none of the gdr ’ s political leaders were punished .
both margot and erich honecker are prominent examples , he said . after german reunification , margot honecker was investigated for her role in cases of forced adoption involving the children of dissidents who ’ d been arrested or had fled to the west .
charges were dropped in 1994 , however , and the former minister never stood trial . knabe said he finds it particularly unfair that the german state pays out 4.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.5 billion -rrb- in pensions for the former leaders of the gdr , but only 48 million euros for the victims ’ pensions . margot honecker reportedly picks up a pension check for 1,500 euros each month at the german embassy in santiago . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de books by former gdr secret police officers spark outrage the public launch of two new books on the infamous east german stasi secret police sparked angry outbursts here on wednesday , showing that tensions still run high 17 years after the fall of the berlin wall .
-lrb- 13.04.2006 -rrb- berlin 's palace of the republic faces wrecking ball germany 's lower house has approved the demolition of one of communist east germany 's ugliest , but best-loved buildings .
the vote to tear down the palace of the republic concludes a heated debate spanning over a decade .
-lrb- 20.01.2006 -rrb- the scent of ostalgie kitsch erich honecker 's shower gel is sure to have you stepping out of the shower smelling like an old communist .
but gdr victims ' groups are incensed at the last " ostalgie " product to hit the shelves .

where do the candidates stand when it comes to brussels ? on first glance , it might appear that the french presidential candidates are slackers regarding the european union , since the bloc is hardly on the radar screens during this election season . " european topics are hardly present in the french campaign , " said henri de grossouvre , head of the european think tank forum carolus . but this eu shyness in an otherwise fairly boisterous campaign is not surprising to many observers since talk about europe is likely to score few points for the candidates vying for the presidency .
on may 29 , 2005 , french voters refused to follow the entreaties of the country 's political elite and maneuvered their country into a european dead end .
it does not appear that the french , or the candidates , are very eager to find their way back . france 's eu malaise can be partially traced to outgoing french president jacques chirac who , unlike his predecessor francois mitterrand , generally placed his own or french interests before those of the eu when it came to forging compromises with brussels .
for example , in 1998 he pushed like a bulldozer to ensure that the second president of the european central bank was a frenchman . chirac is leaving an uncertain political landscape to his potential successor , each of whom has a very different solution to the bind the eu finds itself in . sarkozy - " mini constitution " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy wants a slimmed-down treaty nicolas sarkozy , from the governing ump party , likes to talk about a slimmed-down version of the eu constitution .
if he wins the upcoming election , he would like to introduce a " simplified " eu constitution to the french parliament for consideration .
this " mini constitution " would only guarantee the smooth functioning of the 27 member states . " sarkozy has prepared everything to bring france out of its isolation , " said frank baasner , director of the french-german institute -lrb- dfi -rrb- in ludwigsburg .
sarkozy has ruled out another referendum . " the first referendum brought europe to a standstill , " baasner said .
" a second would destroy it . " royal - ready for risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : segolene royal wants to have the constitution reworked sarkozy 's socialist rival , segolene royal , is campaigning for a " new participatory style of politics , " according to daniela schwarzer , france expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . up to now , royal has held more than 5,000 public forums on various campaign themes , including european policy .
she wants to have the constitutional treaty reworked and more stress put on economic and social matters .
royal says she 's " ready to take the risk . " " in a new referendum , it will be about actually making europe the topic of the vote , " said axel schäfer , the europe expert of the social democrats ' parliamentary group .
in the 2005 referendums in france and the netherlands , many observers believe that people used the " no " vote to express their dissatisfaction with national politics and politicians .
schäfer pointed out that in france " actually a large majority are in favor of a european constitution . " bayrou - the model european ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayrou is taking the middle road francois bayrou from the centrist udf party is treading a middle line between sarkozy and royal .
he does advocate , like royal , holding a new referendum .
but he enters sarkozy territory when he calls for a " credible , simple , short document . "
in his opinion , there should be only two considerations : how decisions are made and where the citizen stands .
in the past , bayrou has been a supporter of a federal europe . but bayrou 's interest in europe policy more than just campaign rhetoric .
in light of his long advocacy for common eu institutions , he is the more credible eu proponent among the candidates , according to france expert baasner . " other eu partners would basically know where he stands , " he said . le pen - a nativist europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-marie le pen is not an eu fan jean-marie le pen from the far-right national front -lrb- fn -rrb- likes to call the eu a " fat , soft jellyfish " and , if elected , would push to see border checks re-established that were eliminated by the schengen agreement . " those who are now hauling out their dusty french flags always forget to say that they are sealing france 's end in that they will force a new constitutional treaty on the french as soon as they are elected , " said le pen 's daughter marine , who campaigns for her father , during an interview on french television .
she was referring to attempts by both sarkozy and royal to appeal to french patriotic sentiments during the current election campaign . all the candidates of the middle , sarkozy , royal and bayrou , came out in favor of the eu constitution back in 2005 .
whoever wins the upcoming election will have to explain to his or her european partners soon thereafter how and why the draft treaty should be changed . angela göpfert -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu looks on as french socialists hold presidential primaries the woman hoping to become france 's first female president says she is confident of victory in the socialist presidential primaries - but what would a royal victory mean for europe ? -lrb- 16.11.2006 -rrb- reviving the eu constitution ... or not as the current holder of the eu presidency , austria has attempted to restart debate about how the stalled eu constitution project should move forward .

dw-world.de looks back at her life as she turns 80 on tuesday . margot honecker dressed elegantly and had a nice figure .
yet she was more than just a trophy wife for the president .
driven by her own ambitions and political convictions , she continually sought out positions of influence and eventually served as minister of education in communist east germany for over a quarter of a century . an unwavering believer in communism , margot honecker used her role as minister to indoctrinate the next generation .
politicized education was a method of gaining support for the repressive communist regime of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , which was then a part of the soviet bloc . “ she saw the school system as an extension of the dictatorship and many people were hurt professionally and mentally , ” said hubertus knabe , expert on former east germany and director of the berlin-hohenschönhausen memorial , which is located in what used to be a prison for political dissidents in the gdr . “ she was a bit fanatical , while erich was more bureaucratic , ” added knabe about the unpopular minister . hanging on to an impossible dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot and erich honecker at a socialist youth festival in 1973 over 17 years after the collapse of the iron curtain , margot honecker is still an unrepentant socialist . “ no one can seriously expect me to sacrifice my world view and my convictions on the altar of contemporary history , ” she said at a presentation of her book “ margot honecker on the other germany , ” which she published in 2001 together with prominent chilean socialist politician luis corvalan . the book originally appeared in chile , where margot honecker has lived in exile since 1992 .
it was a rare exception to her usual silence : after years in the political limelight , the 80-year-old now avoids public interviews and appearances . climbing the political ladder born on april 17 , 1927 in the eastern german city of halle , margot feist was a young woman when world war two ended and the soviet union gained control of eastern germany .
trained as a clerk and a telephone operator , she soon became involved in the free german youth -lrb- fdj -rrb- , a socialist organization for young people .
showing a penchant for leadership , she swiftly climbed its ranks . in 1949 , at the age of 22 , she became the youngest member of east germany ’ s parliament , the volkskammer . margot had met her future husband at fdj meetings .
erich honecker was the director of the youth organization ; he was also 15 years older and married .
when margot became pregnant and gave birth to their daughter sonja in 1952 , erich divorced his wife and he and margot married . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker was released from charges of treason due to ill health in his book “ margot honecker .
the biography , ” literary scholar ed stuhler speculated that the honeckers may have married for political reasons .
indeed , margot did not lack professional and political ambition . in communist east germany , mothers were expected to work - the state provided childcare - and margot honecker followed the party line .
in 1955 she began working at the ministry of education , rising to the top position there in 1963 . “ trained for war ” in east germany and throughout the former soviet union , political education and propaganda were crucial to securing public support for the regime and school curriculum was saturated with socialist doctrine . in 1978 , military training was introduced in the ninth and tenth grades . “ the children and youth in the gdr were trained for war , ” said hubertus knabe , “ both theoretically with textbooks and practically with weapons exercises and military manoeuvres - and that at an age where they were still very impressionable . ” “ it was a politically charged war against the class enemy , against the west , ” added knabe . on the run bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a marriage of love or politics - or both ?
after the fall of the berlin wall , erich honecker resigned as head of state in 1989 .
in march 1991 , the honeckers fled to moscow to evade charges in the federal republic of germany for cold war crimes involving the shooting deaths of east germans attempting to flee to the west . the following year , margot immigrated to chile where daughter sonja was living with her chilean husband .
chile had strong ties to communist east germany after the gdr took in thousands of chilean refugees in the mid-1970s following a bloody military coup led by augusto pinochet . the post-soviet russian government had extradited erich honecker to germany to stand trial , but he was released by german authorities in 1993 due to poor health .
he joined his wife and daughter in chile , where he died of cancer in may 1994 . questioning justice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot was more staunchly dogmatic than her husband , said gdr expert hubertus knabe in his new book “ the culprits are among us , ” which came out in germany several weeks ago , knabe argues that none of the gdr ’ s political leaders were punished .
both margot and erich honecker are prominent examples , he said . after german reunification , margot honecker was investigated for her role in cases of forced adoption involving the children of dissidents who ’ d been arrested or had fled to the west .
charges were dropped in 1994 , however , and the former minister never stood trial . knabe said he finds it particularly unfair that the german state pays out 4.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.5 billion -rrb- in pensions for the former leaders of the gdr , but only 48 million euros for the victims ’ pensions . margot honecker reportedly picks up a pension check for 1,500 euros each month at the german embassy in santiago . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de books by former gdr secret police officers spark outrage the public launch of two new books on the infamous east german stasi secret police sparked angry outbursts here on wednesday , showing that tensions still run high 17 years after the fall of the berlin wall .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : france 's next president : sarko vs. sego police , protesters battle after sarkozy win sarkozy favored as french elect new president conservative sarkozy is france 's next president as election nears , french duo fight to a draw in last debate europe -pipe- 17.04.2007 europe on the back burner in french election campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's " no " to the proposed eu constitution hit europe hard france 's " non " vote to the eu constitution in 2005 has made the subject of europe a political hot potato in the presidential campaign .
where do the candidates stand when it comes to brussels ? on first glance , it might appear that the french presidential candidates are slackers regarding the european union , since the bloc is hardly on the radar screens during this election season . " european topics are hardly present in the french campaign , " said henri de grossouvre , head of the european think tank forum carolus . but this eu shyness in an otherwise fairly boisterous campaign is not surprising to many observers since talk about europe is likely to score few points for the candidates vying for the presidency .
on may 29 , 2005 , french voters refused to follow the entreaties of the country 's political elite and maneuvered their country into a european dead end .
it does not appear that the french , or the candidates , are very eager to find their way back . france 's eu malaise can be partially traced to outgoing french president jacques chirac who , unlike his predecessor francois mitterrand , generally placed his own or french interests before those of the eu when it came to forging compromises with brussels .
for example , in 1998 he pushed like a bulldozer to ensure that the second president of the european central bank was a frenchman . chirac is leaving an uncertain political landscape to his potential successor , each of whom has a very different solution to the bind the eu finds itself in . sarkozy - " mini constitution " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy wants a slimmed-down treaty nicolas sarkozy , from the governing ump party , likes to talk about a slimmed-down version of the eu constitution .
if he wins the upcoming election , he would like to introduce a " simplified " eu constitution to the french parliament for consideration .
this " mini constitution " would only guarantee the smooth functioning of the 27 member states . " sarkozy has prepared everything to bring france out of its isolation , " said frank baasner , director of the french-german institute -lrb- dfi -rrb- in ludwigsburg .
sarkozy has ruled out another referendum . " the first referendum brought europe to a standstill , " baasner said .
" a second would destroy it . " royal - ready for risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : segolene royal wants to have the constitution reworked sarkozy 's socialist rival , segolene royal , is campaigning for a " new participatory style of politics , " according to daniela schwarzer , france expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . up to now , royal has held more than 5,000 public forums on various campaign themes , including european policy .
she wants to have the constitutional treaty reworked and more stress put on economic and social matters .
royal says she 's " ready to take the risk . " " in a new referendum , it will be about actually making europe the topic of the vote , " said axel schäfer , the europe expert of the social democrats ' parliamentary group .
in the 2005 referendums in france and the netherlands , many observers believe that people used the " no " vote to express their dissatisfaction with national politics and politicians .
schäfer pointed out that in france " actually a large majority are in favor of a european constitution . " bayrou - the model european ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayrou is taking the middle road francois bayrou from the centrist udf party is treading a middle line between sarkozy and royal .
he does advocate , like royal , holding a new referendum .
but he enters sarkozy territory when he calls for a " credible , simple , short document . "
in his opinion , there should be only two considerations : how decisions are made and where the citizen stands .
in the past , bayrou has been a supporter of a federal europe . but bayrou 's interest in europe policy more than just campaign rhetoric .
in light of his long advocacy for common eu institutions , he is the more credible eu proponent among the candidates , according to france expert baasner . " other eu partners would basically know where he stands , " he said . le pen - a nativist europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-marie le pen is not an eu fan jean-marie le pen from the far-right national front -lrb- fn -rrb- likes to call the eu a " fat , soft jellyfish " and , if elected , would push to see border checks re-established that were eliminated by the schengen agreement . " those who are now hauling out their dusty french flags always forget to say that they are sealing france 's end in that they will force a new constitutional treaty on the french as soon as they are elected , " said le pen 's daughter marine , who campaigns for her father , during an interview on french television .
she was referring to attempts by both sarkozy and royal to appeal to french patriotic sentiments during the current election campaign . all the candidates of the middle , sarkozy , royal and bayrou , came out in favor of the eu constitution back in 2005 .
whoever wins the upcoming election will have to explain to his or her european partners soon thereafter how and why the draft treaty should be changed . angela göpfert -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu looks on as french socialists hold presidential primaries the woman hoping to become france 's first female president says she is confident of victory in the socialist presidential primaries - but what would a royal victory mean for europe ? -lrb- 16.11.2006 -rrb- reviving the eu constitution ... or not as the current holder of the eu presidency , austria has attempted to restart debate about how the stalled eu constitution project should move forward .

now he 's saved his political skin by backing down from his original statement . günther oettinger appears to have made a narrow escape . in a eulogy on april 11 for hans filbinger , a former baden-württemberg state premier and a military judge during the third reich , oettinger praised his predecessor as an opponent of the nazi regime .
in fact , as a judge , filbinger personally signed death sentences for soldiers deserting hitler 's army late in world war ii . the eulogy attracted massive criticism from jewish groups , social democrats and even conservative chancellor angela merkel .
after initially sticking by his eulogy , oettinger decided on monday to smooth the waves . in a statement , oettinger said , " i do not stand by my choice of words .
on the contrary , i distance myself from them . " in the nick of time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a former german soldier with a death sentence issued against him for desertion oettinger 's retreat came only one day before archivists in baden-württemberg uncovered filbinger 's nazi party membership card - ending any questions as to whether he was a nazi supporter . filbinger was forced to resign from the office of state premier in 1978 , after playwright rolf hochhuth published a play dealing with his activities during the third reich . the baden württemberg chapter of the conservative christian democrats had defended filbinger 's record .
but with oettinger 's announcement , that policy would seem to be a thing of the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans filbinger died on april 1 , 2007 after oettinger 's announcement , hochhuth said it was time to end the discussions .
" it is absurd , " hochhuth told the daily bild newspaper , " to call for oettinger 's resignation .
he 's seen the error of his ways and apologized .
that 's the end of the matter . " the chairman of the social democrats , kurt beck , also said he considered the debate to be over . while acknowledging that oettinger 's retraction had probably saved his career , most german newspapers said that his political reputation had been seriously damaged .
" oettinger got it all wrong , " wrote berlin 's tagesspiegel , " and indeed in every respect . " meanwhile , angela merkel is drawing praise for forcing her conservative colleague to back down from his controversial statements . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel scolds state premier for defending ex-nazi german chancellor angela merkel sharply criticized a fellow conservative on friday for " whitewashing " the nazi past of his predecessor , the former leader of a powerful southern german state .

where do the candidates stand when it comes to brussels ? on first glance , it might appear that the french presidential candidates are slackers regarding the european union , since the bloc is hardly on the radar screens during this election season . " european topics are hardly present in the french campaign , " said henri de grossouvre , head of the european think tank forum carolus . but this eu shyness in an otherwise fairly boisterous campaign is not surprising to many observers since talk about europe is likely to score few points for the candidates vying for the presidency .
on may 29 , 2005 , french voters refused to follow the entreaties of the country 's political elite and maneuvered their country into a european dead end .
it does not appear that the french , or the candidates , are very eager to find their way back . france 's eu malaise can be partially traced to outgoing french president jacques chirac who , unlike his predecessor francois mitterrand , generally placed his own or french interests before those of the eu when it came to forging compromises with brussels .
for example , in 1998 he pushed like a bulldozer to ensure that the second president of the european central bank was a frenchman . chirac is leaving an uncertain political landscape to his potential successor , each of whom has a very different solution to the bind the eu finds itself in . sarkozy - " mini constitution " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy wants a slimmed-down treaty nicolas sarkozy , from the governing ump party , likes to talk about a slimmed-down version of the eu constitution .
if he wins the upcoming election , he would like to introduce a " simplified " eu constitution to the french parliament for consideration .
this " mini constitution " would only guarantee the smooth functioning of the 27 member states . " sarkozy has prepared everything to bring france out of its isolation , " said frank baasner , director of the french-german institute -lrb- dfi -rrb- in ludwigsburg .
sarkozy has ruled out another referendum . " the first referendum brought europe to a standstill , " baasner said .
" a second would destroy it . " royal - ready for risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : segolene royal wants to have the constitution reworked sarkozy 's socialist rival , segolene royal , is campaigning for a " new participatory style of politics , " according to daniela schwarzer , france expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . up to now , royal has held more than 5,000 public forums on various campaign themes , including european policy .
she wants to have the constitutional treaty reworked and more stress put on economic and social matters .
royal says she 's " ready to take the risk . " " in a new referendum , it will be about actually making europe the topic of the vote , " said axel schäfer , the europe expert of the social democrats ' parliamentary group .
in the 2005 referendums in france and the netherlands , many observers believe that people used the " no " vote to express their dissatisfaction with national politics and politicians .
schäfer pointed out that in france " actually a large majority are in favor of a european constitution . " bayrou - the model european ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayrou is taking the middle road francois bayrou from the centrist udf party is treading a middle line between sarkozy and royal .
he does advocate , like royal , holding a new referendum .
but he enters sarkozy territory when he calls for a " credible , simple , short document . "
in his opinion , there should be only two considerations : how decisions are made and where the citizen stands .
in the past , bayrou has been a supporter of a federal europe . but bayrou 's interest in europe policy more than just campaign rhetoric .
in light of his long advocacy for common eu institutions , he is the more credible eu proponent among the candidates , according to france expert baasner . " other eu partners would basically know where he stands , " he said . le pen - a nativist europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-marie le pen is not an eu fan jean-marie le pen from the far-right national front -lrb- fn -rrb- likes to call the eu a " fat , soft jellyfish " and , if elected , would push to see border checks re-established that were eliminated by the schengen agreement . " those who are now hauling out their dusty french flags always forget to say that they are sealing france 's end in that they will force a new constitutional treaty on the french as soon as they are elected , " said le pen 's daughter marine , who campaigns for her father , during an interview on french television .
she was referring to attempts by both sarkozy and royal to appeal to french patriotic sentiments during the current election campaign . all the candidates of the middle , sarkozy , royal and bayrou , came out in favor of the eu constitution back in 2005 .
whoever wins the upcoming election will have to explain to his or her european partners soon thereafter how and why the draft treaty should be changed . angela göpfert -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu looks on as french socialists hold presidential primaries the woman hoping to become france 's first female president says she is confident of victory in the socialist presidential primaries - but what would a royal victory mean for europe ? -lrb- 16.11.2006 -rrb- reviving the eu constitution ... or not as the current holder of the eu presidency , austria has attempted to restart debate about how the stalled eu constitution project should move forward .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.04.2007 east germany ’ s former first lady turns 80 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot honecker is still an unrepentant socialist margot honecker , the reclusive widow of former east german head-of-state erich honecker , was known for her authoritarian style and rigid socialist ideology .
dw-world.de looks back at her life as she turns 80 on tuesday . margot honecker dressed elegantly and had a nice figure .
yet she was more than just a trophy wife for the president .
driven by her own ambitions and political convictions , she continually sought out positions of influence and eventually served as minister of education in communist east germany for over a quarter of a century . an unwavering believer in communism , margot honecker used her role as minister to indoctrinate the next generation .
politicized education was a method of gaining support for the repressive communist regime of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , which was then a part of the soviet bloc . “ she saw the school system as an extension of the dictatorship and many people were hurt professionally and mentally , ” said hubertus knabe , expert on former east germany and director of the berlin-hohenschönhausen memorial , which is located in what used to be a prison for political dissidents in the gdr . “ she was a bit fanatical , while erich was more bureaucratic , ” added knabe about the unpopular minister . hanging on to an impossible dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot and erich honecker at a socialist youth festival in 1973 over 17 years after the collapse of the iron curtain , margot honecker is still an unrepentant socialist . “ no one can seriously expect me to sacrifice my world view and my convictions on the altar of contemporary history , ” she said at a presentation of her book “ margot honecker on the other germany , ” which she published in 2001 together with prominent chilean socialist politician luis corvalan . the book originally appeared in chile , where margot honecker has lived in exile since 1992 .
it was a rare exception to her usual silence : after years in the political limelight , the 80-year-old now avoids public interviews and appearances . climbing the political ladder born on april 17 , 1927 in the eastern german city of halle , margot feist was a young woman when world war two ended and the soviet union gained control of eastern germany .
trained as a clerk and a telephone operator , she soon became involved in the free german youth -lrb- fdj -rrb- , a socialist organization for young people .
showing a penchant for leadership , she swiftly climbed its ranks . in 1949 , at the age of 22 , she became the youngest member of east germany ’ s parliament , the volkskammer . margot had met her future husband at fdj meetings .
erich honecker was the director of the youth organization ; he was also 15 years older and married .
when margot became pregnant and gave birth to their daughter sonja in 1952 , erich divorced his wife and he and margot married . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker was released from charges of treason due to ill health in his book “ margot honecker .
the biography , ” literary scholar ed stuhler speculated that the honeckers may have married for political reasons .
indeed , margot did not lack professional and political ambition . in communist east germany , mothers were expected to work - the state provided childcare - and margot honecker followed the party line .
in 1955 she began working at the ministry of education , rising to the top position there in 1963 . “ trained for war ” in east germany and throughout the former soviet union , political education and propaganda were crucial to securing public support for the regime and school curriculum was saturated with socialist doctrine . in 1978 , military training was introduced in the ninth and tenth grades . “ the children and youth in the gdr were trained for war , ” said hubertus knabe , “ both theoretically with textbooks and practically with weapons exercises and military manoeuvres - and that at an age where they were still very impressionable . ” “ it was a politically charged war against the class enemy , against the west , ” added knabe . on the run bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a marriage of love or politics - or both ?
after the fall of the berlin wall , erich honecker resigned as head of state in 1989 .
in march 1991 , the honeckers fled to moscow to evade charges in the federal republic of germany for cold war crimes involving the shooting deaths of east germans attempting to flee to the west . the following year , margot immigrated to chile where daughter sonja was living with her chilean husband .
chile had strong ties to communist east germany after the gdr took in thousands of chilean refugees in the mid-1970s following a bloody military coup led by augusto pinochet . the post-soviet russian government had extradited erich honecker to germany to stand trial , but he was released by german authorities in 1993 due to poor health .
he joined his wife and daughter in chile , where he died of cancer in may 1994 . questioning justice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot was more staunchly dogmatic than her husband , said gdr expert hubertus knabe in his new book “ the culprits are among us , ” which came out in germany several weeks ago , knabe argues that none of the gdr ’ s political leaders were punished .
both margot and erich honecker are prominent examples , he said . after german reunification , margot honecker was investigated for her role in cases of forced adoption involving the children of dissidents who ’ d been arrested or had fled to the west .
charges were dropped in 1994 , however , and the former minister never stood trial . knabe said he finds it particularly unfair that the german state pays out 4.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.5 billion -rrb- in pensions for the former leaders of the gdr , but only 48 million euros for the victims ’ pensions . margot honecker reportedly picks up a pension check for 1,500 euros each month at the german embassy in santiago . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de books by former gdr secret police officers spark outrage the public launch of two new books on the infamous east german stasi secret police sparked angry outbursts here on wednesday , showing that tensions still run high 17 years after the fall of the berlin wall .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.04.2007 europe offers condolences for us university shooting victims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university shooting incident was the worst of its kind in us history the deadliest shooting rampage in us history , which left 32 dead at an american university , sent shudders around the world tuesday , setting off shock and sympathy along with questions over gun control in the usa . as the scope of the tragedy became clear , german chancellor angela merkel , who currently holds the european union 's rotating presidency , expressed her sympathy to us president george w. bush and the american people . the leaders of her two coalition partners followed suit .
kurt beck said he had experienced the events of april 16 at virginia tech university in the town of blacksburg with " terrible sorrow . "
edmund stoiber , the head of the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democrats , said the fact that more than 30 people could be " mowed down " was " beyond what is humanly imaginable . " french president jacques chirac also said he was " horrified and concerned " at the killings and expressed france 's complete solidarity with the us . police have identified 23-year-old cho seung-hui , a south korean studying at the university , as the gunman responsible for at least 30 of the deaths .
police also said one of two guns recovered was used in both of the two separate shooting incidents at the campus on monday - the first in a student dormitory and the second in a building used for lectures .
cho subsequently killed himself . " only the names change " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder why police could n't stop the killer before a second set of murders but as europeans were articulating their sympathy for the victims and their families , some raised the perennial issue of easy availability of firearms in the united states . beck said that while school attacks were not necessarily unpreventable , laws could be beefed up to " at least hinder or restrict " access to " certain forms of weaponry . " european newspapers were more direct in their criticism .
the spanish daily el pais expressed doubt that the blacksburg tragedy would lead to a change in availability of weapons . gerard baker , united states editor for the times of london , cited the long list of school shootings in the us in an editorial for that publication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : virginia tech students are grieving the gunman 's victims " it 's so familiar you could write the script yourself , " he commented .
" only the names change - jonesboro , columbine , lancaster county and now virginia tech .
and the numbers . " the vast majority of european bloggers have also expressed incredulity that america has refused to limit access to guns in reactions to such mass shootings .
although similar events have taken place in europe , including a high-school massacre in the german city of erfurt in 2002 , a disproportionate number of them happen in the us . us president bush expressed his horror and sympathy with the victims on monday .
a short time later , his press spokesperson said , " the president believes that there is a right for people to bear arms , but that all laws must be followed . " ongoing investigations and mounting criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the massacre has many europeans shaking their heads at us gun laws on tuesday , authorities in and around the university continued to reconstruct what had happened . some virginia tech students and others involved have questioned why police and university authorities issued no general warning between the first set of shootings in the dormitory and those in the lecture building , which happened some two hours later . there has been no substantiation for rumors that a second gunman may have been involved in the attacks . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de missing teenage suspect in school shooting alert found dead an 18-year-old german teenager who had gone missing has been found dead in the woods near his home .
his disappearance had sparked a manhunt and security alerts at three high schools in south-west germany on wednesday .

" we are determined to find a democratic resolution to the parliamentary crisis in ukraine , " he told reporters in brussels , after talks with european commission chief jose manuel barroso . " we 've never been saying and never -lrb- been -rrb- crudely speaking about any option with using force to resolve the situation , " yushchenko said . the ukrainian president said he would respect any decision taken by his country 's constitutional court , which on tuesday opened a hearing into yushchenko 's standoff with yanukovych over the president 's decision to dissolve parliament and call early elections . " a serious political crisis " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's parliament was dissolved two weeks ago for his part , pro-russian yanukovych , who rejects the decree , is due tuesday to address the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe , a continent-wide rights body , in the french city of strasbourg . barroso called the situation in ukraine " a serious political crisis , " but appealed to both sides to find a negotiated solution . " we hope this political crisis is solved according to the rules of democracy , " barroso said , adding that he was " more confident " a lawful and democratic solution could be found after his talks with yushchenko . yushchenko has defended his two-week-old decree , having originally dissolved ukraine 's assembly after accusing yanukovych of trying to steal his supporters for the government 's coalition . yanukovych and his majority in the 450-seat parliament have defied the order and appealed to the court to resolve the matter . legal or not ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : week-long protests have been held in kiev the constitutional court in kiev on tuesday began proceedings determine whether yushchenko 's decision two weeks ago to dissolve parliament was legal ; yanukovych claims it was not . last week , five of the court 's 18 judges complained that they had come under " gross pressure " from the prime minister 's parliamentary majority and demanded protection by bodyguards .
a ruling from the court could take as long as a month . both sides have pledged to abide by the constitutional court ruling , but many officials say such a decision would broaden divisions and suggest a negotiated settlement could obviate legal action . both the president and prime minister have called for a political deal to resolve the crisis , possibly by postponing the may 27 parliamentary election laid down in yushchenko 's decree , a move that has also been suggested by european officials , including an eu envoy in kiev last week . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine gripped by stalemate as eu waits for compromise rival demonstrators rallied in the ukrainian capital wednesday as defiant prime minister viktor yanukovych rejected a possible concession by his political enemy , president viktor yushchenko .

" we are determined to find a democratic resolution to the parliamentary crisis in ukraine , " he told reporters in brussels , after talks with european commission chief jose manuel barroso . " we 've never been saying and never -lrb- been -rrb- crudely speaking about any option with using force to resolve the situation , " yushchenko said . the ukrainian president said he would respect any decision taken by his country 's constitutional court , which on tuesday opened a hearing into yushchenko 's standoff with yanukovych over the president 's decision to dissolve parliament and call early elections . " a serious political crisis " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's parliament was dissolved two weeks ago for his part , pro-russian yanukovych , who rejects the decree , is due tuesday to address the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe , a continent-wide rights body , in the french city of strasbourg . barroso called the situation in ukraine " a serious political crisis , " but appealed to both sides to find a negotiated solution . " we hope this political crisis is solved according to the rules of democracy , " barroso said , adding that he was " more confident " a lawful and democratic solution could be found after his talks with yushchenko . yushchenko has defended his two-week-old decree , having originally dissolved ukraine 's assembly after accusing yanukovych of trying to steal his supporters for the government 's coalition . yanukovych and his majority in the 450-seat parliament have defied the order and appealed to the court to resolve the matter . legal or not ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : week-long protests have been held in kiev the constitutional court in kiev on tuesday began proceedings determine whether yushchenko 's decision two weeks ago to dissolve parliament was legal ; yanukovych claims it was not . last week , five of the court 's 18 judges complained that they had come under " gross pressure " from the prime minister 's parliamentary majority and demanded protection by bodyguards .
a ruling from the court could take as long as a month . both sides have pledged to abide by the constitutional court ruling , but many officials say such a decision would broaden divisions and suggest a negotiated settlement could obviate legal action . both the president and prime minister have called for a political deal to resolve the crisis , possibly by postponing the may 27 parliamentary election laid down in yushchenko 's decree , a move that has also been suggested by european officials , including an eu envoy in kiev last week . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine gripped by stalemate as eu waits for compromise rival demonstrators rallied in the ukrainian capital wednesday as defiant prime minister viktor yanukovych rejected a possible concession by his political enemy , president viktor yushchenko .

" we are determined to find a democratic resolution to the parliamentary crisis in ukraine , " he told reporters in brussels , after talks with european commission chief jose manuel barroso . " we 've never been saying and never -lrb- been -rrb- crudely speaking about any option with using force to resolve the situation , " yushchenko said . the ukrainian president said he would respect any decision taken by his country 's constitutional court , which on tuesday opened a hearing into yushchenko 's standoff with yanukovych over the president 's decision to dissolve parliament and call early elections . " a serious political crisis " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's parliament was dissolved two weeks ago for his part , pro-russian yanukovych , who rejects the decree , is due tuesday to address the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe , a continent-wide rights body , in the french city of strasbourg . barroso called the situation in ukraine " a serious political crisis , " but appealed to both sides to find a negotiated solution . " we hope this political crisis is solved according to the rules of democracy , " barroso said , adding that he was " more confident " a lawful and democratic solution could be found after his talks with yushchenko . yushchenko has defended his two-week-old decree , having originally dissolved ukraine 's assembly after accusing yanukovych of trying to steal his supporters for the government 's coalition . yanukovych and his majority in the 450-seat parliament have defied the order and appealed to the court to resolve the matter . legal or not ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : week-long protests have been held in kiev the constitutional court in kiev on tuesday began proceedings determine whether yushchenko 's decision two weeks ago to dissolve parliament was legal ; yanukovych claims it was not . last week , five of the court 's 18 judges complained that they had come under " gross pressure " from the prime minister 's parliamentary majority and demanded protection by bodyguards .
a ruling from the court could take as long as a month . both sides have pledged to abide by the constitutional court ruling , but many officials say such a decision would broaden divisions and suggest a negotiated settlement could obviate legal action . both the president and prime minister have called for a political deal to resolve the crisis , possibly by postponing the may 27 parliamentary election laid down in yushchenko 's decree , a move that has also been suggested by european officials , including an eu envoy in kiev last week . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine gripped by stalemate as eu waits for compromise rival demonstrators rallied in the ukrainian capital wednesday as defiant prime minister viktor yanukovych rejected a possible concession by his political enemy , president viktor yushchenko .

now he 's saved his political skin by backing down from his original statement . günther oettinger appears to have made a narrow escape . in a eulogy on april 11 for hans filbinger , a former baden-württemberg state premier and a military judge during the third reich , oettinger praised his predecessor as an opponent of the nazi regime .
in fact , as a judge , filbinger personally signed death sentences for soldiers deserting hitler 's army late in world war ii . the eulogy attracted massive criticism from jewish groups , social democrats and even conservative chancellor angela merkel .
after initially sticking by his eulogy , oettinger decided on monday to smooth the waves . in a statement , oettinger said , " i do not stand by my choice of words .
on the contrary , i distance myself from them . " in the nick of time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a former german soldier with a death sentence issued against him for desertion oettinger 's retreat came only one day before archivists in baden-württemberg uncovered filbinger 's nazi party membership card - ending any questions as to whether he was a nazi supporter . filbinger was forced to resign from the office of state premier in 1978 , after playwright rolf hochhuth published a play dealing with his activities during the third reich . the baden württemberg chapter of the conservative christian democrats had defended filbinger 's record .
but with oettinger 's announcement , that policy would seem to be a thing of the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans filbinger died on april 1 , 2007 after oettinger 's announcement , hochhuth said it was time to end the discussions .
" it is absurd , " hochhuth told the daily bild newspaper , " to call for oettinger 's resignation .
he 's seen the error of his ways and apologized .
that 's the end of the matter . " the chairman of the social democrats , kurt beck , also said he considered the debate to be over . while acknowledging that oettinger 's retraction had probably saved his career , most german newspapers said that his political reputation had been seriously damaged .
" oettinger got it all wrong , " wrote berlin 's tagesspiegel , " and indeed in every respect . " meanwhile , angela merkel is drawing praise for forcing her conservative colleague to back down from his controversial statements . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel scolds state premier for defending ex-nazi german chancellor angela merkel sharply criticized a fellow conservative on friday for " whitewashing " the nazi past of his predecessor , the former leader of a powerful southern german state .

now he 's saved his political skin by backing down from his original statement . günther oettinger appears to have made a narrow escape . in a eulogy on april 11 for hans filbinger , a former baden-württemberg state premier and a military judge during the third reich , oettinger praised his predecessor as an opponent of the nazi regime .
in fact , as a judge , filbinger personally signed death sentences for soldiers deserting hitler 's army late in world war ii . the eulogy attracted massive criticism from jewish groups , social democrats and even conservative chancellor angela merkel .
after initially sticking by his eulogy , oettinger decided on monday to smooth the waves . in a statement , oettinger said , " i do not stand by my choice of words .
on the contrary , i distance myself from them . " in the nick of time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a former german soldier with a death sentence issued against him for desertion oettinger 's retreat came only one day before archivists in baden-württemberg uncovered filbinger 's nazi party membership card - ending any questions as to whether he was a nazi supporter . filbinger was forced to resign from the office of state premier in 1978 , after playwright rolf hochhuth published a play dealing with his activities during the third reich . the baden württemberg chapter of the conservative christian democrats had defended filbinger 's record .
but with oettinger 's announcement , that policy would seem to be a thing of the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans filbinger died on april 1 , 2007 after oettinger 's announcement , hochhuth said it was time to end the discussions .
" it is absurd , " hochhuth told the daily bild newspaper , " to call for oettinger 's resignation .
he 's seen the error of his ways and apologized .
that 's the end of the matter . " the chairman of the social democrats , kurt beck , also said he considered the debate to be over . while acknowledging that oettinger 's retraction had probably saved his career , most german newspapers said that his political reputation had been seriously damaged .
" oettinger got it all wrong , " wrote berlin 's tagesspiegel , " and indeed in every respect . " meanwhile , angela merkel is drawing praise for forcing her conservative colleague to back down from his controversial statements . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel scolds state premier for defending ex-nazi german chancellor angela merkel sharply criticized a fellow conservative on friday for " whitewashing " the nazi past of his predecessor , the former leader of a powerful southern german state .

driven by her own ambitions and political convictions , she continually sought out positions of influence and eventually served as minister of education in communist east germany for over a quarter of a century . an unwavering believer in communism , margot honecker used her role as minister to indoctrinate the next generation .
politicized education was a method of gaining support for the repressive communist regime of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , which was then a part of the soviet bloc . “ she saw the school system as an extension of the dictatorship and many people were hurt professionally and mentally , ” said hubertus knabe , expert on former east germany and director of the berlin-hohenschönhausen memorial , which is located in what used to be a prison for political dissidents in the gdr . “ she was a bit fanatical , while erich was more bureaucratic , ” added knabe about the unpopular minister . hanging on to an impossible dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot and erich honecker at a socialist youth festival in 1973 over 17 years after the collapse of the iron curtain , margot honecker is still an unrepentant socialist . “ no one can seriously expect me to sacrifice my world view and my convictions on the altar of contemporary history , ” she said at a presentation of her book “ margot honecker on the other germany , ” which she published in 2001 together with prominent chilean socialist politician luis corvalan . the book originally appeared in chile , where margot honecker has lived in exile since 1992 .
it was a rare exception to her usual silence : after years in the political limelight , the 80-year-old now avoids public interviews and appearances . climbing the political ladder born on april 17 , 1927 in the eastern german city of halle , margot feist was a young woman when world war two ended and the soviet union gained control of eastern germany .

chile had strong ties to communist east germany after the gdr took in thousands of chilean refugees in the mid-1970s following a bloody military coup led by augusto pinochet . the post-soviet russian government had extradited erich honecker to germany to stand trial , but he was released by german authorities in 1993 due to poor health .

both margot and erich honecker are prominent examples , he said . after german reunification , margot honecker was investigated for her role in cases of forced adoption involving the children of dissidents who ’ d been arrested or had fled to the west .
charges were dropped in 1994 , however , and the former minister never stood trial . knabe said he finds it particularly unfair that the german state pays out 4.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.5 billion -rrb- in pensions for the former leaders of the gdr , but only 48 million euros for the victims ’ pensions . margot honecker reportedly picks up a pension check for 1,500 euros each month at the german embassy in santiago . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de books by former gdr secret police officers spark outrage the public launch of two new books on the infamous east german stasi secret police sparked angry outbursts here on wednesday , showing that tensions still run high 17 years after the fall of the berlin wall .

after the fall of the berlin wall , erich honecker resigned as head of state in 1989 .
in march 1991 , the honeckers fled to moscow to evade charges in the federal republic of germany for cold war crimes involving the shooting deaths of east germans attempting to flee to the west . the following year , margot immigrated to chile where daughter sonja was living with her chilean husband .
chile had strong ties to communist east germany after the gdr took in thousands of chilean refugees in the mid-1970s following a bloody military coup led by augusto pinochet . the post-soviet russian government had extradited erich honecker to germany to stand trial , but he was released by german authorities in 1993 due to poor health .

both margot and erich honecker are prominent examples , he said . after german reunification , margot honecker was investigated for her role in cases of forced adoption involving the children of dissidents who ’ d been arrested or had fled to the west .
charges were dropped in 1994 , however , and the former minister never stood trial . knabe said he finds it particularly unfair that the german state pays out 4.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.5 billion -rrb- in pensions for the former leaders of the gdr , but only 48 million euros for the victims ’ pensions . margot honecker reportedly picks up a pension check for 1,500 euros each month at the german embassy in santiago . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de books by former gdr secret police officers spark outrage the public launch of two new books on the infamous east german stasi secret police sparked angry outbursts here on wednesday , showing that tensions still run high 17 years after the fall of the berlin wall .

dw-world.de looks back at her life as she turns 80 on tuesday . margot honecker dressed elegantly and had a nice figure .
yet she was more than just a trophy wife for the president .
driven by her own ambitions and political convictions , she continually sought out positions of influence and eventually served as minister of education in communist east germany for over a quarter of a century . an unwavering believer in communism , margot honecker used her role as minister to indoctrinate the next generation .
politicized education was a method of gaining support for the repressive communist regime of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , which was then a part of the soviet bloc . “ she saw the school system as an extension of the dictatorship and many people were hurt professionally and mentally , ” said hubertus knabe , expert on former east germany and director of the berlin-hohenschönhausen memorial , which is located in what used to be a prison for political dissidents in the gdr . “ she was a bit fanatical , while erich was more bureaucratic , ” added knabe about the unpopular minister . hanging on to an impossible dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot and erich honecker at a socialist youth festival in 1973 over 17 years after the collapse of the iron curtain , margot honecker is still an unrepentant socialist . “ no one can seriously expect me to sacrifice my world view and my convictions on the altar of contemporary history , ” she said at a presentation of her book “ margot honecker on the other germany , ” which she published in 2001 together with prominent chilean socialist politician luis corvalan . the book originally appeared in chile , where margot honecker has lived in exile since 1992 .
it was a rare exception to her usual silence : after years in the political limelight , the 80-year-old now avoids public interviews and appearances . climbing the political ladder born on april 17 , 1927 in the eastern german city of halle , margot feist was a young woman when world war two ended and the soviet union gained control of eastern germany .
trained as a clerk and a telephone operator , she soon became involved in the free german youth -lrb- fdj -rrb- , a socialist organization for young people .
showing a penchant for leadership , she swiftly climbed its ranks . in 1949 , at the age of 22 , she became the youngest member of east germany ’ s parliament , the volkskammer . margot had met her future husband at fdj meetings .
erich honecker was the director of the youth organization ; he was also 15 years older and married .
when margot became pregnant and gave birth to their daughter sonja in 1952 , erich divorced his wife and he and margot married . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker was released from charges of treason due to ill health in his book “ margot honecker .
the biography , ” literary scholar ed stuhler speculated that the honeckers may have married for political reasons .

kurt beck said he had experienced the events of april 16 at virginia tech university in the town of blacksburg with " terrible sorrow . "
edmund stoiber , the head of the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democrats , said the fact that more than 30 people could be " mowed down " was " beyond what is humanly imaginable . " french president jacques chirac also said he was " horrified and concerned " at the killings and expressed france 's complete solidarity with the us . police have identified 23-year-old cho seung-hui , a south korean studying at the university , as the gunman responsible for at least 30 of the deaths .
police also said one of two guns recovered was used in both of the two separate shooting incidents at the campus on monday - the first in a student dormitory and the second in a building used for lectures .
cho subsequently killed himself . " only the names change " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder why police could n't stop the killer before a second set of murders but as europeans were articulating their sympathy for the victims and their families , some raised the perennial issue of easy availability of firearms in the united states . beck said that while school attacks were not necessarily unpreventable , laws could be beefed up to " at least hinder or restrict " access to " certain forms of weaponry . " european newspapers were more direct in their criticism .
the spanish daily el pais expressed doubt that the blacksburg tragedy would lead to a change in availability of weapons . gerard baker , united states editor for the times of london , cited the long list of school shootings in the us in an editorial for that publication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : virginia tech students are grieving the gunman 's victims " it 's so familiar you could write the script yourself , " he commented .
" only the names change - jonesboro , columbine , lancaster county and now virginia tech .
and the numbers . " the vast majority of european bloggers have also expressed incredulity that america has refused to limit access to guns in reactions to such mass shootings .
although similar events have taken place in europe , including a high-school massacre in the german city of erfurt in 2002 , a disproportionate number of them happen in the us . us president bush expressed his horror and sympathy with the victims on monday .
a short time later , his press spokesperson said , " the president believes that there is a right for people to bear arms , but that all laws must be followed . " ongoing investigations and mounting criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the massacre has many europeans shaking their heads at us gun laws on tuesday , authorities in and around the university continued to reconstruct what had happened . some virginia tech students and others involved have questioned why police and university authorities issued no general warning between the first set of shootings in the dormitory and those in the lecture building , which happened some two hours later . there has been no substantiation for rumors that a second gunman may have been involved in the attacks . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de missing teenage suspect in school shooting alert found dead an 18-year-old german teenager who had gone missing has been found dead in the woods near his home .

where do the candidates stand when it comes to brussels ? on first glance , it might appear that the french presidential candidates are slackers regarding the european union , since the bloc is hardly on the radar screens during this election season . " european topics are hardly present in the french campaign , " said henri de grossouvre , head of the european think tank forum carolus . but this eu shyness in an otherwise fairly boisterous campaign is not surprising to many observers since talk about europe is likely to score few points for the candidates vying for the presidency .
on may 29 , 2005 , french voters refused to follow the entreaties of the country 's political elite and maneuvered their country into a european dead end .
it does not appear that the french , or the candidates , are very eager to find their way back . france 's eu malaise can be partially traced to outgoing french president jacques chirac who , unlike his predecessor francois mitterrand , generally placed his own or french interests before those of the eu when it came to forging compromises with brussels .
for example , in 1998 he pushed like a bulldozer to ensure that the second president of the european central bank was a frenchman . chirac is leaving an uncertain political landscape to his potential successor , each of whom has a very different solution to the bind the eu finds itself in . sarkozy - " mini constitution " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy wants a slimmed-down treaty nicolas sarkozy , from the governing ump party , likes to talk about a slimmed-down version of the eu constitution .
if he wins the upcoming election , he would like to introduce a " simplified " eu constitution to the french parliament for consideration .
this " mini constitution " would only guarantee the smooth functioning of the 27 member states . " sarkozy has prepared everything to bring france out of its isolation , " said frank baasner , director of the french-german institute -lrb- dfi -rrb- in ludwigsburg .
sarkozy has ruled out another referendum . " the first referendum brought europe to a standstill , " baasner said .
" a second would destroy it . " royal - ready for risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : segolene royal wants to have the constitution reworked sarkozy 's socialist rival , segolene royal , is campaigning for a " new participatory style of politics , " according to daniela schwarzer , france expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . up to now , royal has held more than 5,000 public forums on various campaign themes , including european policy .
she wants to have the constitutional treaty reworked and more stress put on economic and social matters .
royal says she 's " ready to take the risk . " " in a new referendum , it will be about actually making europe the topic of the vote , " said axel schäfer , the europe expert of the social democrats ' parliamentary group .
in the 2005 referendums in france and the netherlands , many observers believe that people used the " no " vote to express their dissatisfaction with national politics and politicians .
schäfer pointed out that in france " actually a large majority are in favor of a european constitution . " bayrou - the model european ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayrou is taking the middle road francois bayrou from the centrist udf party is treading a middle line between sarkozy and royal .
he does advocate , like royal , holding a new referendum .
but he enters sarkozy territory when he calls for a " credible , simple , short document . "
in his opinion , there should be only two considerations : how decisions are made and where the citizen stands .
in the past , bayrou has been a supporter of a federal europe . but bayrou 's interest in europe policy more than just campaign rhetoric .
in light of his long advocacy for common eu institutions , he is the more credible eu proponent among the candidates , according to france expert baasner . " other eu partners would basically know where he stands , " he said . le pen - a nativist europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-marie le pen is not an eu fan jean-marie le pen from the far-right national front -lrb- fn -rrb- likes to call the eu a " fat , soft jellyfish " and , if elected , would push to see border checks re-established that were eliminated by the schengen agreement . " those who are now hauling out their dusty french flags always forget to say that they are sealing france 's end in that they will force a new constitutional treaty on the french as soon as they are elected , " said le pen 's daughter marine , who campaigns for her father , during an interview on french television .
she was referring to attempts by both sarkozy and royal to appeal to french patriotic sentiments during the current election campaign . all the candidates of the middle , sarkozy , royal and bayrou , came out in favor of the eu constitution back in 2005 .
whoever wins the upcoming election will have to explain to his or her european partners soon thereafter how and why the draft treaty should be changed . angela göpfert -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu looks on as french socialists hold presidential primaries the woman hoping to become france 's first female president says she is confident of victory in the socialist presidential primaries - but what would a royal victory mean for europe ? -lrb- 16.11.2006 -rrb- reviving the eu constitution ... or not as the current holder of the eu presidency , austria has attempted to restart debate about how the stalled eu constitution project should move forward .

where do the candidates stand when it comes to brussels ? on first glance , it might appear that the french presidential candidates are slackers regarding the european union , since the bloc is hardly on the radar screens during this election season . " european topics are hardly present in the french campaign , " said henri de grossouvre , head of the european think tank forum carolus . but this eu shyness in an otherwise fairly boisterous campaign is not surprising to many observers since talk about europe is likely to score few points for the candidates vying for the presidency .
on may 29 , 2005 , french voters refused to follow the entreaties of the country 's political elite and maneuvered their country into a european dead end .
it does not appear that the french , or the candidates , are very eager to find their way back . france 's eu malaise can be partially traced to outgoing french president jacques chirac who , unlike his predecessor francois mitterrand , generally placed his own or french interests before those of the eu when it came to forging compromises with brussels .
for example , in 1998 he pushed like a bulldozer to ensure that the second president of the european central bank was a frenchman . chirac is leaving an uncertain political landscape to his potential successor , each of whom has a very different solution to the bind the eu finds itself in . sarkozy - " mini constitution " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy wants a slimmed-down treaty nicolas sarkozy , from the governing ump party , likes to talk about a slimmed-down version of the eu constitution .
if he wins the upcoming election , he would like to introduce a " simplified " eu constitution to the french parliament for consideration .
this " mini constitution " would only guarantee the smooth functioning of the 27 member states . " sarkozy has prepared everything to bring france out of its isolation , " said frank baasner , director of the french-german institute -lrb- dfi -rrb- in ludwigsburg .
sarkozy has ruled out another referendum . " the first referendum brought europe to a standstill , " baasner said .
" a second would destroy it . " royal - ready for risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : segolene royal wants to have the constitution reworked sarkozy 's socialist rival , segolene royal , is campaigning for a " new participatory style of politics , " according to daniela schwarzer , france expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . up to now , royal has held more than 5,000 public forums on various campaign themes , including european policy .
she wants to have the constitutional treaty reworked and more stress put on economic and social matters .
royal says she 's " ready to take the risk . " " in a new referendum , it will be about actually making europe the topic of the vote , " said axel schäfer , the europe expert of the social democrats ' parliamentary group .
in the 2005 referendums in france and the netherlands , many observers believe that people used the " no " vote to express their dissatisfaction with national politics and politicians .
schäfer pointed out that in france " actually a large majority are in favor of a european constitution .

he does advocate , like royal , holding a new referendum .
but he enters sarkozy territory when he calls for a " credible , simple , short document . "
in his opinion , there should be only two considerations : how decisions are made and where the citizen stands .
in the past , bayrou has been a supporter of a federal europe . but bayrou 's interest in europe policy more than just campaign rhetoric .
in light of his long advocacy for common eu institutions , he is the more credible eu proponent among the candidates , according to france expert baasner .

she was referring to attempts by both sarkozy and royal to appeal to french patriotic sentiments during the current election campaign . all the candidates of the middle , sarkozy , royal and bayrou , came out in favor of the eu constitution back in 2005 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : france 's next president : sarko vs. sego police , protesters battle after sarkozy win sarkozy favored as french elect new president conservative sarkozy is france 's next president as election nears , french duo fight to a draw in last debate europe -pipe- 17.04.2007 europe on the back burner in french election campaign großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's " no " to the proposed eu constitution hit europe hard france 's " non " vote to the eu constitution in 2005 has made the subject of europe a political hot potato in the presidential campaign .
where do the candidates stand when it comes to brussels ? on first glance , it might appear that the french presidential candidates are slackers regarding the european union , since the bloc is hardly on the radar screens during this election season . " european topics are hardly present in the french campaign , " said henri de grossouvre , head of the european think tank forum carolus . but this eu shyness in an otherwise fairly boisterous campaign is not surprising to many observers since talk about europe is likely to score few points for the candidates vying for the presidency .
on may 29 , 2005 , french voters refused to follow the entreaties of the country 's political elite and maneuvered their country into a european dead end .
it does not appear that the french , or the candidates , are very eager to find their way back . france 's eu malaise can be partially traced to outgoing french president jacques chirac who , unlike his predecessor francois mitterrand , generally placed his own or french interests before those of the eu when it came to forging compromises with brussels .
for example , in 1998 he pushed like a bulldozer to ensure that the second president of the european central bank was a frenchman . chirac is leaving an uncertain political landscape to his potential successor , each of whom has a very different solution to the bind the eu finds itself in . sarkozy - " mini constitution " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy wants a slimmed-down treaty nicolas sarkozy , from the governing ump party , likes to talk about a slimmed-down version of the eu constitution .
if he wins the upcoming election , he would like to introduce a " simplified " eu constitution to the french parliament for consideration .
this " mini constitution " would only guarantee the smooth functioning of the 27 member states . " sarkozy has prepared everything to bring france out of its isolation , " said frank baasner , director of the french-german institute -lrb- dfi -rrb- in ludwigsburg .
sarkozy has ruled out another referendum . " the first referendum brought europe to a standstill , " baasner said .
" a second would destroy it . " royal - ready for risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : segolene royal wants to have the constitution reworked sarkozy 's socialist rival , segolene royal , is campaigning for a " new participatory style of politics , " according to daniela schwarzer , france expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . up to now , royal has held more than 5,000 public forums on various campaign themes , including european policy .
she wants to have the constitutional treaty reworked and more stress put on economic and social matters .
royal says she 's " ready to take the risk . " " in a new referendum , it will be about actually making europe the topic of the vote , " said axel schäfer , the europe expert of the social democrats ' parliamentary group .
in the 2005 referendums in france and the netherlands , many observers believe that people used the " no " vote to express their dissatisfaction with national politics and politicians .
schäfer pointed out that in france " actually a large majority are in favor of a european constitution . " bayrou - the model european ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayrou is taking the middle road francois bayrou from the centrist udf party is treading a middle line between sarkozy and royal .
he does advocate , like royal , holding a new referendum .
but he enters sarkozy territory when he calls for a " credible , simple , short document . "
in his opinion , there should be only two considerations : how decisions are made and where the citizen stands .
in the past , bayrou has been a supporter of a federal europe . but bayrou 's interest in europe policy more than just campaign rhetoric .
in light of his long advocacy for common eu institutions , he is the more credible eu proponent among the candidates , according to france expert baasner . " other eu partners would basically know where he stands , " he said . le pen - a nativist europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-marie le pen is not an eu fan jean-marie le pen from the far-right national front -lrb- fn -rrb- likes to call the eu a " fat , soft jellyfish " and , if elected , would push to see border checks re-established that were eliminated by the schengen agreement . " those who are now hauling out their dusty french flags always forget to say that they are sealing france 's end in that they will force a new constitutional treaty on the french as soon as they are elected , " said le pen 's daughter marine , who campaigns for her father , during an interview on french television .
she was referring to attempts by both sarkozy and royal to appeal to french patriotic sentiments during the current election campaign . all the candidates of the middle , sarkozy , royal and bayrou , came out in favor of the eu constitution back in 2005 .
whoever wins the upcoming election will have to explain to his or her european partners soon thereafter how and why the draft treaty should be changed . angela göpfert -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu looks on as french socialists hold presidential primaries the woman hoping to become france 's first female president says she is confident of victory in the socialist presidential primaries - but what would a royal victory mean for europe ? -lrb- 16.11.2006 -rrb- reviving the eu constitution ... or not as the current holder of the eu presidency , austria has attempted to restart debate about how the stalled eu constitution project should move forward .

kurt beck said he had experienced the events of april 16 at virginia tech university in the town of blacksburg with " terrible sorrow . "
edmund stoiber , the head of the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democrats , said the fact that more than 30 people could be " mowed down " was " beyond what is humanly imaginable . " french president jacques chirac also said he was " horrified and concerned " at the killings and expressed france 's complete solidarity with the us . police have identified 23-year-old cho seung-hui , a south korean studying at the university , as the gunman responsible for at least 30 of the deaths .
police also said one of two guns recovered was used in both of the two separate shooting incidents at the campus on monday - the first in a student dormitory and the second in a building used for lectures .
cho subsequently killed himself . " only the names change " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder why police could n't stop the killer before a second set of murders but as europeans were articulating their sympathy for the victims and their families , some raised the perennial issue of easy availability of firearms in the united states . beck said that while school attacks were not necessarily unpreventable , laws could be beefed up to " at least hinder or restrict " access to " certain forms of weaponry . " european newspapers were more direct in their criticism .
the spanish daily el pais expressed doubt that the blacksburg tragedy would lead to a change in availability of weapons . gerard baker , united states editor for the times of london , cited the long list of school shootings in the us in an editorial for that publication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : virginia tech students are grieving the gunman 's victims " it 's so familiar you could write the script yourself , " he commented .
" only the names change - jonesboro , columbine , lancaster county and now virginia tech .
and the numbers . " the vast majority of european bloggers have also expressed incredulity that america has refused to limit access to guns in reactions to such mass shootings .
although similar events have taken place in europe , including a high-school massacre in the german city of erfurt in 2002 , a disproportionate number of them happen in the us . us president bush expressed his horror and sympathy with the victims on monday .
a short time later , his press spokesperson said , " the president believes that there is a right for people to bear arms , but that all laws must be followed . " ongoing investigations and mounting criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the massacre has many europeans shaking their heads at us gun laws on tuesday , authorities in and around the university continued to reconstruct what had happened . some virginia tech students and others involved have questioned why police and university authorities issued no general warning between the first set of shootings in the dormitory and those in the lecture building , which happened some two hours later . there has been no substantiation for rumors that a second gunman may have been involved in the attacks . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de missing teenage suspect in school shooting alert found dead an 18-year-old german teenager who had gone missing has been found dead in the woods near his home .

the spanish daily el pais expressed doubt that the blacksburg tragedy would lead to a change in availability of weapons . gerard baker , united states editor for the times of london , cited the long list of school shootings in the us in an editorial for that publication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : virginia tech students are grieving the gunman 's victims " it 's so familiar you could write the script yourself , " he commented .
" only the names change - jonesboro , columbine , lancaster county and now virginia tech .
and the numbers . " the vast majority of european bloggers have also expressed incredulity that america has refused to limit access to guns in reactions to such mass shootings .
although similar events have taken place in europe , including a high-school massacre in the german city of erfurt in 2002 , a disproportionate number of them happen in the us . us president bush expressed his horror and sympathy with the victims on monday .
a short time later , his press spokesperson said , " the president believes that there is a right for people to bear arms , but that all laws must be followed . " ongoing investigations and mounting criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the massacre has many europeans shaking their heads at us gun laws on tuesday , authorities in and around the university continued to reconstruct what had happened . some virginia tech students and others involved have questioned why police and university authorities issued no general warning between the first set of shootings in the dormitory and those in the lecture building , which happened some two hours later . there has been no substantiation for rumors that a second gunman may have been involved in the attacks . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de missing teenage suspect in school shooting alert found dead an 18-year-old german teenager who had gone missing has been found dead in the woods near his home .

driven by her own ambitions and political convictions , she continually sought out positions of influence and eventually served as minister of education in communist east germany for over a quarter of a century . an unwavering believer in communism , margot honecker used her role as minister to indoctrinate the next generation .
politicized education was a method of gaining support for the repressive communist regime of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , which was then a part of the soviet bloc . “ she saw the school system as an extension of the dictatorship and many people were hurt professionally and mentally , ” said hubertus knabe , expert on former east germany and director of the berlin-hohenschönhausen memorial , which is located in what used to be a prison for political dissidents in the gdr . “ she was a bit fanatical , while erich was more bureaucratic , ” added knabe about the unpopular minister . hanging on to an impossible dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot and erich honecker at a socialist youth festival in 1973 over 17 years after the collapse of the iron curtain , margot honecker is still an unrepentant socialist . “ no one can seriously expect me to sacrifice my world view and my convictions on the altar of contemporary history , ” she said at a presentation of her book “ margot honecker on the other germany , ” which she published in 2001 together with prominent chilean socialist politician luis corvalan . the book originally appeared in chile , where margot honecker has lived in exile since 1992 .
it was a rare exception to her usual silence : after years in the political limelight , the 80-year-old now avoids public interviews and appearances . climbing the political ladder born on april 17 , 1927 in the eastern german city of halle , margot feist was a young woman when world war two ended and the soviet union gained control of eastern germany .
trained as a clerk and a telephone operator , she soon became involved in the free german youth -lrb- fdj -rrb- , a socialist organization for young people .
showing a penchant for leadership , she swiftly climbed its ranks . in 1949 , at the age of 22 , she became the youngest member of east germany ’ s parliament , the volkskammer . margot had met her future husband at fdj meetings .
erich honecker was the director of the youth organization ; he was also 15 years older and married .
when margot became pregnant and gave birth to their daughter sonja in 1952 , erich divorced his wife and he and margot married . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker was released from charges of treason due to ill health in his book “ margot honecker .
the biography , ” literary scholar ed stuhler speculated that the honeckers may have married for political reasons .
indeed , margot did not lack professional and political ambition . in communist east germany , mothers were expected to work - the state provided childcare - and margot honecker followed the party line .
in 1955 she began working at the ministry of education , rising to the top position there in 1963 . “ trained for war ” in east germany and throughout the former soviet union , political education and propaganda were crucial to securing public support for the regime and school curriculum was saturated with socialist doctrine . in 1978 , military training was introduced in the ninth and tenth grades . “ the children and youth in the gdr were trained for war , ” said hubertus knabe , “ both theoretically with textbooks and practically with weapons exercises and military manoeuvres - and that at an age where they were still very impressionable . ” “ it was a politically charged war against the class enemy , against the west , ” added knabe . on the run bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a marriage of love or politics - or both ?
after the fall of the berlin wall , erich honecker resigned as head of state in 1989 .
in march 1991 , the honeckers fled to moscow to evade charges in the federal republic of germany for cold war crimes involving the shooting deaths of east germans attempting to flee to the west . the following year , margot immigrated to chile where daughter sonja was living with her chilean husband .
chile had strong ties to communist east germany after the gdr took in thousands of chilean refugees in the mid-1970s following a bloody military coup led by augusto pinochet . the post-soviet russian government had extradited erich honecker to germany to stand trial , but he was released by german authorities in 1993 due to poor health .
he joined his wife and daughter in chile , where he died of cancer in may 1994 . questioning justice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot was more staunchly dogmatic than her husband , said gdr expert hubertus knabe in his new book “ the culprits are among us , ” which came out in germany several weeks ago , knabe argues that none of the gdr ’ s political leaders were punished .
both margot and erich honecker are prominent examples , he said . after german reunification , margot honecker was investigated for her role in cases of forced adoption involving the children of dissidents who ’ d been arrested or had fled to the west .
charges were dropped in 1994 , however , and the former minister never stood trial . knabe said he finds it particularly unfair that the german state pays out 4.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.5 billion -rrb- in pensions for the former leaders of the gdr , but only 48 million euros for the victims ’ pensions . margot honecker reportedly picks up a pension check for 1,500 euros each month at the german embassy in santiago . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de books by former gdr secret police officers spark outrage the public launch of two new books on the infamous east german stasi secret police sparked angry outbursts here on wednesday , showing that tensions still run high 17 years after the fall of the berlin wall .

the vote to tear down the palace of the republic concludes a heated debate spanning over a decade .

kurt beck said he had experienced the events of april 16 at virginia tech university in the town of blacksburg with " terrible sorrow . "
edmund stoiber , the head of the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democrats , said the fact that more than 30 people could be " mowed down " was " beyond what is humanly imaginable . " french president jacques chirac also said he was " horrified and concerned " at the killings and expressed france 's complete solidarity with the us . police have identified 23-year-old cho seung-hui , a south korean studying at the university , as the gunman responsible for at least 30 of the deaths .
police also said one of two guns recovered was used in both of the two separate shooting incidents at the campus on monday - the first in a student dormitory and the second in a building used for lectures .
cho subsequently killed himself . " only the names change " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder why police could n't stop the killer before a second set of murders but as europeans were articulating their sympathy for the victims and their families , some raised the perennial issue of easy availability of firearms in the united states . beck said that while school attacks were not necessarily unpreventable , laws could be beefed up to " at least hinder or restrict " access to " certain forms of weaponry . " european newspapers were more direct in their criticism .
the spanish daily el pais expressed doubt that the blacksburg tragedy would lead to a change in availability of weapons . gerard baker , united states editor for the times of london , cited the long list of school shootings in the us in an editorial for that publication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : virginia tech students are grieving the gunman 's victims " it 's so familiar you could write the script yourself , " he commented .
" only the names change - jonesboro , columbine , lancaster county and now virginia tech .
and the numbers . " the vast majority of european bloggers have also expressed incredulity that america has refused to limit access to guns in reactions to such mass shootings .
although similar events have taken place in europe , including a high-school massacre in the german city of erfurt in 2002 , a disproportionate number of them happen in the us . us president bush expressed his horror and sympathy with the victims on monday .
a short time later , his press spokesperson said , " the president believes that there is a right for people to bear arms , but that all laws must be followed . " ongoing investigations and mounting criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the massacre has many europeans shaking their heads at us gun laws on tuesday , authorities in and around the university continued to reconstruct what had happened . some virginia tech students and others involved have questioned why police and university authorities issued no general warning between the first set of shootings in the dormitory and those in the lecture building , which happened some two hours later . there has been no substantiation for rumors that a second gunman may have been involved in the attacks . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de missing teenage suspect in school shooting alert found dead an 18-year-old german teenager who had gone missing has been found dead in the woods near his home .

kurt beck said he had experienced the events of april 16 at virginia tech university in the town of blacksburg with " terrible sorrow . "
edmund stoiber , the head of the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democrats , said the fact that more than 30 people could be " mowed down " was " beyond what is humanly imaginable . " french president jacques chirac also said he was " horrified and concerned " at the killings and expressed france 's complete solidarity with the us . police have identified 23-year-old cho seung-hui , a south korean studying at the university , as the gunman responsible for at least 30 of the deaths .
police also said one of two guns recovered was used in both of the two separate shooting incidents at the campus on monday - the first in a student dormitory and the second in a building used for lectures .
cho subsequently killed himself . " only the names change " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder why police could n't stop the killer before a second set of murders but as europeans were articulating their sympathy for the victims and their families , some raised the perennial issue of easy availability of firearms in the united states . beck said that while school attacks were not necessarily unpreventable , laws could be beefed up to " at least hinder or restrict " access to " certain forms of weaponry . " european newspapers were more direct in their criticism .
the spanish daily el pais expressed doubt that the blacksburg tragedy would lead to a change in availability of weapons . gerard baker , united states editor for the times of london , cited the long list of school shootings in the us in an editorial for that publication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : virginia tech students are grieving the gunman 's victims " it 's so familiar you could write the script yourself , " he commented .
" only the names change - jonesboro , columbine , lancaster county and now virginia tech .
and the numbers . " the vast majority of european bloggers have also expressed incredulity that america has refused to limit access to guns in reactions to such mass shootings .
although similar events have taken place in europe , including a high-school massacre in the german city of erfurt in 2002 , a disproportionate number of them happen in the us . us president bush expressed his horror and sympathy with the victims on monday .
a short time later , his press spokesperson said , " the president believes that there is a right for people to bear arms , but that all laws must be followed . " ongoing investigations and mounting criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the massacre has many europeans shaking their heads at us gun laws on tuesday , authorities in and around the university continued to reconstruct what had happened . some virginia tech students and others involved have questioned why police and university authorities issued no general warning between the first set of shootings in the dormitory and those in the lecture building , which happened some two hours later . there has been no substantiation for rumors that a second gunman may have been involved in the attacks . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de missing teenage suspect in school shooting alert found dead an 18-year-old german teenager who had gone missing has been found dead in the woods near his home .

" a serious political crisis " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's parliament was dissolved two weeks ago for his part , pro-russian yanukovych , who rejects the decree , is due tuesday to address the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe , a continent-wide rights body , in the french city of strasbourg . barroso called the situation in ukraine " a serious political crisis , " but appealed to both sides to find a negotiated solution . " we hope this political crisis is solved according to the rules of democracy , " barroso said , adding that he was " more confident " a lawful and democratic solution could be found after his talks with yushchenko . yushchenko has defended his two-week-old decree , having originally dissolved ukraine 's assembly after accusing yanukovych of trying to steal his supporters for the government 's coalition . yanukovych and his majority in the 450-seat parliament have defied the order and appealed to the court to resolve the matter . legal or not ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : week-long protests have been held in kiev the constitutional court in kiev on tuesday began proceedings determine whether yushchenko 's decision two weeks ago to dissolve parliament was legal ; yanukovych claims it was not . last week , five of the court 's 18 judges complained that they had come under " gross pressure " from the prime minister 's parliamentary majority and demanded protection by bodyguards .
a ruling from the court could take as long as a month . both sides have pledged to abide by the constitutional court ruling , but many officials say such a decision would broaden divisions and suggest a negotiated settlement could obviate legal action . both the president and prime minister have called for a political deal to resolve the crisis , possibly by postponing the may 27 parliamentary election laid down in yushchenko 's decree , a move that has also been suggested by european officials , including an eu envoy in kiev last week . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine gripped by stalemate as eu waits for compromise rival demonstrators rallied in the ukrainian capital wednesday as defiant prime minister viktor yanukovych rejected a possible concession by his political enemy , president viktor yushchenko .

dw-world.de looks back at her life as she turns 80 on tuesday . margot honecker dressed elegantly and had a nice figure .
yet she was more than just a trophy wife for the president .
driven by her own ambitions and political convictions , she continually sought out positions of influence and eventually served as minister of education in communist east germany for over a quarter of a century . an unwavering believer in communism , margot honecker used her role as minister to indoctrinate the next generation .
politicized education was a method of gaining support for the repressive communist regime of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , which was then a part of the soviet bloc . “ she saw the school system as an extension of the dictatorship and many people were hurt professionally and mentally , ” said hubertus knabe , expert on former east germany and director of the berlin-hohenschönhausen memorial , which is located in what used to be a prison for political dissidents in the gdr . “ she was a bit fanatical , while erich was more bureaucratic , ” added knabe about the unpopular minister . hanging on to an impossible dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot and erich honecker at a socialist youth festival in 1973 over 17 years after the collapse of the iron curtain , margot honecker is still an unrepentant socialist . “ no one can seriously expect me to sacrifice my world view and my convictions on the altar of contemporary history , ” she said at a presentation of her book “ margot honecker on the other germany , ” which she published in 2001 together with prominent chilean socialist politician luis corvalan . the book originally appeared in chile , where margot honecker has lived in exile since 1992 .
it was a rare exception to her usual silence : after years in the political limelight , the 80-year-old now avoids public interviews and appearances . climbing the political ladder born on april 17 , 1927 in the eastern german city of halle , margot feist was a young woman when world war two ended and the soviet union gained control of eastern germany .
trained as a clerk and a telephone operator , she soon became involved in the free german youth -lrb- fdj -rrb- , a socialist organization for young people .
showing a penchant for leadership , she swiftly climbed its ranks . in 1949 , at the age of 22 , she became the youngest member of east germany ’ s parliament , the volkskammer . margot had met her future husband at fdj meetings .
erich honecker was the director of the youth organization ; he was also 15 years older and married .
when margot became pregnant and gave birth to their daughter sonja in 1952 , erich divorced his wife and he and margot married . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker was released from charges of treason due to ill health in his book “ margot honecker .
the biography , ” literary scholar ed stuhler speculated that the honeckers may have married for political reasons .
indeed , margot did not lack professional and political ambition . in communist east germany , mothers were expected to work - the state provided childcare - and margot honecker followed the party line .
in 1955 she began working at the ministry of education , rising to the top position there in 1963 . “ trained for war ” in east germany and throughout the former soviet union , political education and propaganda were crucial to securing public support for the regime and school curriculum was saturated with socialist doctrine . in 1978 , military training was introduced in the ninth and tenth grades . “ the children and youth in the gdr were trained for war , ” said hubertus knabe , “ both theoretically with textbooks and practically with weapons exercises and military manoeuvres - and that at an age where they were still very impressionable . ” “ it was a politically charged war against the class enemy , against the west , ” added knabe . on the run bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a marriage of love or politics - or both ?
after the fall of the berlin wall , erich honecker resigned as head of state in 1989 .
in march 1991 , the honeckers fled to moscow to evade charges in the federal republic of germany for cold war crimes involving the shooting deaths of east germans attempting to flee to the west . the following year , margot immigrated to chile where daughter sonja was living with her chilean husband .
chile had strong ties to communist east germany after the gdr took in thousands of chilean refugees in the mid-1970s following a bloody military coup led by augusto pinochet . the post-soviet russian government had extradited erich honecker to germany to stand trial , but he was released by german authorities in 1993 due to poor health .
he joined his wife and daughter in chile , where he died of cancer in may 1994 . questioning justice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot was more staunchly dogmatic than her husband , said gdr expert hubertus knabe in his new book “ the culprits are among us , ” which came out in germany several weeks ago , knabe argues that none of the gdr ’ s political leaders were punished .
both margot and erich honecker are prominent examples , he said . after german reunification , margot honecker was investigated for her role in cases of forced adoption involving the children of dissidents who ’ d been arrested or had fled to the west .
charges were dropped in 1994 , however , and the former minister never stood trial . knabe said he finds it particularly unfair that the german state pays out 4.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.5 billion -rrb- in pensions for the former leaders of the gdr , but only 48 million euros for the victims ’ pensions . margot honecker reportedly picks up a pension check for 1,500 euros each month at the german embassy in santiago . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de books by former gdr secret police officers spark outrage the public launch of two new books on the infamous east german stasi secret police sparked angry outbursts here on wednesday , showing that tensions still run high 17 years after the fall of the berlin wall .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.04.2007 europe offers condolences for us university shooting victims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university shooting incident was the worst of its kind in us history the deadliest shooting rampage in us history , which left 32 dead at an american university , sent shudders around the world tuesday , setting off shock and sympathy along with questions over gun control in the usa . as the scope of the tragedy became clear , german chancellor angela merkel , who currently holds the european union 's rotating presidency , expressed her sympathy to us president george w. bush and the american people . the leaders of her two coalition partners followed suit .
kurt beck said he had experienced the events of april 16 at virginia tech university in the town of blacksburg with " terrible sorrow . "
edmund stoiber , the head of the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democrats , said the fact that more than 30 people could be " mowed down " was " beyond what is humanly imaginable . " french president jacques chirac also said he was " horrified and concerned " at the killings and expressed france 's complete solidarity with the us . police have identified 23-year-old cho seung-hui , a south korean studying at the university , as the gunman responsible for at least 30 of the deaths .
police also said one of two guns recovered was used in both of the two separate shooting incidents at the campus on monday - the first in a student dormitory and the second in a building used for lectures .
cho subsequently killed himself . " only the names change " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder why police could n't stop the killer before a second set of murders but as europeans were articulating their sympathy for the victims and their families , some raised the perennial issue of easy availability of firearms in the united states . beck said that while school attacks were not necessarily unpreventable , laws could be beefed up to " at least hinder or restrict " access to " certain forms of weaponry . " european newspapers were more direct in their criticism .
the spanish daily el pais expressed doubt that the blacksburg tragedy would lead to a change in availability of weapons . gerard baker , united states editor for the times of london , cited the long list of school shootings in the us in an editorial for that publication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : virginia tech students are grieving the gunman 's victims " it 's so familiar you could write the script yourself , " he commented .
" only the names change - jonesboro , columbine , lancaster county and now virginia tech .
and the numbers . " the vast majority of european bloggers have also expressed incredulity that america has refused to limit access to guns in reactions to such mass shootings .
although similar events have taken place in europe , including a high-school massacre in the german city of erfurt in 2002 , a disproportionate number of them happen in the us . us president bush expressed his horror and sympathy with the victims on monday .
a short time later , his press spokesperson said , " the president believes that there is a right for people to bear arms , but that all laws must be followed . " ongoing investigations and mounting criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the massacre has many europeans shaking their heads at us gun laws on tuesday , authorities in and around the university continued to reconstruct what had happened . some virginia tech students and others involved have questioned why police and university authorities issued no general warning between the first set of shootings in the dormitory and those in the lecture building , which happened some two hours later . there has been no substantiation for rumors that a second gunman may have been involved in the attacks . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de missing teenage suspect in school shooting alert found dead an 18-year-old german teenager who had gone missing has been found dead in the woods near his home .

" we are determined to find a democratic resolution to the parliamentary crisis in ukraine , " he told reporters in brussels , after talks with european commission chief jose manuel barroso . " we 've never been saying and never -lrb- been -rrb- crudely speaking about any option with using force to resolve the situation , " yushchenko said . the ukrainian president said he would respect any decision taken by his country 's constitutional court , which on tuesday opened a hearing into yushchenko 's standoff with yanukovych over the president 's decision to dissolve parliament and call early elections . " a serious political crisis " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's parliament was dissolved two weeks ago for his part , pro-russian yanukovych , who rejects the decree , is due tuesday to address the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe , a continent-wide rights body , in the french city of strasbourg . barroso called the situation in ukraine " a serious political crisis , " but appealed to both sides to find a negotiated solution . " we hope this political crisis is solved according to the rules of democracy , " barroso said , adding that he was " more confident " a lawful and democratic solution could be found after his talks with yushchenko . yushchenko has defended his two-week-old decree , having originally dissolved ukraine 's assembly after accusing yanukovych of trying to steal his supporters for the government 's coalition . yanukovych and his majority in the 450-seat parliament have defied the order and appealed to the court to resolve the matter . legal or not ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : week-long protests have been held in kiev the constitutional court in kiev on tuesday began proceedings determine whether yushchenko 's decision two weeks ago to dissolve parliament was legal ; yanukovych claims it was not . last week , five of the court 's 18 judges complained that they had come under " gross pressure " from the prime minister 's parliamentary majority and demanded protection by bodyguards .
a ruling from the court could take as long as a month . both sides have pledged to abide by the constitutional court ruling , but many officials say such a decision would broaden divisions and suggest a negotiated settlement could obviate legal action . both the president and prime minister have called for a political deal to resolve the crisis , possibly by postponing the may 27 parliamentary election laid down in yushchenko 's decree , a move that has also been suggested by european officials , including an eu envoy in kiev last week . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine gripped by stalemate as eu waits for compromise rival demonstrators rallied in the ukrainian capital wednesday as defiant prime minister viktor yanukovych rejected a possible concession by his political enemy , president viktor yushchenko .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.04.2007 europe offers condolences for us university shooting victims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university shooting incident was the worst of its kind in us history the deadliest shooting rampage in us history , which left 32 dead at an american university , sent shudders around the world tuesday , setting off shock and sympathy along with questions over gun control in the usa . as the scope of the tragedy became clear , german chancellor angela merkel , who currently holds the european union 's rotating presidency , expressed her sympathy to us president george w. bush and the american people . the leaders of her two coalition partners followed suit .
kurt beck said he had experienced the events of april 16 at virginia tech university in the town of blacksburg with " terrible sorrow . "
edmund stoiber , the head of the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democrats , said the fact that more than 30 people could be " mowed down " was " beyond what is humanly imaginable . " french president jacques chirac also said he was " horrified and concerned " at the killings and expressed france 's complete solidarity with the us . police have identified 23-year-old cho seung-hui , a south korean studying at the university , as the gunman responsible for at least 30 of the deaths .
police also said one of two guns recovered was used in both of the two separate shooting incidents at the campus on monday - the first in a student dormitory and the second in a building used for lectures .
cho subsequently killed himself . " only the names change " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder why police could n't stop the killer before a second set of murders but as europeans were articulating their sympathy for the victims and their families , some raised the perennial issue of easy availability of firearms in the united states . beck said that while school attacks were not necessarily unpreventable , laws could be beefed up to " at least hinder or restrict " access to " certain forms of weaponry . " european newspapers were more direct in their criticism .
the spanish daily el pais expressed doubt that the blacksburg tragedy would lead to a change in availability of weapons . gerard baker , united states editor for the times of london , cited the long list of school shootings in the us in an editorial for that publication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : virginia tech students are grieving the gunman 's victims " it 's so familiar you could write the script yourself , " he commented .
" only the names change - jonesboro , columbine , lancaster county and now virginia tech .
and the numbers . " the vast majority of european bloggers have also expressed incredulity that america has refused to limit access to guns in reactions to such mass shootings .
although similar events have taken place in europe , including a high-school massacre in the german city of erfurt in 2002 , a disproportionate number of them happen in the us . us president bush expressed his horror and sympathy with the victims on monday .
a short time later , his press spokesperson said , " the president believes that there is a right for people to bear arms , but that all laws must be followed . " ongoing investigations and mounting criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the massacre has many europeans shaking their heads at us gun laws on tuesday , authorities in and around the university continued to reconstruct what had happened . some virginia tech students and others involved have questioned why police and university authorities issued no general warning between the first set of shootings in the dormitory and those in the lecture building , which happened some two hours later . there has been no substantiation for rumors that a second gunman may have been involved in the attacks . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de missing teenage suspect in school shooting alert found dead an 18-year-old german teenager who had gone missing has been found dead in the woods near his home .
his disappearance had sparked a manhunt and security alerts at three high schools in south-west germany on wednesday .
-lrb- 06.12.2006 -rrb- germany reevaluates gun laws after school shooting germany has some of the most strict firearms laws in the world .

" we are determined to find a democratic resolution to the parliamentary crisis in ukraine , " he told reporters in brussels , after talks with european commission chief jose manuel barroso . " we 've never been saying and never -lrb- been -rrb- crudely speaking about any option with using force to resolve the situation , " yushchenko said . the ukrainian president said he would respect any decision taken by his country 's constitutional court , which on tuesday opened a hearing into yushchenko 's standoff with yanukovych over the president 's decision to dissolve parliament and call early elections . " a serious political crisis " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's parliament was dissolved two weeks ago for his part , pro-russian yanukovych , who rejects the decree , is due tuesday to address the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe , a continent-wide rights body , in the french city of strasbourg . barroso called the situation in ukraine " a serious political crisis , " but appealed to both sides to find a negotiated solution . " we hope this political crisis is solved according to the rules of democracy , " barroso said , adding that he was " more confident " a lawful and democratic solution could be found after his talks with yushchenko . yushchenko has defended his two-week-old decree , having originally dissolved ukraine 's assembly after accusing yanukovych of trying to steal his supporters for the government 's coalition . yanukovych and his majority in the 450-seat parliament have defied the order and appealed to the court to resolve the matter . legal or not ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : week-long protests have been held in kiev the constitutional court in kiev on tuesday began proceedings determine whether yushchenko 's decision two weeks ago to dissolve parliament was legal ; yanukovych claims it was not . last week , five of the court 's 18 judges complained that they had come under " gross pressure " from the prime minister 's parliamentary majority and demanded protection by bodyguards .
a ruling from the court could take as long as a month . both sides have pledged to abide by the constitutional court ruling , but many officials say such a decision would broaden divisions and suggest a negotiated settlement could obviate legal action . both the president and prime minister have called for a political deal to resolve the crisis , possibly by postponing the may 27 parliamentary election laid down in yushchenko 's decree , a move that has also been suggested by european officials , including an eu envoy in kiev last week . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine gripped by stalemate as eu waits for compromise rival demonstrators rallied in the ukrainian capital wednesday as defiant prime minister viktor yanukovych rejected a possible concession by his political enemy , president viktor yushchenko .

where do the candidates stand when it comes to brussels ? on first glance , it might appear that the french presidential candidates are slackers regarding the european union , since the bloc is hardly on the radar screens during this election season . " european topics are hardly present in the french campaign , " said henri de grossouvre , head of the european think tank forum carolus . but this eu shyness in an otherwise fairly boisterous campaign is not surprising to many observers since talk about europe is likely to score few points for the candidates vying for the presidency .
on may 29 , 2005 , french voters refused to follow the entreaties of the country 's political elite and maneuvered their country into a european dead end .
it does not appear that the french , or the candidates , are very eager to find their way back . france 's eu malaise can be partially traced to outgoing french president jacques chirac who , unlike his predecessor francois mitterrand , generally placed his own or french interests before those of the eu when it came to forging compromises with brussels .
for example , in 1998 he pushed like a bulldozer to ensure that the second president of the european central bank was a frenchman . chirac is leaving an uncertain political landscape to his potential successor , each of whom has a very different solution to the bind the eu finds itself in . sarkozy - " mini constitution " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy wants a slimmed-down treaty nicolas sarkozy , from the governing ump party , likes to talk about a slimmed-down version of the eu constitution .
if he wins the upcoming election , he would like to introduce a " simplified " eu constitution to the french parliament for consideration .
this " mini constitution " would only guarantee the smooth functioning of the 27 member states . " sarkozy has prepared everything to bring france out of its isolation , " said frank baasner , director of the french-german institute -lrb- dfi -rrb- in ludwigsburg .

she wants to have the constitutional treaty reworked and more stress put on economic and social matters .
royal says she 's " ready to take the risk . " " in a new referendum , it will be about actually making europe the topic of the vote , " said axel schäfer , the europe expert of the social democrats ' parliamentary group .
in the 2005 referendums in france and the netherlands , many observers believe that people used the " no " vote to express their dissatisfaction with national politics and politicians .

but he enters sarkozy territory when he calls for a " credible , simple , short document . "
in his opinion , there should be only two considerations : how decisions are made and where the citizen stands .
in the past , bayrou has been a supporter of a federal europe . but bayrou 's interest in europe policy more than just campaign rhetoric .

she was referring to attempts by both sarkozy and royal to appeal to french patriotic sentiments during the current election campaign . all the candidates of the middle , sarkozy , royal and bayrou , came out in favor of the eu constitution back in 2005 .

where do the candidates stand when it comes to brussels ? on first glance , it might appear that the french presidential candidates are slackers regarding the european union , since the bloc is hardly on the radar screens during this election season . " european topics are hardly present in the french campaign , " said henri de grossouvre , head of the european think tank forum carolus . but this eu shyness in an otherwise fairly boisterous campaign is not surprising to many observers since talk about europe is likely to score few points for the candidates vying for the presidency .
on may 29 , 2005 , french voters refused to follow the entreaties of the country 's political elite and maneuvered their country into a european dead end .
it does not appear that the french , or the candidates , are very eager to find their way back . france 's eu malaise can be partially traced to outgoing french president jacques chirac who , unlike his predecessor francois mitterrand , generally placed his own or french interests before those of the eu when it came to forging compromises with brussels .
for example , in 1998 he pushed like a bulldozer to ensure that the second president of the european central bank was a frenchman . chirac is leaving an uncertain political landscape to his potential successor , each of whom has a very different solution to the bind the eu finds itself in . sarkozy - " mini constitution " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy wants a slimmed-down treaty nicolas sarkozy , from the governing ump party , likes to talk about a slimmed-down version of the eu constitution .
if he wins the upcoming election , he would like to introduce a " simplified " eu constitution to the french parliament for consideration .
this " mini constitution " would only guarantee the smooth functioning of the 27 member states . " sarkozy has prepared everything to bring france out of its isolation , " said frank baasner , director of the french-german institute -lrb- dfi -rrb- in ludwigsburg .
sarkozy has ruled out another referendum . " the first referendum brought europe to a standstill , " baasner said .
" a second would destroy it . " royal - ready for risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : segolene royal wants to have the constitution reworked sarkozy 's socialist rival , segolene royal , is campaigning for a " new participatory style of politics , " according to daniela schwarzer , france expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . up to now , royal has held more than 5,000 public forums on various campaign themes , including european policy .
she wants to have the constitutional treaty reworked and more stress put on economic and social matters .
royal says she 's " ready to take the risk . " " in a new referendum , it will be about actually making europe the topic of the vote , " said axel schäfer , the europe expert of the social democrats ' parliamentary group .
in the 2005 referendums in france and the netherlands , many observers believe that people used the " no " vote to express their dissatisfaction with national politics and politicians .
schäfer pointed out that in france " actually a large majority are in favor of a european constitution .

he does advocate , like royal , holding a new referendum .
but he enters sarkozy territory when he calls for a " credible , simple , short document . "
in his opinion , there should be only two considerations : how decisions are made and where the citizen stands .
in the past , bayrou has been a supporter of a federal europe . but bayrou 's interest in europe policy more than just campaign rhetoric .
in light of his long advocacy for common eu institutions , he is the more credible eu proponent among the candidates , according to france expert baasner .

" those who are now hauling out their dusty french flags always forget to say that they are sealing france 's end in that they will force a new constitutional treaty on the french as soon as they are elected , " said le pen 's daughter marine , who campaigns for her father , during an interview on french television .
she was referring to attempts by both sarkozy and royal to appeal to french patriotic sentiments during the current election campaign . all the candidates of the middle , sarkozy , royal and bayrou , came out in favor of the eu constitution back in 2005 .

dw-world.de looks back at her life as she turns 80 on tuesday . margot honecker dressed elegantly and had a nice figure .
yet she was more than just a trophy wife for the president .

dw-world.de looks back at her life as she turns 80 on tuesday . margot honecker dressed elegantly and had a nice figure .
yet she was more than just a trophy wife for the president .
driven by her own ambitions and political convictions , she continually sought out positions of influence and eventually served as minister of education in communist east germany for over a quarter of a century . an unwavering believer in communism , margot honecker used her role as minister to indoctrinate the next generation .
politicized education was a method of gaining support for the repressive communist regime of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , which was then a part of the soviet bloc . “ she saw the school system as an extension of the dictatorship and many people were hurt professionally and mentally , ” said hubertus knabe , expert on former east germany and director of the berlin-hohenschönhausen memorial , which is located in what used to be a prison for political dissidents in the gdr . “ she was a bit fanatical , while erich was more bureaucratic , ” added knabe about the unpopular minister . hanging on to an impossible dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot and erich honecker at a socialist youth festival in 1973 over 17 years after the collapse of the iron curtain , margot honecker is still an unrepentant socialist . “ no one can seriously expect me to sacrifice my world view and my convictions on the altar of contemporary history , ” she said at a presentation of her book “ margot honecker on the other germany , ” which she published in 2001 together with prominent chilean socialist politician luis corvalan . the book originally appeared in chile , where margot honecker has lived in exile since 1992 .
it was a rare exception to her usual silence : after years in the political limelight , the 80-year-old now avoids public interviews and appearances . climbing the political ladder born on april 17 , 1927 in the eastern german city of halle , margot feist was a young woman when world war two ended and the soviet union gained control of eastern germany .
trained as a clerk and a telephone operator , she soon became involved in the free german youth -lrb- fdj -rrb- , a socialist organization for young people .
showing a penchant for leadership , she swiftly climbed its ranks . in 1949 , at the age of 22 , she became the youngest member of east germany ’ s parliament , the volkskammer . margot had met her future husband at fdj meetings .
erich honecker was the director of the youth organization ; he was also 15 years older and married .

chile had strong ties to communist east germany after the gdr took in thousands of chilean refugees in the mid-1970s following a bloody military coup led by augusto pinochet . the post-soviet russian government had extradited erich honecker to germany to stand trial , but he was released by german authorities in 1993 due to poor health .

the survivors increasingly face violence , unemployment and lack of basic services as a result of religious , ethnic and political strife . “ i hope this conference will galvanize international support to provide them with more protection and assistance and i hope it will mobilize resources in establishing much needed protection space , ” said un secretary general ban ki-moon in a video message . “ for neighboring countries , this means keeping borders open and upholding the principle of no forced return , ” added ban , who also made an appeal to other asylum countries . western nations urged to do more amnesty international , human rights watch and the norwegian refugee council especially singled out britain as needing to do more in a joint appeal to the us and the eu . " we ask that you take the lead in europe by immediately announcing a program to resettle some of the iraqi refugees currently living in the most difficult conditions , " the three groups said in a joint appeal to prime minister tony blair . in a separate statement , amnesty international called on western countries to set up a resettlement program for iraqis that goes " far beyond token numbers and should constitute a significant part of the solution to the current crisis . " the charitable organization caritas international called on germany to increase its support .
germany ’ s foreign ministry had announced on monday that it would make 2.2 million euros in aid available to iraqi refugees and displaced persons . only about 20,000 iraqis applied for asylum in the european union last year , though the number is quickly growing .
sweden takes in more than half of all iraqi asylum seekers to europe . about 95 percent of iraqi refugees are in the middle east , but the number reaching industrialised countries , mainly europe , surged by 77 percent -lrb- 22,200 -rrb- in 2006 , according to unhcr data . eu interior and justice ministers are to examine the issue at a meeting on thursday .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : guterres said permanent integration abroad was n't the best solution for iraqi asylum seekers un high commissioner for refugees antonio guterres praised iraq ’ s two neighbors for their “ generous ” role in assisting and taking in iraqi refugees . these countries , however , have reached their limits in financing the aid effort .
the international federation of the red cross and red crescent called tuesday for 11.1 million euros to aid some 100,000 iraqi families living in jordan and syria . " we will take the lead " about 450 representatives from 60 countries participated in the un conference , including iraq ’ s foreign minister , hoshiyar zebari . in an interview with reuters television , zebari said , “ we ’ ve come here with a very clear message , that these are our people and that the iraqi government will take the lead in addressing the needs of its people .
we have concrete ideas and we will raise them here . ” dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de in easter message , pope laments " continual slaughter " in iraq pope benedict on sunday celebrated easter mass by decrying the " continual slaughter " in iraq and making a plea for peace in his traditional easter message on peter 's square on the holiest day of the christian calendar .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 17.04.2007 europe offers condolences for us university shooting victims großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the university shooting incident was the worst of its kind in us history the deadliest shooting rampage in us history , which left 32 dead at an american university , sent shudders around the world tuesday , setting off shock and sympathy along with questions over gun control in the usa . as the scope of the tragedy became clear , german chancellor angela merkel , who currently holds the european union 's rotating presidency , expressed her sympathy to us president george w. bush and the american people . the leaders of her two coalition partners followed suit .
kurt beck said he had experienced the events of april 16 at virginia tech university in the town of blacksburg with " terrible sorrow . "
edmund stoiber , the head of the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democrats , said the fact that more than 30 people could be " mowed down " was " beyond what is humanly imaginable . " french president jacques chirac also said he was " horrified and concerned " at the killings and expressed france 's complete solidarity with the us . police have identified 23-year-old cho seung-hui , a south korean studying at the university , as the gunman responsible for at least 30 of the deaths .
police also said one of two guns recovered was used in both of the two separate shooting incidents at the campus on monday - the first in a student dormitory and the second in a building used for lectures .
cho subsequently killed himself . " only the names change " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder why police could n't stop the killer before a second set of murders but as europeans were articulating their sympathy for the victims and their families , some raised the perennial issue of easy availability of firearms in the united states . beck said that while school attacks were not necessarily unpreventable , laws could be beefed up to " at least hinder or restrict " access to " certain forms of weaponry . " european newspapers were more direct in their criticism .
the spanish daily el pais expressed doubt that the blacksburg tragedy would lead to a change in availability of weapons . gerard baker , united states editor for the times of london , cited the long list of school shootings in the us in an editorial for that publication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : virginia tech students are grieving the gunman 's victims " it 's so familiar you could write the script yourself , " he commented .
" only the names change - jonesboro , columbine , lancaster county and now virginia tech .
and the numbers . " the vast majority of european bloggers have also expressed incredulity that america has refused to limit access to guns in reactions to such mass shootings .
although similar events have taken place in europe , including a high-school massacre in the german city of erfurt in 2002 , a disproportionate number of them happen in the us . us president bush expressed his horror and sympathy with the victims on monday .
a short time later , his press spokesperson said , " the president believes that there is a right for people to bear arms , but that all laws must be followed . " ongoing investigations and mounting criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the massacre has many europeans shaking their heads at us gun laws on tuesday , authorities in and around the university continued to reconstruct what had happened . some virginia tech students and others involved have questioned why police and university authorities issued no general warning between the first set of shootings in the dormitory and those in the lecture building , which happened some two hours later . there has been no substantiation for rumors that a second gunman may have been involved in the attacks . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de missing teenage suspect in school shooting alert found dead an 18-year-old german teenager who had gone missing has been found dead in the woods near his home .

" we 've achieved our principal objective : to prevent factory closures , " said klaus franz , chairman of the opel workers council in germany . the antwerp plant would build cars for other gm brands , the labor leader said , but details still needed to be worked out , according to the company . keeping up with the market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm wants to further automate astra production last month , forster warned of impending job cuts and said that " in extreme cases we might be forced to shut down a plant . " this was because productivity at the plants was growing at an annual rate of 3 to 4 percent but the market for cars was stagnating , he said . gm , which employs 60,000 workers in europe , has shed more than 12,000 jobs as part of a restructuring program introduced in 2005 to cut losses in its european operations . last year opel recorded a net profit of $ 227 million - its first gain in seven years .
but the parent company has been hit by a sharp downturn in us sales after failing to predict a consumer swing to smaller , fuel-saving models . as part of the cost-cutting measures , gm closed its opel plant at azambuja in portugal , cutting 1,100 jobs . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de american billionaire investor kerkorian makes bid for chrysler american billionaire investor kirk kerkorian 's investment group has offered german-us automaker daimlerchrysler $ 4.5 billion -lrb- 3.3 billion euros -rrb- in cash to buy its struggling us chrysler unit .

" we 've achieved our principal objective : to prevent factory closures , " said klaus franz , chairman of the opel workers council in germany . the antwerp plant would build cars for other gm brands , the labor leader said , but details still needed to be worked out , according to the company . keeping up with the market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm wants to further automate astra production last month , forster warned of impending job cuts and said that " in extreme cases we might be forced to shut down a plant .

yet she was more than just a trophy wife for the president .
driven by her own ambitions and political convictions , she continually sought out positions of influence and eventually served as minister of education in communist east germany for over a quarter of a century . an unwavering believer in communism , margot honecker used her role as minister to indoctrinate the next generation .
politicized education was a method of gaining support for the repressive communist regime of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , which was then a part of the soviet bloc . “ she saw the school system as an extension of the dictatorship and many people were hurt professionally and mentally , ” said hubertus knabe , expert on former east germany and director of the berlin-hohenschönhausen memorial , which is located in what used to be a prison for political dissidents in the gdr . “ she was a bit fanatical , while erich was more bureaucratic , ” added knabe about the unpopular minister . hanging on to an impossible dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot and erich honecker at a socialist youth festival in 1973 over 17 years after the collapse of the iron curtain , margot honecker is still an unrepentant socialist . “ no one can seriously expect me to sacrifice my world view and my convictions on the altar of contemporary history , ” she said at a presentation of her book “ margot honecker on the other germany , ” which she published in 2001 together with prominent chilean socialist politician luis corvalan . the book originally appeared in chile , where margot honecker has lived in exile since 1992 .
it was a rare exception to her usual silence : after years in the political limelight , the 80-year-old now avoids public interviews and appearances . climbing the political ladder born on april 17 , 1927 in the eastern german city of halle , margot feist was a young woman when world war two ended and the soviet union gained control of eastern germany .
trained as a clerk and a telephone operator , she soon became involved in the free german youth -lrb- fdj -rrb- , a socialist organization for young people .
showing a penchant for leadership , she swiftly climbed its ranks . in 1949 , at the age of 22 , she became the youngest member of east germany ’ s parliament , the volkskammer . margot had met her future husband at fdj meetings .
erich honecker was the director of the youth organization ; he was also 15 years older and married .
when margot became pregnant and gave birth to their daughter sonja in 1952 , erich divorced his wife and he and margot married . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker was released from charges of treason due to ill health in his book “ margot honecker .
the biography , ” literary scholar ed stuhler speculated that the honeckers may have married for political reasons .
indeed , margot did not lack professional and political ambition . in communist east germany , mothers were expected to work - the state provided childcare - and margot honecker followed the party line .
in 1955 she began working at the ministry of education , rising to the top position there in 1963 . “ trained for war ” in east germany and throughout the former soviet union , political education and propaganda were crucial to securing public support for the regime and school curriculum was saturated with socialist doctrine . in 1978 , military training was introduced in the ninth and tenth grades . “ the children and youth in the gdr were trained for war , ” said hubertus knabe , “ both theoretically with textbooks and practically with weapons exercises and military manoeuvres - and that at an age where they were still very impressionable . ” “ it was a politically charged war against the class enemy , against the west , ” added knabe . on the run bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a marriage of love or politics - or both ?
after the fall of the berlin wall , erich honecker resigned as head of state in 1989 .
in march 1991 , the honeckers fled to moscow to evade charges in the federal republic of germany for cold war crimes involving the shooting deaths of east germans attempting to flee to the west . the following year , margot immigrated to chile where daughter sonja was living with her chilean husband .
chile had strong ties to communist east germany after the gdr took in thousands of chilean refugees in the mid-1970s following a bloody military coup led by augusto pinochet . the post-soviet russian government had extradited erich honecker to germany to stand trial , but he was released by german authorities in 1993 due to poor health .
he joined his wife and daughter in chile , where he died of cancer in may 1994 . questioning justice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot was more staunchly dogmatic than her husband , said gdr expert hubertus knabe in his new book “ the culprits are among us , ” which came out in germany several weeks ago , knabe argues that none of the gdr ’ s political leaders were punished .
both margot and erich honecker are prominent examples , he said . after german reunification , margot honecker was investigated for her role in cases of forced adoption involving the children of dissidents who ’ d been arrested or had fled to the west .
charges were dropped in 1994 , however , and the former minister never stood trial . knabe said he finds it particularly unfair that the german state pays out 4.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.5 billion -rrb- in pensions for the former leaders of the gdr , but only 48 million euros for the victims ’ pensions . margot honecker reportedly picks up a pension check for 1,500 euros each month at the german embassy in santiago . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de books by former gdr secret police officers spark outrage the public launch of two new books on the infamous east german stasi secret police sparked angry outbursts here on wednesday , showing that tensions still run high 17 years after the fall of the berlin wall .
-lrb- 13.04.2006 -rrb- berlin 's palace of the republic faces wrecking ball germany 's lower house has approved the demolition of one of communist east germany 's ugliest , but best-loved buildings .
the vote to tear down the palace of the republic concludes a heated debate spanning over a decade .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.04.2007 east germany ’ s former first lady turns 80 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot honecker is still an unrepentant socialist margot honecker , the reclusive widow of former east german head-of-state erich honecker , was known for her authoritarian style and rigid socialist ideology .
dw-world.de looks back at her life as she turns 80 on tuesday . margot honecker dressed elegantly and had a nice figure .
yet she was more than just a trophy wife for the president .
driven by her own ambitions and political convictions , she continually sought out positions of influence and eventually served as minister of education in communist east germany for over a quarter of a century . an unwavering believer in communism , margot honecker used her role as minister to indoctrinate the next generation .
politicized education was a method of gaining support for the repressive communist regime of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , which was then a part of the soviet bloc . “ she saw the school system as an extension of the dictatorship and many people were hurt professionally and mentally , ” said hubertus knabe , expert on former east germany and director of the berlin-hohenschönhausen memorial , which is located in what used to be a prison for political dissidents in the gdr . “ she was a bit fanatical , while erich was more bureaucratic , ” added knabe about the unpopular minister . hanging on to an impossible dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot and erich honecker at a socialist youth festival in 1973 over 17 years after the collapse of the iron curtain , margot honecker is still an unrepentant socialist . “ no one can seriously expect me to sacrifice my world view and my convictions on the altar of contemporary history , ” she said at a presentation of her book “ margot honecker on the other germany , ” which she published in 2001 together with prominent chilean socialist politician luis corvalan . the book originally appeared in chile , where margot honecker has lived in exile since 1992 .
it was a rare exception to her usual silence : after years in the political limelight , the 80-year-old now avoids public interviews and appearances . climbing the political ladder born on april 17 , 1927 in the eastern german city of halle , margot feist was a young woman when world war two ended and the soviet union gained control of eastern germany .
trained as a clerk and a telephone operator , she soon became involved in the free german youth -lrb- fdj -rrb- , a socialist organization for young people .
showing a penchant for leadership , she swiftly climbed its ranks . in 1949 , at the age of 22 , she became the youngest member of east germany ’ s parliament , the volkskammer . margot had met her future husband at fdj meetings .
erich honecker was the director of the youth organization ; he was also 15 years older and married .
when margot became pregnant and gave birth to their daughter sonja in 1952 , erich divorced his wife and he and margot married . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker was released from charges of treason due to ill health in his book “ margot honecker .
the biography , ” literary scholar ed stuhler speculated that the honeckers may have married for political reasons .
indeed , margot did not lack professional and political ambition . in communist east germany , mothers were expected to work - the state provided childcare - and margot honecker followed the party line .

after the fall of the berlin wall , erich honecker resigned as head of state in 1989 .
in march 1991 , the honeckers fled to moscow to evade charges in the federal republic of germany for cold war crimes involving the shooting deaths of east germans attempting to flee to the west . the following year , margot immigrated to chile where daughter sonja was living with her chilean husband .
chile had strong ties to communist east germany after the gdr took in thousands of chilean refugees in the mid-1970s following a bloody military coup led by augusto pinochet . the post-soviet russian government had extradited erich honecker to germany to stand trial , but he was released by german authorities in 1993 due to poor health .

both margot and erich honecker are prominent examples , he said . after german reunification , margot honecker was investigated for her role in cases of forced adoption involving the children of dissidents who ’ d been arrested or had fled to the west .
charges were dropped in 1994 , however , and the former minister never stood trial . knabe said he finds it particularly unfair that the german state pays out 4.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.5 billion -rrb- in pensions for the former leaders of the gdr , but only 48 million euros for the victims ’ pensions . margot honecker reportedly picks up a pension check for 1,500 euros each month at the german embassy in santiago . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de books by former gdr secret police officers spark outrage the public launch of two new books on the infamous east german stasi secret police sparked angry outbursts here on wednesday , showing that tensions still run high 17 years after the fall of the berlin wall .

where do the candidates stand when it comes to brussels ? on first glance , it might appear that the french presidential candidates are slackers regarding the european union , since the bloc is hardly on the radar screens during this election season . " european topics are hardly present in the french campaign , " said henri de grossouvre , head of the european think tank forum carolus . but this eu shyness in an otherwise fairly boisterous campaign is not surprising to many observers since talk about europe is likely to score few points for the candidates vying for the presidency .
on may 29 , 2005 , french voters refused to follow the entreaties of the country 's political elite and maneuvered their country into a european dead end .
it does not appear that the french , or the candidates , are very eager to find their way back . france 's eu malaise can be partially traced to outgoing french president jacques chirac who , unlike his predecessor francois mitterrand , generally placed his own or french interests before those of the eu when it came to forging compromises with brussels .
for example , in 1998 he pushed like a bulldozer to ensure that the second president of the european central bank was a frenchman . chirac is leaving an uncertain political landscape to his potential successor , each of whom has a very different solution to the bind the eu finds itself in . sarkozy - " mini constitution " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy wants a slimmed-down treaty nicolas sarkozy , from the governing ump party , likes to talk about a slimmed-down version of the eu constitution .
if he wins the upcoming election , he would like to introduce a " simplified " eu constitution to the french parliament for consideration .
this " mini constitution " would only guarantee the smooth functioning of the 27 member states . " sarkozy has prepared everything to bring france out of its isolation , " said frank baasner , director of the french-german institute -lrb- dfi -rrb- in ludwigsburg .
sarkozy has ruled out another referendum . " the first referendum brought europe to a standstill , " baasner said .
" a second would destroy it . " royal - ready for risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : segolene royal wants to have the constitution reworked sarkozy 's socialist rival , segolene royal , is campaigning for a " new participatory style of politics , " according to daniela schwarzer , france expert at the german institute for international and security affairs -lrb- swp -rrb- . up to now , royal has held more than 5,000 public forums on various campaign themes , including european policy .
she wants to have the constitutional treaty reworked and more stress put on economic and social matters .
royal says she 's " ready to take the risk . " " in a new referendum , it will be about actually making europe the topic of the vote , " said axel schäfer , the europe expert of the social democrats ' parliamentary group .
in the 2005 referendums in france and the netherlands , many observers believe that people used the " no " vote to express their dissatisfaction with national politics and politicians .
schäfer pointed out that in france " actually a large majority are in favor of a european constitution . " bayrou - the model european ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayrou is taking the middle road francois bayrou from the centrist udf party is treading a middle line between sarkozy and royal .
he does advocate , like royal , holding a new referendum .
but he enters sarkozy territory when he calls for a " credible , simple , short document . "
in his opinion , there should be only two considerations : how decisions are made and where the citizen stands .
in the past , bayrou has been a supporter of a federal europe . but bayrou 's interest in europe policy more than just campaign rhetoric .
in light of his long advocacy for common eu institutions , he is the more credible eu proponent among the candidates , according to france expert baasner . " other eu partners would basically know where he stands , " he said . le pen - a nativist europe bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-marie le pen is not an eu fan jean-marie le pen from the far-right national front -lrb- fn -rrb- likes to call the eu a " fat , soft jellyfish " and , if elected , would push to see border checks re-established that were eliminated by the schengen agreement . " those who are now hauling out their dusty french flags always forget to say that they are sealing france 's end in that they will force a new constitutional treaty on the french as soon as they are elected , " said le pen 's daughter marine , who campaigns for her father , during an interview on french television .
she was referring to attempts by both sarkozy and royal to appeal to french patriotic sentiments during the current election campaign . all the candidates of the middle , sarkozy , royal and bayrou , came out in favor of the eu constitution back in 2005 .
whoever wins the upcoming election will have to explain to his or her european partners soon thereafter how and why the draft treaty should be changed . angela göpfert -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu looks on as french socialists hold presidential primaries the woman hoping to become france 's first female president says she is confident of victory in the socialist presidential primaries - but what would a royal victory mean for europe ? -lrb- 16.11.2006 -rrb- reviving the eu constitution ... or not as the current holder of the eu presidency , austria has attempted to restart debate about how the stalled eu constitution project should move forward .

it is planning to invest 3.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 3.9 billion -rrb- in the new astra . german labor leaders said the plant at bochum could see the number of assembly line employees slashed from 4,900 to 3,200 because of gm 's plans to streamline production . the company wants to cut production time for the new astra model from 24 hours to 15 hours per car , said rainer einenkel , head of the workers council at the bochum plant . " we 've achieved our principal objective : to prevent factory closures , " said klaus franz , chairman of the opel workers council in germany . the antwerp plant would build cars for other gm brands , the labor leader said , but details still needed to be worked out , according to the company . keeping up with the market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm wants to further automate astra production last month , forster warned of impending job cuts and said that " in extreme cases we might be forced to shut down a plant . " this was because productivity at the plants was growing at an annual rate of 3 to 4 percent but the market for cars was stagnating , he said . gm , which employs 60,000 workers in europe , has shed more than 12,000 jobs as part of a restructuring program introduced in 2005 to cut losses in its european operations . last year opel recorded a net profit of $ 227 million - its first gain in seven years .
but the parent company has been hit by a sharp downturn in us sales after failing to predict a consumer swing to smaller , fuel-saving models . as part of the cost-cutting measures , gm closed its opel plant at azambuja in portugal , cutting 1,100 jobs . dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de american billionaire investor kerkorian makes bid for chrysler american billionaire investor kirk kerkorian 's investment group has offered german-us automaker daimlerchrysler $ 4.5 billion -lrb- 3.3 billion euros -rrb- in cash to buy its struggling us chrysler unit .

where do the candidates stand when it comes to brussels ? on first glance , it might appear that the french presidential candidates are slackers regarding the european union , since the bloc is hardly on the radar screens during this election season . " european topics are hardly present in the french campaign , " said henri de grossouvre , head of the european think tank forum carolus . but this eu shyness in an otherwise fairly boisterous campaign is not surprising to many observers since talk about europe is likely to score few points for the candidates vying for the presidency .
on may 29 , 2005 , french voters refused to follow the entreaties of the country 's political elite and maneuvered their country into a european dead end .
it does not appear that the french , or the candidates , are very eager to find their way back . france 's eu malaise can be partially traced to outgoing french president jacques chirac who , unlike his predecessor francois mitterrand , generally placed his own or french interests before those of the eu when it came to forging compromises with brussels .
for example , in 1998 he pushed like a bulldozer to ensure that the second president of the european central bank was a frenchman . chirac is leaving an uncertain political landscape to his potential successor , each of whom has a very different solution to the bind the eu finds itself in . sarkozy - " mini constitution " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nicolas sarkozy wants a slimmed-down treaty nicolas sarkozy , from the governing ump party , likes to talk about a slimmed-down version of the eu constitution .
if he wins the upcoming election , he would like to introduce a " simplified " eu constitution to the french parliament for consideration .
this " mini constitution " would only guarantee the smooth functioning of the 27 member states . " sarkozy has prepared everything to bring france out of its isolation , " said frank baasner , director of the french-german institute -lrb- dfi -rrb- in ludwigsburg .

she wants to have the constitutional treaty reworked and more stress put on economic and social matters .
royal says she 's " ready to take the risk . " " in a new referendum , it will be about actually making europe the topic of the vote , " said axel schäfer , the europe expert of the social democrats ' parliamentary group .
in the 2005 referendums in france and the netherlands , many observers believe that people used the " no " vote to express their dissatisfaction with national politics and politicians .

in his opinion , there should be only two considerations : how decisions are made and where the citizen stands .
in the past , bayrou has been a supporter of a federal europe . but bayrou 's interest in europe policy more than just campaign rhetoric .

she was referring to attempts by both sarkozy and royal to appeal to french patriotic sentiments during the current election campaign . all the candidates of the middle , sarkozy , royal and bayrou , came out in favor of the eu constitution back in 2005 .

" we are determined to find a democratic resolution to the parliamentary crisis in ukraine , " he told reporters in brussels , after talks with european commission chief jose manuel barroso . " we 've never been saying and never -lrb- been -rrb- crudely speaking about any option with using force to resolve the situation , " yushchenko said . the ukrainian president said he would respect any decision taken by his country 's constitutional court , which on tuesday opened a hearing into yushchenko 's standoff with yanukovych over the president 's decision to dissolve parliament and call early elections . " a serious political crisis " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's parliament was dissolved two weeks ago for his part , pro-russian yanukovych , who rejects the decree , is due tuesday to address the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe , a continent-wide rights body , in the french city of strasbourg . barroso called the situation in ukraine " a serious political crisis , " but appealed to both sides to find a negotiated solution . " we hope this political crisis is solved according to the rules of democracy , " barroso said , adding that he was " more confident " a lawful and democratic solution could be found after his talks with yushchenko . yushchenko has defended his two-week-old decree , having originally dissolved ukraine 's assembly after accusing yanukovych of trying to steal his supporters for the government 's coalition . yanukovych and his majority in the 450-seat parliament have defied the order and appealed to the court to resolve the matter . legal or not ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : week-long protests have been held in kiev the constitutional court in kiev on tuesday began proceedings determine whether yushchenko 's decision two weeks ago to dissolve parliament was legal ; yanukovych claims it was not . last week , five of the court 's 18 judges complained that they had come under " gross pressure " from the prime minister 's parliamentary majority and demanded protection by bodyguards .
a ruling from the court could take as long as a month . both sides have pledged to abide by the constitutional court ruling , but many officials say such a decision would broaden divisions and suggest a negotiated settlement could obviate legal action . both the president and prime minister have called for a political deal to resolve the crisis , possibly by postponing the may 27 parliamentary election laid down in yushchenko 's decree , a move that has also been suggested by european officials , including an eu envoy in kiev last week . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine gripped by stalemate as eu waits for compromise rival demonstrators rallied in the ukrainian capital wednesday as defiant prime minister viktor yanukovych rejected a possible concession by his political enemy , president viktor yushchenko .

dw-world.de looks back at her life as she turns 80 on tuesday . margot honecker dressed elegantly and had a nice figure .
yet she was more than just a trophy wife for the president .
driven by her own ambitions and political convictions , she continually sought out positions of influence and eventually served as minister of education in communist east germany for over a quarter of a century . an unwavering believer in communism , margot honecker used her role as minister to indoctrinate the next generation .
politicized education was a method of gaining support for the repressive communist regime of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , which was then a part of the soviet bloc . “ she saw the school system as an extension of the dictatorship and many people were hurt professionally and mentally , ” said hubertus knabe , expert on former east germany and director of the berlin-hohenschönhausen memorial , which is located in what used to be a prison for political dissidents in the gdr . “ she was a bit fanatical , while erich was more bureaucratic , ” added knabe about the unpopular minister . hanging on to an impossible dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot and erich honecker at a socialist youth festival in 1973 over 17 years after the collapse of the iron curtain , margot honecker is still an unrepentant socialist . “ no one can seriously expect me to sacrifice my world view and my convictions on the altar of contemporary history , ” she said at a presentation of her book “ margot honecker on the other germany , ” which she published in 2001 together with prominent chilean socialist politician luis corvalan . the book originally appeared in chile , where margot honecker has lived in exile since 1992 .
it was a rare exception to her usual silence : after years in the political limelight , the 80-year-old now avoids public interviews and appearances . climbing the political ladder born on april 17 , 1927 in the eastern german city of halle , margot feist was a young woman when world war two ended and the soviet union gained control of eastern germany .
trained as a clerk and a telephone operator , she soon became involved in the free german youth -lrb- fdj -rrb- , a socialist organization for young people .
showing a penchant for leadership , she swiftly climbed its ranks . in 1949 , at the age of 22 , she became the youngest member of east germany ’ s parliament , the volkskammer . margot had met her future husband at fdj meetings .
erich honecker was the director of the youth organization ; he was also 15 years older and married .
when margot became pregnant and gave birth to their daughter sonja in 1952 , erich divorced his wife and he and margot married . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker was released from charges of treason due to ill health in his book “ margot honecker .
the biography , ” literary scholar ed stuhler speculated that the honeckers may have married for political reasons .
indeed , margot did not lack professional and political ambition . in communist east germany , mothers were expected to work - the state provided childcare - and margot honecker followed the party line .
in 1955 she began working at the ministry of education , rising to the top position there in 1963 . “ trained for war ” in east germany and throughout the former soviet union , political education and propaganda were crucial to securing public support for the regime and school curriculum was saturated with socialist doctrine . in 1978 , military training was introduced in the ninth and tenth grades . “ the children and youth in the gdr were trained for war , ” said hubertus knabe , “ both theoretically with textbooks and practically with weapons exercises and military manoeuvres - and that at an age where they were still very impressionable . ” “ it was a politically charged war against the class enemy , against the west , ” added knabe . on the run bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a marriage of love or politics - or both ?
after the fall of the berlin wall , erich honecker resigned as head of state in 1989 .
in march 1991 , the honeckers fled to moscow to evade charges in the federal republic of germany for cold war crimes involving the shooting deaths of east germans attempting to flee to the west . the following year , margot immigrated to chile where daughter sonja was living with her chilean husband .
chile had strong ties to communist east germany after the gdr took in thousands of chilean refugees in the mid-1970s following a bloody military coup led by augusto pinochet . the post-soviet russian government had extradited erich honecker to germany to stand trial , but he was released by german authorities in 1993 due to poor health .
he joined his wife and daughter in chile , where he died of cancer in may 1994 . questioning justice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot was more staunchly dogmatic than her husband , said gdr expert hubertus knabe in his new book “ the culprits are among us , ” which came out in germany several weeks ago , knabe argues that none of the gdr ’ s political leaders were punished .
both margot and erich honecker are prominent examples , he said . after german reunification , margot honecker was investigated for her role in cases of forced adoption involving the children of dissidents who ’ d been arrested or had fled to the west .
charges were dropped in 1994 , however , and the former minister never stood trial . knabe said he finds it particularly unfair that the german state pays out 4.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.5 billion -rrb- in pensions for the former leaders of the gdr , but only 48 million euros for the victims ’ pensions . margot honecker reportedly picks up a pension check for 1,500 euros each month at the german embassy in santiago . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de books by former gdr secret police officers spark outrage the public launch of two new books on the infamous east german stasi secret police sparked angry outbursts here on wednesday , showing that tensions still run high 17 years after the fall of the berlin wall .

now he 's saved his political skin by backing down from his original statement . günther oettinger appears to have made a narrow escape . in a eulogy on april 11 for hans filbinger , a former baden-württemberg state premier and a military judge during the third reich , oettinger praised his predecessor as an opponent of the nazi regime .
in fact , as a judge , filbinger personally signed death sentences for soldiers deserting hitler 's army late in world war ii . the eulogy attracted massive criticism from jewish groups , social democrats and even conservative chancellor angela merkel .
after initially sticking by his eulogy , oettinger decided on monday to smooth the waves . in a statement , oettinger said , " i do not stand by my choice of words .
on the contrary , i distance myself from them . " in the nick of time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a former german soldier with a death sentence issued against him for desertion oettinger 's retreat came only one day before archivists in baden-württemberg uncovered filbinger 's nazi party membership card - ending any questions as to whether he was a nazi supporter . filbinger was forced to resign from the office of state premier in 1978 , after playwright rolf hochhuth published a play dealing with his activities during the third reich . the baden württemberg chapter of the conservative christian democrats had defended filbinger 's record .
but with oettinger 's announcement , that policy would seem to be a thing of the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans filbinger died on april 1 , 2007 after oettinger 's announcement , hochhuth said it was time to end the discussions .
" it is absurd , " hochhuth told the daily bild newspaper , " to call for oettinger 's resignation .
he 's seen the error of his ways and apologized .
that 's the end of the matter . " the chairman of the social democrats , kurt beck , also said he considered the debate to be over . while acknowledging that oettinger 's retraction had probably saved his career , most german newspapers said that his political reputation had been seriously damaged .
" oettinger got it all wrong , " wrote berlin 's tagesspiegel , " and indeed in every respect . " meanwhile , angela merkel is drawing praise for forcing her conservative colleague to back down from his controversial statements . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel scolds state premier for defending ex-nazi german chancellor angela merkel sharply criticized a fellow conservative on friday for " whitewashing " the nazi past of his predecessor , the former leader of a powerful southern german state .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.04.2007 east germany ’ s former first lady turns 80 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot honecker is still an unrepentant socialist margot honecker , the reclusive widow of former east german head-of-state erich honecker , was known for her authoritarian style and rigid socialist ideology .
dw-world.de looks back at her life as she turns 80 on tuesday . margot honecker dressed elegantly and had a nice figure .
yet she was more than just a trophy wife for the president .
driven by her own ambitions and political convictions , she continually sought out positions of influence and eventually served as minister of education in communist east germany for over a quarter of a century . an unwavering believer in communism , margot honecker used her role as minister to indoctrinate the next generation .
politicized education was a method of gaining support for the repressive communist regime of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , which was then a part of the soviet bloc . “ she saw the school system as an extension of the dictatorship and many people were hurt professionally and mentally , ” said hubertus knabe , expert on former east germany and director of the berlin-hohenschönhausen memorial , which is located in what used to be a prison for political dissidents in the gdr . “ she was a bit fanatical , while erich was more bureaucratic , ” added knabe about the unpopular minister . hanging on to an impossible dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot and erich honecker at a socialist youth festival in 1973 over 17 years after the collapse of the iron curtain , margot honecker is still an unrepentant socialist . “ no one can seriously expect me to sacrifice my world view and my convictions on the altar of contemporary history , ” she said at a presentation of her book “ margot honecker on the other germany , ” which she published in 2001 together with prominent chilean socialist politician luis corvalan . the book originally appeared in chile , where margot honecker has lived in exile since 1992 .
it was a rare exception to her usual silence : after years in the political limelight , the 80-year-old now avoids public interviews and appearances . climbing the political ladder born on april 17 , 1927 in the eastern german city of halle , margot feist was a young woman when world war two ended and the soviet union gained control of eastern germany .
trained as a clerk and a telephone operator , she soon became involved in the free german youth -lrb- fdj -rrb- , a socialist organization for young people .
showing a penchant for leadership , she swiftly climbed its ranks . in 1949 , at the age of 22 , she became the youngest member of east germany ’ s parliament , the volkskammer . margot had met her future husband at fdj meetings .
erich honecker was the director of the youth organization ; he was also 15 years older and married .
when margot became pregnant and gave birth to their daughter sonja in 1952 , erich divorced his wife and he and margot married . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker was released from charges of treason due to ill health in his book “ margot honecker .
the biography , ” literary scholar ed stuhler speculated that the honeckers may have married for political reasons .
indeed , margot did not lack professional and political ambition . in communist east germany , mothers were expected to work - the state provided childcare - and margot honecker followed the party line .
in 1955 she began working at the ministry of education , rising to the top position there in 1963 . “ trained for war ” in east germany and throughout the former soviet union , political education and propaganda were crucial to securing public support for the regime and school curriculum was saturated with socialist doctrine . in 1978 , military training was introduced in the ninth and tenth grades . “ the children and youth in the gdr were trained for war , ” said hubertus knabe , “ both theoretically with textbooks and practically with weapons exercises and military manoeuvres - and that at an age where they were still very impressionable . ” “ it was a politically charged war against the class enemy , against the west , ” added knabe . on the run bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a marriage of love or politics - or both ?
after the fall of the berlin wall , erich honecker resigned as head of state in 1989 .
in march 1991 , the honeckers fled to moscow to evade charges in the federal republic of germany for cold war crimes involving the shooting deaths of east germans attempting to flee to the west . the following year , margot immigrated to chile where daughter sonja was living with her chilean husband .
chile had strong ties to communist east germany after the gdr took in thousands of chilean refugees in the mid-1970s following a bloody military coup led by augusto pinochet . the post-soviet russian government had extradited erich honecker to germany to stand trial , but he was released by german authorities in 1993 due to poor health .
he joined his wife and daughter in chile , where he died of cancer in may 1994 . questioning justice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot was more staunchly dogmatic than her husband , said gdr expert hubertus knabe in his new book “ the culprits are among us , ” which came out in germany several weeks ago , knabe argues that none of the gdr ’ s political leaders were punished .
both margot and erich honecker are prominent examples , he said . after german reunification , margot honecker was investigated for her role in cases of forced adoption involving the children of dissidents who ’ d been arrested or had fled to the west .
charges were dropped in 1994 , however , and the former minister never stood trial . knabe said he finds it particularly unfair that the german state pays out 4.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.5 billion -rrb- in pensions for the former leaders of the gdr , but only 48 million euros for the victims ’ pensions . margot honecker reportedly picks up a pension check for 1,500 euros each month at the german embassy in santiago . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de books by former gdr secret police officers spark outrage the public launch of two new books on the infamous east german stasi secret police sparked angry outbursts here on wednesday , showing that tensions still run high 17 years after the fall of the berlin wall .

the vote to tear down the palace of the republic concludes a heated debate spanning over a decade .

" we 've achieved our principal objective : to prevent factory closures , " said klaus franz , chairman of the opel workers council in germany . the antwerp plant would build cars for other gm brands , the labor leader said , but details still needed to be worked out , according to the company . keeping up with the market bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gm wants to further automate astra production last month , forster warned of impending job cuts and said that " in extreme cases we might be forced to shut down a plant . " this was because productivity at the plants was growing at an annual rate of 3 to 4 percent but the market for cars was stagnating , he said . gm , which employs 60,000 workers in europe , has shed more than 12,000 jobs as part of a restructuring program introduced in 2005 to cut losses in its european operations . last year opel recorded a net profit of $ 227 million - its first gain in seven years .

" we are determined to find a democratic resolution to the parliamentary crisis in ukraine , " he told reporters in brussels , after talks with european commission chief jose manuel barroso . " we 've never been saying and never -lrb- been -rrb- crudely speaking about any option with using force to resolve the situation , " yushchenko said . the ukrainian president said he would respect any decision taken by his country 's constitutional court , which on tuesday opened a hearing into yushchenko 's standoff with yanukovych over the president 's decision to dissolve parliament and call early elections . " a serious political crisis " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's parliament was dissolved two weeks ago for his part , pro-russian yanukovych , who rejects the decree , is due tuesday to address the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe , a continent-wide rights body , in the french city of strasbourg . barroso called the situation in ukraine " a serious political crisis , " but appealed to both sides to find a negotiated solution . " we hope this political crisis is solved according to the rules of democracy , " barroso said , adding that he was " more confident " a lawful and democratic solution could be found after his talks with yushchenko . yushchenko has defended his two-week-old decree , having originally dissolved ukraine 's assembly after accusing yanukovych of trying to steal his supporters for the government 's coalition . yanukovych and his majority in the 450-seat parliament have defied the order and appealed to the court to resolve the matter . legal or not ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : week-long protests have been held in kiev the constitutional court in kiev on tuesday began proceedings determine whether yushchenko 's decision two weeks ago to dissolve parliament was legal ; yanukovych claims it was not . last week , five of the court 's 18 judges complained that they had come under " gross pressure " from the prime minister 's parliamentary majority and demanded protection by bodyguards .
a ruling from the court could take as long as a month . both sides have pledged to abide by the constitutional court ruling , but many officials say such a decision would broaden divisions and suggest a negotiated settlement could obviate legal action . both the president and prime minister have called for a political deal to resolve the crisis , possibly by postponing the may 27 parliamentary election laid down in yushchenko 's decree , a move that has also been suggested by european officials , including an eu envoy in kiev last week . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine gripped by stalemate as eu waits for compromise rival demonstrators rallied in the ukrainian capital wednesday as defiant prime minister viktor yanukovych rejected a possible concession by his political enemy , president viktor yushchenko .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 17.04.2007 east germany ’ s former first lady turns 80 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot honecker is still an unrepentant socialist margot honecker , the reclusive widow of former east german head-of-state erich honecker , was known for her authoritarian style and rigid socialist ideology .
dw-world.de looks back at her life as she turns 80 on tuesday . margot honecker dressed elegantly and had a nice figure .
yet she was more than just a trophy wife for the president .
driven by her own ambitions and political convictions , she continually sought out positions of influence and eventually served as minister of education in communist east germany for over a quarter of a century . an unwavering believer in communism , margot honecker used her role as minister to indoctrinate the next generation .
politicized education was a method of gaining support for the repressive communist regime of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , which was then a part of the soviet bloc . “ she saw the school system as an extension of the dictatorship and many people were hurt professionally and mentally , ” said hubertus knabe , expert on former east germany and director of the berlin-hohenschönhausen memorial , which is located in what used to be a prison for political dissidents in the gdr . “ she was a bit fanatical , while erich was more bureaucratic , ” added knabe about the unpopular minister . hanging on to an impossible dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot and erich honecker at a socialist youth festival in 1973 over 17 years after the collapse of the iron curtain , margot honecker is still an unrepentant socialist . “ no one can seriously expect me to sacrifice my world view and my convictions on the altar of contemporary history , ” she said at a presentation of her book “ margot honecker on the other germany , ” which she published in 2001 together with prominent chilean socialist politician luis corvalan . the book originally appeared in chile , where margot honecker has lived in exile since 1992 .
it was a rare exception to her usual silence : after years in the political limelight , the 80-year-old now avoids public interviews and appearances . climbing the political ladder born on april 17 , 1927 in the eastern german city of halle , margot feist was a young woman when world war two ended and the soviet union gained control of eastern germany .
trained as a clerk and a telephone operator , she soon became involved in the free german youth -lrb- fdj -rrb- , a socialist organization for young people .
showing a penchant for leadership , she swiftly climbed its ranks . in 1949 , at the age of 22 , she became the youngest member of east germany ’ s parliament , the volkskammer . margot had met her future husband at fdj meetings .
erich honecker was the director of the youth organization ; he was also 15 years older and married .
when margot became pregnant and gave birth to their daughter sonja in 1952 , erich divorced his wife and he and margot married . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker was released from charges of treason due to ill health in his book “ margot honecker .
the biography , ” literary scholar ed stuhler speculated that the honeckers may have married for political reasons .
indeed , margot did not lack professional and political ambition . in communist east germany , mothers were expected to work - the state provided childcare - and margot honecker followed the party line .
in 1955 she began working at the ministry of education , rising to the top position there in 1963 . “ trained for war ” in east germany and throughout the former soviet union , political education and propaganda were crucial to securing public support for the regime and school curriculum was saturated with socialist doctrine . in 1978 , military training was introduced in the ninth and tenth grades . “ the children and youth in the gdr were trained for war , ” said hubertus knabe , “ both theoretically with textbooks and practically with weapons exercises and military manoeuvres - and that at an age where they were still very impressionable . ” “ it was a politically charged war against the class enemy , against the west , ” added knabe . on the run bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a marriage of love or politics - or both ?
after the fall of the berlin wall , erich honecker resigned as head of state in 1989 .
in march 1991 , the honeckers fled to moscow to evade charges in the federal republic of germany for cold war crimes involving the shooting deaths of east germans attempting to flee to the west . the following year , margot immigrated to chile where daughter sonja was living with her chilean husband .
chile had strong ties to communist east germany after the gdr took in thousands of chilean refugees in the mid-1970s following a bloody military coup led by augusto pinochet . the post-soviet russian government had extradited erich honecker to germany to stand trial , but he was released by german authorities in 1993 due to poor health .
he joined his wife and daughter in chile , where he died of cancer in may 1994 . questioning justice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot was more staunchly dogmatic than her husband , said gdr expert hubertus knabe in his new book “ the culprits are among us , ” which came out in germany several weeks ago , knabe argues that none of the gdr ’ s political leaders were punished .
both margot and erich honecker are prominent examples , he said . after german reunification , margot honecker was investigated for her role in cases of forced adoption involving the children of dissidents who ’ d been arrested or had fled to the west .
charges were dropped in 1994 , however , and the former minister never stood trial . knabe said he finds it particularly unfair that the german state pays out 4.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.5 billion -rrb- in pensions for the former leaders of the gdr , but only 48 million euros for the victims ’ pensions . margot honecker reportedly picks up a pension check for 1,500 euros each month at the german embassy in santiago . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de books by former gdr secret police officers spark outrage the public launch of two new books on the infamous east german stasi secret police sparked angry outbursts here on wednesday , showing that tensions still run high 17 years after the fall of the berlin wall .
-lrb- 13.04.2006 -rrb- berlin 's palace of the republic faces wrecking ball germany 's lower house has approved the demolition of one of communist east germany 's ugliest , but best-loved buildings .
the vote to tear down the palace of the republic concludes a heated debate spanning over a decade .
-lrb- 20.01.2006 -rrb- the scent of ostalgie kitsch erich honecker 's shower gel is sure to have you stepping out of the shower smelling like an old communist .
but gdr victims ' groups are incensed at the last " ostalgie " product to hit the shelves .

" we are determined to find a democratic resolution to the parliamentary crisis in ukraine , " he told reporters in brussels , after talks with european commission chief jose manuel barroso . " we 've never been saying and never -lrb- been -rrb- crudely speaking about any option with using force to resolve the situation , " yushchenko said . the ukrainian president said he would respect any decision taken by his country 's constitutional court , which on tuesday opened a hearing into yushchenko 's standoff with yanukovych over the president 's decision to dissolve parliament and call early elections . " a serious political crisis " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's parliament was dissolved two weeks ago for his part , pro-russian yanukovych , who rejects the decree , is due tuesday to address the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe , a continent-wide rights body , in the french city of strasbourg . barroso called the situation in ukraine " a serious political crisis , " but appealed to both sides to find a negotiated solution . " we hope this political crisis is solved according to the rules of democracy , " barroso said , adding that he was " more confident " a lawful and democratic solution could be found after his talks with yushchenko . yushchenko has defended his two-week-old decree , having originally dissolved ukraine 's assembly after accusing yanukovych of trying to steal his supporters for the government 's coalition . yanukovych and his majority in the 450-seat parliament have defied the order and appealed to the court to resolve the matter . legal or not ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : week-long protests have been held in kiev the constitutional court in kiev on tuesday began proceedings determine whether yushchenko 's decision two weeks ago to dissolve parliament was legal ; yanukovych claims it was not . last week , five of the court 's 18 judges complained that they had come under " gross pressure " from the prime minister 's parliamentary majority and demanded protection by bodyguards .
a ruling from the court could take as long as a month . both sides have pledged to abide by the constitutional court ruling , but many officials say such a decision would broaden divisions and suggest a negotiated settlement could obviate legal action . both the president and prime minister have called for a political deal to resolve the crisis , possibly by postponing the may 27 parliamentary election laid down in yushchenko 's decree , a move that has also been suggested by european officials , including an eu envoy in kiev last week . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine gripped by stalemate as eu waits for compromise rival demonstrators rallied in the ukrainian capital wednesday as defiant prime minister viktor yanukovych rejected a possible concession by his political enemy , president viktor yushchenko .

where do the candidates stand when it comes to brussels ? on first glance , it might appear that the french presidential candidates are slackers regarding the european union , since the bloc is hardly on the radar screens during this election season .

it does not appear that the french , or the candidates , are very eager to find their way back . france 's eu malaise can be partially traced to outgoing french president jacques chirac who , unlike his predecessor francois mitterrand , generally placed his own or french interests before those of the eu when it came to forging compromises with brussels .

dw-world.de looks back at her life as she turns 80 on tuesday . margot honecker dressed elegantly and had a nice figure .
yet she was more than just a trophy wife for the president .
driven by her own ambitions and political convictions , she continually sought out positions of influence and eventually served as minister of education in communist east germany for over a quarter of a century . an unwavering believer in communism , margot honecker used her role as minister to indoctrinate the next generation .
politicized education was a method of gaining support for the repressive communist regime of the german democratic republic -lrb- gdr -rrb- , which was then a part of the soviet bloc . “ she saw the school system as an extension of the dictatorship and many people were hurt professionally and mentally , ” said hubertus knabe , expert on former east germany and director of the berlin-hohenschönhausen memorial , which is located in what used to be a prison for political dissidents in the gdr . “ she was a bit fanatical , while erich was more bureaucratic , ” added knabe about the unpopular minister . hanging on to an impossible dream bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot and erich honecker at a socialist youth festival in 1973 over 17 years after the collapse of the iron curtain , margot honecker is still an unrepentant socialist . “ no one can seriously expect me to sacrifice my world view and my convictions on the altar of contemporary history , ” she said at a presentation of her book “ margot honecker on the other germany , ” which she published in 2001 together with prominent chilean socialist politician luis corvalan . the book originally appeared in chile , where margot honecker has lived in exile since 1992 .
it was a rare exception to her usual silence : after years in the political limelight , the 80-year-old now avoids public interviews and appearances . climbing the political ladder born on april 17 , 1927 in the eastern german city of halle , margot feist was a young woman when world war two ended and the soviet union gained control of eastern germany .
trained as a clerk and a telephone operator , she soon became involved in the free german youth -lrb- fdj -rrb- , a socialist organization for young people .
showing a penchant for leadership , she swiftly climbed its ranks . in 1949 , at the age of 22 , she became the youngest member of east germany ’ s parliament , the volkskammer . margot had met her future husband at fdj meetings .
erich honecker was the director of the youth organization ; he was also 15 years older and married .
when margot became pregnant and gave birth to their daughter sonja in 1952 , erich divorced his wife and he and margot married . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erich honecker was released from charges of treason due to ill health in his book “ margot honecker .
the biography , ” literary scholar ed stuhler speculated that the honeckers may have married for political reasons .
indeed , margot did not lack professional and political ambition . in communist east germany , mothers were expected to work - the state provided childcare - and margot honecker followed the party line .
in 1955 she began working at the ministry of education , rising to the top position there in 1963 . “ trained for war ” in east germany and throughout the former soviet union , political education and propaganda were crucial to securing public support for the regime and school curriculum was saturated with socialist doctrine . in 1978 , military training was introduced in the ninth and tenth grades . “ the children and youth in the gdr were trained for war , ” said hubertus knabe , “ both theoretically with textbooks and practically with weapons exercises and military manoeuvres - and that at an age where they were still very impressionable . ” “ it was a politically charged war against the class enemy , against the west , ” added knabe . on the run bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a marriage of love or politics - or both ?
after the fall of the berlin wall , erich honecker resigned as head of state in 1989 .
in march 1991 , the honeckers fled to moscow to evade charges in the federal republic of germany for cold war crimes involving the shooting deaths of east germans attempting to flee to the west . the following year , margot immigrated to chile where daughter sonja was living with her chilean husband .
chile had strong ties to communist east germany after the gdr took in thousands of chilean refugees in the mid-1970s following a bloody military coup led by augusto pinochet . the post-soviet russian government had extradited erich honecker to germany to stand trial , but he was released by german authorities in 1993 due to poor health .
he joined his wife and daughter in chile , where he died of cancer in may 1994 . questioning justice bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : margot was more staunchly dogmatic than her husband , said gdr expert hubertus knabe in his new book “ the culprits are among us , ” which came out in germany several weeks ago , knabe argues that none of the gdr ’ s political leaders were punished .
both margot and erich honecker are prominent examples , he said . after german reunification , margot honecker was investigated for her role in cases of forced adoption involving the children of dissidents who ’ d been arrested or had fled to the west .
charges were dropped in 1994 , however , and the former minister never stood trial . knabe said he finds it particularly unfair that the german state pays out 4.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 5.5 billion -rrb- in pensions for the former leaders of the gdr , but only 48 million euros for the victims ’ pensions . margot honecker reportedly picks up a pension check for 1,500 euros each month at the german embassy in santiago . kate bowen send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de books by former gdr secret police officers spark outrage the public launch of two new books on the infamous east german stasi secret police sparked angry outbursts here on wednesday , showing that tensions still run high 17 years after the fall of the berlin wall .

" we are determined to find a democratic resolution to the parliamentary crisis in ukraine , " he told reporters in brussels , after talks with european commission chief jose manuel barroso . " we 've never been saying and never -lrb- been -rrb- crudely speaking about any option with using force to resolve the situation , " yushchenko said . the ukrainian president said he would respect any decision taken by his country 's constitutional court , which on tuesday opened a hearing into yushchenko 's standoff with yanukovych over the president 's decision to dissolve parliament and call early elections . " a serious political crisis " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine 's parliament was dissolved two weeks ago for his part , pro-russian yanukovych , who rejects the decree , is due tuesday to address the parliamentary assembly of the council of europe , a continent-wide rights body , in the french city of strasbourg . barroso called the situation in ukraine " a serious political crisis , " but appealed to both sides to find a negotiated solution . " we hope this political crisis is solved according to the rules of democracy , " barroso said , adding that he was " more confident " a lawful and democratic solution could be found after his talks with yushchenko . yushchenko has defended his two-week-old decree , having originally dissolved ukraine 's assembly after accusing yanukovych of trying to steal his supporters for the government 's coalition . yanukovych and his majority in the 450-seat parliament have defied the order and appealed to the court to resolve the matter . legal or not ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : week-long protests have been held in kiev the constitutional court in kiev on tuesday began proceedings determine whether yushchenko 's decision two weeks ago to dissolve parliament was legal ; yanukovych claims it was not . last week , five of the court 's 18 judges complained that they had come under " gross pressure " from the prime minister 's parliamentary majority and demanded protection by bodyguards .
a ruling from the court could take as long as a month . both sides have pledged to abide by the constitutional court ruling , but many officials say such a decision would broaden divisions and suggest a negotiated settlement could obviate legal action . both the president and prime minister have called for a political deal to resolve the crisis , possibly by postponing the may 27 parliamentary election laid down in yushchenko 's decree , a move that has also been suggested by european officials , including an eu envoy in kiev last week . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de ukraine gripped by stalemate as eu waits for compromise rival demonstrators rallied in the ukrainian capital wednesday as defiant prime minister viktor yanukovych rejected a possible concession by his political enemy , president viktor yushchenko .

now he 's saved his political skin by backing down from his original statement . günther oettinger appears to have made a narrow escape . in a eulogy on april 11 for hans filbinger , a former baden-württemberg state premier and a military judge during the third reich , oettinger praised his predecessor as an opponent of the nazi regime .
in fact , as a judge , filbinger personally signed death sentences for soldiers deserting hitler 's army late in world war ii . the eulogy attracted massive criticism from jewish groups , social democrats and even conservative chancellor angela merkel .
after initially sticking by his eulogy , oettinger decided on monday to smooth the waves . in a statement , oettinger said , " i do not stand by my choice of words .
on the contrary , i distance myself from them . " in the nick of time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a former german soldier with a death sentence issued against him for desertion oettinger 's retreat came only one day before archivists in baden-württemberg uncovered filbinger 's nazi party membership card - ending any questions as to whether he was a nazi supporter . filbinger was forced to resign from the office of state premier in 1978 , after playwright rolf hochhuth published a play dealing with his activities during the third reich . the baden württemberg chapter of the conservative christian democrats had defended filbinger 's record .
but with oettinger 's announcement , that policy would seem to be a thing of the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans filbinger died on april 1 , 2007 after oettinger 's announcement , hochhuth said it was time to end the discussions .
" it is absurd , " hochhuth told the daily bild newspaper , " to call for oettinger 's resignation .
he 's seen the error of his ways and apologized .
that 's the end of the matter . " the chairman of the social democrats , kurt beck , also said he considered the debate to be over . while acknowledging that oettinger 's retraction had probably saved his career , most german newspapers said that his political reputation had been seriously damaged .

kurt beck said he had experienced the events of april 16 at virginia tech university in the town of blacksburg with " terrible sorrow . "
edmund stoiber , the head of the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democrats , said the fact that more than 30 people could be " mowed down " was " beyond what is humanly imaginable .

kurt beck said he had experienced the events of april 16 at virginia tech university in the town of blacksburg with " terrible sorrow . "
edmund stoiber , the head of the bavarian sister party to merkel 's christian democrats , said the fact that more than 30 people could be " mowed down " was " beyond what is humanly imaginable . " french president jacques chirac also said he was " horrified and concerned " at the killings and expressed france 's complete solidarity with the us . police have identified 23-year-old cho seung-hui , a south korean studying at the university , as the gunman responsible for at least 30 of the deaths .
police also said one of two guns recovered was used in both of the two separate shooting incidents at the campus on monday - the first in a student dormitory and the second in a building used for lectures .
cho subsequently killed himself . " only the names change " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder why police could n't stop the killer before a second set of murders but as europeans were articulating their sympathy for the victims and their families , some raised the perennial issue of easy availability of firearms in the united states . beck said that while school attacks were not necessarily unpreventable , laws could be beefed up to " at least hinder or restrict " access to " certain forms of weaponry . " european newspapers were more direct in their criticism .
the spanish daily el pais expressed doubt that the blacksburg tragedy would lead to a change in availability of weapons . gerard baker , united states editor for the times of london , cited the long list of school shootings in the us in an editorial for that publication . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : virginia tech students are grieving the gunman 's victims " it 's so familiar you could write the script yourself , " he commented .
" only the names change - jonesboro , columbine , lancaster county and now virginia tech .
and the numbers . " the vast majority of european bloggers have also expressed incredulity that america has refused to limit access to guns in reactions to such mass shootings .
although similar events have taken place in europe , including a high-school massacre in the german city of erfurt in 2002 , a disproportionate number of them happen in the us . us president bush expressed his horror and sympathy with the victims on monday .
a short time later , his press spokesperson said , " the president believes that there is a right for people to bear arms , but that all laws must be followed . " ongoing investigations and mounting criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the massacre has many europeans shaking their heads at us gun laws on tuesday , authorities in and around the university continued to reconstruct what had happened . some virginia tech students and others involved have questioned why police and university authorities issued no general warning between the first set of shootings in the dormitory and those in the lecture building , which happened some two hours later . there has been no substantiation for rumors that a second gunman may have been involved in the attacks . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de missing teenage suspect in school shooting alert found dead an 18-year-old german teenager who had gone missing has been found dead in the woods near his home .

the survivors increasingly face violence , unemployment and lack of basic services as a result of religious , ethnic and political strife . “ i hope this conference will galvanize international support to provide them with more protection and assistance and i hope it will mobilize resources in establishing much needed protection space , ” said un secretary general ban ki-moon in a video message . “ for neighboring countries , this means keeping borders open and upholding the principle of no forced return , ” added ban , who also made an appeal to other asylum countries . western nations urged to do more amnesty international , human rights watch and the norwegian refugee council especially singled out britain as needing to do more in a joint appeal to the us and the eu . " we ask that you take the lead in europe by immediately announcing a program to resettle some of the iraqi refugees currently living in the most difficult conditions , " the three groups said in a joint appeal to prime minister tony blair . in a separate statement , amnesty international called on western countries to set up a resettlement program for iraqis that goes " far beyond token numbers and should constitute a significant part of the solution to the current crisis . " the charitable organization caritas international called on germany to increase its support .
germany ’ s foreign ministry had announced on monday that it would make 2.2 million euros in aid available to iraqi refugees and displaced persons . only about 20,000 iraqis applied for asylum in the european union last year , though the number is quickly growing .

now he 's saved his political skin by backing down from his original statement . günther oettinger appears to have made a narrow escape . in a eulogy on april 11 for hans filbinger , a former baden-württemberg state premier and a military judge during the third reich , oettinger praised his predecessor as an opponent of the nazi regime .
in fact , as a judge , filbinger personally signed death sentences for soldiers deserting hitler 's army late in world war ii . the eulogy attracted massive criticism from jewish groups , social democrats and even conservative chancellor angela merkel .
after initially sticking by his eulogy , oettinger decided on monday to smooth the waves . in a statement , oettinger said , " i do not stand by my choice of words .
on the contrary , i distance myself from them . " in the nick of time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a former german soldier with a death sentence issued against him for desertion oettinger 's retreat came only one day before archivists in baden-württemberg uncovered filbinger 's nazi party membership card - ending any questions as to whether he was a nazi supporter . filbinger was forced to resign from the office of state premier in 1978 , after playwright rolf hochhuth published a play dealing with his activities during the third reich . the baden württemberg chapter of the conservative christian democrats had defended filbinger 's record .
but with oettinger 's announcement , that policy would seem to be a thing of the past . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hans filbinger died on april 1 , 2007 after oettinger 's announcement , hochhuth said it was time to end the discussions .
" it is absurd , " hochhuth told the daily bild newspaper , " to call for oettinger 's resignation .
he 's seen the error of his ways and apologized .
that 's the end of the matter . " the chairman of the social democrats , kurt beck , also said he considered the debate to be over . while acknowledging that oettinger 's retraction had probably saved his career , most german newspapers said that his political reputation had been seriously damaged .

speaking on a visit to canada , dr rowan williams said the church had real differences of conviction within it .
he said the debate was bigger than the gay clergy issue - it was about " the forms of behaviour that the church has the freedom or the authority to bless " .
us episcopal leaders are resisting calls for the appointment of a separate leader for members opposing gay clergy .
the episcopal church is the american wing of the 77 million-strong anglican communion .
in 2003 it consecrated an openly gay bishop , sparking dozens of its own parishes to leave .
in february , anglican leaders threatened the americans with expulsion unless they agreed to a separate leader for a traditionalist wing of their church .
dr rowan williams says a divide in the anglican church is possible us bishops rejected the plan as harmful and spiritually unsound - but they reiterated their wish to stay inside the communion .
the worldwide anglican communion has given the us church until 30 september to change its position .
dr williams plans to visit america shortly before the deadline expires .
speaking in canada , he said : " it 's not just about nice people who want to include gay and lesbian christians , and nasty people who want not to include them .
" the question is , really , ' what are the forms of behaviour that the church has the freedom or the authority to bless if it wants to be faithful to scripture and tradition ? '

along with unemployment , race relations and a sluggish economy , the future of the french countryside is a key , and highly emotive , issue in the presidential election campaign .
a crimson sun is setting behind the wooded hillside in the southern aveyron region as laurent reversat - whose flock of 350 ewes produces the creamy milk used to make roquefort cheese - herds his sheep into the milking shed .
" i 've been a farmer for 10 years and in that time many little farms around here have just vanished " , he says .
" what we 're seeing is rural desertification . "
misspent money some might wonder why the mood in the countryside today is so despondent .
after all , france is the world 's second largest agricultural exporter after the us ; it is also the biggest single beneficiary of the europe 's common agricultural policy or cap .
every year , over $ 10bn , more than a fifth of european subsidies , go to french farmers .
many feel the traditional character of rural life is disappearing but one problem is that most of the european money is not going to the small farmers who are often seen as guardians of the countryside .
instead , the lion 's share goes to the giant agribusinesses and cereal farms in northern france , renowned for their heavy dependence on fertilisers and pesticides .
pierre boulanger , a paris based academic who has investigated the distribution of subsidies in france says the money from europe is misspent and runs against citizens ' interests .
" the fact is we are in a totally frozen situation , " he says .
" the past big beneficiaries are still the big beneficiaries of today and tomorrow . "
farm subsidies are often associated with overproduction , but the system dates back to the founding of the european union when there were real concerns about food shortages .
pushed out france 's post-war leader , general de gaulle , said that a country that can not feed itself is not a great country .
and still today food self-sufficiency , like france 's nuclear deterrent , is seen as crucial to france 's geopolitical independence .
" what is the point of being the second biggest european country - geographically speaking - after germany if we just turn our land into a desert ? " asked right-wing candidate nicolas sarkozy , addressing a meeting of farmers and fishermen .
meanwhile segolene royale , the socialist party candidate , has spoken of the " strong internal serenity " of her childhood in a small village in eastern france .
the image of fallow land and empty villages strikes fear into many french hearts .
la france profonde - rural france - is as important to the country 's identity at home and abroad as the louvre and the eiffel tower .
we get a lot of unemployed and single parent families turning up here in a real state of crisis , asking us to house them richard villaplana , mayor , fayet but whereas 40 years ago a fifth of the population worked on the land , now there are less than 600,000 farmers - and about half of those may disappear in the next 20 years .
and recently , many of those repopulating the countryside are outsiders - between 1999 and 2004 , two million city people moved there .
very few became farmers .
some are commuters ; others are middle class immigrants from the uk , the netherlands , germany and other parts of northern europe .
but according to richard villaplana , mayor of the little village of fayet in the aveyron , the new arrivals included a very different category of people - the urban underclass , pushed out of the cities because they can not afford the rents .
" we get a lot of unemployed and single parent families turning up here in a real state of crisis , asking us to house them , " he says .
" of course people like to help each other , but you have to realise that some of my villagers get less than unemployment benefit . "
community mr villaplana adds that in the hard land of the aveyron , people are proud and fiercely independent , and do not understand why anyone should live off the state .
" there are farmers or construction workers in my village on low wages who are not eligible for state aid , and have less money to spend than those on the dole , " he says .
rural life is changing - but there are fewer farmers every year " people here are n't setting fire to cars like youth in the suburbs of big cities , but they are suffering too . "
but many of the newcomers have not come through choice , and find it hard to adapt to life in the countryside .
and with farming in decline and a chronic lack of jobs in much of the countryside , it is difficult for the new arrivals to become integrated .
meanwhile laurent reversat feels a sense of community remains the most valuable thing about life in the countryside - and he says that is why he chose to become a farmer .
" when i was small i thought it was the cows and the tractors that i liked on my grandmother 's farm , but now i realise that what was most important for me was that everybody worked together , " he recalls .
" we would bring in the hay and at eleven at night we would play petanque .
there was a great solidarity with the village as an extended family .
it was something magnificent ... everything that we 've lost in 30 years . "

every year , over $ 10bn , more than a fifth of european subsidies , go to french farmers .
many feel the traditional character of rural life is disappearing but one problem is that most of the european money is not going to the small farmers who are often seen as guardians of the countryside .
instead , the lion 's share goes to the giant agribusinesses and cereal farms in northern france , renowned for their heavy dependence on fertilisers and pesticides .
pierre boulanger , a paris based academic who has investigated the distribution of subsidies in france says the money from europe is misspent and runs against citizens ' interests .
" the fact is we are in a totally frozen situation , " he says .
" the past big beneficiaries are still the big beneficiaries of today and tomorrow . "
farm subsidies are often associated with overproduction , but the system dates back to the founding of the european union when there were real concerns about food shortages .
pushed out france 's post-war leader , general de gaulle , said that a country that can not feed itself is not a great country .
and still today food self-sufficiency , like france 's nuclear deterrent , is seen as crucial to france 's geopolitical independence .
" what is the point of being the second biggest european country - geographically speaking - after germany if we just turn our land into a desert ? " asked right-wing candidate nicolas sarkozy , addressing a meeting of farmers and fishermen .
meanwhile segolene royale , the socialist party candidate , has spoken of the " strong internal serenity " of her childhood in a small village in eastern france .
the image of fallow land and empty villages strikes fear into many french hearts .
la france profonde - rural france - is as important to the country 's identity at home and abroad as the louvre and the eiffel tower .
we get a lot of unemployed and single parent families turning up here in a real state of crisis , asking us to house them richard villaplana , mayor , fayet but whereas 40 years ago a fifth of the population worked on the land , now there are less than 600,000 farmers - and about half of those may disappear in the next 20 years .
and recently , many of those repopulating the countryside are outsiders - between 1999 and 2004 , two million city people moved there .
very few became farmers .
some are commuters ; others are middle class immigrants from the uk , the netherlands , germany and other parts of northern europe .
but according to richard villaplana , mayor of the little village of fayet in the aveyron , the new arrivals included a very different category of people - the urban underclass , pushed out of the cities because they can not afford the rents .
" we get a lot of unemployed and single parent families turning up here in a real state of crisis , asking us to house them , " he says .
" of course people like to help each other , but you have to realise that some of my villagers get less than unemployment benefit . "
community mr villaplana adds that in the hard land of the aveyron , people are proud and fiercely independent , and do not understand why anyone should live off the state .
" there are farmers or construction workers in my village on low wages who are not eligible for state aid , and have less money to spend than those on the dole , " he says .
rural life is changing - but there are fewer farmers every year " people here are n't setting fire to cars like youth in the suburbs of big cities , but they are suffering too . "
but many of the newcomers have not come through choice , and find it hard to adapt to life in the countryside .
and with farming in decline and a chronic lack of jobs in much of the countryside , it is difficult for the new arrivals to become integrated .
meanwhile laurent reversat feels a sense of community remains the most valuable thing about life in the countryside - and he says that is why he chose to become a farmer .
" when i was small i thought it was the cows and the tractors that i liked on my grandmother 's farm , but now i realise that what was most important for me was that everybody worked together , " he recalls .
" we would bring in the hay and at eleven at night we would play petanque .
there was a great solidarity with the village as an extended family .
it was something magnificent ... everything that we 've lost in 30 years . "

the miners became stuck underground after an explosion on monday night at a mine in baofeng county , henan province .
according to xinhua news agency , another explosion shook the mine as a rescue attempt got underway , hampering efforts to save those trapped .
china 's mines are among the most dangerous in the world , with about 5,000 deaths reported every year .
independent labour groups put the death toll at much higher - up to 20,000 annually .
they say there is evidence that mine operators often cover up accidents to avoid costly shutdowns and fines .
last year beijing pledged to close all small coal mines , in a bid to improve the industry 's safety record .
but coal provides more than two-thirds of china 's electricity , and production has been stepped up to meet demand .

independent labour groups put the death toll at much higher - up to 20,000 annually .
they say there is evidence that mine operators often cover up accidents to avoid costly shutdowns and fines .

a columbia university team found people who ate cured meats at least 14 times a month were more likely to have copd - chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
copd , which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema , kills around 30,000 people in the uk each year .
the report , in the american journal of respiratory and critical care medicine , said nitrites in meat may be to blame .
however , the overall risk of developing copd remains low .
nitrites generate reactive nitrogen species that may cause damage to the lungs dr rui jiang dr rui jiang , leading the research , said high levels of nitrites are used in cured meats such as bacon as preservatives , anti-bacterial agents and colour fixatives .
he said reactive nitrogen species , molecules that can damage body tissues , might be the key .
he said : " nitrites generate reactive nitrogen species that may cause damage to the lungs , producing structural changes resembling emphysema . "
copd risk the researchers looked at 7,352 american individuals who participated in the third national health and nutrition examination survey , conducted between 1988 and 1994 .
they compared the results of lung function tests and the risks of developing copd in participants and found those who ate the meats more often had worse lung function and were more likely to have copd .
copd is a term used for a number of conditions , and results from chronic bronchitis and emphysema , two inflammatory lung diseases .
it leads to damaged airways in the lungs making breathing more difficult , and is a major cause of disability and death .
diet ' not to blame ' the researchers also found individuals who consumed cured meats frequently were more likely to be male and of a lower socio-economic status , and to smoke , than those who never consumed cured meats .
they also often had lower intakes of vitamin c , fish , fruits and vegetables , and higher energy intakes .
yet they concluded these factors were not to blame for the effects on lungs .
copd kills around 30,000 people in the uk every year dr jiang said : " adjustment for these factors in our analyses did not appreciably change our findings . "
he said the link between cured meats and lung function was therefore unlikely to be explained by these other dietary factors .
he called for more studies of high dietary nitrite intake to assess whether it is a risk factor in the development of copd .
professor peter calverly of the british thoracic society said : " this study illustrates that factors other than smoking may contribute to copd .
" although smoking remains the single most significant cause of copd this research seems to suggest other factors may result in increased risk of the disease . "

it leads to damaged airways in the lungs making breathing more difficult , and is a major cause of disability and death .
diet ' not to blame ' the researchers also found individuals who consumed cured meats frequently were more likely to be male and of a lower socio-economic status , and to smoke , than those who never consumed cured meats .
they also often had lower intakes of vitamin c , fish , fruits and vegetables , and higher energy intakes .
yet they concluded these factors were not to blame for the effects on lungs .
copd kills around 30,000 people in the uk every year dr jiang said : " adjustment for these factors in our analyses did not appreciably change our findings . "
he said the link between cured meats and lung function was therefore unlikely to be explained by these other dietary factors .
he called for more studies of high dietary nitrite intake to assess whether it is a risk factor in the development of copd .
professor peter calverly of the british thoracic society said : " this study illustrates that factors other than smoking may contribute to copd .

a columbia university team found people who ate cured meats at least 14 times a month were more likely to have copd - chronic obstructive pulmonary disease .
copd , which includes chronic bronchitis and emphysema , kills around 30,000 people in the uk each year .
the report , in the american journal of respiratory and critical care medicine , said nitrites in meat may be to blame .
however , the overall risk of developing copd remains low . "
nitrites generate reactive nitrogen species that may cause damage to the lungs " dr rui jiang dr rui jiang , leading the research , said high levels of nitrites are used in cured meats such as bacon as preservatives , anti-bacterial agents and colour fixatives .
he said reactive nitrogen species , molecules that can damage body tissues , might be the key .
he said : " nitrites generate reactive nitrogen species that may cause damage to the lungs , producing structural changes resembling emphysema . "
copd risk the researchers looked at 7,352 american individuals who participated in the third national health and nutrition examination survey , conducted between 1988 and 1994 .
they compared the results of lung function tests and the risks of developing copd in participants and found those who ate the meats more often had worse lung function and were more likely to have copd .

it is a relief that your local tesco express is just about to open and that it also has a plentiful supply of pastries as well as your newspaper of choice .
having a tesco convenience store just down the road may justifiably be seen as a luxury by many people .
but tesco 's extraordinary growth - further evidence of which has emerged as it unveiled its annual profits of £ 2.55bn - is making this a reality in more and more parts of the country .
the express convenience chain is tesco 's fastest growing format , both in the uk and abroad , and one of its most lucrative operations .
expanding and diversifying there are now about 750 stores in the uk and although opening rates slowed slightly last year due to expensive property prices , the chain is set to hit the 1,000 mark in the next two to three years .
at the same time , existing stores are expanding and diversifying .
in addition to their staple range of fresh bread , canned goods , ready meals and alcohol , they are starting to sell non-food goods such as books and cds .
tesco has said it is trying to synchronise deliveries .
the improvements have taken a long time to come through ben khosa , councillor , richmond borough council most express stores are in town centres or city suburbs , often close to railway stations and other transport links , ensuring a high level of passing trade .
these are often residential areas , giving the stores a ready customer base , but making it essential they maintain good relations with local communities .
inevitably , the cheek-by-jowl location of many of these stores has led to friction .
" the tesco store is an asset and i think its representatives have shown a willingness to work with the community , but i think they could do more , " says ben khosa , who represents the liberal democrats on richmond borough council in south west london .
he has fielded numerous complaints about the tesco store in neighbouring st margaret 's , mainly due to the traffic chaos it caused after it opened .
several delivery vans often pulled up outside at the same time , blocking access to the bus stop on the high street and causing long tailbacks .
delivery times have angered people living near some stores " tesco has said it is trying to control its fleet of vans and synchronise deliveries .
" the improvements have taken a long time to come through and it has taken a lot of head bashing .
it has been a little bit slow in coming for my liking . "
agreement may have been reached in this instance - only one van can now wait outside the store at any one time - but similar tensions are simmering across the uk .
opening hours most of these concerns surround the noise and congestion generated by the stores , which often open 16 hours a day - 7am to 11pm - seven days a week .
they are not far off being 24/7 hour operations , and their emphasis on fresh food means deliveries can take place late at night or early in the morning .
add in the bright lights and litter which are inevitable features of any retailer , and it is clear some people regard them as an ubiquitous nuisance rather than a real convenience .
when tesco was refused a licence to sell alcohol at a new express store in bournville - a non-drinking village near birmingham - earlier this year , it was widely portrayed as a victory for old-fashioned community values against the onslaught of ravenous consumerism .
express history the first express store opened in 1994 .
up to 3,000 square feet , they sell 7,000 product lines .
they make up about 5 % of tesco 's uk retail space one tesco critic says the firm should understand that some sites are not suitable for express stores due to their size and location .
" delivery lorries arrive at all hours causing even more noise and congestion , " says rex needle , from bourne in lincolnshire , where tesco bought a petrol station from esso in 2002 .
he says disruption has increased significantly since then and he is worried about the knock-on effect on the town 's conservation area , which the store borders .
" planning permission allowed it to become an off licence and the result is one of the worst planning blunders in lincolnshire in recent times . "
' good neighbour ' policy always attuned to public opinion , tesco moved last autumn to address some of the concerns about the wider social impact of its express stores .
it has redesigned many shop fronts to make them less obtrusive and more in keeping with their surroundings and is currently reviewing noise levels and delivery patterns to stores .
deliveries have already been banned at certain times while smaller vans are being used to reduce noise and limit congestion .
suppliers have been encouraged to use smaller vans these efforts are part of the firm 's " good neighbour " approach to convenience store retailing in urban areas , one of ten objectives laid out in its community action plan .
keeping customers onside should not be rocket science and tesco has , so far , proved itself adept at staying one step ahead of the criticism its substantial market power has attracted .
with their attractive mixture of low prices , wide ranges and long opening hours , express stores have a large body of fans , dismissive of what they say is the hypocrisy of their critics .
" people complain but then they go into the shop " says one resident of the south west london suburb of kew , who lives a few doors down from an express store .

it is a relief that your local tesco express is just about to open and that it also has a plentiful supply of pastries as well as your newspaper of choice .
having a tesco convenience store just down the road may justifiably be seen as a luxury by many people .
but tesco 's extraordinary growth - further evidence of which has emerged as it unveiled its annual profits of £ 2.55bn - is making this a reality in more and more parts of the country .
the express convenience chain is tesco 's fastest growing format , both in the uk and abroad , and one of its most lucrative operations .
expanding and diversifying there are now about 750 stores in the uk and although opening rates slowed slightly last year due to expensive property prices , the chain is set to hit the 1,000 mark in the next two to three years .
at the same time , existing stores are expanding and diversifying .
in addition to their staple range of fresh bread , canned goods , ready meals and alcohol , they are starting to sell non-food goods such as books and cds . "
tesco has said it is trying to synchronise deliveries .
the improvements have taken a long time to come through " ben khosa , councillor , richmond borough council most express stores are in town centres or city suburbs , often close to railway stations and other transport links , ensuring a high level of passing trade .
these are often residential areas , giving the stores a ready customer base , but making it essential they maintain good relations with local communities .
inevitably , the cheek-by-jowl location of many of these stores has led to friction .
" the tesco store is an asset and i think its representatives have shown a willingness to work with the community , but i think they could do more , " says ben khosa , who represents the liberal democrats on richmond borough council in south west london .
he has fielded numerous complaints about the tesco store in neighbouring st margaret 's , mainly due to the traffic chaos it caused after it opened .
several delivery vans often pulled up outside at the same time , blocking access to the bus stop on the high street and causing long tailbacks .
" tesco has said it is trying to control its fleet of vans and synchronise deliveries .
" the improvements have taken a long time to come through and it has taken a lot of head bashing .
it has been a little bit slow in coming for my liking . "
agreement may have been reached in this instance - only one van can now wait outside the store at any one time - but similar tensions are simmering across the uk .
opening hours most of these concerns surround the noise and congestion generated by the stores , which often open 16 hours a day - 7am to 11pm - seven days a week .
they are not far off being 24/7 hour operations , and their emphasis on fresh food means deliveries can take place late at night or early in the morning .
