program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 06.07.2007 scandal clouds gather over 2007 tour de france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crossing the line : cycling has moved from individual scandals to widespread criminality the 94th tour de france starts on july 8 under a cloud of scandal that refuses to dissipate .
such is the uncertainty about many of the riders that the line-up for the 2007 tour is still in doubt . many thought that the scandal that overshadowed the 2006 tour was the largest of all time and the investigation that followed would finally uncover the nefarious networks which operate under the radar of the sport 's authorities .
before last year 's race , stars like jan ullrich and ivan basso were excluded with almost 50 other riders due to their alleged associations with the man at the center of a blood-doping circle , the spaniard eufemianos fuentes .
the race went ahead regardless only for the eventual winner , the american floyd landis , to be revealed as a drug cheat a few days after celebrating his success on the champs-elysee .
and yet , despite the admissions , revelations and recriminations arising from the 2006 tour , the 2007 race could be an even more disgraced event .
with the prelude to the race scheduled for saturday , the field of riders is far from being confirmed due to a large number of question marks hanging over many helmeted heads .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas klöden is still not confirmed for the 2007 tour more than 50 riders remain major doubts for the race this year , including co-favorites jens voigt and andreas klöden .
these riders have yet to be signed off by the anti-doping officials of the world cycling federation , the union cycliste internationale -lrb- uci -rrb- .
without uci approval , riders can not take part . " anyone who has a doping suspicion hanging over them at the start need not turn up for the event , " tour de france chief christian prudhomme has said .
while the riders themselves are likely to suffer from being tarred with the doping brush if found to have been involved , the sport is suffering not only from having its reputation repeatedly dragged through the mud but also through the effect the scandals have on sponsorship . " that -lrb- sponsors -rrb- should abandon a system that is manipulated , faked and full of cheats is only normal , " says josef hackforth , professor for sport , media and communication at the munich university of technology .
few top names not tarred with the scandal brush few would argue against that , considering the state of the sport at the moment .
virtually every top rider of the last few years has come under suspicion of being involved in doping .
at least 58 riders are known to have been working with the shamed fuentes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik zabel prayed for forgiveness in recent months 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis has admitted using performance-enhancing drugs , as have former teammates from deutsche telekom 's group , formerly team telekom : eric zabel , udo bölts , bert dietz , christian henn and rolf aldag .
meanwhile , despite admissions from a former team telekom masseur that he injected the rider with the banned blood-boosting drug erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- , 1997 tour winner jan ullrich has maintained his silence , neither confirming nor denying the allegations made against him .
jaksche reveals permissive drug culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaksche claims team chiefs approved doping riders if anyone was still in any doubt that cycling was a secretly permissive environment where doping was practiced , encouraged and tolerated , the interview german rider jörg jaksche gave to the newsmagazine der spiegel in june erased any misconceptions that doping in cycling was just a list of individual indiscretions .
after years of denials and silence , jaksche admitted using banned substances throughout his career with a number of teams .
but more shockingly , jaksche revealed that he had been urged by various team bosses to take the drugs .
jaksche now claims to be clean and that the new controls on riders are making cycling less contaminated than at any time in the last ten years .
team gerolsteiner boss hans-michael holczer agrees but adds , " the tour is cleaner than in the past but it is still not clean . "
fans and media need to take a stand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popularity of cycling remains despite the scandals for cycling to survive , josef hackforth believes , it needs a shock to the system like the sudden and mass exodus of fans not willing to put up with supporting a sport that is riddled with the doping disease . " if the spectators say : we are not interested any more , then cycling would have to act , " he said . " however , this is an illusion .
one stage of the giro d 'italia attracted five million television viewers and hundreds of thousands lined the route .
it seems the interest in these heroes on two wheels refuses to wane despite the doping scandals . "
hackforth also believes the media can play its part but , specifically in germany where public broadcaster ard has come under huge criticism for its bias to team telekom , many channels and outlets are under their own pressure to avoid the doping question .
in a recent survey in germany , two-thirds of the respondents said that their interest in tour coverage would drop off if there was continued reporting on doping allegations .
with ratings at stake , it remains unlikely that the media will be doing its bit to force cycling to clean up . oliver samson -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a nation 's bowel movements are just one of those .
and yet , with obviously nothing better to do , one company could n't resist finding out what germans did on the toilet . it is widely believed that elvis presley died on his while wearing a diaper and enjoying one of his grilled peanut butter , banana , honey and bacon sandwiches .
madonna allegedly insists hers has a new seat fitted every day after having the sealed item inspected by her staff .
people do have the strangest habits when it comes to their toilets – and the germans -lrb- while not quite so anal , if you excuse the pun -rrb- are no exception .
according to a new survey commissioned by toilet paper firm zewa - presumably instigated by people at the company who have nothing better to do - 52 percent of the germans polled admitted to either pondering world events or catching up on literature of choice while on the porcelain throne .
it seems that the country which has given the world many great thinkers and poets continues to be filled by people who take every opportunity to read , even when they are " lightening the load . "
german men tend to favor computer magazines and daily newspapers to help " grease the wheels " while some , 18 percent in fact , even take the opportunity to analyze instruction manuals .
their womenfolk , meanwhile , prefer to pass the time with celebrity magazines and novels .

russia will spend another 9 billion euros to build the needed infrastructure and sports facilities .

sochi organizers acknowledge they have a massive task ahead of them to turn the impoverished resort town into an olympic hub in seven years .
the road from sochi 's seashore to the mountains is narrow and runs through an economically depressed area of small farms .
by 2014 it will have a high-tech train line , new roads , ice arenas , sporting venues and everything else needed for the games .
environmentalists say this transformation will threaten an already fragile ecosystem in the caucus mountains .

" valuable nature is going to be irrevocably destroyed for 16 days of winter olympics , " tennhardt said thursday .
" once again ecological interests are sacrificed for economics . "
sotschi is in the south of russia .
the area has relatively mild weather and in recent years has suffered from climate change .
building an olympic infrastructure will further hurt the area 's delicate ecological balance , tennhardt said .
andrej petrow , head of greenpeace in russia , also criticized the plan to hold the olympics so close to the sochi national park .
" russia does n't adhere to international agreements to protect the world 's natural inheritance and yet the ioc still supports it , " petrow said .
habitats for threatened plant and animal species will be destroyed to make way for luxury sports sites and spas , petrow said .
this goes against russian environmental protection laws and goes against international agreements , petrow said .

chernyshenko said he was confident sochi would meet all requirements and pledges .
" the government has to meet the critical needs of the ioc and we have to manage all the stakeholders such as the management and the investors , " he said .

between 1850 and 1939 five million europeans left from hamburg , most of them headed for the united states .

ballin , who was jewish , saw eastern european jews as an important customer base .

the dormitory facility allowed hapag to keep its customers healthy .

the project 's been controversial because of scientology member tom cruise 's involvement . the german federal film fund -lrb- dfff -rrb- has approved subsidies worth 4.8 million euros -lrb- $ 6.5 million -rrb- for the film " valkyrie . "
" the application was submitted , the criteria for the grant were fulfilled and the project was approved , " said dfff project head christine berg , according to the reuters news service .
the money comes from a new 60-million-euro annual subsidy budget for films by the german government .
to qualify , projects have to involve a german producer and be at least partially made in germany .
the subsidy for " valkyrie " is higher than the total budget for most german films , according to reuters .
a ban on filming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom cruise has already checked out possible filming sites in berlin while that may anger some in germany , the main reason for resistance from some politicians and others is that us actor tom cruise is expected to portray count claus von stauffenberg , who was executed after a failed attempt to kill nazi dictator adolf hitler on july 20 , 1944 .
government officials have already said that they will not grant filming permits for germany 's defense ministry in berlin , where stauffenberg was executed .
while some have given cruise 's membership of scientology as the reason , finance ministry officials , who control state properties , said that filming at the site where stauffenberg was executed has been generally banned because of a previous bad experience .
babelsberg cooperates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : babelsberg 's studios are ready for cruise officials for the babelsberg film studio near berlin meanwhile said that they had signed a cooperation agreement with united artists entertainment , which is partially owned by cruise .
" united artists offers us a great chance to bring this historically relevant story to a worldwide audience , " carl woebcken , the ceo of studio babelsberg said in a press release , adding that studio officials considered cruise the " ideal choice " for the movie 's leading role .

for the central and eastern europen emigrants who headed for the americas starting in 1880 , the cheapest way to reach the new world was to take a train to the north sea coast , then board a ship to cross the atlantic . staging area for american adventure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advertisements for a better life the ballinstadt museum offers visitors replicas of dormitory buildings , using some of the original red bricks , where immigrants stayed before embarking on the long journey to the americas .
albert ballin , general manager of the well-known german shipping company hapag , built the housing complex between 1901 and 1907 .
ballin , who was jewish , saw eastern european jews as an important customer base .
his dormitories had kosher food options .
he also provided space for a synagogue as well as a christian chapel .
the dormitory facility allowed hapag to keep its customers healthy .
it also served as a way to screen those with infectious diseases , who were likely to be barred by us immigration officers at ellis island in new york and sent back to europe at the line 's expense .
the hostel 's comfort also helped hamburg get a competitive edge over bremen and antwerp for shipping customers .
the rivalry continues today .
bremen opened its own emigration museum in 2005 .
both cities are trying to develop a tourist industry based on their history as major port towns . bildunterschrift : the museum shows historic movie footage set in picture frames treasure trove for geneologists besides the dormitories , the museum has a multimedia exhibit describes the ordeal poor people went through to reach the americas and also follows the lives of immigrants once they arrived .
the interactive aspect of the exhibit is designed to appeal to young people .
there 's movie footage , hand-tinted photographs and mannequins who tell emigrants ' stories .
the museum is also a treasure trove for genealogists , with digitalized , searchable passenger lists of emigrants who left from hamburg .
an estimated 20 million americans are direct descendents from the emigrants who left from hamburg .
the museum 's cafe has emigrant-era tables and benches , but serves modern food .
the 12 million euro -lrb- $ 16 million -rrb- emigration museum opened for the general public thursday in hamburg 's veddel neighborhood where 60 percent of the residents are immigrants , most of them from eastern europe and turkey .
the buildings are set in a landscaped area that will double as a public park . dw staff / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the project 's been controversial because of scientology member tom cruise 's involvement . the german federal film fund -lrb- dfff -rrb- has approved subsidies worth 4.8 million euros -lrb- $ 6.5 million -rrb- for the film " valkyrie . "
" the application was submitted , the criteria for the grant were fulfilled and the project was approved , " said dfff project head christine berg , according to the reuters news service .
the money comes from a new 60-million-euro annual subsidy budget for films by the german government .
to qualify , projects have to involve a german producer and be at least partially made in germany .
the subsidy for " valkyrie " is higher than the total budget for most german films , according to reuters .

government officials have already said that they will not grant filming permits for germany 's defense ministry in berlin , where stauffenberg was executed .
while some have given cruise 's membership of scientology as the reason , finance ministry officials , who control state properties , said that filming at the site where stauffenberg was executed has been generally banned because of a previous bad experience .

russia will spend another 9 billion euros to build the needed infrastructure and sports facilities .
russia launched wild celebrations after the international olympic committee 's -lrb- ioc -rrb- decision was announced in guatemala wednesday .
building something from nothing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands celebrated in the resort town early thursday but now reality has set in .
sochi organizers acknowledge they have a massive task ahead of them to turn the impoverished resort town into an olympic hub in seven years .
the road from sochi 's seashore to the mountains is narrow and runs through an economically depressed area of small farms .
by 2014 it will have a high-tech train line , new roads , ice arenas , sporting venues and everything else needed for the games .
environmentalists say this transformation will threaten an already fragile ecosystem in the caucus mountains .
environmental concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sochi has palms and powder the sochi olympics will not be " green , " said thomas tennhardt of the german association for nature conservation -lrb- nabu . -rrb-
" valuable nature is going to be irrevocably destroyed for 16 days of winter olympics , " tennhardt said thursday .
" once again ecological interests are sacrificed for economics . "
sotschi is in the south of russia .
the area has relatively mild weather and in recent years has suffered from climate change .
building an olympic infrastructure will further hurt the area 's delicate ecological balance , tennhardt said .
andrej petrow , head of greenpeace in russia , also criticized the plan to hold the olympics so close to the sochi national park .
" russia does n't adhere to international agreements to protect the world 's natural inheritance and yet the ioc still supports it , " petrow said .
habitats for threatened plant and animal species will be destroyed to make way for luxury sports sites and spas , petrow said .
this goes against russian environmental protection laws and goes against international agreements , petrow said .
russia 's legacy to the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin skis at sochi sochi beat out korean candidate pyeongchang , viewed by many to be the ioc favorites , by 51 votes to 47 .
dmitri chernyshenko , who headed the bid for the russians , said it was time to begin the hard work of turning promises into reality .
chernyshenko said he was confident sochi would meet all requirements and pledges .
" the government has to meet the critical needs of the ioc and we have to manage all the stakeholders such as the management and the investors , " he said .
" it will not just be a process of construction because winning these games will see the implementation of new laws and changes in russian society . "
chernyshenko will fly to switzerland monday to visit ioc personnel .
" this concept is a great legacy for russia and the world , " he said .
" we will succeed as we have now a very experienced team who had one single goal - bringing the olympic games to russia . "
image boost for putin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's win was considered an upset the decision was a major win for russian president vladimir putin , who was a primary champion of the campaign .
putin said the award recognized russia 's sports tradition and important place in the world .
" this is support from one of the most authoritative and independent international organizations - the international olympic committee , " he said .
the german press was critical of the decision .
many editorials pointed out that sochi is not a traditional winter sports destination and that the decision was a major victory for putin , who has recently clashed with europe over decisions seen as anti-democratic .
the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung called the award a " political failure . "
it comes at a time when russia is on an anti-democratic course and the olympics will serve as further propaganda , the newspaper said .
the ioc picked moscow because of its enormous financial power , said an editorial in the frankfurter neue presse .
the newspaper was skeptical of putin 's promise to make sure the area 's environment was protected .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 06.07.2007 interbau : the modernization of germany the international architecture exhibit interbau , which opened on july 6 , 1957 in berlin 's hansa neighborhood , came to be seen as a tangible example of germany 's modernization and a side effect of the cold war . summer 1957 was a hot one , wrote the berliner zeitung .
but soaring temperatures did n't keep some 1.4 million people from visiting the interbau exhibit in berlin . when the show drew to a close in late september , 900,000 people had viewed the hansa neighborhood alone and 375,000 had ridden the chair-lift specially built for the first interbau event , added the berlin paper . in the early 1950s , west berliners had been appalled by the view of the new socialist-style apartment and retail buildings along stalinallee -lrb- today karl-marx-allee -rrb- in east berlin and the enthusiasm with which the young gdr built its workers ' palace , author nikolaus bernau told the berliner zeitung .
as a counterweight to these large-scale soviet building projects , the west decided to reinstate the tradition of architectural exhibitions . competing with the east a response to the gdr 's first major reconstruction plan , interbau was intended to " demonstrate the new , democratic western germany to the outside world , which was on the side of the french , british , italian and americans , not only politically but also culturally , " said bernau . this attitude may explain the project 's exorbitant cost .
instead of reconstructing post-war ruins and making use of the old infrastructure , property was redistributed , streets were rebuilt and the interbau exhibit was viewed as a counterbalance to the monumental structures of 1950s east berlin . the " city of tomorrow " in preparation for the exhibit , an architecture contest was announced .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 06.07.2007 interbau : the modernization of germany the international architecture exhibit interbau , which opened on july 6 , 1957 in berlin 's hansa neighborhood , came to be seen as a tangible example of germany 's modernization and a side effect of the cold war . summer 1957 was a hot one , wrote the berliner zeitung .
but soaring temperatures did n't keep some 1.4 million people from visiting the interbau exhibit in berlin . when the show drew to a close in late september , 900,000 people had viewed the hansa neighborhood alone and 375,000 had ridden the chair-lift specially built for the first interbau event , added the berlin paper . in the early 1950s , west berliners had been appalled by the view of the new socialist-style apartment and retail buildings along stalinallee -lrb- today karl-marx-allee -rrb- in east berlin and the enthusiasm with which the young gdr built its workers ' palace , author nikolaus bernau told the berliner zeitung .
as a counterweight to these large-scale soviet building projects , the west decided to reinstate the tradition of architectural exhibitions . competing with the east a response to the gdr 's first major reconstruction plan , interbau was intended to " demonstrate the new , democratic western germany to the outside world , which was on the side of the french , british , italian and americans , not only politically but also culturally , " said bernau . this attitude may explain the project 's exorbitant cost .
instead of reconstructing post-war ruins and making use of the old infrastructure , property was redistributed , streets were rebuilt and the interbau exhibit was viewed as a counterbalance to the monumental structures of 1950s east berlin . the " city of tomorrow " in preparation for the exhibit , an architecture contest was announced .
willy kreuer and gerhard jobst took the prize with their relaxed building ideas .
in place of the old barrack-like block developments , they generated space by more freely positioning their buildings . public parks were a top priority in what was supposed to be the " city of tomorrow " : a zoological garden was integrated into the hansa neighborhood , which was encircled by high-rises , apartment blocks , single-family homes and churches .
shops , restaurants , a movie theater , a library and the subway at hansa square were to make up the heart of the district . by the time the interbau exhibit ended in 1957 , only 601 of today 's 1,160 apartment units were completed .
the remaining 35 apartment buildings were finished by 1960 . help from abroad fifty-three architects from around the world , some of them internationally renowned , were invited to help .
oscar niemeyer from brazil , arne jacobsen from denmark , alvar aalto from finland and the german bauhaus founder walter gropius - who , according to the berliner zeitung , had considered himself an american since his emigration to the us in 1937 - were among them . arne jacobsen , who fled to sweden during world war two because of his jewish ancestry , built four houses for the berlin exhibit , all in the style of mies van der rohe 's 1930s villas . oscar niemeyer 's only project in germany was completed in honor of the interbau event .
his eight-story apartment block set on v-shaped supports celebrates its 50th anniversary this year - its creator 's 100th birthday . the house of world cultures , then a convention center , and an apartment block by le corbusier in the charlottenburg district were later integrated into the interbau project . the entire interbau collection received landmark status in 1995 . carlos albuquerque -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but soaring temperatures did n't keep some 1.4 million people from visiting the interbau exhibit in berlin . when the show drew to a close in late september , 900,000 people had viewed the hansa neighborhood alone and 375,000 had ridden the chair-lift specially built for the first interbau event , added the berlin paper . in the early 1950s , west berliners had been appalled by the view of the new socialist-style apartment and retail buildings along stalinallee -lrb- today karl-marx-allee -rrb- in east berlin and the enthusiasm with which the young gdr built its workers ' palace , author nikolaus bernau told the berliner zeitung .
as a counterweight to these large-scale soviet building projects , the west decided to reinstate the tradition of architectural exhibitions . competing with the east a response to the gdr 's first major reconstruction plan , interbau was intended to " demonstrate the new , democratic western germany to the outside world , which was on the side of the french , british , italian and americans , not only politically but also culturally , " said bernau . this attitude may explain the project 's exorbitant cost .
instead of reconstructing post-war ruins and making use of the old infrastructure , property was redistributed , streets were rebuilt and the interbau exhibit was viewed as a counterbalance to the monumental structures of 1950s east berlin . the " city of tomorrow " in preparation for the exhibit , an architecture contest was announced .
willy kreuer and gerhard jobst took the prize with their relaxed building ideas .
in place of the old barrack-like block developments , they generated space by more freely positioning their buildings . public parks were a top priority in what was supposed to be the " city of tomorrow " : a zoological garden was integrated into the hansa neighborhood , which was encircled by high-rises , apartment blocks , single-family homes and churches .
shops , restaurants , a movie theater , a library and the subway at hansa square were to make up the heart of the district . by the time the interbau exhibit ended in 1957 , only 601 of today 's 1,160 apartment units were completed .
the remaining 35 apartment buildings were finished by 1960 . help from abroad fifty-three architects from around the world , some of them internationally renowned , were invited to help .
oscar niemeyer from brazil , arne jacobsen from denmark , alvar aalto from finland and the german bauhaus founder walter gropius - who , according to the berliner zeitung , had considered himself an american since his emigration to the us in 1937 - were among them . arne jacobsen , who fled to sweden during world war two because of his jewish ancestry , built four houses for the berlin exhibit , all in the style of mies van der rohe 's 1930s villas . oscar niemeyer 's only project in germany was completed in honor of the interbau event .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 06.07.2007 interbau : the modernization of germany the international architecture exhibit interbau , which opened on july 6 , 1957 in berlin 's hansa neighborhood , came to be seen as a tangible example of germany 's modernization and a side effect of the cold war . summer 1957 was a hot one , wrote the berliner zeitung .
but soaring temperatures did n't keep some 1.4 million people from visiting the interbau exhibit in berlin . when the show drew to a close in late september , 900,000 people had viewed the hansa neighborhood alone and 375,000 had ridden the chair-lift specially built for the first interbau event , added the berlin paper . in the early 1950s , west berliners had been appalled by the view of the new socialist-style apartment and retail buildings along stalinallee -lrb- today karl-marx-allee -rrb- in east berlin and the enthusiasm with which the young gdr built its workers ' palace , author nikolaus bernau told the berliner zeitung .
as a counterweight to these large-scale soviet building projects , the west decided to reinstate the tradition of architectural exhibitions . competing with the east a response to the gdr 's first major reconstruction plan , interbau was intended to " demonstrate the new , democratic western germany to the outside world , which was on the side of the french , british , italian and americans , not only politically but also culturally , " said bernau . this attitude may explain the project 's exorbitant cost .
instead of reconstructing post-war ruins and making use of the old infrastructure , property was redistributed , streets were rebuilt and the interbau exhibit was viewed as a counterbalance to the monumental structures of 1950s east berlin . the " city of tomorrow " in preparation for the exhibit , an architecture contest was announced .
willy kreuer and gerhard jobst took the prize with their relaxed building ideas .
in place of the old barrack-like block developments , they generated space by more freely positioning their buildings . public parks were a top priority in what was supposed to be the " city of tomorrow " : a zoological garden was integrated into the hansa neighborhood , which was encircled by high-rises , apartment blocks , single-family homes and churches .
shops , restaurants , a movie theater , a library and the subway at hansa square were to make up the heart of the district . by the time the interbau exhibit ended in 1957 , only 601 of today 's 1,160 apartment units were completed .
the remaining 35 apartment buildings were finished by 1960 . help from abroad fifty-three architects from around the world , some of them internationally renowned , were invited to help .
oscar niemeyer from brazil , arne jacobsen from denmark , alvar aalto from finland and the german bauhaus founder walter gropius - who , according to the berliner zeitung , had considered himself an american since his emigration to the us in 1937 - were among them . arne jacobsen , who fled to sweden during world war two because of his jewish ancestry , built four houses for the berlin exhibit , all in the style of mies van der rohe 's 1930s villas . oscar niemeyer 's only project in germany was completed in honor of the interbau event .
his eight-story apartment block set on v-shaped supports celebrates its 50th anniversary this year - its creator 's 100th birthday . the house of world cultures , then a convention center , and an apartment block by le corbusier in the charlottenburg district were later integrated into the interbau project . the entire interbau collection received landmark status in 1995 . carlos albuquerque -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the project 's been controversial because of scientology member tom cruise 's involvement . the german federal film fund -lrb- dfff -rrb- has approved subsidies worth 4.8 million euros -lrb- $ 6.5 million -rrb- for the film " valkyrie . "
" the application was submitted , the criteria for the grant were fulfilled and the project was approved , " said dfff project head christine berg , according to the reuters news service .
the money comes from a new 60-million-euro annual subsidy budget for films by the german government .
to qualify , projects have to involve a german producer and be at least partially made in germany .
the subsidy for " valkyrie " is higher than the total budget for most german films , according to reuters .
a ban on filming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom cruise has already checked out possible filming sites in berlin while that may anger some in germany , the main reason for resistance from some politicians and others is that us actor tom cruise is expected to portray count claus von stauffenberg , who was executed after a failed attempt to kill nazi dictator adolf hitler on july 20 , 1944 .
government officials have already said that they will not grant filming permits for germany 's defense ministry in berlin , where stauffenberg was executed .
while some have given cruise 's membership of scientology as the reason , finance ministry officials , who control state properties , said that filming at the site where stauffenberg was executed has been generally banned because of a previous bad experience .
babelsberg cooperates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : babelsberg 's studios are ready for cruise officials for the babelsberg film studio near berlin meanwhile said that they had signed a cooperation agreement with united artists entertainment , which is partially owned by cruise .
" united artists offers us a great chance to bring this historically relevant story to a worldwide audience , " carl woebcken , the ceo of studio babelsberg said in a press release , adding that studio officials considered cruise the " ideal choice " for the movie 's leading role .
filming is expected to start on july 19 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the change will take effect in 2008 , but wo n't save businesses a lot of money . germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , had already passed the change in may .

the grand coalition government of christian democrats and social democrats hope that the change will make germany more attractive to investors and help keep germany 's economic recovery on track .
as a result of the change , companies will be able to cut their tax bills by about 25 million euros -lrb- $ 34 billion -rrb- .

but soaring temperatures did n't keep some 1.4 million people from visiting the interbau exhibit in berlin . when the show drew to a close in late september , 900,000 people had viewed the hansa neighborhood alone and 375,000 had ridden the chair-lift specially built for the first interbau event , added the berlin paper . in the early 1950s , west berliners had been appalled by the view of the new socialist-style apartment and retail buildings along stalinallee -lrb- today karl-marx-allee -rrb- in east berlin and the enthusiasm with which the young gdr built its workers ' palace , author nikolaus bernau told the berliner zeitung .
as a counterweight to these large-scale soviet building projects , the west decided to reinstate the tradition of architectural exhibitions . competing with the east a response to the gdr 's first major reconstruction plan , interbau was intended to " demonstrate the new , democratic western germany to the outside world , which was on the side of the french , british , italian and americans , not only politically but also culturally , " said bernau . this attitude may explain the project 's exorbitant cost .
instead of reconstructing post-war ruins and making use of the old infrastructure , property was redistributed , streets were rebuilt and the interbau exhibit was viewed as a counterbalance to the monumental structures of 1950s east berlin . the " city of tomorrow " in preparation for the exhibit , an architecture contest was announced .

shops , restaurants , a movie theater , a library and the subway at hansa square were to make up the heart of the district . by the time the interbau exhibit ended in 1957 , only 601 of today 's 1,160 apartment units were completed .

between 1850 and 1939 five million europeans left from hamburg , most of them headed for the united states .
for the central and eastern europen emigrants who headed for the americas starting in 1880 , the cheapest way to reach the new world was to take a train to the north sea coast , then board a ship to cross the atlantic . staging area for american adventure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advertisements for a better life the ballinstadt museum offers visitors replicas of dormitory buildings , using some of the original red bricks , where immigrants stayed before embarking on the long journey to the americas .
albert ballin , general manager of the well-known german shipping company hapag , built the housing complex between 1901 and 1907 .
ballin , who was jewish , saw eastern european jews as an important customer base .
his dormitories had kosher food options .
he also provided space for a synagogue as well as a christian chapel .
the dormitory facility allowed hapag to keep its customers healthy .
it also served as a way to screen those with infectious diseases , who were likely to be barred by us immigration officers at ellis island in new york and sent back to europe at the line 's expense .
the hostel 's comfort also helped hamburg get a competitive edge over bremen and antwerp for shipping customers .

the new ballinstadt museum showcases the role hamburg played in the lives of those whose destination was the new world . european emigrants boarded ships for the americas in the search for freedom , tolerance and enough to eat .
between 1850 and 1939 five million europeans left from hamburg , most of them headed for the united states .
for the central and eastern europen emigrants who headed for the americas starting in 1880 , the cheapest way to reach the new world was to take a train to the north sea coast , then board a ship to cross the atlantic . staging area for american adventure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advertisements for a better life the ballinstadt museum offers visitors replicas of dormitory buildings , using some of the original red bricks , where immigrants stayed before embarking on the long journey to the americas .
albert ballin , general manager of the well-known german shipping company hapag , built the housing complex between 1901 and 1907 .
ballin , who was jewish , saw eastern european jews as an important customer base .
his dormitories had kosher food options .
he also provided space for a synagogue as well as a christian chapel .
the dormitory facility allowed hapag to keep its customers healthy .
it also served as a way to screen those with infectious diseases , who were likely to be barred by us immigration officers at ellis island in new york and sent back to europe at the line 's expense .
the hostel 's comfort also helped hamburg get a competitive edge over bremen and antwerp for shipping customers .
the rivalry continues today .
bremen opened its own emigration museum in 2005 .
both cities are trying to develop a tourist industry based on their history as major port towns . bildunterschrift : the museum shows historic movie footage set in picture frames treasure trove for geneologists besides the dormitories , the museum has a multimedia exhibit describes the ordeal poor people went through to reach the americas and also follows the lives of immigrants once they arrived .
the interactive aspect of the exhibit is designed to appeal to young people .
there 's movie footage , hand-tinted photographs and mannequins who tell emigrants ' stories .
the museum is also a treasure trove for genealogists , with digitalized , searchable passenger lists of emigrants who left from hamburg .
an estimated 20 million americans are direct descendents from the emigrants who left from hamburg .
the museum 's cafe has emigrant-era tables and benches , but serves modern food .
the 12 million euro -lrb- $ 16 million -rrb- emigration museum opened for the general public thursday in hamburg 's veddel neighborhood where 60 percent of the residents are immigrants , most of them from eastern europe and turkey .

such is the uncertainty about many of the riders that the line-up for the 2007 tour is still in doubt . many thought that the scandal that overshadowed the 2006 tour was the largest of all time and the investigation that followed would finally uncover the nefarious networks which operate under the radar of the sport 's authorities .
before last year 's race , stars like jan ullrich and ivan basso were excluded with almost 50 other riders due to their alleged associations with the man at the center of a blood-doping circle , the spaniard eufemianos fuentes .
the race went ahead regardless only for the eventual winner , the american floyd landis , to be revealed as a drug cheat a few days after celebrating his success on the champs-elysee .
and yet , despite the admissions , revelations and recriminations arising from the 2006 tour , the 2007 race could be an even more disgraced event .
with the prelude to the race scheduled for saturday , the field of riders is far from being confirmed due to a large number of question marks hanging over many helmeted heads .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas klöden is still not confirmed for the 2007 tour more than 50 riders remain major doubts for the race this year , including co-favorites jens voigt and andreas klöden .
these riders have yet to be signed off by the anti-doping officials of the world cycling federation , the union cycliste internationale -lrb- uci -rrb- .
without uci approval , riders can not take part . " anyone who has a doping suspicion hanging over them at the start need not turn up for the event , " tour de france chief christian prudhomme has said .
while the riders themselves are likely to suffer from being tarred with the doping brush if found to have been involved , the sport is suffering not only from having its reputation repeatedly dragged through the mud but also through the effect the scandals have on sponsorship . " that -lrb- sponsors -rrb- should abandon a system that is manipulated , faked and full of cheats is only normal , " says josef hackforth , professor for sport , media and communication at the munich university of technology .
few top names not tarred with the scandal brush few would argue against that , considering the state of the sport at the moment .
virtually every top rider of the last few years has come under suspicion of being involved in doping .
at least 58 riders are known to have been working with the shamed fuentes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik zabel prayed for forgiveness in recent months 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis has admitted using performance-enhancing drugs , as have former teammates from deutsche telekom 's group , formerly team telekom : eric zabel , udo bölts , bert dietz , christian henn and rolf aldag .
meanwhile , despite admissions from a former team telekom masseur that he injected the rider with the banned blood-boosting drug erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- , 1997 tour winner jan ullrich has maintained his silence , neither confirming nor denying the allegations made against him .
jaksche reveals permissive drug culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaksche claims team chiefs approved doping riders if anyone was still in any doubt that cycling was a secretly permissive environment where doping was practiced , encouraged and tolerated , the interview german rider jörg jaksche gave to the newsmagazine der spiegel in june erased any misconceptions that doping in cycling was just a list of individual indiscretions .
after years of denials and silence , jaksche admitted using banned substances throughout his career with a number of teams .
but more shockingly , jaksche revealed that he had been urged by various team bosses to take the drugs .
jaksche now claims to be clean and that the new controls on riders are making cycling less contaminated than at any time in the last ten years .
team gerolsteiner boss hans-michael holczer agrees but adds , " the tour is cleaner than in the past but it is still not clean . "
fans and media need to take a stand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popularity of cycling remains despite the scandals for cycling to survive , josef hackforth believes , it needs a shock to the system like the sudden and mass exodus of fans not willing to put up with supporting a sport that is riddled with the doping disease . " if the spectators say : we are not interested any more , then cycling would have to act , " he said . " however , this is an illusion .
one stage of the giro d 'italia attracted five million television viewers and hundreds of thousands lined the route .
it seems the interest in these heroes on two wheels refuses to wane despite the doping scandals . "
hackforth also believes the media can play its part but , specifically in germany where public broadcaster ard has come under huge criticism for its bias to team telekom , many channels and outlets are under their own pressure to avoid the doping question .
in a recent survey in germany , two-thirds of the respondents said that their interest in tour coverage would drop off if there was continued reporting on doping allegations .

such is the uncertainty about many of the riders that the line-up for the 2007 tour is still in doubt . many thought that the scandal that overshadowed the 2006 tour was the largest of all time and the investigation that followed would finally uncover the nefarious networks which operate under the radar of the sport 's authorities .
before last year 's race , stars like jan ullrich and ivan basso were excluded with almost 50 other riders due to their alleged associations with the man at the center of a blood-doping circle , the spaniard eufemianos fuentes .
the race went ahead regardless only for the eventual winner , the american floyd landis , to be revealed as a drug cheat a few days after celebrating his success on the champs-elysee .
and yet , despite the admissions , revelations and recriminations arising from the 2006 tour , the 2007 race could be an even more disgraced event .
with the prelude to the race scheduled for saturday , the field of riders is far from being confirmed due to a large number of question marks hanging over many helmeted heads .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas klöden is still not confirmed for the 2007 tour more than 50 riders remain major doubts for the race this year , including co-favorites jens voigt and andreas klöden .
these riders have yet to be signed off by the anti-doping officials of the world cycling federation , the union cycliste internationale -lrb- uci -rrb- .
without uci approval , riders can not take part . " anyone who has a doping suspicion hanging over them at the start need not turn up for the event , " tour de france chief christian prudhomme has said .
while the riders themselves are likely to suffer from being tarred with the doping brush if found to have been involved , the sport is suffering not only from having its reputation repeatedly dragged through the mud but also through the effect the scandals have on sponsorship . " that -lrb- sponsors -rrb- should abandon a system that is manipulated , faked and full of cheats is only normal , " says josef hackforth , professor for sport , media and communication at the munich university of technology .
few top names not tarred with the scandal brush few would argue against that , considering the state of the sport at the moment .
virtually every top rider of the last few years has come under suspicion of being involved in doping .
at least 58 riders are known to have been working with the shamed fuentes .

meanwhile , despite admissions from a former team telekom masseur that he injected the rider with the banned blood-boosting drug erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- , 1997 tour winner jan ullrich has maintained his silence , neither confirming nor denying the allegations made against him .
jaksche reveals permissive drug culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaksche claims team chiefs approved doping riders if anyone was still in any doubt that cycling was a secretly permissive environment where doping was practiced , encouraged and tolerated , the interview german rider jörg jaksche gave to the newsmagazine der spiegel in june erased any misconceptions that doping in cycling was just a list of individual indiscretions .
after years of denials and silence , jaksche admitted using banned substances throughout his career with a number of teams .
but more shockingly , jaksche revealed that he had been urged by various team bosses to take the drugs .
jaksche now claims to be clean and that the new controls on riders are making cycling less contaminated than at any time in the last ten years .
team gerolsteiner boss hans-michael holczer agrees but adds , " the tour is cleaner than in the past but it is still not clean . "
fans and media need to take a stand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popularity of cycling remains despite the scandals for cycling to survive , josef hackforth believes , it needs a shock to the system like the sudden and mass exodus of fans not willing to put up with supporting a sport that is riddled with the doping disease .

jaksche reveals permissive drug culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaksche claims team chiefs approved doping riders if anyone was still in any doubt that cycling was a secretly permissive environment where doping was practiced , encouraged and tolerated , the interview german rider jörg jaksche gave to the newsmagazine der spiegel in june erased any misconceptions that doping in cycling was just a list of individual indiscretions .
after years of denials and silence , jaksche admitted using banned substances throughout his career with a number of teams .
but more shockingly , jaksche revealed that he had been urged by various team bosses to take the drugs .
jaksche now claims to be clean and that the new controls on riders are making cycling less contaminated than at any time in the last ten years .
team gerolsteiner boss hans-michael holczer agrees but adds , " the tour is cleaner than in the past but it is still not clean . "
fans and media need to take a stand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popularity of cycling remains despite the scandals for cycling to survive , josef hackforth believes , it needs a shock to the system like the sudden and mass exodus of fans not willing to put up with supporting a sport that is riddled with the doping disease . " if the spectators say : we are not interested any more , then cycling would have to act , " he said . " however , this is an illusion .
one stage of the giro d 'italia attracted five million television viewers and hundreds of thousands lined the route .
it seems the interest in these heroes on two wheels refuses to wane despite the doping scandals . "
hackforth also believes the media can play its part but , specifically in germany where public broadcaster ard has come under huge criticism for its bias to team telekom , many channels and outlets are under their own pressure to avoid the doping question .
in a recent survey in germany , two-thirds of the respondents said that their interest in tour coverage would drop off if there was continued reporting on doping allegations .
with ratings at stake , it remains unlikely that the media will be doing its bit to force cycling to clean up . oliver samson -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

sochi organizers acknowledge they have a massive task ahead of them to turn the impoverished resort town into an olympic hub in seven years .
the road from sochi 's seashore to the mountains is narrow and runs through an economically depressed area of small farms .
by 2014 it will have a high-tech train line , new roads , ice arenas , sporting venues and everything else needed for the games .
environmentalists say this transformation will threaten an already fragile ecosystem in the caucus mountains .

" once again ecological interests are sacrificed for economics . "
sotschi is in the south of russia .
the area has relatively mild weather and in recent years has suffered from climate change .
building an olympic infrastructure will further hurt the area 's delicate ecological balance , tennhardt said .
andrej petrow , head of greenpeace in russia , also criticized the plan to hold the olympics so close to the sochi national park .
" russia does n't adhere to international agreements to protect the world 's natural inheritance and yet the ioc still supports it , " petrow said .
habitats for threatened plant and animal species will be destroyed to make way for luxury sports sites and spas , petrow said .
this goes against russian environmental protection laws and goes against international agreements , petrow said .

chernyshenko said he was confident sochi would meet all requirements and pledges .
" the government has to meet the critical needs of the ioc and we have to manage all the stakeholders such as the management and the investors , " he said .

the project 's been controversial because of scientology member tom cruise 's involvement . the german federal film fund -lrb- dfff -rrb- has approved subsidies worth 4.8 million euros -lrb- $ 6.5 million -rrb- for the film " valkyrie . "
" the application was submitted , the criteria for the grant were fulfilled and the project was approved , " said dfff project head christine berg , according to the reuters news service .
the money comes from a new 60-million-euro annual subsidy budget for films by the german government .
to qualify , projects have to involve a german producer and be at least partially made in germany .
the subsidy for " valkyrie " is higher than the total budget for most german films , according to reuters .
a ban on filming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom cruise has already checked out possible filming sites in berlin while that may anger some in germany , the main reason for resistance from some politicians and others is that us actor tom cruise is expected to portray count claus von stauffenberg , who was executed after a failed attempt to kill nazi dictator adolf hitler on july 20 , 1944 .
government officials have already said that they will not grant filming permits for germany 's defense ministry in berlin , where stauffenberg was executed .
while some have given cruise 's membership of scientology as the reason , finance ministry officials , who control state properties , said that filming at the site where stauffenberg was executed has been generally banned because of a previous bad experience .
babelsberg cooperates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : babelsberg 's studios are ready for cruise officials for the babelsberg film studio near berlin meanwhile said that they had signed a cooperation agreement with united artists entertainment , which is partially owned by cruise .

filming is expected to start on july 19 . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

detailed information about who politicians work for and how much money they make went public after germany 's federal constitutional court ruled wednesday that the highly paid side jobs could compromise parliamentarians ' independence .
the public has a right to know if representatives earn money on the side , the court ruled . politicians have privacy concerns politicians have complained that jobs held before being elected are listed in the same way as those held while in office .

in this case , the right to privacy was secondary to the public interest in transparency , the court ruled .
transparency international endorsed the decision with the organization 's german head calling for even more transparency . " we are waiting for more openness from the parliamentarians and from everyone a more exact breakdown of the payments , " christian humborg told the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung . corruption concerns fueled legislation the issue started with the previous social democrat-green government in 2005 in response to a scandal about parliamentarians who were on the payrolls of german corporations .
many did n't seem to do much to earn the extra incomes . the revelations of these plum side jobs cost some politicians their jobs .

politicians must indicate approximately how much they earn by choosing between three different categories .
the parliament passed a bill in 2005 requiring the information on income earned from side jobs to be made public .
nine politicians from several political parties brought a court case to stop the law , saying that it violated their privacy .
of the politicians that brought the court case , one is a businessman , one owns an insurance company and seven are lawyers .

a nation 's bowel movements are just one of those .
and yet , with obviously nothing better to do , one company could n't resist finding out what germans did on the toilet . it is widely believed that elvis presley died on his while wearing a diaper and enjoying one of his grilled peanut butter , banana , honey and bacon sandwiches .
madonna allegedly insists hers has a new seat fitted every day after having the sealed item inspected by her staff .
people do have the strangest habits when it comes to their toilets – and the germans -lrb- while not quite so anal , if you excuse the pun -rrb- are no exception .
according to a new survey commissioned by toilet paper firm zewa - presumably instigated by people at the company who have nothing better to do - 52 percent of the germans polled admitted to either pondering world events or catching up on literature of choice while on the porcelain throne .
it seems that the country which has given the world many great thinkers and poets continues to be filled by people who take every opportunity to read , even when they are " lightening the load . "
german men tend to favor computer magazines and daily newspapers to help " grease the wheels " while some , 18 percent in fact , even take the opportunity to analyze instruction manuals .
their womenfolk , meanwhile , prefer to pass the time with celebrity magazines and novels .
men take their sweet time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " help !
i got cramp ! "
german men also seem to take longer to get through their ablutions and reading material than german women .
the study shows that 34 percent of men spend between five and ten minutes on the toilet , which is unsurprising given the level of technical language and geopolitical debate in their chosen reading material .
real connoisseurs , some 16 percent of those polled , go from cover to cover in mammoth sessions lasting between ten and 15 minutes .
the ladies seem to have a pavlovian response to reading on the toilet with 49 percent of them getting in and out between two to five minutes , giving them barely enough time to flick a page of their favored spy or suspense paperback .
-lrb- apparently romantic fiction does not sit well on the toilet . -rrb-
not all germans combine bowel movements with a spot of light reading .
the survey shows that 34 percent of germans actually do nothing other than what nature intended when they go to the lavatory .
these must be the thinkers , rather than the poets .
music lovers go for an ipoo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans like to bring their own soundtrack young germans bring their own modern take on passing time in the smallest room in the house .
the survey showed that 26 percent of 14-29 year olds listen to music on the loo .
one can only speculate whether specific playlists are compiled for these visits .
if they are , one might assume that songs like " -lrb- i can ’ t get no -rrb- satisfaction " by the rolling stones and " can ’ t stand the strain " by funkadelic would be omitted .
the same percentage of 14-29 year olds also send sms messages while going through the motions .
the mind boggles at what information these messages could possibly contain .
elsewhere in the study , statistics point to a trend of more leisurely visits in the twilight years of life with almost half of those polled over 50 years old saying they do absolutely nothing in the toilet .
this 49 percent obviously need more roughage in their diet .
there are also regional differences in toilet habits within germany .
just less than half of those inhabitants from mecklenburg-west pomerania who were polled tend to day-dream during their nirvana-esque bouts of relief-inspired enlightenment .
i did it " my way " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what will it be today ?
oklahoma or big spender ? "
meanwhile , the toilets of saxony-anhalt are alive with the sound of incumbents crooning " my way " , with ten percent of those polled admitting to making the most of the acoustics by belting out a few show tunes and standards while relieving themselves .
it certainly seems that anything goes in germany once that sign on the door flips from " vacant " to " occupied . "

a nation 's bowel movements are just one of those .
and yet , with obviously nothing better to do , one company could n't resist finding out what germans did on the toilet . it is widely believed that elvis presley died on his while wearing a diaper and enjoying one of his grilled peanut butter , banana , honey and bacon sandwiches .
madonna allegedly insists hers has a new seat fitted every day after having the sealed item inspected by her staff .
people do have the strangest habits when it comes to their toilets – and the germans -lrb- while not quite so anal , if you excuse the pun -rrb- are no exception .
according to a new survey commissioned by toilet paper firm zewa - presumably instigated by people at the company who have nothing better to do - 52 percent of the germans polled admitted to either pondering world events or catching up on literature of choice while on the porcelain throne .
it seems that the country which has given the world many great thinkers and poets continues to be filled by people who take every opportunity to read , even when they are " lightening the load . "
german men tend to favor computer magazines and daily newspapers to help " grease the wheels " while some , 18 percent in fact , even take the opportunity to analyze instruction manuals .
their womenfolk , meanwhile , prefer to pass the time with celebrity magazines and novels .
men take their sweet time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " help !
i got cramp ! "
german men also seem to take longer to get through their ablutions and reading material than german women .
the study shows that 34 percent of men spend between five and ten minutes on the toilet , which is unsurprising given the level of technical language and geopolitical debate in their chosen reading material .
real connoisseurs , some 16 percent of those polled , go from cover to cover in mammoth sessions lasting between ten and 15 minutes .
the ladies seem to have a pavlovian response to reading on the toilet with 49 percent of them getting in and out between two to five minutes , giving them barely enough time to flick a page of their favored spy or suspense paperback .
-lrb- apparently romantic fiction does not sit well on the toilet . -rrb-
not all germans combine bowel movements with a spot of light reading .
the survey shows that 34 percent of germans actually do nothing other than what nature intended when they go to the lavatory .
these must be the thinkers , rather than the poets .
music lovers go for an ipoo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans like to bring their own soundtrack young germans bring their own modern take on passing time in the smallest room in the house .
the survey showed that 26 percent of 14-29 year olds listen to music on the loo .
one can only speculate whether specific playlists are compiled for these visits .
if they are , one might assume that songs like " -lrb- i can ’ t get no -rrb- satisfaction " by the rolling stones and " can ’ t stand the strain " by funkadelic would be omitted .
the same percentage of 14-29 year olds also send sms messages while going through the motions .
the mind boggles at what information these messages could possibly contain .
elsewhere in the study , statistics point to a trend of more leisurely visits in the twilight years of life with almost half of those polled over 50 years old saying they do absolutely nothing in the toilet .
this 49 percent obviously need more roughage in their diet .
there are also regional differences in toilet habits within germany .
just less than half of those inhabitants from mecklenburg-west pomerania who were polled tend to day-dream during their nirvana-esque bouts of relief-inspired enlightenment .
i did it " my way " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what will it be today ?
oklahoma or big spender ? "
meanwhile , the toilets of saxony-anhalt are alive with the sound of incumbents crooning " my way " , with ten percent of those polled admitting to making the most of the acoustics by belting out a few show tunes and standards while relieving themselves .

the information is misleading and unfair , they say .
a court ruled it 's necessary to bring more transparency to german politics . a day after germany 's highest court ruled that information about the extra money politicians earn from side jobs should be made public , the information was posted on the german parliament 's web site .
politicians have been quick to criticize the move , saying the information is misleading and unfair .
detailed information about who politicians work for and how much money they make went public after germany 's federal constitutional court ruled wednesday that the highly paid side jobs could compromise parliamentarians ' independence .
the public has a right to know if representatives earn money on the side , the court ruled . politicians have privacy concerns politicians have complained that jobs held before being elected are listed in the same way as those held while in office .
they also feel it reveals proprietary business information to competitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians practice law on the side germany 's highest court dismissed privacy concerns .
in this case , the right to privacy was secondary to the public interest in transparency , the court ruled .
transparency international endorsed the decision with the organization 's german head calling for even more transparency . " we are waiting for more openness from the parliamentarians and from everyone a more exact breakdown of the payments , " christian humborg told the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung . corruption concerns fueled legislation the issue started with the previous social democrat-green government in 2005 in response to a scandal about parliamentarians who were on the payrolls of german corporations .
many did n't seem to do much to earn the extra incomes . the revelations of these plum side jobs cost some politicians their jobs .
it also raised concerns in the country about possible corruption and a conflict of interest if politicians were closely connected to big companies .
some also questioned why politicians , who are paid well in germany , needed to take up another job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians are a well-paid group german parliamentarians get a monthly salary of approximately 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 9,500 . -rrb-
the ruling requires all extra monthly income over 1,000 euros -lrb- 1,360 dollars -rrb- to be declared .
politicians must indicate approximately how much they earn by choosing between three different categories .
the parliament passed a bill in 2005 requiring the information on income earned from side jobs to be made public .
nine politicians from several political parties brought a court case to stop the law , saying that it violated their privacy .
of the politicians that brought the court case , one is a businessman , one owns an insurance company and seven are lawyers .
a quarter of the members of parliament are attorneys .
they are concerned that the law interferes with client confidentiality .
bernhard dombek , president of the german federal bar association , was critical of the law .
although it does n't require that attorneys list the names of their clients , it will be easier to figure out who they are , dombek told the tagesspiegel daily .
he predicted people will be less interested in serving as politicians . some changes possible olaf scholz of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said friday that a careful examination will take place of the reasons the judges gave for the decision , and any practical problems will be dealt with .
the spd will suggest any " practicable changes for the future , " scholz told the dpa news agency . christian lange , who introduced the original measure for the spd , said parliamentarians needed to have more " respect and humility " for the decision made by the court .
politicians should obey the law instead of questioning it , lange said . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 06.07.2007 study reveals germany 's toilet habits whether you like it or not großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans get up to many things in the toilet , including , it seems , turning to the dark side some things should remain private .
a nation 's bowel movements are just one of those .
and yet , with obviously nothing better to do , one company could n't resist finding out what germans did on the toilet . it is widely believed that elvis presley died on his while wearing a diaper and enjoying one of his grilled peanut butter , banana , honey and bacon sandwiches .
madonna allegedly insists hers has a new seat fitted every day after having the sealed item inspected by her staff .
people do have the strangest habits when it comes to their toilets – and the germans -lrb- while not quite so anal , if you excuse the pun -rrb- are no exception .
according to a new survey commissioned by toilet paper firm zewa - presumably instigated by people at the company who have nothing better to do - 52 percent of the germans polled admitted to either pondering world events or catching up on literature of choice while on the porcelain throne .
it seems that the country which has given the world many great thinkers and poets continues to be filled by people who take every opportunity to read , even when they are " lightening the load . "
german men tend to favor computer magazines and daily newspapers to help " grease the wheels " while some , 18 percent in fact , even take the opportunity to analyze instruction manuals .
their womenfolk , meanwhile , prefer to pass the time with celebrity magazines and novels .
men take their sweet time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " help !
i got cramp ! "
german men also seem to take longer to get through their ablutions and reading material than german women .
the study shows that 34 percent of men spend between five and ten minutes on the toilet , which is unsurprising given the level of technical language and geopolitical debate in their chosen reading material .
real connoisseurs , some 16 percent of those polled , go from cover to cover in mammoth sessions lasting between ten and 15 minutes .
the ladies seem to have a pavlovian response to reading on the toilet with 49 percent of them getting in and out between two to five minutes , giving them barely enough time to flick a page of their favored spy or suspense paperback .
-lrb- apparently romantic fiction does not sit well on the toilet . -rrb-
not all germans combine bowel movements with a spot of light reading .
the survey shows that 34 percent of germans actually do nothing other than what nature intended when they go to the lavatory .
these must be the thinkers , rather than the poets .
music lovers go for an ipoo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans like to bring their own soundtrack young germans bring their own modern take on passing time in the smallest room in the house .
the survey showed that 26 percent of 14-29 year olds listen to music on the loo .
one can only speculate whether specific playlists are compiled for these visits .
if they are , one might assume that songs like " -lrb- i can ’ t get no -rrb- satisfaction " by the rolling stones and " can ’ t stand the strain " by funkadelic would be omitted .
the same percentage of 14-29 year olds also send sms messages while going through the motions .
the mind boggles at what information these messages could possibly contain .
elsewhere in the study , statistics point to a trend of more leisurely visits in the twilight years of life with almost half of those polled over 50 years old saying they do absolutely nothing in the toilet .
this 49 percent obviously need more roughage in their diet .
there are also regional differences in toilet habits within germany .
just less than half of those inhabitants from mecklenburg-west pomerania who were polled tend to day-dream during their nirvana-esque bouts of relief-inspired enlightenment .
i did it " my way " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what will it be today ?
oklahoma or big spender ? "
meanwhile , the toilets of saxony-anhalt are alive with the sound of incumbents crooning " my way " , with ten percent of those polled admitting to making the most of the acoustics by belting out a few show tunes and standards while relieving themselves .
it certainly seems that anything goes in germany once that sign on the door flips from " vacant " to " occupied . "

dw-world.de toilets beware , germans follow directions to the dot gps navigation systems are beginning to get a bad rep in germany .
that 's probably because germans are actually too good at following instructions .
even when they are told to crash into a toilet shack .
-lrb- 23.10.2006 -rrb- flushed with german pride when american gis in iraq get the call of nature , they politely ask to be excused and tiptoe off to the ladies ' room .
no matter when and where , because their german toilets are like flying carpets : they go everywhere .

a nation 's bowel movements are just one of those .
and yet , with obviously nothing better to do , one company could n't resist finding out what germans did on the toilet . it is widely believed that elvis presley died on his while wearing a diaper and enjoying one of his grilled peanut butter , banana , honey and bacon sandwiches .
madonna allegedly insists hers has a new seat fitted every day after having the sealed item inspected by her staff .
people do have the strangest habits when it comes to their toilets – and the germans -lrb- while not quite so anal , if you excuse the pun -rrb- are no exception .
according to a new survey commissioned by toilet paper firm zewa - presumably instigated by people at the company who have nothing better to do - 52 percent of the germans polled admitted to either pondering world events or catching up on literature of choice while on the porcelain throne .
it seems that the country which has given the world many great thinkers and poets continues to be filled by people who take every opportunity to read , even when they are " lightening the load . "
german men tend to favor computer magazines and daily newspapers to help " grease the wheels " while some , 18 percent in fact , even take the opportunity to analyze instruction manuals .
their womenfolk , meanwhile , prefer to pass the time with celebrity magazines and novels .
men take their sweet time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " help !
i got cramp ! "
german men also seem to take longer to get through their ablutions and reading material than german women .
the study shows that 34 percent of men spend between five and ten minutes on the toilet , which is unsurprising given the level of technical language and geopolitical debate in their chosen reading material .
real connoisseurs , some 16 percent of those polled , go from cover to cover in mammoth sessions lasting between ten and 15 minutes .
the ladies seem to have a pavlovian response to reading on the toilet with 49 percent of them getting in and out between two to five minutes , giving them barely enough time to flick a page of their favored spy or suspense paperback .
-lrb- apparently romantic fiction does not sit well on the toilet . -rrb-
not all germans combine bowel movements with a spot of light reading .
the survey shows that 34 percent of germans actually do nothing other than what nature intended when they go to the lavatory .
these must be the thinkers , rather than the poets .
music lovers go for an ipoo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans like to bring their own soundtrack young germans bring their own modern take on passing time in the smallest room in the house .
the survey showed that 26 percent of 14-29 year olds listen to music on the loo .
one can only speculate whether specific playlists are compiled for these visits .
if they are , one might assume that songs like " -lrb- i can ’ t get no -rrb- satisfaction " by the rolling stones and " can ’ t stand the strain " by funkadelic would be omitted .
the same percentage of 14-29 year olds also send sms messages while going through the motions .
the mind boggles at what information these messages could possibly contain .
elsewhere in the study , statistics point to a trend of more leisurely visits in the twilight years of life with almost half of those polled over 50 years old saying they do absolutely nothing in the toilet .
this 49 percent obviously need more roughage in their diet .
there are also regional differences in toilet habits within germany .
just less than half of those inhabitants from mecklenburg-west pomerania who were polled tend to day-dream during their nirvana-esque bouts of relief-inspired enlightenment .
i did it " my way " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what will it be today ?
oklahoma or big spender ? "
meanwhile , the toilets of saxony-anhalt are alive with the sound of incumbents crooning " my way " , with ten percent of those polled admitting to making the most of the acoustics by belting out a few show tunes and standards while relieving themselves .

a nation 's bowel movements are just one of those .
and yet , with obviously nothing better to do , one company could n't resist finding out what germans did on the toilet . it is widely believed that elvis presley died on his while wearing a diaper and enjoying one of his grilled peanut butter , banana , honey and bacon sandwiches .
madonna allegedly insists hers has a new seat fitted every day after having the sealed item inspected by her staff .
people do have the strangest habits when it comes to their toilets – and the germans -lrb- while not quite so anal , if you excuse the pun -rrb- are no exception .
according to a new survey commissioned by toilet paper firm zewa - presumably instigated by people at the company who have nothing better to do - 52 percent of the germans polled admitted to either pondering world events or catching up on literature of choice while on the porcelain throne .
it seems that the country which has given the world many great thinkers and poets continues to be filled by people who take every opportunity to read , even when they are " lightening the load . "
german men tend to favor computer magazines and daily newspapers to help " grease the wheels " while some , 18 percent in fact , even take the opportunity to analyze instruction manuals .
their womenfolk , meanwhile , prefer to pass the time with celebrity magazines and novels .
men take their sweet time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " help !
i got cramp ! "
german men also seem to take longer to get through their ablutions and reading material than german women .
the study shows that 34 percent of men spend between five and ten minutes on the toilet , which is unsurprising given the level of technical language and geopolitical debate in their chosen reading material .
real connoisseurs , some 16 percent of those polled , go from cover to cover in mammoth sessions lasting between ten and 15 minutes .
the ladies seem to have a pavlovian response to reading on the toilet with 49 percent of them getting in and out between two to five minutes , giving them barely enough time to flick a page of their favored spy or suspense paperback .
-lrb- apparently romantic fiction does not sit well on the toilet . -rrb-
not all germans combine bowel movements with a spot of light reading .
the survey shows that 34 percent of germans actually do nothing other than what nature intended when they go to the lavatory .
these must be the thinkers , rather than the poets .
music lovers go for an ipoo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans like to bring their own soundtrack young germans bring their own modern take on passing time in the smallest room in the house .
the survey showed that 26 percent of 14-29 year olds listen to music on the loo .
one can only speculate whether specific playlists are compiled for these visits .
if they are , one might assume that songs like " -lrb- i can ’ t get no -rrb- satisfaction " by the rolling stones and " can ’ t stand the strain " by funkadelic would be omitted .
the same percentage of 14-29 year olds also send sms messages while going through the motions .
the mind boggles at what information these messages could possibly contain .
elsewhere in the study , statistics point to a trend of more leisurely visits in the twilight years of life with almost half of those polled over 50 years old saying they do absolutely nothing in the toilet .
this 49 percent obviously need more roughage in their diet .
there are also regional differences in toilet habits within germany .
just less than half of those inhabitants from mecklenburg-west pomerania who were polled tend to day-dream during their nirvana-esque bouts of relief-inspired enlightenment .
i did it " my way " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what will it be today ?
oklahoma or big spender ? "
meanwhile , the toilets of saxony-anhalt are alive with the sound of incumbents crooning " my way " , with ten percent of those polled admitting to making the most of the acoustics by belting out a few show tunes and standards while relieving themselves .
it certainly seems that anything goes in germany once that sign on the door flips from " vacant " to " occupied . "

the change will take effect in 2008 , but wo n't save businesses a lot of money . germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , had already passed the change in may .
from 2008 , the corporate tax rate will now be lowered from 38.7 percent to 29.8 percent , taking germany from its current position as one of the eu countries with the highest rates to the middle field .
the grand coalition government of christian democrats and social democrats hope that the change will make germany more attractive to investors and help keep germany 's economic recovery on track .
as a result of the change , companies will be able to cut their tax bills by about 25 million euros -lrb- $ 34 billion -rrb- .
at the same time , however , the government hopes that it will make up for the lost revenue by eliminating tax breaks and loopholes . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

such is the uncertainty about many of the riders that the line-up for the 2007 tour is still in doubt . many thought that the scandal that overshadowed the 2006 tour was the largest of all time and the investigation that followed would finally uncover the nefarious networks which operate under the radar of the sport 's authorities .
before last year 's race , stars like jan ullrich and ivan basso were excluded with almost 50 other riders due to their alleged associations with the man at the center of a blood-doping circle , the spaniard eufemianos fuentes .
the race went ahead regardless only for the eventual winner , the american floyd landis , to be revealed as a drug cheat a few days after celebrating his success on the champs-elysee .
and yet , despite the admissions , revelations and recriminations arising from the 2006 tour , the 2007 race could be an even more disgraced event .
with the prelude to the race scheduled for saturday , the field of riders is far from being confirmed due to a large number of question marks hanging over many helmeted heads .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas klöden is still not confirmed for the 2007 tour more than 50 riders remain major doubts for the race this year , including co-favorites jens voigt and andreas klöden .

without uci approval , riders can not take part . " anyone who has a doping suspicion hanging over them at the start need not turn up for the event , " tour de france chief christian prudhomme has said .
while the riders themselves are likely to suffer from being tarred with the doping brush if found to have been involved , the sport is suffering not only from having its reputation repeatedly dragged through the mud but also through the effect the scandals have on sponsorship . " that -lrb- sponsors -rrb- should abandon a system that is manipulated , faked and full of cheats is only normal , " says josef hackforth , professor for sport , media and communication at the munich university of technology .
few top names not tarred with the scandal brush few would argue against that , considering the state of the sport at the moment .
virtually every top rider of the last few years has come under suspicion of being involved in doping .

meanwhile , despite admissions from a former team telekom masseur that he injected the rider with the banned blood-boosting drug erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- , 1997 tour winner jan ullrich has maintained his silence , neither confirming nor denying the allegations made against him .

after years of denials and silence , jaksche admitted using banned substances throughout his career with a number of teams .
but more shockingly , jaksche revealed that he had been urged by various team bosses to take the drugs .
jaksche now claims to be clean and that the new controls on riders are making cycling less contaminated than at any time in the last ten years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 06.07.2007 germany , france raise bird flu risk level after new h5n1 cases großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fear that the h5n1 strain will jump to humans has contributed to high alert levels germany has raised its bird flu risk assessment level after it was reported that 38 new cases of the deadly h5n1 strain were discovered in the country 's east .
france also reported new cases and upped its own alert . germany ' top state veterinary laboratory raised the risk level after more wild birds had tested positive for h5n1 in the eastern states of saxony-anhalt and thuringia . " we will raise the threat level , " a spokeswoman for the friedrich löffler institute told reporters .
the regional authorities in sangerhausen in saxony-anhalt reported that 38 dead birds found on the shores of an artificial lake near the town of kelbra had all tested positive .
saxony-anhalt is the fourth of germany 's 16 states to report cases of h5n1 bird flu since late last month , when it struck down six wild birds in the southern city of nuremberg in bavaria .
on tuesday , a bird found on the other side of the lake which is in thuringia was confirmed to have had h5n1 bird flu .
cases have also been reported near leipzig in the neighboring eastern state of saxony , bordering the czech republic which is battling a more severe outbreak of the h5n1 avian flu .
german poultry as yet unaffected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wild birds have so far been the only ones affected the friedrich löffler institute suggested the disease could have jumped the border from the czech side where it has infected turkey and chicken farms .
so far in germany the new outbreak has been restricted to swans , geese and other wild birds and has not affected poultry farms .
germany battled a widespread bird flu epidemic in 2006 .
it broke out on the baltic sea island of rügen and spread to six states , including bavaria .
the disease spread to mammals , infecting three cats and a stone marten , but did not affect humans .
in neighboring france , europe 's biggest poultry producer , authorities stepped up surveillance after tests on three dead swans confirmed an h5n1 outbreak .
agriculture minister michel barnier raised the threat level from bird flu from " moderate " to “ high " following the test results on the swans that were found dead in northeast france last week .
france on high alert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emergency plans are swinging into action in france it is france 's second outbreak of the deadly strain of bird flu in 17 months , but health minister roselyne bachelot said there was no reason for alarm . " france is not threatened by a bird flu pandemic as there has not been , for the moment , a human contamination from the h5n1 virus , " bachelot said .
but she added " we must be vigilant as the great flu epidemic that followed the war of 1914 , the spanish flu " came from a strain of bird flu .
scientists believe a strain related to today 's bird flu virus caused the death of tens of millions of people during the spanish flu pandemic .
" we must do what is necessary to ensure that all of the agencies , the entire health system is ready to deal with a mutation of the virus " that could attack humans , said bachelot on french television .
fresh measures were ordered to ensure that chickens and other poultry did not enter into contact with wild birds and that they underwent monthly veterinary checks .
pigeon competitions have been banned and security around a one-kilometer -lrb- 0.6 mile -rrb- exclusion zone established around the pond in the moselle department where the dead swans were discovered has been beefed up .
a second 15-kilometer " observation " zone was set up around the pond at assenoncourt but a spokesman for the local municipality said no other dead birds had been found there , which he described as a " reassuring " sign .
french poultry farms ready for lockdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poultry farms dread having to cull their flocks " these measures apply to all farms that must be protected from wild birds that fly overhead .
these protective measures are nets and a ban on bringing birds together in public places and at markets , " barnier said .
officials put three farms in the observation zone under quarantine , and restricted access to roads in the area .
" with these measures that we are taking , the risk of contamination will be very small , " said philippe hestroffer , of the regional veterinary services .
a first outbreak of h5n1 in february 2006 was detected in 62 dead birds in central france and spread to a farm near the town of versailleux where hundreds of turkeys were slaughtered .
it was also the first outbreak of the virulent strain in the european union .
france produces 900 million poultry per year including 700 million chickens , according to the confederation of french poultry producers .
the sector employs 80,000 people and generated four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- last year .
authorities act in the netherlands in the netherlands , the authorities ordered all poultry to be kept inside .
they announced the measure after what they called the discovery of a bird flu case " not far from the netherlands . "
while the bird flu virus is highly contagious among poultry and can spread to an entire flock , it remains difficult for humans to catch .
a total of 191 people worldwide have died of bird flu , according to the world health organization , which has reported 317 cases in its june 29 tally .

france also reported new cases and upped its own alert . germany ' top state veterinary laboratory raised the risk level after more wild birds had tested positive for h5n1 in the eastern states of saxony-anhalt and thuringia . " we will raise the threat level , " a spokeswoman for the friedrich löffler institute told reporters .
the regional authorities in sangerhausen in saxony-anhalt reported that 38 dead birds found on the shores of an artificial lake near the town of kelbra had all tested positive .
saxony-anhalt is the fourth of germany 's 16 states to report cases of h5n1 bird flu since late last month , when it struck down six wild birds in the southern city of nuremberg in bavaria .
on tuesday , a bird found on the other side of the lake which is in thuringia was confirmed to have had h5n1 bird flu .
cases have also been reported near leipzig in the neighboring eastern state of saxony , bordering the czech republic which is battling a more severe outbreak of the h5n1 avian flu .
german poultry as yet unaffected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wild birds have so far been the only ones affected the friedrich löffler institute suggested the disease could have jumped the border from the czech side where it has infected turkey and chicken farms .
so far in germany the new outbreak has been restricted to swans , geese and other wild birds and has not affected poultry farms .
germany battled a widespread bird flu epidemic in 2006 .
it broke out on the baltic sea island of rügen and spread to six states , including bavaria .
the disease spread to mammals , infecting three cats and a stone marten , but did not affect humans .
in neighboring france , europe 's biggest poultry producer , authorities stepped up surveillance after tests on three dead swans confirmed an h5n1 outbreak .
agriculture minister michel barnier raised the threat level from bird flu from " moderate " to “ high " following the test results on the swans that were found dead in northeast france last week .
france on high alert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emergency plans are swinging into action in france it is france 's second outbreak of the deadly strain of bird flu in 17 months , but health minister roselyne bachelot said there was no reason for alarm . " france is not threatened by a bird flu pandemic as there has not been , for the moment , a human contamination from the h5n1 virus , " bachelot said .
but she added " we must be vigilant as the great flu epidemic that followed the war of 1914 , the spanish flu " came from a strain of bird flu .
scientists believe a strain related to today 's bird flu virus caused the death of tens of millions of people during the spanish flu pandemic .
" we must do what is necessary to ensure that all of the agencies , the entire health system is ready to deal with a mutation of the virus " that could attack humans , said bachelot on french television .
fresh measures were ordered to ensure that chickens and other poultry did not enter into contact with wild birds and that they underwent monthly veterinary checks .
pigeon competitions have been banned and security around a one-kilometer -lrb- 0.6 mile -rrb- exclusion zone established around the pond in the moselle department where the dead swans were discovered has been beefed up .

russia will spend another 9 billion euros to build the needed infrastructure and sports facilities .
russia launched wild celebrations after the international olympic committee 's -lrb- ioc -rrb- decision was announced in guatemala wednesday .
building something from nothing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands celebrated in the resort town early thursday but now reality has set in .
sochi organizers acknowledge they have a massive task ahead of them to turn the impoverished resort town into an olympic hub in seven years .
the road from sochi 's seashore to the mountains is narrow and runs through an economically depressed area of small farms .
by 2014 it will have a high-tech train line , new roads , ice arenas , sporting venues and everything else needed for the games .
environmentalists say this transformation will threaten an already fragile ecosystem in the caucus mountains .

" valuable nature is going to be irrevocably destroyed for 16 days of winter olympics , " tennhardt said thursday .
" once again ecological interests are sacrificed for economics . "
sotschi is in the south of russia .
the area has relatively mild weather and in recent years has suffered from climate change .
building an olympic infrastructure will further hurt the area 's delicate ecological balance , tennhardt said .
andrej petrow , head of greenpeace in russia , also criticized the plan to hold the olympics so close to the sochi national park .
" russia does n't adhere to international agreements to protect the world 's natural inheritance and yet the ioc still supports it , " petrow said .
habitats for threatened plant and animal species will be destroyed to make way for luxury sports sites and spas , petrow said .
this goes against russian environmental protection laws and goes against international agreements , petrow said .

dmitri chernyshenko , who headed the bid for the russians , said it was time to begin the hard work of turning promises into reality .
chernyshenko said he was confident sochi would meet all requirements and pledges .
" the government has to meet the critical needs of the ioc and we have to manage all the stakeholders such as the management and the investors , " he said .
" it will not just be a process of construction because winning these games will see the implementation of new laws and changes in russian society . "
chernyshenko will fly to switzerland monday to visit ioc personnel .

" we will succeed as we have now a very experienced team who had one single goal - bringing the olympic games to russia . "

putin said the award recognized russia 's sports tradition and important place in the world .

the german press was critical of the decision .
many editorials pointed out that sochi is not a traditional winter sports destination and that the decision was a major victory for putin , who has recently clashed with europe over decisions seen as anti-democratic .

the new ballinstadt museum showcases the role hamburg played in the lives of those whose destination was the new world . european emigrants boarded ships for the americas in the search for freedom , tolerance and enough to eat .
between 1850 and 1939 five million europeans left from hamburg , most of them headed for the united states .
for the central and eastern europen emigrants who headed for the americas starting in 1880 , the cheapest way to reach the new world was to take a train to the north sea coast , then board a ship to cross the atlantic . staging area for american adventure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advertisements for a better life the ballinstadt museum offers visitors replicas of dormitory buildings , using some of the original red bricks , where immigrants stayed before embarking on the long journey to the americas .
albert ballin , general manager of the well-known german shipping company hapag , built the housing complex between 1901 and 1907 .
ballin , who was jewish , saw eastern european jews as an important customer base .
his dormitories had kosher food options .
he also provided space for a synagogue as well as a christian chapel .
the dormitory facility allowed hapag to keep its customers healthy .
it also served as a way to screen those with infectious diseases , who were likely to be barred by us immigration officers at ellis island in new york and sent back to europe at the line 's expense .
the hostel 's comfort also helped hamburg get a competitive edge over bremen and antwerp for shipping customers .
the rivalry continues today .
bremen opened its own emigration museum in 2005 .
both cities are trying to develop a tourist industry based on their history as major port towns . bildunterschrift : the museum shows historic movie footage set in picture frames treasure trove for geneologists besides the dormitories , the museum has a multimedia exhibit describes the ordeal poor people went through to reach the americas and also follows the lives of immigrants once they arrived .

the new ballinstadt museum showcases the role hamburg played in the lives of those whose destination was the new world . european emigrants boarded ships for the americas in the search for freedom , tolerance and enough to eat .
between 1850 and 1939 five million europeans left from hamburg , most of them headed for the united states .
for the central and eastern europen emigrants who headed for the americas starting in 1880 , the cheapest way to reach the new world was to take a train to the north sea coast , then board a ship to cross the atlantic . staging area for american adventure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advertisements for a better life the ballinstadt museum offers visitors replicas of dormitory buildings , using some of the original red bricks , where immigrants stayed before embarking on the long journey to the americas .
albert ballin , general manager of the well-known german shipping company hapag , built the housing complex between 1901 and 1907 .
ballin , who was jewish , saw eastern european jews as an important customer base .
his dormitories had kosher food options .
he also provided space for a synagogue as well as a christian chapel .
the dormitory facility allowed hapag to keep its customers healthy .
it also served as a way to screen those with infectious diseases , who were likely to be barred by us immigration officers at ellis island in new york and sent back to europe at the line 's expense .
the hostel 's comfort also helped hamburg get a competitive edge over bremen and antwerp for shipping customers .
the rivalry continues today .

but soaring temperatures did n't keep some 1.4 million people from visiting the interbau exhibit in berlin . when the show drew to a close in late september , 900,000 people had viewed the hansa neighborhood alone and 375,000 had ridden the chair-lift specially built for the first interbau event , added the berlin paper . in the early 1950s , west berliners had been appalled by the view of the new socialist-style apartment and retail buildings along stalinallee -lrb- today karl-marx-allee -rrb- in east berlin and the enthusiasm with which the young gdr built its workers ' palace , author nikolaus bernau told the berliner zeitung .
as a counterweight to these large-scale soviet building projects , the west decided to reinstate the tradition of architectural exhibitions . competing with the east a response to the gdr 's first major reconstruction plan , interbau was intended to " demonstrate the new , democratic western germany to the outside world , which was on the side of the french , british , italian and americans , not only politically but also culturally , " said bernau . this attitude may explain the project 's exorbitant cost .

sochi organizers acknowledge they have a massive task ahead of them to turn the impoverished resort town into an olympic hub in seven years .
the road from sochi 's seashore to the mountains is narrow and runs through an economically depressed area of small farms .
by 2014 it will have a high-tech train line , new roads , ice arenas , sporting venues and everything else needed for the games .
environmentalists say this transformation will threaten an already fragile ecosystem in the caucus mountains .

" once again ecological interests are sacrificed for economics . "
sotschi is in the south of russia .
the area has relatively mild weather and in recent years has suffered from climate change .
building an olympic infrastructure will further hurt the area 's delicate ecological balance , tennhardt said .
andrej petrow , head of greenpeace in russia , also criticized the plan to hold the olympics so close to the sochi national park .
" russia does n't adhere to international agreements to protect the world 's natural inheritance and yet the ioc still supports it , " petrow said .

chernyshenko said he was confident sochi would meet all requirements and pledges .
" the government has to meet the critical needs of the ioc and we have to manage all the stakeholders such as the management and the investors , " he said .
" it will not just be a process of construction because winning these games will see the implementation of new laws and changes in russian society . "

the new ballinstadt museum showcases the role hamburg played in the lives of those whose destination was the new world . european emigrants boarded ships for the americas in the search for freedom , tolerance and enough to eat .
between 1850 and 1939 five million europeans left from hamburg , most of them headed for the united states .
for the central and eastern europen emigrants who headed for the americas starting in 1880 , the cheapest way to reach the new world was to take a train to the north sea coast , then board a ship to cross the atlantic . staging area for american adventure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advertisements for a better life the ballinstadt museum offers visitors replicas of dormitory buildings , using some of the original red bricks , where immigrants stayed before embarking on the long journey to the americas .
albert ballin , general manager of the well-known german shipping company hapag , built the housing complex between 1901 and 1907 .
ballin , who was jewish , saw eastern european jews as an important customer base .
his dormitories had kosher food options .
he also provided space for a synagogue as well as a christian chapel .
the dormitory facility allowed hapag to keep its customers healthy .
it also served as a way to screen those with infectious diseases , who were likely to be barred by us immigration officers at ellis island in new york and sent back to europe at the line 's expense .
the hostel 's comfort also helped hamburg get a competitive edge over bremen and antwerp for shipping customers .
the rivalry continues today .
bremen opened its own emigration museum in 2005 .
both cities are trying to develop a tourist industry based on their history as major port towns . bildunterschrift : the museum shows historic movie footage set in picture frames treasure trove for geneologists besides the dormitories , the museum has a multimedia exhibit describes the ordeal poor people went through to reach the americas and also follows the lives of immigrants once they arrived .
the interactive aspect of the exhibit is designed to appeal to young people .
there 's movie footage , hand-tinted photographs and mannequins who tell emigrants ' stories .
the museum is also a treasure trove for genealogists , with digitalized , searchable passenger lists of emigrants who left from hamburg .
an estimated 20 million americans are direct descendents from the emigrants who left from hamburg .
the museum 's cafe has emigrant-era tables and benches , but serves modern food .
the 12 million euro -lrb- $ 16 million -rrb- emigration museum opened for the general public thursday in hamburg 's veddel neighborhood where 60 percent of the residents are immigrants , most of them from eastern europe and turkey .
the buildings are set in a landscaped area that will double as a public park . dw staff / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but soaring temperatures did n't keep some 1.4 million people from visiting the interbau exhibit in berlin . when the show drew to a close in late september , 900,000 people had viewed the hansa neighborhood alone and 375,000 had ridden the chair-lift specially built for the first interbau event , added the berlin paper . in the early 1950s , west berliners had been appalled by the view of the new socialist-style apartment and retail buildings along stalinallee -lrb- today karl-marx-allee -rrb- in east berlin and the enthusiasm with which the young gdr built its workers ' palace , author nikolaus bernau told the berliner zeitung .
as a counterweight to these large-scale soviet building projects , the west decided to reinstate the tradition of architectural exhibitions . competing with the east a response to the gdr 's first major reconstruction plan , interbau was intended to " demonstrate the new , democratic western germany to the outside world , which was on the side of the french , british , italian and americans , not only politically but also culturally , " said bernau . this attitude may explain the project 's exorbitant cost .
instead of reconstructing post-war ruins and making use of the old infrastructure , property was redistributed , streets were rebuilt and the interbau exhibit was viewed as a counterbalance to the monumental structures of 1950s east berlin . the " city of tomorrow " in preparation for the exhibit , an architecture contest was announced .

in place of the old barrack-like block developments , they generated space by more freely positioning their buildings . public parks were a top priority in what was supposed to be the " city of tomorrow " : a zoological garden was integrated into the hansa neighborhood , which was encircled by high-rises , apartment blocks , single-family homes and churches .
shops , restaurants , a movie theater , a library and the subway at hansa square were to make up the heart of the district . by the time the interbau exhibit ended in 1957 , only 601 of today 's 1,160 apartment units were completed .

between 1850 and 1939 five million europeans left from hamburg , most of them headed for the united states .

albert ballin , general manager of the well-known german shipping company hapag , built the housing complex between 1901 and 1907 .
ballin , who was jewish , saw eastern european jews as an important customer base .
his dormitories had kosher food options .
he also provided space for a synagogue as well as a christian chapel .
the dormitory facility allowed hapag to keep its customers healthy .

the new ballinstadt museum showcases the role hamburg played in the lives of those whose destination was the new world . european emigrants boarded ships for the americas in the search for freedom , tolerance and enough to eat .
between 1850 and 1939 five million europeans left from hamburg , most of them headed for the united states .
for the central and eastern europen emigrants who headed for the americas starting in 1880 , the cheapest way to reach the new world was to take a train to the north sea coast , then board a ship to cross the atlantic . staging area for american adventure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advertisements for a better life the ballinstadt museum offers visitors replicas of dormitory buildings , using some of the original red bricks , where immigrants stayed before embarking on the long journey to the americas .
albert ballin , general manager of the well-known german shipping company hapag , built the housing complex between 1901 and 1907 .
ballin , who was jewish , saw eastern european jews as an important customer base .
his dormitories had kosher food options .
he also provided space for a synagogue as well as a christian chapel .
the dormitory facility allowed hapag to keep its customers healthy .
it also served as a way to screen those with infectious diseases , who were likely to be barred by us immigration officers at ellis island in new york and sent back to europe at the line 's expense .
the hostel 's comfort also helped hamburg get a competitive edge over bremen and antwerp for shipping customers .
the rivalry continues today .
bremen opened its own emigration museum in 2005 .
both cities are trying to develop a tourist industry based on their history as major port towns . bildunterschrift : the museum shows historic movie footage set in picture frames treasure trove for geneologists besides the dormitories , the museum has a multimedia exhibit describes the ordeal poor people went through to reach the americas and also follows the lives of immigrants once they arrived .
the interactive aspect of the exhibit is designed to appeal to young people .
there 's movie footage , hand-tinted photographs and mannequins who tell emigrants ' stories .
the museum is also a treasure trove for genealogists , with digitalized , searchable passenger lists of emigrants who left from hamburg .
an estimated 20 million americans are direct descendents from the emigrants who left from hamburg .
the museum 's cafe has emigrant-era tables and benches , but serves modern food .
the 12 million euro -lrb- $ 16 million -rrb- emigration museum opened for the general public thursday in hamburg 's veddel neighborhood where 60 percent of the residents are immigrants , most of them from eastern europe and turkey .
the buildings are set in a landscaped area that will double as a public park . dw staff / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

such is the uncertainty about many of the riders that the line-up for the 2007 tour is still in doubt . many thought that the scandal that overshadowed the 2006 tour was the largest of all time and the investigation that followed would finally uncover the nefarious networks which operate under the radar of the sport 's authorities .
before last year 's race , stars like jan ullrich and ivan basso were excluded with almost 50 other riders due to their alleged associations with the man at the center of a blood-doping circle , the spaniard eufemianos fuentes .
the race went ahead regardless only for the eventual winner , the american floyd landis , to be revealed as a drug cheat a few days after celebrating his success on the champs-elysee .
and yet , despite the admissions , revelations and recriminations arising from the 2006 tour , the 2007 race could be an even more disgraced event .
with the prelude to the race scheduled for saturday , the field of riders is far from being confirmed due to a large number of question marks hanging over many helmeted heads .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas klöden is still not confirmed for the 2007 tour more than 50 riders remain major doubts for the race this year , including co-favorites jens voigt and andreas klöden .
these riders have yet to be signed off by the anti-doping officials of the world cycling federation , the union cycliste internationale -lrb- uci -rrb- .
without uci approval , riders can not take part . " anyone who has a doping suspicion hanging over them at the start need not turn up for the event , " tour de france chief christian prudhomme has said .
while the riders themselves are likely to suffer from being tarred with the doping brush if found to have been involved , the sport is suffering not only from having its reputation repeatedly dragged through the mud but also through the effect the scandals have on sponsorship . " that -lrb- sponsors -rrb- should abandon a system that is manipulated , faked and full of cheats is only normal , " says josef hackforth , professor for sport , media and communication at the munich university of technology .
few top names not tarred with the scandal brush few would argue against that , considering the state of the sport at the moment .
virtually every top rider of the last few years has come under suspicion of being involved in doping .
at least 58 riders are known to have been working with the shamed fuentes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik zabel prayed for forgiveness in recent months 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis has admitted using performance-enhancing drugs , as have former teammates from deutsche telekom 's group , formerly team telekom : eric zabel , udo bölts , bert dietz , christian henn and rolf aldag .
meanwhile , despite admissions from a former team telekom masseur that he injected the rider with the banned blood-boosting drug erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- , 1997 tour winner jan ullrich has maintained his silence , neither confirming nor denying the allegations made against him .
jaksche reveals permissive drug culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaksche claims team chiefs approved doping riders if anyone was still in any doubt that cycling was a secretly permissive environment where doping was practiced , encouraged and tolerated , the interview german rider jörg jaksche gave to the newsmagazine der spiegel in june erased any misconceptions that doping in cycling was just a list of individual indiscretions .
after years of denials and silence , jaksche admitted using banned substances throughout his career with a number of teams .
but more shockingly , jaksche revealed that he had been urged by various team bosses to take the drugs .
jaksche now claims to be clean and that the new controls on riders are making cycling less contaminated than at any time in the last ten years .
team gerolsteiner boss hans-michael holczer agrees but adds , " the tour is cleaner than in the past but it is still not clean . "
fans and media need to take a stand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popularity of cycling remains despite the scandals for cycling to survive , josef hackforth believes , it needs a shock to the system like the sudden and mass exodus of fans not willing to put up with supporting a sport that is riddled with the doping disease . " if the spectators say : we are not interested any more , then cycling would have to act , " he said . " however , this is an illusion .
one stage of the giro d 'italia attracted five million television viewers and hundreds of thousands lined the route .
it seems the interest in these heroes on two wheels refuses to wane despite the doping scandals . "
hackforth also believes the media can play its part but , specifically in germany where public broadcaster ard has come under huge criticism for its bias to team telekom , many channels and outlets are under their own pressure to avoid the doping question .
in a recent survey in germany , two-thirds of the respondents said that their interest in tour coverage would drop off if there was continued reporting on doping allegations .

such is the uncertainty about many of the riders that the line-up for the 2007 tour is still in doubt . many thought that the scandal that overshadowed the 2006 tour was the largest of all time and the investigation that followed would finally uncover the nefarious networks which operate under the radar of the sport 's authorities .
before last year 's race , stars like jan ullrich and ivan basso were excluded with almost 50 other riders due to their alleged associations with the man at the center of a blood-doping circle , the spaniard eufemianos fuentes .
the race went ahead regardless only for the eventual winner , the american floyd landis , to be revealed as a drug cheat a few days after celebrating his success on the champs-elysee .
and yet , despite the admissions , revelations and recriminations arising from the 2006 tour , the 2007 race could be an even more disgraced event .

france also reported new cases and upped its own alert . germany ' top state veterinary laboratory raised the risk level after more wild birds had tested positive for h5n1 in the eastern states of saxony-anhalt and thuringia . " we will raise the threat level , " a spokeswoman for the friedrich löffler institute told reporters .
the regional authorities in sangerhausen in saxony-anhalt reported that 38 dead birds found on the shores of an artificial lake near the town of kelbra had all tested positive .
saxony-anhalt is the fourth of germany 's 16 states to report cases of h5n1 bird flu since late last month , when it struck down six wild birds in the southern city of nuremberg in bavaria .
on tuesday , a bird found on the other side of the lake which is in thuringia was confirmed to have had h5n1 bird flu .
cases have also been reported near leipzig in the neighboring eastern state of saxony , bordering the czech republic which is battling a more severe outbreak of the h5n1 avian flu .
german poultry as yet unaffected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wild birds have so far been the only ones affected the friedrich löffler institute suggested the disease could have jumped the border from the czech side where it has infected turkey and chicken farms .
so far in germany the new outbreak has been restricted to swans , geese and other wild birds and has not affected poultry farms .
germany battled a widespread bird flu epidemic in 2006 .
it broke out on the baltic sea island of rügen and spread to six states , including bavaria .

" france is not threatened by a bird flu pandemic as there has not been , for the moment , a human contamination from the h5n1 virus , " bachelot said .
but she added " we must be vigilant as the great flu epidemic that followed the war of 1914 , the spanish flu " came from a strain of bird flu .
scientists believe a strain related to today 's bird flu virus caused the death of tens of millions of people during the spanish flu pandemic .
" we must do what is necessary to ensure that all of the agencies , the entire health system is ready to deal with a mutation of the virus " that could attack humans , said bachelot on french television .
fresh measures were ordered to ensure that chickens and other poultry did not enter into contact with wild birds and that they underwent monthly veterinary checks .
pigeon competitions have been banned and security around a one-kilometer -lrb- 0.6 mile -rrb- exclusion zone established around the pond in the moselle department where the dead swans were discovered has been beefed up .
a second 15-kilometer " observation " zone was set up around the pond at assenoncourt but a spokesman for the local municipality said no other dead birds had been found there , which he described as a " reassuring " sign .
french poultry farms ready for lockdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poultry farms dread having to cull their flocks " these measures apply to all farms that must be protected from wild birds that fly overhead .
these protective measures are nets and a ban on bringing birds together in public places and at markets , " barnier said .
officials put three farms in the observation zone under quarantine , and restricted access to roads in the area .
" with these measures that we are taking , the risk of contamination will be very small , " said philippe hestroffer , of the regional veterinary services .
a first outbreak of h5n1 in february 2006 was detected in 62 dead birds in central france and spread to a farm near the town of versailleux where hundreds of turkeys were slaughtered .
it was also the first outbreak of the virulent strain in the european union .
france produces 900 million poultry per year including 700 million chickens , according to the confederation of french poultry producers .

france also reported new cases and upped its own alert . germany ' top state veterinary laboratory raised the risk level after more wild birds had tested positive for h5n1 in the eastern states of saxony-anhalt and thuringia . " we will raise the threat level , " a spokeswoman for the friedrich löffler institute told reporters .
the regional authorities in sangerhausen in saxony-anhalt reported that 38 dead birds found on the shores of an artificial lake near the town of kelbra had all tested positive .
saxony-anhalt is the fourth of germany 's 16 states to report cases of h5n1 bird flu since late last month , when it struck down six wild birds in the southern city of nuremberg in bavaria .
on tuesday , a bird found on the other side of the lake which is in thuringia was confirmed to have had h5n1 bird flu .
cases have also been reported near leipzig in the neighboring eastern state of saxony , bordering the czech republic which is battling a more severe outbreak of the h5n1 avian flu .
german poultry as yet unaffected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wild birds have so far been the only ones affected the friedrich löffler institute suggested the disease could have jumped the border from the czech side where it has infected turkey and chicken farms .
so far in germany the new outbreak has been restricted to swans , geese and other wild birds and has not affected poultry farms .
germany battled a widespread bird flu epidemic in 2006 .
it broke out on the baltic sea island of rügen and spread to six states , including bavaria .
the disease spread to mammals , infecting three cats and a stone marten , but did not affect humans .
in neighboring france , europe 's biggest poultry producer , authorities stepped up surveillance after tests on three dead swans confirmed an h5n1 outbreak .
agriculture minister michel barnier raised the threat level from bird flu from " moderate " to “ high " following the test results on the swans that were found dead in northeast france last week .
france on high alert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emergency plans are swinging into action in france it is france 's second outbreak of the deadly strain of bird flu in 17 months , but health minister roselyne bachelot said there was no reason for alarm . " france is not threatened by a bird flu pandemic as there has not been , for the moment , a human contamination from the h5n1 virus , " bachelot said .
but she added " we must be vigilant as the great flu epidemic that followed the war of 1914 , the spanish flu " came from a strain of bird flu .
scientists believe a strain related to today 's bird flu virus caused the death of tens of millions of people during the spanish flu pandemic .
" we must do what is necessary to ensure that all of the agencies , the entire health system is ready to deal with a mutation of the virus " that could attack humans , said bachelot on french television .
fresh measures were ordered to ensure that chickens and other poultry did not enter into contact with wild birds and that they underwent monthly veterinary checks .
pigeon competitions have been banned and security around a one-kilometer -lrb- 0.6 mile -rrb- exclusion zone established around the pond in the moselle department where the dead swans were discovered has been beefed up .
a second 15-kilometer " observation " zone was set up around the pond at assenoncourt but a spokesman for the local municipality said no other dead birds had been found there , which he described as a " reassuring " sign .
french poultry farms ready for lockdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poultry farms dread having to cull their flocks " these measures apply to all farms that must be protected from wild birds that fly overhead .
these protective measures are nets and a ban on bringing birds together in public places and at markets , " barnier said .
officials put three farms in the observation zone under quarantine , and restricted access to roads in the area .
" with these measures that we are taking , the risk of contamination will be very small , " said philippe hestroffer , of the regional veterinary services .
a first outbreak of h5n1 in february 2006 was detected in 62 dead birds in central france and spread to a farm near the town of versailleux where hundreds of turkeys were slaughtered .
it was also the first outbreak of the virulent strain in the european union .
france produces 900 million poultry per year including 700 million chickens , according to the confederation of french poultry producers .
the sector employs 80,000 people and generated four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- last year .
authorities act in the netherlands in the netherlands , the authorities ordered all poultry to be kept inside .
they announced the measure after what they called the discovery of a bird flu case " not far from the netherlands . "
while the bird flu virus is highly contagious among poultry and can spread to an entire flock , it remains difficult for humans to catch .
a total of 191 people worldwide have died of bird flu , according to the world health organization , which has reported 317 cases in its june 29 tally .

" russia does n't adhere to international agreements to protect the world 's natural inheritance and yet the ioc still supports it , " petrow said .

russia will spend another 9 billion euros to build the needed infrastructure and sports facilities .
russia launched wild celebrations after the international olympic committee 's -lrb- ioc -rrb- decision was announced in guatemala wednesday .
building something from nothing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands celebrated in the resort town early thursday but now reality has set in .
sochi organizers acknowledge they have a massive task ahead of them to turn the impoverished resort town into an olympic hub in seven years .
the road from sochi 's seashore to the mountains is narrow and runs through an economically depressed area of small farms .
by 2014 it will have a high-tech train line , new roads , ice arenas , sporting venues and everything else needed for the games .
environmentalists say this transformation will threaten an already fragile ecosystem in the caucus mountains .
environmental concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sochi has palms and powder the sochi olympics will not be " green , " said thomas tennhardt of the german association for nature conservation -lrb- nabu . -rrb-
" valuable nature is going to be irrevocably destroyed for 16 days of winter olympics , " tennhardt said thursday .
" once again ecological interests are sacrificed for economics . "
sotschi is in the south of russia .
the area has relatively mild weather and in recent years has suffered from climate change .
building an olympic infrastructure will further hurt the area 's delicate ecological balance , tennhardt said .
andrej petrow , head of greenpeace in russia , also criticized the plan to hold the olympics so close to the sochi national park .
" russia does n't adhere to international agreements to protect the world 's natural inheritance and yet the ioc still supports it , " petrow said .
habitats for threatened plant and animal species will be destroyed to make way for luxury sports sites and spas , petrow said .
this goes against russian environmental protection laws and goes against international agreements , petrow said .

the information is misleading and unfair , they say .
a court ruled it 's necessary to bring more transparency to german politics . a day after germany 's highest court ruled that information about the extra money politicians earn from side jobs should be made public , the information was posted on the german parliament 's web site .
politicians have been quick to criticize the move , saying the information is misleading and unfair .
detailed information about who politicians work for and how much money they make went public after germany 's federal constitutional court ruled wednesday that the highly paid side jobs could compromise parliamentarians ' independence .
the public has a right to know if representatives earn money on the side , the court ruled . politicians have privacy concerns politicians have complained that jobs held before being elected are listed in the same way as those held while in office .
they also feel it reveals proprietary business information to competitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians practice law on the side germany 's highest court dismissed privacy concerns .
in this case , the right to privacy was secondary to the public interest in transparency , the court ruled .
transparency international endorsed the decision with the organization 's german head calling for even more transparency . " we are waiting for more openness from the parliamentarians and from everyone a more exact breakdown of the payments , " christian humborg told the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung . corruption concerns fueled legislation the issue started with the previous social democrat-green government in 2005 in response to a scandal about parliamentarians who were on the payrolls of german corporations .

people do have the strangest habits when it comes to their toilets – and the germans -lrb- while not quite so anal , if you excuse the pun -rrb- are no exception .
according to a new survey commissioned by toilet paper firm zewa - presumably instigated by people at the company who have nothing better to do - 52 percent of the germans polled admitted to either pondering world events or catching up on literature of choice while on the porcelain throne .
it seems that the country which has given the world many great thinkers and poets continues to be filled by people who take every opportunity to read , even when they are " lightening the load . "
german men tend to favor computer magazines and daily newspapers to help " grease the wheels " while some , 18 percent in fact , even take the opportunity to analyze instruction manuals .

german men also seem to take longer to get through their ablutions and reading material than german women .
the study shows that 34 percent of men spend between five and ten minutes on the toilet , which is unsurprising given the level of technical language and geopolitical debate in their chosen reading material .
real connoisseurs , some 16 percent of those polled , go from cover to cover in mammoth sessions lasting between ten and 15 minutes .
the ladies seem to have a pavlovian response to reading on the toilet with 49 percent of them getting in and out between two to five minutes , giving them barely enough time to flick a page of their favored spy or suspense paperback .

not all germans combine bowel movements with a spot of light reading .
the survey shows that 34 percent of germans actually do nothing other than what nature intended when they go to the lavatory .
these must be the thinkers , rather than the poets .
music lovers go for an ipoo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans like to bring their own soundtrack young germans bring their own modern take on passing time in the smallest room in the house .
the survey showed that 26 percent of 14-29 year olds listen to music on the loo .
one can only speculate whether specific playlists are compiled for these visits .
if they are , one might assume that songs like " -lrb- i can ’ t get no -rrb- satisfaction " by the rolling stones and " can ’ t stand the strain " by funkadelic would be omitted .
the same percentage of 14-29 year olds also send sms messages while going through the motions .
the mind boggles at what information these messages could possibly contain .
elsewhere in the study , statistics point to a trend of more leisurely visits in the twilight years of life with almost half of those polled over 50 years old saying they do absolutely nothing in the toilet .
this 49 percent obviously need more roughage in their diet .
there are also regional differences in toilet habits within germany .
just less than half of those inhabitants from mecklenburg-west pomerania who were polled tend to day-dream during their nirvana-esque bouts of relief-inspired enlightenment .

russia will spend another 9 billion euros to build the needed infrastructure and sports facilities .
russia launched wild celebrations after the international olympic committee 's -lrb- ioc -rrb- decision was announced in guatemala wednesday .
building something from nothing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands celebrated in the resort town early thursday but now reality has set in .
sochi organizers acknowledge they have a massive task ahead of them to turn the impoverished resort town into an olympic hub in seven years .
the road from sochi 's seashore to the mountains is narrow and runs through an economically depressed area of small farms .
by 2014 it will have a high-tech train line , new roads , ice arenas , sporting venues and everything else needed for the games .
environmentalists say this transformation will threaten an already fragile ecosystem in the caucus mountains .
environmental concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sochi has palms and powder the sochi olympics will not be " green , " said thomas tennhardt of the german association for nature conservation -lrb- nabu . -rrb-
" valuable nature is going to be irrevocably destroyed for 16 days of winter olympics , " tennhardt said thursday .
" once again ecological interests are sacrificed for economics . "
sotschi is in the south of russia .
the area has relatively mild weather and in recent years has suffered from climate change .
building an olympic infrastructure will further hurt the area 's delicate ecological balance , tennhardt said .
andrej petrow , head of greenpeace in russia , also criticized the plan to hold the olympics so close to the sochi national park .
" russia does n't adhere to international agreements to protect the world 's natural inheritance and yet the ioc still supports it , " petrow said .
habitats for threatened plant and animal species will be destroyed to make way for luxury sports sites and spas , petrow said .
this goes against russian environmental protection laws and goes against international agreements , petrow said .
russia 's legacy to the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin skis at sochi sochi beat out korean candidate pyeongchang , viewed by many to be the ioc favorites , by 51 votes to 47 .
dmitri chernyshenko , who headed the bid for the russians , said it was time to begin the hard work of turning promises into reality .
chernyshenko said he was confident sochi would meet all requirements and pledges .
" the government has to meet the critical needs of the ioc and we have to manage all the stakeholders such as the management and the investors , " he said .
" it will not just be a process of construction because winning these games will see the implementation of new laws and changes in russian society . "
chernyshenko will fly to switzerland monday to visit ioc personnel .
" this concept is a great legacy for russia and the world , " he said .
" we will succeed as we have now a very experienced team who had one single goal - bringing the olympic games to russia . "
image boost for putin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's win was considered an upset the decision was a major win for russian president vladimir putin , who was a primary champion of the campaign .
putin said the award recognized russia 's sports tradition and important place in the world .
" this is support from one of the most authoritative and independent international organizations - the international olympic committee , " he said .
the german press was critical of the decision .
many editorials pointed out that sochi is not a traditional winter sports destination and that the decision was a major victory for putin , who has recently clashed with europe over decisions seen as anti-democratic .
the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung called the award a " political failure . "
it comes at a time when russia is on an anti-democratic course and the olympics will serve as further propaganda , the newspaper said .
the ioc picked moscow because of its enormous financial power , said an editorial in the frankfurter neue presse .
the newspaper was skeptical of putin 's promise to make sure the area 's environment was protected .
with his record of squelching public criticism , these promises " should not be trusted , " the newspaper said . dw staff from wire reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 06.07.2007 scandal clouds gather over 2007 tour de france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crossing the line : cycling has moved from individual scandals to widespread criminality the 94th tour de france starts on july 8 under a cloud of scandal that refuses to dissipate .
such is the uncertainty about many of the riders that the line-up for the 2007 tour is still in doubt . many thought that the scandal that overshadowed the 2006 tour was the largest of all time and the investigation that followed would finally uncover the nefarious networks which operate under the radar of the sport 's authorities .
before last year 's race , stars like jan ullrich and ivan basso were excluded with almost 50 other riders due to their alleged associations with the man at the center of a blood-doping circle , the spaniard eufemianos fuentes .
the race went ahead regardless only for the eventual winner , the american floyd landis , to be revealed as a drug cheat a few days after celebrating his success on the champs-elysee .
and yet , despite the admissions , revelations and recriminations arising from the 2006 tour , the 2007 race could be an even more disgraced event .
with the prelude to the race scheduled for saturday , the field of riders is far from being confirmed due to a large number of question marks hanging over many helmeted heads .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas klöden is still not confirmed for the 2007 tour more than 50 riders remain major doubts for the race this year , including co-favorites jens voigt and andreas klöden .
these riders have yet to be signed off by the anti-doping officials of the world cycling federation , the union cycliste internationale -lrb- uci -rrb- .
without uci approval , riders can not take part . " anyone who has a doping suspicion hanging over them at the start need not turn up for the event , " tour de france chief christian prudhomme has said .
while the riders themselves are likely to suffer from being tarred with the doping brush if found to have been involved , the sport is suffering not only from having its reputation repeatedly dragged through the mud but also through the effect the scandals have on sponsorship . " that -lrb- sponsors -rrb- should abandon a system that is manipulated , faked and full of cheats is only normal , " says josef hackforth , professor for sport , media and communication at the munich university of technology .

by 2014 it will have a high-tech train line , new roads , ice arenas , sporting venues and everything else needed for the games .
environmentalists say this transformation will threaten an already fragile ecosystem in the caucus mountains .

" valuable nature is going to be irrevocably destroyed for 16 days of winter olympics , " tennhardt said thursday .
" once again ecological interests are sacrificed for economics . "
sotschi is in the south of russia .
the area has relatively mild weather and in recent years has suffered from climate change .
building an olympic infrastructure will further hurt the area 's delicate ecological balance , tennhardt said .
andrej petrow , head of greenpeace in russia , also criticized the plan to hold the olympics so close to the sochi national park .
" russia does n't adhere to international agreements to protect the world 's natural inheritance and yet the ioc still supports it , " petrow said .
habitats for threatened plant and animal species will be destroyed to make way for luxury sports sites and spas , petrow said .
this goes against russian environmental protection laws and goes against international agreements , petrow said .

chernyshenko said he was confident sochi would meet all requirements and pledges .
" the government has to meet the critical needs of the ioc and we have to manage all the stakeholders such as the management and the investors , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 06.07.2007 interbau : the modernization of germany the international architecture exhibit interbau , which opened on july 6 , 1957 in berlin 's hansa neighborhood , came to be seen as a tangible example of germany 's modernization and a side effect of the cold war . summer 1957 was a hot one , wrote the berliner zeitung .
but soaring temperatures did n't keep some 1.4 million people from visiting the interbau exhibit in berlin . when the show drew to a close in late september , 900,000 people had viewed the hansa neighborhood alone and 375,000 had ridden the chair-lift specially built for the first interbau event , added the berlin paper . in the early 1950s , west berliners had been appalled by the view of the new socialist-style apartment and retail buildings along stalinallee -lrb- today karl-marx-allee -rrb- in east berlin and the enthusiasm with which the young gdr built its workers ' palace , author nikolaus bernau told the berliner zeitung .
as a counterweight to these large-scale soviet building projects , the west decided to reinstate the tradition of architectural exhibitions . competing with the east a response to the gdr 's first major reconstruction plan , interbau was intended to " demonstrate the new , democratic western germany to the outside world , which was on the side of the french , british , italian and americans , not only politically but also culturally , " said bernau . this attitude may explain the project 's exorbitant cost .
instead of reconstructing post-war ruins and making use of the old infrastructure , property was redistributed , streets were rebuilt and the interbau exhibit was viewed as a counterbalance to the monumental structures of 1950s east berlin . the " city of tomorrow " in preparation for the exhibit , an architecture contest was announced .

but soaring temperatures did n't keep some 1.4 million people from visiting the interbau exhibit in berlin . when the show drew to a close in late september , 900,000 people had viewed the hansa neighborhood alone and 375,000 had ridden the chair-lift specially built for the first interbau event , added the berlin paper . in the early 1950s , west berliners had been appalled by the view of the new socialist-style apartment and retail buildings along stalinallee -lrb- today karl-marx-allee -rrb- in east berlin and the enthusiasm with which the young gdr built its workers ' palace , author nikolaus bernau told the berliner zeitung .
as a counterweight to these large-scale soviet building projects , the west decided to reinstate the tradition of architectural exhibitions . competing with the east a response to the gdr 's first major reconstruction plan , interbau was intended to " demonstrate the new , democratic western germany to the outside world , which was on the side of the french , british , italian and americans , not only politically but also culturally , " said bernau . this attitude may explain the project 's exorbitant cost .
instead of reconstructing post-war ruins and making use of the old infrastructure , property was redistributed , streets were rebuilt and the interbau exhibit was viewed as a counterbalance to the monumental structures of 1950s east berlin . the " city of tomorrow " in preparation for the exhibit , an architecture contest was announced .

russia will spend another 9 billion euros to build the needed infrastructure and sports facilities .
russia launched wild celebrations after the international olympic committee 's -lrb- ioc -rrb- decision was announced in guatemala wednesday .
building something from nothing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands celebrated in the resort town early thursday but now reality has set in .
sochi organizers acknowledge they have a massive task ahead of them to turn the impoverished resort town into an olympic hub in seven years .
the road from sochi 's seashore to the mountains is narrow and runs through an economically depressed area of small farms .
by 2014 it will have a high-tech train line , new roads , ice arenas , sporting venues and everything else needed for the games .
environmentalists say this transformation will threaten an already fragile ecosystem in the caucus mountains .
environmental concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sochi has palms and powder the sochi olympics will not be " green , " said thomas tennhardt of the german association for nature conservation -lrb- nabu . -rrb-
" valuable nature is going to be irrevocably destroyed for 16 days of winter olympics , " tennhardt said thursday .
" once again ecological interests are sacrificed for economics . "
sotschi is in the south of russia .
the area has relatively mild weather and in recent years has suffered from climate change .
building an olympic infrastructure will further hurt the area 's delicate ecological balance , tennhardt said .
andrej petrow , head of greenpeace in russia , also criticized the plan to hold the olympics so close to the sochi national park .
" russia does n't adhere to international agreements to protect the world 's natural inheritance and yet the ioc still supports it , " petrow said .
habitats for threatened plant and animal species will be destroyed to make way for luxury sports sites and spas , petrow said .
this goes against russian environmental protection laws and goes against international agreements , petrow said .
russia 's legacy to the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin skis at sochi sochi beat out korean candidate pyeongchang , viewed by many to be the ioc favorites , by 51 votes to 47 .
dmitri chernyshenko , who headed the bid for the russians , said it was time to begin the hard work of turning promises into reality .
chernyshenko said he was confident sochi would meet all requirements and pledges .
" the government has to meet the critical needs of the ioc and we have to manage all the stakeholders such as the management and the investors , " he said .
" it will not just be a process of construction because winning these games will see the implementation of new laws and changes in russian society . "
chernyshenko will fly to switzerland monday to visit ioc personnel .
" this concept is a great legacy for russia and the world , " he said .
" we will succeed as we have now a very experienced team who had one single goal - bringing the olympic games to russia . "
image boost for putin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's win was considered an upset the decision was a major win for russian president vladimir putin , who was a primary champion of the campaign .
putin said the award recognized russia 's sports tradition and important place in the world .
" this is support from one of the most authoritative and independent international organizations - the international olympic committee , " he said .
the german press was critical of the decision .
many editorials pointed out that sochi is not a traditional winter sports destination and that the decision was a major victory for putin , who has recently clashed with europe over decisions seen as anti-democratic .
the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung called the award a " political failure . "
it comes at a time when russia is on an anti-democratic course and the olympics will serve as further propaganda , the newspaper said .
the ioc picked moscow because of its enormous financial power , said an editorial in the frankfurter neue presse .
the newspaper was skeptical of putin 's promise to make sure the area 's environment was protected .
with his record of squelching public criticism , these promises " should not be trusted , " the newspaper said . dw staff from wire reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

between 1850 and 1939 five million europeans left from hamburg , most of them headed for the united states .
for the central and eastern europen emigrants who headed for the americas starting in 1880 , the cheapest way to reach the new world was to take a train to the north sea coast , then board a ship to cross the atlantic . staging area for american adventure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advertisements for a better life the ballinstadt museum offers visitors replicas of dormitory buildings , using some of the original red bricks , where immigrants stayed before embarking on the long journey to the americas .
albert ballin , general manager of the well-known german shipping company hapag , built the housing complex between 1901 and 1907 .
ballin , who was jewish , saw eastern european jews as an important customer base .
his dormitories had kosher food options .
he also provided space for a synagogue as well as a christian chapel .
the dormitory facility allowed hapag to keep its customers healthy .
it also served as a way to screen those with infectious diseases , who were likely to be barred by us immigration officers at ellis island in new york and sent back to europe at the line 's expense .
the hostel 's comfort also helped hamburg get a competitive edge over bremen and antwerp for shipping customers .
the rivalry continues today .
bremen opened its own emigration museum in 2005 .
both cities are trying to develop a tourist industry based on their history as major port towns . bildunterschrift : the museum shows historic movie footage set in picture frames treasure trove for geneologists besides the dormitories , the museum has a multimedia exhibit describes the ordeal poor people went through to reach the americas and also follows the lives of immigrants once they arrived .
the interactive aspect of the exhibit is designed to appeal to young people .
there 's movie footage , hand-tinted photographs and mannequins who tell emigrants ' stories .
the museum is also a treasure trove for genealogists , with digitalized , searchable passenger lists of emigrants who left from hamburg .
an estimated 20 million americans are direct descendents from the emigrants who left from hamburg .
the museum 's cafe has emigrant-era tables and benches , but serves modern food .
the 12 million euro -lrb- $ 16 million -rrb- emigration museum opened for the general public thursday in hamburg 's veddel neighborhood where 60 percent of the residents are immigrants , most of them from eastern europe and turkey .
the buildings are set in a landscaped area that will double as a public park . dw staff / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

france also reported new cases and upped its own alert . germany ' top state veterinary laboratory raised the risk level after more wild birds had tested positive for h5n1 in the eastern states of saxony-anhalt and thuringia . " we will raise the threat level , " a spokeswoman for the friedrich löffler institute told reporters .
the regional authorities in sangerhausen in saxony-anhalt reported that 38 dead birds found on the shores of an artificial lake near the town of kelbra had all tested positive .
saxony-anhalt is the fourth of germany 's 16 states to report cases of h5n1 bird flu since late last month , when it struck down six wild birds in the southern city of nuremberg in bavaria .
on tuesday , a bird found on the other side of the lake which is in thuringia was confirmed to have had h5n1 bird flu .
cases have also been reported near leipzig in the neighboring eastern state of saxony , bordering the czech republic which is battling a more severe outbreak of the h5n1 avian flu .
german poultry as yet unaffected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wild birds have so far been the only ones affected the friedrich löffler institute suggested the disease could have jumped the border from the czech side where it has infected turkey and chicken farms .
so far in germany the new outbreak has been restricted to swans , geese and other wild birds and has not affected poultry farms .
germany battled a widespread bird flu epidemic in 2006 .
it broke out on the baltic sea island of rügen and spread to six states , including bavaria .
the disease spread to mammals , infecting three cats and a stone marten , but did not affect humans .
in neighboring france , europe 's biggest poultry producer , authorities stepped up surveillance after tests on three dead swans confirmed an h5n1 outbreak .
agriculture minister michel barnier raised the threat level from bird flu from " moderate " to “ high " following the test results on the swans that were found dead in northeast france last week .
france on high alert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emergency plans are swinging into action in france it is france 's second outbreak of the deadly strain of bird flu in 17 months , but health minister roselyne bachelot said there was no reason for alarm . " france is not threatened by a bird flu pandemic as there has not been , for the moment , a human contamination from the h5n1 virus , " bachelot said .
but she added " we must be vigilant as the great flu epidemic that followed the war of 1914 , the spanish flu " came from a strain of bird flu .
scientists believe a strain related to today 's bird flu virus caused the death of tens of millions of people during the spanish flu pandemic .
" we must do what is necessary to ensure that all of the agencies , the entire health system is ready to deal with a mutation of the virus " that could attack humans , said bachelot on french television .
fresh measures were ordered to ensure that chickens and other poultry did not enter into contact with wild birds and that they underwent monthly veterinary checks .
pigeon competitions have been banned and security around a one-kilometer -lrb- 0.6 mile -rrb- exclusion zone established around the pond in the moselle department where the dead swans were discovered has been beefed up .
a second 15-kilometer " observation " zone was set up around the pond at assenoncourt but a spokesman for the local municipality said no other dead birds had been found there , which he described as a " reassuring " sign .
french poultry farms ready for lockdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poultry farms dread having to cull their flocks " these measures apply to all farms that must be protected from wild birds that fly overhead .
these protective measures are nets and a ban on bringing birds together in public places and at markets , " barnier said .
officials put three farms in the observation zone under quarantine , and restricted access to roads in the area .
" with these measures that we are taking , the risk of contamination will be very small , " said philippe hestroffer , of the regional veterinary services .
a first outbreak of h5n1 in february 2006 was detected in 62 dead birds in central france and spread to a farm near the town of versailleux where hundreds of turkeys were slaughtered .
it was also the first outbreak of the virulent strain in the european union .
france produces 900 million poultry per year including 700 million chickens , according to the confederation of french poultry producers .
the sector employs 80,000 people and generated four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- last year .
authorities act in the netherlands in the netherlands , the authorities ordered all poultry to be kept inside .
they announced the measure after what they called the discovery of a bird flu case " not far from the netherlands . "
while the bird flu virus is highly contagious among poultry and can spread to an entire flock , it remains difficult for humans to catch .
a total of 191 people worldwide have died of bird flu , according to the world health organization , which has reported 317 cases in its june 29 tally .
indonesia , vietnam and thailand top the list of most-affected countries . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

such is the uncertainty about many of the riders that the line-up for the 2007 tour is still in doubt . many thought that the scandal that overshadowed the 2006 tour was the largest of all time and the investigation that followed would finally uncover the nefarious networks which operate under the radar of the sport 's authorities .

and yet , despite the admissions , revelations and recriminations arising from the 2006 tour , the 2007 race could be an even more disgraced event .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 06.07.2007 scandal clouds gather over 2007 tour de france großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : crossing the line : cycling has moved from individual scandals to widespread criminality the 94th tour de france starts on july 8 under a cloud of scandal that refuses to dissipate .
such is the uncertainty about many of the riders that the line-up for the 2007 tour is still in doubt . many thought that the scandal that overshadowed the 2006 tour was the largest of all time and the investigation that followed would finally uncover the nefarious networks which operate under the radar of the sport 's authorities .
before last year 's race , stars like jan ullrich and ivan basso were excluded with almost 50 other riders due to their alleged associations with the man at the center of a blood-doping circle , the spaniard eufemianos fuentes .
the race went ahead regardless only for the eventual winner , the american floyd landis , to be revealed as a drug cheat a few days after celebrating his success on the champs-elysee .
and yet , despite the admissions , revelations and recriminations arising from the 2006 tour , the 2007 race could be an even more disgraced event .
with the prelude to the race scheduled for saturday , the field of riders is far from being confirmed due to a large number of question marks hanging over many helmeted heads .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : andreas klöden is still not confirmed for the 2007 tour more than 50 riders remain major doubts for the race this year , including co-favorites jens voigt and andreas klöden .
these riders have yet to be signed off by the anti-doping officials of the world cycling federation , the union cycliste internationale -lrb- uci -rrb- .
without uci approval , riders can not take part . " anyone who has a doping suspicion hanging over them at the start need not turn up for the event , " tour de france chief christian prudhomme has said .
while the riders themselves are likely to suffer from being tarred with the doping brush if found to have been involved , the sport is suffering not only from having its reputation repeatedly dragged through the mud but also through the effect the scandals have on sponsorship . " that -lrb- sponsors -rrb- should abandon a system that is manipulated , faked and full of cheats is only normal , " says josef hackforth , professor for sport , media and communication at the munich university of technology .
few top names not tarred with the scandal brush few would argue against that , considering the state of the sport at the moment .
virtually every top rider of the last few years has come under suspicion of being involved in doping .
at least 58 riders are known to have been working with the shamed fuentes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik zabel prayed for forgiveness in recent months 1996 tour de france winner bjarne riis has admitted using performance-enhancing drugs , as have former teammates from deutsche telekom 's group , formerly team telekom : eric zabel , udo bölts , bert dietz , christian henn and rolf aldag .
meanwhile , despite admissions from a former team telekom masseur that he injected the rider with the banned blood-boosting drug erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- , 1997 tour winner jan ullrich has maintained his silence , neither confirming nor denying the allegations made against him .
jaksche reveals permissive drug culture bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaksche claims team chiefs approved doping riders if anyone was still in any doubt that cycling was a secretly permissive environment where doping was practiced , encouraged and tolerated , the interview german rider jörg jaksche gave to the newsmagazine der spiegel in june erased any misconceptions that doping in cycling was just a list of individual indiscretions .
after years of denials and silence , jaksche admitted using banned substances throughout his career with a number of teams .
but more shockingly , jaksche revealed that he had been urged by various team bosses to take the drugs .
jaksche now claims to be clean and that the new controls on riders are making cycling less contaminated than at any time in the last ten years .
team gerolsteiner boss hans-michael holczer agrees but adds , " the tour is cleaner than in the past but it is still not clean . "
fans and media need to take a stand bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the popularity of cycling remains despite the scandals for cycling to survive , josef hackforth believes , it needs a shock to the system like the sudden and mass exodus of fans not willing to put up with supporting a sport that is riddled with the doping disease . " if the spectators say : we are not interested any more , then cycling would have to act , " he said . " however , this is an illusion .
one stage of the giro d 'italia attracted five million television viewers and hundreds of thousands lined the route .
it seems the interest in these heroes on two wheels refuses to wane despite the doping scandals . "
hackforth also believes the media can play its part but , specifically in germany where public broadcaster ard has come under huge criticism for its bias to team telekom , many channels and outlets are under their own pressure to avoid the doping question .
in a recent survey in germany , two-thirds of the respondents said that their interest in tour coverage would drop off if there was continued reporting on doping allegations .
with ratings at stake , it remains unlikely that the media will be doing its bit to force cycling to clean up . oliver samson -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the new ballinstadt museum showcases the role hamburg played in the lives of those whose destination was the new world . european emigrants boarded ships for the americas in the search for freedom , tolerance and enough to eat .
between 1850 and 1939 five million europeans left from hamburg , most of them headed for the united states .
for the central and eastern europen emigrants who headed for the americas starting in 1880 , the cheapest way to reach the new world was to take a train to the north sea coast , then board a ship to cross the atlantic . staging area for american adventure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advertisements for a better life the ballinstadt museum offers visitors replicas of dormitory buildings , using some of the original red bricks , where immigrants stayed before embarking on the long journey to the americas .
albert ballin , general manager of the well-known german shipping company hapag , built the housing complex between 1901 and 1907 .
ballin , who was jewish , saw eastern european jews as an important customer base .
his dormitories had kosher food options .
he also provided space for a synagogue as well as a christian chapel .
the dormitory facility allowed hapag to keep its customers healthy .
it also served as a way to screen those with infectious diseases , who were likely to be barred by us immigration officers at ellis island in new york and sent back to europe at the line 's expense .
the hostel 's comfort also helped hamburg get a competitive edge over bremen and antwerp for shipping customers .
the rivalry continues today .
bremen opened its own emigration museum in 2005 .
both cities are trying to develop a tourist industry based on their history as major port towns . bildunterschrift : the museum shows historic movie footage set in picture frames treasure trove for geneologists besides the dormitories , the museum has a multimedia exhibit describes the ordeal poor people went through to reach the americas and also follows the lives of immigrants once they arrived .
the interactive aspect of the exhibit is designed to appeal to young people .
there 's movie footage , hand-tinted photographs and mannequins who tell emigrants ' stories .
the museum is also a treasure trove for genealogists , with digitalized , searchable passenger lists of emigrants who left from hamburg .
an estimated 20 million americans are direct descendents from the emigrants who left from hamburg .
the museum 's cafe has emigrant-era tables and benches , but serves modern food .
the 12 million euro -lrb- $ 16 million -rrb- emigration museum opened for the general public thursday in hamburg 's veddel neighborhood where 60 percent of the residents are immigrants , most of them from eastern europe and turkey .
the buildings are set in a landscaped area that will double as a public park . dw staff / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

france also reported new cases and upped its own alert . germany ' top state veterinary laboratory raised the risk level after more wild birds had tested positive for h5n1 in the eastern states of saxony-anhalt and thuringia . " we will raise the threat level , " a spokeswoman for the friedrich löffler institute told reporters .
the regional authorities in sangerhausen in saxony-anhalt reported that 38 dead birds found on the shores of an artificial lake near the town of kelbra had all tested positive .
saxony-anhalt is the fourth of germany 's 16 states to report cases of h5n1 bird flu since late last month , when it struck down six wild birds in the southern city of nuremberg in bavaria .
on tuesday , a bird found on the other side of the lake which is in thuringia was confirmed to have had h5n1 bird flu .
cases have also been reported near leipzig in the neighboring eastern state of saxony , bordering the czech republic which is battling a more severe outbreak of the h5n1 avian flu .
german poultry as yet unaffected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wild birds have so far been the only ones affected the friedrich löffler institute suggested the disease could have jumped the border from the czech side where it has infected turkey and chicken farms .
so far in germany the new outbreak has been restricted to swans , geese and other wild birds and has not affected poultry farms .
germany battled a widespread bird flu epidemic in 2006 .
it broke out on the baltic sea island of rügen and spread to six states , including bavaria .
the disease spread to mammals , infecting three cats and a stone marten , but did not affect humans .
in neighboring france , europe 's biggest poultry producer , authorities stepped up surveillance after tests on three dead swans confirmed an h5n1 outbreak .
agriculture minister michel barnier raised the threat level from bird flu from " moderate " to “ high " following the test results on the swans that were found dead in northeast france last week .
france on high alert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emergency plans are swinging into action in france it is france 's second outbreak of the deadly strain of bird flu in 17 months , but health minister roselyne bachelot said there was no reason for alarm . " france is not threatened by a bird flu pandemic as there has not been , for the moment , a human contamination from the h5n1 virus , " bachelot said .
but she added " we must be vigilant as the great flu epidemic that followed the war of 1914 , the spanish flu " came from a strain of bird flu .
scientists believe a strain related to today 's bird flu virus caused the death of tens of millions of people during the spanish flu pandemic .
" we must do what is necessary to ensure that all of the agencies , the entire health system is ready to deal with a mutation of the virus " that could attack humans , said bachelot on french television .
fresh measures were ordered to ensure that chickens and other poultry did not enter into contact with wild birds and that they underwent monthly veterinary checks .
pigeon competitions have been banned and security around a one-kilometer -lrb- 0.6 mile -rrb- exclusion zone established around the pond in the moselle department where the dead swans were discovered has been beefed up .
a second 15-kilometer " observation " zone was set up around the pond at assenoncourt but a spokesman for the local municipality said no other dead birds had been found there , which he described as a " reassuring " sign .
french poultry farms ready for lockdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poultry farms dread having to cull their flocks " these measures apply to all farms that must be protected from wild birds that fly overhead .
these protective measures are nets and a ban on bringing birds together in public places and at markets , " barnier said .
officials put three farms in the observation zone under quarantine , and restricted access to roads in the area .
" with these measures that we are taking , the risk of contamination will be very small , " said philippe hestroffer , of the regional veterinary services .
a first outbreak of h5n1 in february 2006 was detected in 62 dead birds in central france and spread to a farm near the town of versailleux where hundreds of turkeys were slaughtered .
it was also the first outbreak of the virulent strain in the european union .
france produces 900 million poultry per year including 700 million chickens , according to the confederation of french poultry producers .
the sector employs 80,000 people and generated four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- last year .
authorities act in the netherlands in the netherlands , the authorities ordered all poultry to be kept inside .
they announced the measure after what they called the discovery of a bird flu case " not far from the netherlands . "
while the bird flu virus is highly contagious among poultry and can spread to an entire flock , it remains difficult for humans to catch .
a total of 191 people worldwide have died of bird flu , according to the world health organization , which has reported 317 cases in its june 29 tally .

the information is misleading and unfair , they say .
a court ruled it 's necessary to bring more transparency to german politics . a day after germany 's highest court ruled that information about the extra money politicians earn from side jobs should be made public , the information was posted on the german parliament 's web site .
politicians have been quick to criticize the move , saying the information is misleading and unfair .
detailed information about who politicians work for and how much money they make went public after germany 's federal constitutional court ruled wednesday that the highly paid side jobs could compromise parliamentarians ' independence .
the public has a right to know if representatives earn money on the side , the court ruled . politicians have privacy concerns politicians have complained that jobs held before being elected are listed in the same way as those held while in office .
they also feel it reveals proprietary business information to competitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians practice law on the side germany 's highest court dismissed privacy concerns .
in this case , the right to privacy was secondary to the public interest in transparency , the court ruled .
transparency international endorsed the decision with the organization 's german head calling for even more transparency . " we are waiting for more openness from the parliamentarians and from everyone a more exact breakdown of the payments , " christian humborg told the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung . corruption concerns fueled legislation the issue started with the previous social democrat-green government in 2005 in response to a scandal about parliamentarians who were on the payrolls of german corporations .
many did n't seem to do much to earn the extra incomes . the revelations of these plum side jobs cost some politicians their jobs .
it also raised concerns in the country about possible corruption and a conflict of interest if politicians were closely connected to big companies .
some also questioned why politicians , who are paid well in germany , needed to take up another job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians are a well-paid group german parliamentarians get a monthly salary of approximately 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 9,500 . -rrb-
the ruling requires all extra monthly income over 1,000 euros -lrb- 1,360 dollars -rrb- to be declared .
politicians must indicate approximately how much they earn by choosing between three different categories .
the parliament passed a bill in 2005 requiring the information on income earned from side jobs to be made public .
nine politicians from several political parties brought a court case to stop the law , saying that it violated their privacy .
of the politicians that brought the court case , one is a businessman , one owns an insurance company and seven are lawyers .
a quarter of the members of parliament are attorneys .
they are concerned that the law interferes with client confidentiality .
bernhard dombek , president of the german federal bar association , was critical of the law .
although it does n't require that attorneys list the names of their clients , it will be easier to figure out who they are , dombek told the tagesspiegel daily .
he predicted people will be less interested in serving as politicians . some changes possible olaf scholz of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said friday that a careful examination will take place of the reasons the judges gave for the decision , and any practical problems will be dealt with .
the spd will suggest any " practicable changes for the future , " scholz told the dpa news agency . christian lange , who introduced the original measure for the spd , said parliamentarians needed to have more " respect and humility " for the decision made by the court .
politicians should obey the law instead of questioning it , lange said . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a nation 's bowel movements are just one of those .
and yet , with obviously nothing better to do , one company could n't resist finding out what germans did on the toilet . it is widely believed that elvis presley died on his while wearing a diaper and enjoying one of his grilled peanut butter , banana , honey and bacon sandwiches .
madonna allegedly insists hers has a new seat fitted every day after having the sealed item inspected by her staff .
people do have the strangest habits when it comes to their toilets – and the germans -lrb- while not quite so anal , if you excuse the pun -rrb- are no exception .
according to a new survey commissioned by toilet paper firm zewa - presumably instigated by people at the company who have nothing better to do - 52 percent of the germans polled admitted to either pondering world events or catching up on literature of choice while on the porcelain throne .
it seems that the country which has given the world many great thinkers and poets continues to be filled by people who take every opportunity to read , even when they are " lightening the load . "

a nation 's bowel movements are just one of those .
and yet , with obviously nothing better to do , one company could n't resist finding out what germans did on the toilet . it is widely believed that elvis presley died on his while wearing a diaper and enjoying one of his grilled peanut butter , banana , honey and bacon sandwiches .
madonna allegedly insists hers has a new seat fitted every day after having the sealed item inspected by her staff .
people do have the strangest habits when it comes to their toilets – and the germans -lrb- while not quite so anal , if you excuse the pun -rrb- are no exception .
according to a new survey commissioned by toilet paper firm zewa - presumably instigated by people at the company who have nothing better to do - 52 percent of the germans polled admitted to either pondering world events or catching up on literature of choice while on the porcelain throne .
it seems that the country which has given the world many great thinkers and poets continues to be filled by people who take every opportunity to read , even when they are " lightening the load . "
german men tend to favor computer magazines and daily newspapers to help " grease the wheels " while some , 18 percent in fact , even take the opportunity to analyze instruction manuals .
their womenfolk , meanwhile , prefer to pass the time with celebrity magazines and novels .
men take their sweet time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " help !
i got cramp ! "
german men also seem to take longer to get through their ablutions and reading material than german women .
the study shows that 34 percent of men spend between five and ten minutes on the toilet , which is unsurprising given the level of technical language and geopolitical debate in their chosen reading material .
real connoisseurs , some 16 percent of those polled , go from cover to cover in mammoth sessions lasting between ten and 15 minutes .
the ladies seem to have a pavlovian response to reading on the toilet with 49 percent of them getting in and out between two to five minutes , giving them barely enough time to flick a page of their favored spy or suspense paperback .
-lrb- apparently romantic fiction does not sit well on the toilet . -rrb-
not all germans combine bowel movements with a spot of light reading .
the survey shows that 34 percent of germans actually do nothing other than what nature intended when they go to the lavatory .
these must be the thinkers , rather than the poets .
music lovers go for an ipoo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans like to bring their own soundtrack young germans bring their own modern take on passing time in the smallest room in the house .
the survey showed that 26 percent of 14-29 year olds listen to music on the loo .
one can only speculate whether specific playlists are compiled for these visits .
if they are , one might assume that songs like " -lrb- i can ’ t get no -rrb- satisfaction " by the rolling stones and " can ’ t stand the strain " by funkadelic would be omitted .
the same percentage of 14-29 year olds also send sms messages while going through the motions .
the mind boggles at what information these messages could possibly contain .
elsewhere in the study , statistics point to a trend of more leisurely visits in the twilight years of life with almost half of those polled over 50 years old saying they do absolutely nothing in the toilet .
this 49 percent obviously need more roughage in their diet .
there are also regional differences in toilet habits within germany .
just less than half of those inhabitants from mecklenburg-west pomerania who were polled tend to day-dream during their nirvana-esque bouts of relief-inspired enlightenment .
i did it " my way " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what will it be today ?
oklahoma or big spender ? "
meanwhile , the toilets of saxony-anhalt are alive with the sound of incumbents crooning " my way " , with ten percent of those polled admitting to making the most of the acoustics by belting out a few show tunes and standards while relieving themselves .
it certainly seems that anything goes in germany once that sign on the door flips from " vacant " to " occupied . "

france also reported new cases and upped its own alert . germany ' top state veterinary laboratory raised the risk level after more wild birds had tested positive for h5n1 in the eastern states of saxony-anhalt and thuringia . " we will raise the threat level , " a spokeswoman for the friedrich löffler institute told reporters .
the regional authorities in sangerhausen in saxony-anhalt reported that 38 dead birds found on the shores of an artificial lake near the town of kelbra had all tested positive .
saxony-anhalt is the fourth of germany 's 16 states to report cases of h5n1 bird flu since late last month , when it struck down six wild birds in the southern city of nuremberg in bavaria .
on tuesday , a bird found on the other side of the lake which is in thuringia was confirmed to have had h5n1 bird flu .
cases have also been reported near leipzig in the neighboring eastern state of saxony , bordering the czech republic which is battling a more severe outbreak of the h5n1 avian flu .
german poultry as yet unaffected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wild birds have so far been the only ones affected the friedrich löffler institute suggested the disease could have jumped the border from the czech side where it has infected turkey and chicken farms .
so far in germany the new outbreak has been restricted to swans , geese and other wild birds and has not affected poultry farms .
germany battled a widespread bird flu epidemic in 2006 .
it broke out on the baltic sea island of rügen and spread to six states , including bavaria .

" france is not threatened by a bird flu pandemic as there has not been , for the moment , a human contamination from the h5n1 virus , " bachelot said .
but she added " we must be vigilant as the great flu epidemic that followed the war of 1914 , the spanish flu " came from a strain of bird flu .
scientists believe a strain related to today 's bird flu virus caused the death of tens of millions of people during the spanish flu pandemic .
" we must do what is necessary to ensure that all of the agencies , the entire health system is ready to deal with a mutation of the virus " that could attack humans , said bachelot on french television .
fresh measures were ordered to ensure that chickens and other poultry did not enter into contact with wild birds and that they underwent monthly veterinary checks .
pigeon competitions have been banned and security around a one-kilometer -lrb- 0.6 mile -rrb- exclusion zone established around the pond in the moselle department where the dead swans were discovered has been beefed up .
a second 15-kilometer " observation " zone was set up around the pond at assenoncourt but a spokesman for the local municipality said no other dead birds had been found there , which he described as a " reassuring " sign .
french poultry farms ready for lockdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poultry farms dread having to cull their flocks " these measures apply to all farms that must be protected from wild birds that fly overhead .
these protective measures are nets and a ban on bringing birds together in public places and at markets , " barnier said .
officials put three farms in the observation zone under quarantine , and restricted access to roads in the area .
" with these measures that we are taking , the risk of contamination will be very small , " said philippe hestroffer , of the regional veterinary services .
a first outbreak of h5n1 in february 2006 was detected in 62 dead birds in central france and spread to a farm near the town of versailleux where hundreds of turkeys were slaughtered .
it was also the first outbreak of the virulent strain in the european union .
france produces 900 million poultry per year including 700 million chickens , according to the confederation of french poultry producers .
the sector employs 80,000 people and generated four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- last year .
authorities act in the netherlands in the netherlands , the authorities ordered all poultry to be kept inside .
they announced the measure after what they called the discovery of a bird flu case " not far from the netherlands . "
while the bird flu virus is highly contagious among poultry and can spread to an entire flock , it remains difficult for humans to catch .

building something from nothing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands celebrated in the resort town early thursday but now reality has set in .
sochi organizers acknowledge they have a massive task ahead of them to turn the impoverished resort town into an olympic hub in seven years .
the road from sochi 's seashore to the mountains is narrow and runs through an economically depressed area of small farms .
by 2014 it will have a high-tech train line , new roads , ice arenas , sporting venues and everything else needed for the games .
environmentalists say this transformation will threaten an already fragile ecosystem in the caucus mountains .
environmental concerns bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sochi has palms and powder the sochi olympics will not be " green , " said thomas tennhardt of the german association for nature conservation -lrb- nabu . -rrb-
" valuable nature is going to be irrevocably destroyed for 16 days of winter olympics , " tennhardt said thursday .
" once again ecological interests are sacrificed for economics . "
sotschi is in the south of russia .
the area has relatively mild weather and in recent years has suffered from climate change .
building an olympic infrastructure will further hurt the area 's delicate ecological balance , tennhardt said .
andrej petrow , head of greenpeace in russia , also criticized the plan to hold the olympics so close to the sochi national park .
" russia does n't adhere to international agreements to protect the world 's natural inheritance and yet the ioc still supports it , " petrow said .
habitats for threatened plant and animal species will be destroyed to make way for luxury sports sites and spas , petrow said .
this goes against russian environmental protection laws and goes against international agreements , petrow said .
russia 's legacy to the world bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin skis at sochi sochi beat out korean candidate pyeongchang , viewed by many to be the ioc favorites , by 51 votes to 47 .
dmitri chernyshenko , who headed the bid for the russians , said it was time to begin the hard work of turning promises into reality .
chernyshenko said he was confident sochi would meet all requirements and pledges .
" the government has to meet the critical needs of the ioc and we have to manage all the stakeholders such as the management and the investors , " he said .
" it will not just be a process of construction because winning these games will see the implementation of new laws and changes in russian society . "
chernyshenko will fly to switzerland monday to visit ioc personnel .
" this concept is a great legacy for russia and the world , " he said .
" we will succeed as we have now a very experienced team who had one single goal - bringing the olympic games to russia . "
image boost for putin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia 's win was considered an upset the decision was a major win for russian president vladimir putin , who was a primary champion of the campaign .
putin said the award recognized russia 's sports tradition and important place in the world .
" this is support from one of the most authoritative and independent international organizations - the international olympic committee , " he said .
the german press was critical of the decision .
many editorials pointed out that sochi is not a traditional winter sports destination and that the decision was a major victory for putin , who has recently clashed with europe over decisions seen as anti-democratic .
the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung called the award a " political failure . "
it comes at a time when russia is on an anti-democratic course and the olympics will serve as further propaganda , the newspaper said .
the ioc picked moscow because of its enormous financial power , said an editorial in the frankfurter neue presse .
the newspaper was skeptical of putin 's promise to make sure the area 's environment was protected .
with his record of squelching public criticism , these promises " should not be trusted , " the newspaper said . dw staff from wire reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the information is misleading and unfair , they say .
a court ruled it 's necessary to bring more transparency to german politics . a day after germany 's highest court ruled that information about the extra money politicians earn from side jobs should be made public , the information was posted on the german parliament 's web site .
politicians have been quick to criticize the move , saying the information is misleading and unfair .
detailed information about who politicians work for and how much money they make went public after germany 's federal constitutional court ruled wednesday that the highly paid side jobs could compromise parliamentarians ' independence .
the public has a right to know if representatives earn money on the side , the court ruled . politicians have privacy concerns politicians have complained that jobs held before being elected are listed in the same way as those held while in office .
they also feel it reveals proprietary business information to competitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians practice law on the side germany 's highest court dismissed privacy concerns .
in this case , the right to privacy was secondary to the public interest in transparency , the court ruled .
transparency international endorsed the decision with the organization 's german head calling for even more transparency . " we are waiting for more openness from the parliamentarians and from everyone a more exact breakdown of the payments , " christian humborg told the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung . corruption concerns fueled legislation the issue started with the previous social democrat-green government in 2005 in response to a scandal about parliamentarians who were on the payrolls of german corporations .
many did n't seem to do much to earn the extra incomes . the revelations of these plum side jobs cost some politicians their jobs .
it also raised concerns in the country about possible corruption and a conflict of interest if politicians were closely connected to big companies .
some also questioned why politicians , who are paid well in germany , needed to take up another job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians are a well-paid group german parliamentarians get a monthly salary of approximately 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 9,500 . -rrb-
the ruling requires all extra monthly income over 1,000 euros -lrb- 1,360 dollars -rrb- to be declared .
politicians must indicate approximately how much they earn by choosing between three different categories .
the parliament passed a bill in 2005 requiring the information on income earned from side jobs to be made public .
nine politicians from several political parties brought a court case to stop the law , saying that it violated their privacy .
of the politicians that brought the court case , one is a businessman , one owns an insurance company and seven are lawyers .
a quarter of the members of parliament are attorneys .
they are concerned that the law interferes with client confidentiality .
bernhard dombek , president of the german federal bar association , was critical of the law .
although it does n't require that attorneys list the names of their clients , it will be easier to figure out who they are , dombek told the tagesspiegel daily .
he predicted people will be less interested in serving as politicians . some changes possible olaf scholz of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said friday that a careful examination will take place of the reasons the judges gave for the decision , and any practical problems will be dealt with .
the spd will suggest any " practicable changes for the future , " scholz told the dpa news agency . christian lange , who introduced the original measure for the spd , said parliamentarians needed to have more " respect and humility " for the decision made by the court .

russia will spend another 9 billion euros to build the needed infrastructure and sports facilities .
russia launched wild celebrations after the international olympic committee 's -lrb- ioc -rrb- decision was announced in guatemala wednesday .
building something from nothing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands celebrated in the resort town early thursday but now reality has set in .
sochi organizers acknowledge they have a massive task ahead of them to turn the impoverished resort town into an olympic hub in seven years .
the road from sochi 's seashore to the mountains is narrow and runs through an economically depressed area of small farms .
by 2014 it will have a high-tech train line , new roads , ice arenas , sporting venues and everything else needed for the games .
environmentalists say this transformation will threaten an already fragile ecosystem in the caucus mountains .

" valuable nature is going to be irrevocably destroyed for 16 days of winter olympics , " tennhardt said thursday .
" once again ecological interests are sacrificed for economics . "
sotschi is in the south of russia .
the area has relatively mild weather and in recent years has suffered from climate change .
building an olympic infrastructure will further hurt the area 's delicate ecological balance , tennhardt said .
andrej petrow , head of greenpeace in russia , also criticized the plan to hold the olympics so close to the sochi national park .
" russia does n't adhere to international agreements to protect the world 's natural inheritance and yet the ioc still supports it , " petrow said .
habitats for threatened plant and animal species will be destroyed to make way for luxury sports sites and spas , petrow said .
this goes against russian environmental protection laws and goes against international agreements , petrow said .

dmitri chernyshenko , who headed the bid for the russians , said it was time to begin the hard work of turning promises into reality .
chernyshenko said he was confident sochi would meet all requirements and pledges .
" the government has to meet the critical needs of the ioc and we have to manage all the stakeholders such as the management and the investors , " he said .
" it will not just be a process of construction because winning these games will see the implementation of new laws and changes in russian society . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 06.07.2007 germany , france raise bird flu risk level after new h5n1 cases großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the fear that the h5n1 strain will jump to humans has contributed to high alert levels germany has raised its bird flu risk assessment level after it was reported that 38 new cases of the deadly h5n1 strain were discovered in the country 's east .
france also reported new cases and upped its own alert . germany ' top state veterinary laboratory raised the risk level after more wild birds had tested positive for h5n1 in the eastern states of saxony-anhalt and thuringia . " we will raise the threat level , " a spokeswoman for the friedrich löffler institute told reporters .
the regional authorities in sangerhausen in saxony-anhalt reported that 38 dead birds found on the shores of an artificial lake near the town of kelbra had all tested positive .
saxony-anhalt is the fourth of germany 's 16 states to report cases of h5n1 bird flu since late last month , when it struck down six wild birds in the southern city of nuremberg in bavaria .
on tuesday , a bird found on the other side of the lake which is in thuringia was confirmed to have had h5n1 bird flu .
cases have also been reported near leipzig in the neighboring eastern state of saxony , bordering the czech republic which is battling a more severe outbreak of the h5n1 avian flu .
german poultry as yet unaffected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wild birds have so far been the only ones affected the friedrich löffler institute suggested the disease could have jumped the border from the czech side where it has infected turkey and chicken farms .
so far in germany the new outbreak has been restricted to swans , geese and other wild birds and has not affected poultry farms .
germany battled a widespread bird flu epidemic in 2006 .
it broke out on the baltic sea island of rügen and spread to six states , including bavaria .
the disease spread to mammals , infecting three cats and a stone marten , but did not affect humans .
in neighboring france , europe 's biggest poultry producer , authorities stepped up surveillance after tests on three dead swans confirmed an h5n1 outbreak .
agriculture minister michel barnier raised the threat level from bird flu from " moderate " to “ high " following the test results on the swans that were found dead in northeast france last week .
france on high alert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emergency plans are swinging into action in france it is france 's second outbreak of the deadly strain of bird flu in 17 months , but health minister roselyne bachelot said there was no reason for alarm . " france is not threatened by a bird flu pandemic as there has not been , for the moment , a human contamination from the h5n1 virus , " bachelot said .
but she added " we must be vigilant as the great flu epidemic that followed the war of 1914 , the spanish flu " came from a strain of bird flu .
scientists believe a strain related to today 's bird flu virus caused the death of tens of millions of people during the spanish flu pandemic .
" we must do what is necessary to ensure that all of the agencies , the entire health system is ready to deal with a mutation of the virus " that could attack humans , said bachelot on french television .
fresh measures were ordered to ensure that chickens and other poultry did not enter into contact with wild birds and that they underwent monthly veterinary checks .
pigeon competitions have been banned and security around a one-kilometer -lrb- 0.6 mile -rrb- exclusion zone established around the pond in the moselle department where the dead swans were discovered has been beefed up .
a second 15-kilometer " observation " zone was set up around the pond at assenoncourt but a spokesman for the local municipality said no other dead birds had been found there , which he described as a " reassuring " sign .
french poultry farms ready for lockdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poultry farms dread having to cull their flocks " these measures apply to all farms that must be protected from wild birds that fly overhead .
these protective measures are nets and a ban on bringing birds together in public places and at markets , " barnier said .
officials put three farms in the observation zone under quarantine , and restricted access to roads in the area .
" with these measures that we are taking , the risk of contamination will be very small , " said philippe hestroffer , of the regional veterinary services .
a first outbreak of h5n1 in february 2006 was detected in 62 dead birds in central france and spread to a farm near the town of versailleux where hundreds of turkeys were slaughtered .
it was also the first outbreak of the virulent strain in the european union .
france produces 900 million poultry per year including 700 million chickens , according to the confederation of french poultry producers .
the sector employs 80,000 people and generated four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- last year .
authorities act in the netherlands in the netherlands , the authorities ordered all poultry to be kept inside .
they announced the measure after what they called the discovery of a bird flu case " not far from the netherlands . "
while the bird flu virus is highly contagious among poultry and can spread to an entire flock , it remains difficult for humans to catch .
a total of 191 people worldwide have died of bird flu , according to the world health organization , which has reported 317 cases in its june 29 tally .

france also reported new cases and upped its own alert . germany ' top state veterinary laboratory raised the risk level after more wild birds had tested positive for h5n1 in the eastern states of saxony-anhalt and thuringia . " we will raise the threat level , " a spokeswoman for the friedrich löffler institute told reporters .
the regional authorities in sangerhausen in saxony-anhalt reported that 38 dead birds found on the shores of an artificial lake near the town of kelbra had all tested positive .
saxony-anhalt is the fourth of germany 's 16 states to report cases of h5n1 bird flu since late last month , when it struck down six wild birds in the southern city of nuremberg in bavaria .
on tuesday , a bird found on the other side of the lake which is in thuringia was confirmed to have had h5n1 bird flu .
cases have also been reported near leipzig in the neighboring eastern state of saxony , bordering the czech republic which is battling a more severe outbreak of the h5n1 avian flu .
german poultry as yet unaffected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wild birds have so far been the only ones affected the friedrich löffler institute suggested the disease could have jumped the border from the czech side where it has infected turkey and chicken farms .
so far in germany the new outbreak has been restricted to swans , geese and other wild birds and has not affected poultry farms .
germany battled a widespread bird flu epidemic in 2006 .
it broke out on the baltic sea island of rügen and spread to six states , including bavaria .
the disease spread to mammals , infecting three cats and a stone marten , but did not affect humans .
in neighboring france , europe 's biggest poultry producer , authorities stepped up surveillance after tests on three dead swans confirmed an h5n1 outbreak .
agriculture minister michel barnier raised the threat level from bird flu from " moderate " to “ high " following the test results on the swans that were found dead in northeast france last week .
france on high alert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emergency plans are swinging into action in france it is france 's second outbreak of the deadly strain of bird flu in 17 months , but health minister roselyne bachelot said there was no reason for alarm . " france is not threatened by a bird flu pandemic as there has not been , for the moment , a human contamination from the h5n1 virus , " bachelot said .
but she added " we must be vigilant as the great flu epidemic that followed the war of 1914 , the spanish flu " came from a strain of bird flu .
scientists believe a strain related to today 's bird flu virus caused the death of tens of millions of people during the spanish flu pandemic .
" we must do what is necessary to ensure that all of the agencies , the entire health system is ready to deal with a mutation of the virus " that could attack humans , said bachelot on french television .
fresh measures were ordered to ensure that chickens and other poultry did not enter into contact with wild birds and that they underwent monthly veterinary checks .
pigeon competitions have been banned and security around a one-kilometer -lrb- 0.6 mile -rrb- exclusion zone established around the pond in the moselle department where the dead swans were discovered has been beefed up .
a second 15-kilometer " observation " zone was set up around the pond at assenoncourt but a spokesman for the local municipality said no other dead birds had been found there , which he described as a " reassuring " sign .
french poultry farms ready for lockdown bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poultry farms dread having to cull their flocks " these measures apply to all farms that must be protected from wild birds that fly overhead .
these protective measures are nets and a ban on bringing birds together in public places and at markets , " barnier said .
officials put three farms in the observation zone under quarantine , and restricted access to roads in the area .
" with these measures that we are taking , the risk of contamination will be very small , " said philippe hestroffer , of the regional veterinary services .
a first outbreak of h5n1 in february 2006 was detected in 62 dead birds in central france and spread to a farm near the town of versailleux where hundreds of turkeys were slaughtered .
it was also the first outbreak of the virulent strain in the european union .
france produces 900 million poultry per year including 700 million chickens , according to the confederation of french poultry producers .
the sector employs 80,000 people and generated four billion euros -lrb- $ 5.4 billion -rrb- last year .
authorities act in the netherlands in the netherlands , the authorities ordered all poultry to be kept inside .

such is the uncertainty about many of the riders that the line-up for the 2007 tour is still in doubt . many thought that the scandal that overshadowed the 2006 tour was the largest of all time and the investigation that followed would finally uncover the nefarious networks which operate under the radar of the sport 's authorities .
before last year 's race , stars like jan ullrich and ivan basso were excluded with almost 50 other riders due to their alleged associations with the man at the center of a blood-doping circle , the spaniard eufemianos fuentes .
the race went ahead regardless only for the eventual winner , the american floyd landis , to be revealed as a drug cheat a few days after celebrating his success on the champs-elysee .
and yet , despite the admissions , revelations and recriminations arising from the 2006 tour , the 2007 race could be an even more disgraced event .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 06.07.2007 study reveals germany 's toilet habits whether you like it or not großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans get up to many things in the toilet , including , it seems , turning to the dark side some things should remain private .
a nation 's bowel movements are just one of those .
and yet , with obviously nothing better to do , one company could n't resist finding out what germans did on the toilet . it is widely believed that elvis presley died on his while wearing a diaper and enjoying one of his grilled peanut butter , banana , honey and bacon sandwiches .
madonna allegedly insists hers has a new seat fitted every day after having the sealed item inspected by her staff .
people do have the strangest habits when it comes to their toilets – and the germans -lrb- while not quite so anal , if you excuse the pun -rrb- are no exception .
according to a new survey commissioned by toilet paper firm zewa - presumably instigated by people at the company who have nothing better to do - 52 percent of the germans polled admitted to either pondering world events or catching up on literature of choice while on the porcelain throne .
it seems that the country which has given the world many great thinkers and poets continues to be filled by people who take every opportunity to read , even when they are " lightening the load . "
german men tend to favor computer magazines and daily newspapers to help " grease the wheels " while some , 18 percent in fact , even take the opportunity to analyze instruction manuals .
their womenfolk , meanwhile , prefer to pass the time with celebrity magazines and novels .
men take their sweet time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " help !
i got cramp ! "
german men also seem to take longer to get through their ablutions and reading material than german women .
the study shows that 34 percent of men spend between five and ten minutes on the toilet , which is unsurprising given the level of technical language and geopolitical debate in their chosen reading material .
real connoisseurs , some 16 percent of those polled , go from cover to cover in mammoth sessions lasting between ten and 15 minutes .
the ladies seem to have a pavlovian response to reading on the toilet with 49 percent of them getting in and out between two to five minutes , giving them barely enough time to flick a page of their favored spy or suspense paperback .
-lrb- apparently romantic fiction does not sit well on the toilet . -rrb-
not all germans combine bowel movements with a spot of light reading .
the survey shows that 34 percent of germans actually do nothing other than what nature intended when they go to the lavatory .
these must be the thinkers , rather than the poets .
music lovers go for an ipoo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans like to bring their own soundtrack young germans bring their own modern take on passing time in the smallest room in the house .
the survey showed that 26 percent of 14-29 year olds listen to music on the loo .
one can only speculate whether specific playlists are compiled for these visits .
if they are , one might assume that songs like " -lrb- i can ’ t get no -rrb- satisfaction " by the rolling stones and " can ’ t stand the strain " by funkadelic would be omitted .
the same percentage of 14-29 year olds also send sms messages while going through the motions .
the mind boggles at what information these messages could possibly contain .
elsewhere in the study , statistics point to a trend of more leisurely visits in the twilight years of life with almost half of those polled over 50 years old saying they do absolutely nothing in the toilet .
this 49 percent obviously need more roughage in their diet .
there are also regional differences in toilet habits within germany .
just less than half of those inhabitants from mecklenburg-west pomerania who were polled tend to day-dream during their nirvana-esque bouts of relief-inspired enlightenment .
i did it " my way " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what will it be today ?
oklahoma or big spender ? "
meanwhile , the toilets of saxony-anhalt are alive with the sound of incumbents crooning " my way " , with ten percent of those polled admitting to making the most of the acoustics by belting out a few show tunes and standards while relieving themselves .
it certainly seems that anything goes in germany once that sign on the door flips from " vacant " to " occupied . "

the new ballinstadt museum showcases the role hamburg played in the lives of those whose destination was the new world . european emigrants boarded ships for the americas in the search for freedom , tolerance and enough to eat .
between 1850 and 1939 five million europeans left from hamburg , most of them headed for the united states .
for the central and eastern europen emigrants who headed for the americas starting in 1880 , the cheapest way to reach the new world was to take a train to the north sea coast , then board a ship to cross the atlantic . staging area for american adventure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : advertisements for a better life the ballinstadt museum offers visitors replicas of dormitory buildings , using some of the original red bricks , where immigrants stayed before embarking on the long journey to the americas .
albert ballin , general manager of the well-known german shipping company hapag , built the housing complex between 1901 and 1907 .
ballin , who was jewish , saw eastern european jews as an important customer base .
his dormitories had kosher food options .
he also provided space for a synagogue as well as a christian chapel .
the dormitory facility allowed hapag to keep its customers healthy .
it also served as a way to screen those with infectious diseases , who were likely to be barred by us immigration officers at ellis island in new york and sent back to europe at the line 's expense .
the hostel 's comfort also helped hamburg get a competitive edge over bremen and antwerp for shipping customers .
the rivalry continues today .
bremen opened its own emigration museum in 2005 .
both cities are trying to develop a tourist industry based on their history as major port towns . bildunterschrift : the museum shows historic movie footage set in picture frames treasure trove for geneologists besides the dormitories , the museum has a multimedia exhibit describes the ordeal poor people went through to reach the americas and also follows the lives of immigrants once they arrived .
the interactive aspect of the exhibit is designed to appeal to young people .
there 's movie footage , hand-tinted photographs and mannequins who tell emigrants ' stories .
the museum is also a treasure trove for genealogists , with digitalized , searchable passenger lists of emigrants who left from hamburg .
an estimated 20 million americans are direct descendents from the emigrants who left from hamburg .
the museum 's cafe has emigrant-era tables and benches , but serves modern food .
the 12 million euro -lrb- $ 16 million -rrb- emigration museum opened for the general public thursday in hamburg 's veddel neighborhood where 60 percent of the residents are immigrants , most of them from eastern europe and turkey .
the buildings are set in a landscaped area that will double as a public park . dw staff / dpa -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the change will take effect in 2008 , but wo n't save businesses a lot of money . germany 's lower house of parliament , the bundestag , had already passed the change in may .
from 2008 , the corporate tax rate will now be lowered from 38.7 percent to 29.8 percent , taking germany from its current position as one of the eu countries with the highest rates to the middle field .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 06.07.2007 interbau : the modernization of germany the international architecture exhibit interbau , which opened on july 6 , 1957 in berlin 's hansa neighborhood , came to be seen as a tangible example of germany 's modernization and a side effect of the cold war . summer 1957 was a hot one , wrote the berliner zeitung .
but soaring temperatures did n't keep some 1.4 million people from visiting the interbau exhibit in berlin . when the show drew to a close in late september , 900,000 people had viewed the hansa neighborhood alone and 375,000 had ridden the chair-lift specially built for the first interbau event , added the berlin paper . in the early 1950s , west berliners had been appalled by the view of the new socialist-style apartment and retail buildings along stalinallee -lrb- today karl-marx-allee -rrb- in east berlin and the enthusiasm with which the young gdr built its workers ' palace , author nikolaus bernau told the berliner zeitung .
as a counterweight to these large-scale soviet building projects , the west decided to reinstate the tradition of architectural exhibitions . competing with the east a response to the gdr 's first major reconstruction plan , interbau was intended to " demonstrate the new , democratic western germany to the outside world , which was on the side of the french , british , italian and americans , not only politically but also culturally , " said bernau . this attitude may explain the project 's exorbitant cost .
instead of reconstructing post-war ruins and making use of the old infrastructure , property was redistributed , streets were rebuilt and the interbau exhibit was viewed as a counterbalance to the monumental structures of 1950s east berlin . the " city of tomorrow " in preparation for the exhibit , an architecture contest was announced .
willy kreuer and gerhard jobst took the prize with their relaxed building ideas .
in place of the old barrack-like block developments , they generated space by more freely positioning their buildings . public parks were a top priority in what was supposed to be the " city of tomorrow " : a zoological garden was integrated into the hansa neighborhood , which was encircled by high-rises , apartment blocks , single-family homes and churches .
shops , restaurants , a movie theater , a library and the subway at hansa square were to make up the heart of the district . by the time the interbau exhibit ended in 1957 , only 601 of today 's 1,160 apartment units were completed .
the remaining 35 apartment buildings were finished by 1960 . help from abroad fifty-three architects from around the world , some of them internationally renowned , were invited to help .
oscar niemeyer from brazil , arne jacobsen from denmark , alvar aalto from finland and the german bauhaus founder walter gropius - who , according to the berliner zeitung , had considered himself an american since his emigration to the us in 1937 - were among them . arne jacobsen , who fled to sweden during world war two because of his jewish ancestry , built four houses for the berlin exhibit , all in the style of mies van der rohe 's 1930s villas . oscar niemeyer 's only project in germany was completed in honor of the interbau event .
his eight-story apartment block set on v-shaped supports celebrates its 50th anniversary this year - its creator 's 100th birthday . the house of world cultures , then a convention center , and an apartment block by le corbusier in the charlottenburg district were later integrated into the interbau project . the entire interbau collection received landmark status in 1995 . carlos albuquerque -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the information is misleading and unfair , they say .
a court ruled it 's necessary to bring more transparency to german politics . a day after germany 's highest court ruled that information about the extra money politicians earn from side jobs should be made public , the information was posted on the german parliament 's web site .
politicians have been quick to criticize the move , saying the information is misleading and unfair .
detailed information about who politicians work for and how much money they make went public after germany 's federal constitutional court ruled wednesday that the highly paid side jobs could compromise parliamentarians ' independence .
the public has a right to know if representatives earn money on the side , the court ruled . politicians have privacy concerns politicians have complained that jobs held before being elected are listed in the same way as those held while in office .
they also feel it reveals proprietary business information to competitors . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some politicians practice law on the side germany 's highest court dismissed privacy concerns .
in this case , the right to privacy was secondary to the public interest in transparency , the court ruled .
transparency international endorsed the decision with the organization 's german head calling for even more transparency . " we are waiting for more openness from the parliamentarians and from everyone a more exact breakdown of the payments , " christian humborg told the westdeutsche allgemeine zeitung . corruption concerns fueled legislation the issue started with the previous social democrat-green government in 2005 in response to a scandal about parliamentarians who were on the payrolls of german corporations .
many did n't seem to do much to earn the extra incomes . the revelations of these plum side jobs cost some politicians their jobs .
it also raised concerns in the country about possible corruption and a conflict of interest if politicians were closely connected to big companies .
some also questioned why politicians , who are paid well in germany , needed to take up another job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german politicians are a well-paid group german parliamentarians get a monthly salary of approximately 7,000 euros -lrb- $ 9,500 . -rrb-
the ruling requires all extra monthly income over 1,000 euros -lrb- 1,360 dollars -rrb- to be declared .
politicians must indicate approximately how much they earn by choosing between three different categories .
the parliament passed a bill in 2005 requiring the information on income earned from side jobs to be made public .
nine politicians from several political parties brought a court case to stop the law , saying that it violated their privacy .
of the politicians that brought the court case , one is a businessman , one owns an insurance company and seven are lawyers .
a quarter of the members of parliament are attorneys .
they are concerned that the law interferes with client confidentiality .
bernhard dombek , president of the german federal bar association , was critical of the law .
although it does n't require that attorneys list the names of their clients , it will be easier to figure out who they are , dombek told the tagesspiegel daily .
he predicted people will be less interested in serving as politicians . some changes possible olaf scholz of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- said friday that a careful examination will take place of the reasons the judges gave for the decision , and any practical problems will be dealt with .
the spd will suggest any " practicable changes for the future , " scholz told the dpa news agency . christian lange , who introduced the original measure for the spd , said parliamentarians needed to have more " respect and humility " for the decision made by the court .
politicians should obey the law instead of questioning it , lange said . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de architecture -pipe- 06.07.2007 interbau : the modernization of germany the international architecture exhibit interbau , which opened on july 6 , 1957 in berlin 's hansa neighborhood , came to be seen as a tangible example of germany 's modernization and a side effect of the cold war . summer 1957 was a hot one , wrote the berliner zeitung .
but soaring temperatures did n't keep some 1.4 million people from visiting the interbau exhibit in berlin . when the show drew to a close in late september , 900,000 people had viewed the hansa neighborhood alone and 375,000 had ridden the chair-lift specially built for the first interbau event , added the berlin paper . in the early 1950s , west berliners had been appalled by the view of the new socialist-style apartment and retail buildings along stalinallee -lrb- today karl-marx-allee -rrb- in east berlin and the enthusiasm with which the young gdr built its workers ' palace , author nikolaus bernau told the berliner zeitung .
as a counterweight to these large-scale soviet building projects , the west decided to reinstate the tradition of architectural exhibitions . competing with the east a response to the gdr 's first major reconstruction plan , interbau was intended to " demonstrate the new , democratic western germany to the outside world , which was on the side of the french , british , italian and americans , not only politically but also culturally , " said bernau . this attitude may explain the project 's exorbitant cost .
instead of reconstructing post-war ruins and making use of the old infrastructure , property was redistributed , streets were rebuilt and the interbau exhibit was viewed as a counterbalance to the monumental structures of 1950s east berlin . the " city of tomorrow " in preparation for the exhibit , an architecture contest was announced .
willy kreuer and gerhard jobst took the prize with their relaxed building ideas .
in place of the old barrack-like block developments , they generated space by more freely positioning their buildings . public parks were a top priority in what was supposed to be the " city of tomorrow " : a zoological garden was integrated into the hansa neighborhood , which was encircled by high-rises , apartment blocks , single-family homes and churches .
shops , restaurants , a movie theater , a library and the subway at hansa square were to make up the heart of the district . by the time the interbau exhibit ended in 1957 , only 601 of today 's 1,160 apartment units were completed .
the remaining 35 apartment buildings were finished by 1960 . help from abroad fifty-three architects from around the world , some of them internationally renowned , were invited to help .
oscar niemeyer from brazil , arne jacobsen from denmark , alvar aalto from finland and the german bauhaus founder walter gropius - who , according to the berliner zeitung , had considered himself an american since his emigration to the us in 1937 - were among them . arne jacobsen , who fled to sweden during world war two because of his jewish ancestry , built four houses for the berlin exhibit , all in the style of mies van der rohe 's 1930s villas . oscar niemeyer 's only project in germany was completed in honor of the interbau event .
his eight-story apartment block set on v-shaped supports celebrates its 50th anniversary this year - its creator 's 100th birthday . the house of world cultures , then a convention center , and an apartment block by le corbusier in the charlottenburg district were later integrated into the interbau project . the entire interbau collection received landmark status in 1995 . carlos albuquerque -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but soaring temperatures did n't keep some 1.4 million people from visiting the interbau exhibit in berlin . when the show drew to a close in late september , 900,000 people had viewed the hansa neighborhood alone and 375,000 had ridden the chair-lift specially built for the first interbau event , added the berlin paper . in the early 1950s , west berliners had been appalled by the view of the new socialist-style apartment and retail buildings along stalinallee -lrb- today karl-marx-allee -rrb- in east berlin and the enthusiasm with which the young gdr built its workers ' palace , author nikolaus bernau told the berliner zeitung .
as a counterweight to these large-scale soviet building projects , the west decided to reinstate the tradition of architectural exhibitions . competing with the east a response to the gdr 's first major reconstruction plan , interbau was intended to " demonstrate the new , democratic western germany to the outside world , which was on the side of the french , british , italian and americans , not only politically but also culturally , " said bernau . this attitude may explain the project 's exorbitant cost .
instead of reconstructing post-war ruins and making use of the old infrastructure , property was redistributed , streets were rebuilt and the interbau exhibit was viewed as a counterbalance to the monumental structures of 1950s east berlin . the " city of tomorrow " in preparation for the exhibit , an architecture contest was announced .
willy kreuer and gerhard jobst took the prize with their relaxed building ideas .
in place of the old barrack-like block developments , they generated space by more freely positioning their buildings . public parks were a top priority in what was supposed to be the " city of tomorrow " : a zoological garden was integrated into the hansa neighborhood , which was encircled by high-rises , apartment blocks , single-family homes and churches .
shops , restaurants , a movie theater , a library and the subway at hansa square were to make up the heart of the district . by the time the interbau exhibit ended in 1957 , only 601 of today 's 1,160 apartment units were completed .
the remaining 35 apartment buildings were finished by 1960 . help from abroad fifty-three architects from around the world , some of them internationally renowned , were invited to help .
oscar niemeyer from brazil , arne jacobsen from denmark , alvar aalto from finland and the german bauhaus founder walter gropius - who , according to the berliner zeitung , had considered himself an american since his emigration to the us in 1937 - were among them . arne jacobsen , who fled to sweden during world war two because of his jewish ancestry , built four houses for the berlin exhibit , all in the style of mies van der rohe 's 1930s villas . oscar niemeyer 's only project in germany was completed in honor of the interbau event .
his eight-story apartment block set on v-shaped supports celebrates its 50th anniversary this year - its creator 's 100th birthday . the house of world cultures , then a convention center , and an apartment block by le corbusier in the charlottenburg district were later integrated into the interbau project . the entire interbau collection received landmark status in 1995 . carlos albuquerque -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the project 's been controversial because of scientology member tom cruise 's involvement . the german federal film fund -lrb- dfff -rrb- has approved subsidies worth 4.8 million euros -lrb- $ 6.5 million -rrb- for the film " valkyrie . "
" the application was submitted , the criteria for the grant were fulfilled and the project was approved , " said dfff project head christine berg , according to the reuters news service .
the money comes from a new 60-million-euro annual subsidy budget for films by the german government .
to qualify , projects have to involve a german producer and be at least partially made in germany .
the subsidy for " valkyrie " is higher than the total budget for most german films , according to reuters .
a ban on filming bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tom cruise has already checked out possible filming sites in berlin while that may anger some in germany , the main reason for resistance from some politicians and others is that us actor tom cruise is expected to portray count claus von stauffenberg , who was executed after a failed attempt to kill nazi dictator adolf hitler on july 20 , 1944 .
government officials have already said that they will not grant filming permits for germany 's defense ministry in berlin , where stauffenberg was executed .
while some have given cruise 's membership of scientology as the reason , finance ministry officials , who control state properties , said that filming at the site where stauffenberg was executed has been generally banned because of a previous bad experience .
babelsberg cooperates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : babelsberg 's studios are ready for cruise officials for the babelsberg film studio near berlin meanwhile said that they had signed a cooperation agreement with united artists entertainment , which is partially owned by cruise .
" united artists offers us a great chance to bring this historically relevant story to a worldwide audience , " carl woebcken , the ceo of studio babelsberg said in a press release , adding that studio officials considered cruise the " ideal choice " for the movie 's leading role .

instead of reconstructing post-war ruins and making use of the old infrastructure , property was redistributed , streets were rebuilt and the interbau exhibit was viewed as a counterbalance to the monumental structures of 1950s east berlin . the " city of tomorrow " in preparation for the exhibit , an architecture contest was announced .
willy kreuer and gerhard jobst took the prize with their relaxed building ideas .
in place of the old barrack-like block developments , they generated space by more freely positioning their buildings . public parks were a top priority in what was supposed to be the " city of tomorrow " : a zoological garden was integrated into the hansa neighborhood , which was encircled by high-rises , apartment blocks , single-family homes and churches .
shops , restaurants , a movie theater , a library and the subway at hansa square were to make up the heart of the district . by the time the interbau exhibit ended in 1957 , only 601 of today 's 1,160 apartment units were completed .
the remaining 35 apartment buildings were finished by 1960 . help from abroad fifty-three architects from around the world , some of them internationally renowned , were invited to help .
oscar niemeyer from brazil , arne jacobsen from denmark , alvar aalto from finland and the german bauhaus founder walter gropius - who , according to the berliner zeitung , had considered himself an american since his emigration to the us in 1937 - were among them . arne jacobsen , who fled to sweden during world war two because of his jewish ancestry , built four houses for the berlin exhibit , all in the style of mies van der rohe 's 1930s villas . oscar niemeyer 's only project in germany was completed in honor of the interbau event .
his eight-story apartment block set on v-shaped supports celebrates its 50th anniversary this year - its creator 's 100th birthday . the house of world cultures , then a convention center , and an apartment block by le corbusier in the charlottenburg district were later integrated into the interbau project . the entire interbau collection received landmark status in 1995 . carlos albuquerque -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de from the fringe -pipe- 06.07.2007 study reveals germany 's toilet habits whether you like it or not großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans get up to many things in the toilet , including , it seems , turning to the dark side some things should remain private .
a nation 's bowel movements are just one of those .
and yet , with obviously nothing better to do , one company could n't resist finding out what germans did on the toilet . it is widely believed that elvis presley died on his while wearing a diaper and enjoying one of his grilled peanut butter , banana , honey and bacon sandwiches .
madonna allegedly insists hers has a new seat fitted every day after having the sealed item inspected by her staff .
people do have the strangest habits when it comes to their toilets – and the germans -lrb- while not quite so anal , if you excuse the pun -rrb- are no exception .
according to a new survey commissioned by toilet paper firm zewa - presumably instigated by people at the company who have nothing better to do - 52 percent of the germans polled admitted to either pondering world events or catching up on literature of choice while on the porcelain throne .
it seems that the country which has given the world many great thinkers and poets continues to be filled by people who take every opportunity to read , even when they are " lightening the load . "
german men tend to favor computer magazines and daily newspapers to help " grease the wheels " while some , 18 percent in fact , even take the opportunity to analyze instruction manuals .
their womenfolk , meanwhile , prefer to pass the time with celebrity magazines and novels .
men take their sweet time bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " help !
i got cramp ! "
german men also seem to take longer to get through their ablutions and reading material than german women .
the study shows that 34 percent of men spend between five and ten minutes on the toilet , which is unsurprising given the level of technical language and geopolitical debate in their chosen reading material .
real connoisseurs , some 16 percent of those polled , go from cover to cover in mammoth sessions lasting between ten and 15 minutes .
the ladies seem to have a pavlovian response to reading on the toilet with 49 percent of them getting in and out between two to five minutes , giving them barely enough time to flick a page of their favored spy or suspense paperback .
-lrb- apparently romantic fiction does not sit well on the toilet . -rrb-
not all germans combine bowel movements with a spot of light reading .
the survey shows that 34 percent of germans actually do nothing other than what nature intended when they go to the lavatory .
these must be the thinkers , rather than the poets .
music lovers go for an ipoo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some germans like to bring their own soundtrack young germans bring their own modern take on passing time in the smallest room in the house .
the survey showed that 26 percent of 14-29 year olds listen to music on the loo .
one can only speculate whether specific playlists are compiled for these visits .
if they are , one might assume that songs like " -lrb- i can ’ t get no -rrb- satisfaction " by the rolling stones and " can ’ t stand the strain " by funkadelic would be omitted .
the same percentage of 14-29 year olds also send sms messages while going through the motions .
the mind boggles at what information these messages could possibly contain .
elsewhere in the study , statistics point to a trend of more leisurely visits in the twilight years of life with almost half of those polled over 50 years old saying they do absolutely nothing in the toilet .
this 49 percent obviously need more roughage in their diet .
there are also regional differences in toilet habits within germany .
just less than half of those inhabitants from mecklenburg-west pomerania who were polled tend to day-dream during their nirvana-esque bouts of relief-inspired enlightenment .
i did it " my way " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " what will it be today ?
oklahoma or big spender ? "
meanwhile , the toilets of saxony-anhalt are alive with the sound of incumbents crooning " my way " , with ten percent of those polled admitting to making the most of the acoustics by belting out a few show tunes and standards while relieving themselves .
it certainly seems that anything goes in germany once that sign on the door flips from " vacant " to " occupied . "

dw-world.de dw-world : toilets beware , germans follow directions to the dot gps navigation systems are beginning to get a bad rep in germany .
that 's probably because germans are actually too good at following instructions .
even when they are told to crash into a toilet shack .
-lrb- 23.10.2006 -rrb- dw-world : flushed with german pride when american gis in iraq get the call of nature , they politely ask to be excused and tiptoe off to the ladies ' room .
no matter when and where , because their german toilets are like flying carpets : they go everywhere .
-lrb- 27.02.2006 -rrb- dw-world : the days of a free pee are over when nature calls for students in two schools in the state of hesse , they 'd better have 10 cents handy if they want relief .
the school is asking kids to cough up for a pleasant toilet experience .

after the prologue has taken in the sights of central london on saturday , the tour proper will head off through kent , with the first leg ending against the backdrop of canterbury cathedral on sunday .
hosting the start or end of any of the tour 's 20 stages is considered a great honour by the french , but the grand depart is considered to be the most prestigious of all .
cycling fever has taken over london 's parks this year will be the first time the race has begun in such a major city as london - strasbourg , where it began last year , being a more typical venue .
organisers of events in london are hoping to take full advantage of the opportunity to showcase the city in the run-up to the 2012 olympics .
in france , competition to host the tour is intense , with every town eager to bask in the glory of the race .
the bidding process involves much schmoozing , with hopeful mayors vying to wine and dine race officials .
in london 's case , race organiser the aso appears to have jumped at the chance to stage the depart before a backdrop of world-famous landmarks in both london and canterbury .
there was also a £ 1.5m fee paid by the london bid team - a group including transport for london , british cycling , uk sport and sport england - to the aso .
staging the event itself is costing another £ 5.3m , but london and canterbury are expected to receive a massive economic boost from tens of thousands of visitors .
spectators wait for hours to see the riders go past in a flash in total , the tour is expected to be worth £ 70m to the uk economy .
hosting the tour is a massive undertaking .
two million people are expected to line the routes of the first leg through london and kent and hundreds of road closures are planned .
in france local authorities pull out all the stops to make their visitors welcome by putting on festivities and sprucing up their towns - even those where the race will merely flash by in a few minutes can expect hundreds of visitors .
catherine payronnet , of the tourist office in gap , which hosted the start of a stage in 2006 , says the population of the town , normally 40,000 , at least doubled .
spectators get in carnival spirit , dressing up to wave on the cyclists she said : " there were people everywhere , most at the start and finish but also all along the route where the tour was to pass .
people arrived days beforehand with their caravans to get a good spot .
it was like a big party . "
hosting the tour can put even the smallest town on the map - with tv coverage reaching a potential audience of 2.5 billion in more than 80 countries , it is publicity beyond the wildest dreams of cash-strapped local authorities .
in london , organisers are gearing up to make the most of the party atmosphere with a whole string of festivals , carnivals , concerts , street parties , cycling events , markets , displays and exhibitions planned across the city .
more festivities will greet visitors in canterbury , whose 35,000 population is expected to more than double .
french villagers find a way to make sure their village gets noticed along the route , towns and villages are being decorated to welcome the race , with sections of the route lined with miles of bunting and festivities planned from barn dances and carnivals to cream teas and village fetes .
as well as their 15 minutes in the spotlight , these places are all hoping for a share of the £ 37m boost the race is expected to bring to kent .
it is all a far cry from the tour 's first trip to the uk in 1974 , when the riders were confined to a circuit of dual carriageway near plymouth .
britain was better prepared in 1994 , when it hosted two stages of the tour - from dover to brighton , then brighton to portsmouth - attracting three million spectators .
i just hope the crowds are going to stay on behind and spend some money dennis knight send us your comments however , the 1994 experience looks set to pale into significance compared with the huge crowds expected this weekend .
the picturesque weald village of goudhurst , for example , hosted just a handful of spectators in 1994 - this year it is planning for 10,000 .
virtually every pub , restaurant , shop and hall in the village will open , serving refreshments from 0800 bst on race day , with beer tents , children 's entertainment and barbecues laid on and fields converted to car parks .
dennis knight , chairman of goudhurst 's tour de france steering committee , says : " there 's no comparison at all with 1994 .
i just hope the crowds are going to stay on behind and spend some money .
and i hope to goodness it does n't bucket it down with rain . "
police are advising people travelling to watch the tour to use public transport where possible and check in advance for road closures at www.tfl.gov.uk.

hosting the start or end of any of the tour 's 20 stages is considered a great honour by the french , but the grand depart is considered to be the most prestigious of all .
cycling fever has taken over london 's parks this year will be the first time the race has begun in such a major city as london - strasbourg , where it began last year , being a more typical venue .
organisers of events in london are hoping to take full advantage of the opportunity to showcase the city in the run-up to the 2012 olympics .
in france , competition to host the tour is intense , with every town eager to bask in the glory of the race .
the bidding process involves much schmoozing , with hopeful mayors vying to wine and dine race officials .
in london 's case , race organiser the aso appears to have jumped at the chance to stage the depart before a backdrop of world-famous landmarks in both london and canterbury .
there was also a £ 1.5m fee paid by the london bid team - a group including transport for london , british cycling , uk sport and sport england - to the aso .
staging the event itself is costing another £ 5.3m , but london and canterbury are expected to receive a massive economic boost from tens of thousands of visitors .
spectators wait for hours to see the riders go past in a flash in total , the tour is expected to be worth £ 70m to the uk economy .
hosting the tour is a massive undertaking .
two million people are expected to line the routes of the first leg through london and kent and hundreds of road closures are planned .
in france local authorities pull out all the stops to make their visitors welcome by putting on festivities and sprucing up their towns - even those where the race will merely flash by in a few minutes can expect hundreds of visitors .
catherine payronnet , of the tourist office in gap , which hosted the start of a stage in 2006 , says the population of the town , normally 40,000 , at least doubled .
spectators get in carnival spirit , dressing up to wave on the cyclists she said : " there were people everywhere , most at the start and finish but also all along the route where the tour was to pass .
people arrived days beforehand with their caravans to get a good spot .
it was like a big party . "
hosting the tour can put even the smallest town on the map - with tv coverage reaching a potential audience of 2.5 billion in more than 80 countries , it is publicity beyond the wildest dreams of cash-strapped local authorities .
in london , organisers are gearing up to make the most of the party atmosphere with a whole string of festivals , carnivals , concerts , street parties , cycling events , markets , displays and exhibitions planned across the city .
more festivities will greet visitors in canterbury , whose 35,000 population is expected to more than double .
french villagers find a way to make sure their village gets noticed along the route , towns and villages are being decorated to welcome the race , with sections of the route lined with miles of bunting and festivities planned from barn dances and carnivals to cream teas and village fetes .
as well as their 15 minutes in the spotlight , these places are all hoping for a share of the £ 37m boost the race is expected to bring to kent .
it is all a far cry from the tour 's first trip to the uk in 1974 , when the riders were confined to a circuit of dual carriageway near plymouth .
britain was better prepared in 1994 , when it hosted two stages of the tour - from dover to brighton , then brighton to portsmouth - attracting three million spectators .
i just hope the crowds are going to stay on behind and spend some money dennis knight send us your comments however , the 1994 experience looks set to pale into significance compared with the huge crowds expected this weekend .
the picturesque weald village of goudhurst , for example , hosted just a handful of spectators in 1994 - this year it is planning for 10,000 .
virtually every pub , restaurant , shop and hall in the village will open , serving refreshments from 0800 bst on race day , with beer tents , children 's entertainment and barbecues laid on and fields converted to car parks .
dennis knight , chairman of goudhurst 's tour de france steering committee , says : " there 's no comparison at all with 1994 .
i just hope the crowds are going to stay on behind and spend some money .
and i hope to goodness it does n't bucket it down with rain . "
police are advising people travelling to watch the tour to use public transport where possible and check in advance for road closures at www.tfl.gov.uk.

after the prologue has taken in the sights of central london on saturday , the tour proper will head off through kent , with the first leg ending against the backdrop of canterbury cathedral on sunday .
hosting the start or end of any of the tour 's 20 stages is considered a great honour by the french , but the grand depart is considered to be the most prestigious of all .
cycling fever has taken over london 's parks this year will be the first time the race has begun in such a major city as london - strasbourg , where it began last year , being a more typical venue .
organisers of events in london are hoping to take full advantage of the opportunity to showcase the city in the run-up to the 2012 olympics .
in france , competition to host the tour is intense , with every town eager to bask in the glory of the race .
the bidding process involves much schmoozing , with hopeful mayors vying to wine and dine race officials .
in london 's case , race organiser the aso appears to have jumped at the chance to stage the depart before a backdrop of world-famous landmarks in both london and canterbury .
there was also a £ 1.5m fee paid by the london bid team - a group including transport for london , british cycling , uk sport and sport england - to the aso .
staging the event itself is costing another £ 5.3m , but london and canterbury are expected to receive a massive economic boost from tens of thousands of visitors .
spectators wait for hours to see the riders go past in a flash in total , the tour is expected to be worth £ 70m to the uk economy .
hosting the tour is a massive undertaking .
two million people are expected to line the routes of the first leg through london and kent and hundreds of road closures are planned .
in france local authorities pull out all the stops to make their visitors welcome by putting on festivities and sprucing up their towns - even those where the race will merely flash by in a few minutes can expect hundreds of visitors .
catherine payronnet , of the tourist office in gap , which hosted the start of a stage in 2006 , says the population of the town , normally 40,000 , at least doubled .
spectators get in carnival spirit , dressing up to wave on the cyclists she said : " there were people everywhere , most at the start and finish but also all along the route where the tour was to pass .
people arrived days beforehand with their caravans to get a good spot .
it was like a big party . "
hosting the tour can put even the smallest town on the map - with tv coverage reaching a potential audience of 2.5 billion in more than 80 countries , it is publicity beyond the wildest dreams of cash-strapped local authorities .
in london , organisers are gearing up to make the most of the party atmosphere with a whole string of festivals , carnivals , concerts , street parties , cycling events , markets , displays and exhibitions planned across the city .
more festivities will greet visitors in canterbury , whose 35,000 population is expected to more than double .
french villagers find a way to make sure their village gets noticed along the route , towns and villages are being decorated to welcome the race , with sections of the route lined with miles of bunting and festivities planned from barn dances and carnivals to cream teas and village fetes .
as well as their 15 minutes in the spotlight , these places are all hoping for a share of the £ 37m boost the race is expected to bring to kent .
it is all a far cry from the tour 's first trip to the uk in 1974 , when the riders were confined to a circuit of dual carriageway near plymouth .
britain was better prepared in 1994 , when it hosted two stages of the tour - from dover to brighton , then brighton to portsmouth - attracting three million spectators .
i just hope the crowds are going to stay on behind and spend some money dennis knight send us your comments however , the 1994 experience looks set to pale into significance compared with the huge crowds expected this weekend .
the picturesque weald village of goudhurst , for example , hosted just a handful of spectators in 1994 - this year it is planning for 10,000 .
virtually every pub , restaurant , shop and hall in the village will open , serving refreshments from 0800 bst on race day , with beer tents , children 's entertainment and barbecues laid on and fields converted to car parks .
dennis knight , chairman of goudhurst 's tour de france steering committee , says : " there 's no comparison at all with 1994 .
i just hope the crowds are going to stay on behind and spend some money .
and i hope to goodness it does n't bucket it down with rain . "
police are advising people travelling to watch the tour to use public transport where possible and check in advance for road closures at www.tfl.gov.uk.

welsh charity trust pa has helped to fund scientists who hope to repair the spinal cord by transferring cells from the nose to make it grow back .
if successful , the treatment could mean patients taking back control of their bodies .
the research is being carried out by the institute of neurology in london .
simon morris , from sully in the vale of glamorgan , has been learning to rebuild his life since an accident 10 years ago left him paralysed from the chest down . "
to have it all taken away in an instant - it was a lot to take in " simon morris a simple fall while on holiday in greece was enough to damage his spine .
he spent 16 months in hospital , and now depends on a wheelchair .
" i was in the navy prior to my accident so i was quite active .
i enjoyed a very good social life , " said mr morris .
" to have it all taken away in an instant - it was a lot to take in .
" increasing my mobility would be brilliant .
any little gain , any slight gain would mean a great deal for me - not just for me , but for other people with spinal injuries . "
animal models at the moment , there is no treatment for mr morris ' injuries .
but professor geoffrey raisman , from the institute of neurology , have found that cells found in the nose can be transplanted to the spinal cord to help it re-grow .
so far , tests have been on animals but professor raisman said they were now ready for trials with humans .
" we 've got to the point where in animal models - in rats - we can get these cells from the adult , " he said .
" we can transplant them into injuries of the spinal cord , of the spinal root , and the nerve fibres grow back and function returns .
" now , what we 're trying to do is to transfer this to human application , " he added .
' important things ' " the stage we 're at we already know , and others have shown , that these cells are present in humans .
" we are trying to learn how to grow them from what is actually volunteer samples and then we hope to transplant them into a group of highly-defined injuries in 10 to 12 patients . "
the research is expensive and is being helped by a small welsh charity .
trust pa was set up in memory of paul andre -lrb- pa -rrb- blundell , a rugby player from cardiff , who was paralysed after an accident on the pitch .
after his death five years ago , his parents decided to put their efforts into supporting research to repair the spinal cord .
his mother gerri blundell said : " we have the most amazing hope because the work of geoffrey raisman has 40 years of research behind it . "
" as far as paul andre was concerned , for him it was a chance that he would possibly walk again before he was 40 .
" he thought that was worth going for and i think in terms of other families , that hope is one of the most important things to give them something to live for at all . "
developing the treatment could still take years , but the fund-raising will help the research .
this has including raising money at events such as last weekend 's british speedway grand prix at the millennium stadium .

father-of-two mr mee had written books about diy and even had a column in the guardian newspaper .
but fixing a cage which a jaguar had just leapt over , or making an enclosure wolf-proof ?
that was a whole new adventure for mr mee and his family who are reopening the dartmoor wildlife park which they bought last year .
there was plenty of room for improvement when mr mee , his brother duncan and mother amelia took over the park , now renamed the dartmoor zoological park , last year .
they had bought it for £ 1.1m with money from the sale of the family home in surrey .
but it had deteriorated so badly the authorities had refused to grant another licence and they had to borrow another £ 500,000 to bring it up to standard .
suddenly the jaguar lunged at the tiger 's hindquarters , and the tiger turned and swiped the jaguar 's head , spinning him like a doll ben mee pathways , enclosures , restaurants , shops all needed upgrading .
the issue was brought home starkly four days after they moved into the house on site when a jaguar escaped from its enclosure , followed earlier this year by a wolf found wandering near the village .
he said : " at about 5.30pm i was sitting with the head keeper , robert , in the kitchen when duncan burst in , shouted , " one of the big cats is out !
this is not a drill ! " and ran off again .
the park 's jaguar , sovereign , was inside the tiger 's enclosure with its inhabitant , tammy .
" both animals were agitated , and if they began fighting one would have to be shot , " he said .
sovereign the jaguar found a way out of her enclosure " suddenly the jaguar lunged at the tiger 's hindquarters , and the tiger turned and swiped the jaguar 's head , spinning him like a doll . "
kelly , the cat keeper , then ordered all available men to go to one end of the cage .
" on command we yelled as loudly as we could .
" the tiger 's tail twitched , her ears flattened and after a couple of minutes she jumped off the rock and into her house .
" in the morning , the crisis officially ended when a ranger from another park arrived with a dart gun , and returned the comatose jaguar to his proper enclosure . "
sovereign 's cage was strengthened and improved , with old wooden posts replaced with metal posts and a four-strand electrical fence .
zoos ' increasingly important ' but the zoo again made headlines in february this year when a wolf called parker clambered over the top of its enclosure and went walkabout before being recaptured .
the old enclosures at the wildlife park had been criticised by animal rights groups who said people should boycott it .
but mr mee is adamant that all the animals are now in better conditions .
a wolves now have a bigger enclosure at the zoo and the zoo has been checked by the local council and the department of environment food and rural affairs .
the name change to zoological park reflects new concerns said mr mee , with the accent now on breeding and conservation of species .
" i wish that there were huge areas for them to roam free , " said mr mee , speaking from the new enclosure for sovereign who was in quarantine .
" but with market forces being what they are , i think many will be extinct in the wild in our lifetime .
" zoos are becoming increasingly important as a seed bank for wild animals . "
mee has been obsessed with animals since he was young , so when he heard the zoo was for sale , he jumped at the opportunity to put his knowledge into practice .
" i had written a book on awareness in animals , but i had never done any hands-on management , " he said .
" it 's been a very steep learning curve . "
there are 218 animals in the 30-acre zoo , including five tigers , three lions , three bears and seven wolves .
in the future mr mee hopes to add orang utans , gorillas and giraffes and zebras .
right now he is looking forward to re-opening the zoo on saturday .
" it is all a bit tight , but at last we shall have income coming the other way , rather than just going out , " he said .

but fixing a cage which a jaguar had just leapt over , or making an enclosure wolf-proof ?
that was a whole new adventure for mr mee and his family who are reopening the dartmoor wildlife park which they bought last year .
there was plenty of room for improvement when mr mee , his brother duncan and mother amelia took over the park , now renamed the dartmoor zoological park , last year .
they had bought it for £ 1.1m with money from the sale of the family home in surrey .
but it had deteriorated so badly the authorities had refused to grant another licence and they had to borrow another £ 500,000 to bring it up to standard .
suddenly the jaguar lunged at the tiger 's hindquarters , and the tiger turned and swiped the jaguar 's head , spinning him like a doll ben mee pathways , enclosures , restaurants , shops all needed upgrading .
the issue was brought home starkly four days after they moved into the house on site when a jaguar escaped from its enclosure , followed earlier this year by a wolf found wandering near the village .
he said : " at about 5.30pm i was sitting with the head keeper , robert , in the kitchen when duncan burst in , shouted , " one of the big cats is out !
this is not a drill ! " and ran off again .
the park 's jaguar , sovereign , was inside the tiger 's enclosure with its inhabitant , tammy .
" both animals were agitated , and if they began fighting one would have to be shot , " he said .
sovereign the jaguar found a way out of her enclosure " suddenly the jaguar lunged at the tiger 's hindquarters , and the tiger turned and swiped the jaguar 's head , spinning him like a doll . "
kelly , the cat keeper , then ordered all available men to go to one end of the cage .
" on command we yelled as loudly as we could .
" the tiger 's tail twitched , her ears flattened and after a couple of minutes she jumped off the rock and into her house .
" in the morning , the crisis officially ended when a ranger from another park arrived with a dart gun , and returned the comatose jaguar to his proper enclosure . "
sovereign 's cage was strengthened and improved , with old wooden posts replaced with metal posts and a four-strand electrical fence .
zoos ' increasingly important ' but the zoo again made headlines in february this year when a wolf called parker clambered over the top of its enclosure and went walkabout before being recaptured .
the old enclosures at the wildlife park had been criticised by animal rights groups who said people should boycott it .
but mr mee is adamant that all the animals are now in better conditions .
a wolves now have a bigger enclosure at the zoo and the zoo has been checked by the local council and the department of environment food and rural affairs .
the name change to zoological park reflects new concerns said mr mee , with the accent now on breeding and conservation of species .
" i wish that there were huge areas for them to roam free , " said mr mee , speaking from the new enclosure for sovereign who was in quarantine .
" but with market forces being what they are , i think many will be extinct in the wild in our lifetime .
" zoos are becoming increasingly important as a seed bank for wild animals . "
mee has been obsessed with animals since he was young , so when he heard the zoo was for sale , he jumped at the opportunity to put his knowledge into practice .
" i had written a book on awareness in animals , but i had never done any hands-on management , " he said .
" it 's been a very steep learning curve . "
there are 218 animals in the 30-acre zoo , including five tigers , three lions , three bears and seven wolves .
in the future mr mee hopes to add orang utans , gorillas and giraffes and zebras .
right now he is looking forward to re-opening the zoo on saturday .
" it is all a bit tight , but at last we shall have income coming the other way , rather than just going out , " he said .

more than 50 bands were due to perform at the fflam festival in swansea 's singleton park from 13-15 july .
organisers blamed wet weather and said they hoped to have a new date for the end of the summer .
but fans who have made travel plans have expressed their frustration at the short notice of the postponement .
organisers said event tickets would still be valid for the reorganised event , but refunds would also be available .
i have no faith in that announcement , because i ca n't see the weather is going to be any better in september peter wilkey anne hanson , who was due to travel from leeds , said she was " absolutely gutted " .
" i was really looking forward to it - i have been looking forward to it for months in fact , " she said .
" my husband and i ... are going to end up quite out of pocket apart from anything else - £ 68 for train tickets , plus the camping which was £ 30 .

more than 50 bands were due to perform at the fflam festival in swansea 's singleton park from 13-15 july .
organisers blamed wet weather and said they hoped to have a new date for the end of the summer .
but fans who have made travel plans have expressed their frustration at the short notice of the postponement .
organisers said event tickets would still be valid for the reorganised event , but refunds would also be available . "
i have no faith in that announcement , because i ca n't see the weather is going to be any better in september " peter wilkey anne hanson , who was due to travel from leeds , said she was " absolutely gutted " .
" i was really looking forward to it - i have been looking forward to it for months in fact , " she said .
" my husband and i ... are going to end up quite out of pocket apart from anything else - £ 68 for train tickets , plus the camping which was £ 30 .
" and we 'd both actually booked a full week off work following it because we were going to spend some time on the gower .
" to find out eight days before the event , we 're not really sure what to do now . "
and peter wilkey , from torquay , said he and his girlfriend were mainly going to the festival to watch feeder play .
" the website is saying hold on there is going to be another festival later in the year , maybe in september , " he said .
" i have no faith in that announcement , because i ca n't see the weather is going to be any better in september . "
steve balsamo , the lead singer of the storys , who had been due to play a home city show at the festival , said he hoped the festival could be rearranged .
" you may be able to get everybody together , you may be able to get some people together and then get other big bands to come and play it as well , " he said .
" it 's just really unfortunate and unfortunate for swansea and all the music fans because it was going to be a brilliant weekend . "
' dampen ' in a statement promoter , straight music , said : " due to the bad weather , we have been delayed in putting the infrastructure in place and it is a big concern that the weather conditions will hugely dampen the experience we want to give all our festival goers .
" we expect the new date to be at the end of the summer and are doing all we can do get everything reorganised as quickly and efficiently as possible so that we can confirm the date within the week . "
they said full refunds would be available from point of purchase but that they would like to reassure everyone that the festival would take place .
placebo , the levellers and enter shikari were also confirmed to play at fflam - the welsh word for flame .

by fiona pryor entertainment reporter , bbc news he is sleeping four hours at most each night and says he is stressed out .
but promoter harvey goldsmith is used to working under pressure .
the 61-year-old , one of the uk 's most well-known music promoters , has been instrumental in organising high-profile concerts such as 1985 's live aid and 2005 's live 8 .
he is now co-coordinating eight live earth gigs , which will take place on saturday in new york , london , sydney , rio de janeiro , johannesburg , tokyo , shanghai and hamburg .
slick and trouble-free " live earth is an initiative to get people all over the world to focus their attention on our future and the climate , " mr goldsmith says .
" if we do n't do something about the future now , we wo n't have a future . "
with acts such as madonna , lenny kravitz and the red hot chili peppers due to perform to a worldwide audience , the pressure is on to deliver a slick and trouble-free series of shows .
so where does mr goldsmith start when it comes to organising such a huge global event ?
" for me it 's just having the right teams of people who understand what they 're doing and can listen in a short space of time and get the job done , " he says .
" you 've got to secure the right venues , get the right permit , start to generate artists for each of the shows , think about ticket selling , decide what the message is all about , why are we doing the shows ?
" then there are 60 films that are being produced so we have got to make sure that each of them are translated into every local language , " he explains .
time zones despite this being a global event - with the workload multiplied by eight - time zones and language barriers have faded into the background . "
once they agree to do it they do it in the spirit that it 's meant and i do n't think i 've ever had a problem with an artist " harvey goldsmith " they do n't go to bed like me , " he laughs .
" you start with sydney and you end up with america .
you go round the clock .
" in your mind you 've got this 24-hour clock and because i 've got so much experience of understanding that clock you mentally know what time it is in each country . "
asked what could go wrong , mr goldsmith reels off another long list .
" satellite feeds can go down , changeovers are done in a rush , the sound breaking because someone has pulled a wire out by accident in a rush , and also sticking to timings , " he says .
surprisingly the only part of the gig he says that can be relied upon is the artists themselves .
artist co-operation " once they agree to do it , they do it in the spirit that it 's meant .
i do n't think i 've ever had a problem with an artist , " says mr goldsmith , who has worked with everybody from the rolling stones to madonna .
" once they agree to do it and they understand fully why they 're doing it they always co-operate and they always do their very best to make it work . "
with an overnight bag packed and his passport at the ready mr goldsmith is ready to fly to any venue if any last-minute problem arises .
but he is happier in his london office .
" it 's better to be in one place that 's central because as with live 8 i 'm in touch with everybody every 15 minutes , " he says .
and with security measures making travel from uk airports difficult this week , he says going anywhere would be " a kiss of a death " for him .
with the clock ticking to the start of live earth , mr goldsmith is looking forward to seeking refuge and catching up on some well-earned sleep .
but he does not expect that to be until sunday morning , once the final notes have been played in new york and rio de janeiro .

by fiona pryor entertainment reporter , bbc news goldsmith says he only gets a few hours a night at the moment he is sleeping four hours at most each night and says he is stressed out .
but promoter harvey goldsmith is used to working under pressure .
the 61-year-old , one of the uk 's most well-known music promoters , has been instrumental in organising high-profile concerts such as 1985 's live aid and 2005 's live 8 .
he is now co-coordinating eight live earth gigs , which will take place on saturday in new york , london , sydney , rio de janeiro , johannesburg , tokyo , shanghai and hamburg .
slick and trouble-free " live earth is an initiative to get people all over the world to focus their attention on our future and the climate , " mr goldsmith says .
" if we do n't do something about the future now , we wo n't have a future . "
with acts such as madonna , lenny kravitz and the red hot chili peppers due to perform to a worldwide audience , the pressure is on to deliver a slick and trouble-free series of shows .
goldsmith helped promote live aid in 1985 with bob geldof so where does mr goldsmith start when it comes to organising such a huge global event ?
" for me it 's just having the right teams of people who understand what they 're doing and can listen in a short space of time and get the job done , " he says .
" you 've got to secure the right venues , get the right permit , start to generate artists for each of the shows , think about ticket selling , decide what the message is all about , why are we doing the shows ?
" then there are 60 films that are being produced so we have got to make sure that each of them are translated into every local language , " he explains .
time zones despite this being a global event - with the workload multiplied by eight - time zones and language barriers have faded into the background .
once they agree to do it they do it in the spirit that it 's meant and i do n't think i 've ever had a problem with an artist harvey goldsmith " they do n't go to bed like me , " he laughs .
" you start with sydney and you end up with america .
you go round the clock .
" in your mind you 've got this 24-hour clock and because i 've got so much experience of understanding that clock you mentally know what time it is in each country . "
asked what could go wrong , mr goldsmith reels off another long list .
" satellite feeds can go down , changeovers are done in a rush , the sound breaking because someone has pulled a wire out by accident in a rush , and also sticking to timings , " he says .
surprisingly the only part of the gig he says that can be relied upon is the artists themselves .
artist co-operation " once they agree to do it , they do it in the spirit that it 's meant .
i do n't think i 've ever had a problem with an artist , " says mr goldsmith , who has worked with everybody from the rolling stones to madonna .
madonna will headline the london leg of live earth " once they agree to do it and they understand fully why they 're doing it they always co-operate and they always do their very best to make it work . "
with an overnight bag packed and his passport at the ready mr goldsmith is ready to fly to any venue if any last-minute problem arises .
but he is happier in his london office .
" it 's better to be in one place that 's central because as with live 8 i 'm in touch with everybody every 15 minutes , " he says .

the concert at london 's wembley stadium is expected to be one of the focal points , attracting some of the world 's musical superstars including madonna .
bbc correspondents from other cities putting on shows report on what is expected from the gigs , giving a taste of how each event aims to raise environmental awareness .
tokyo - chris hogg tokyo 's live earth show will be headlined by the us nu-metal band linkin park , who have already pledged to plant a tree for each person who attends their gigs on their upcoming tour .
linkin park will headline the tokyo leg of live earth there will be two concerts in japan , one at the makuhari messe , a cavernous venue on the outskirts of tokyo , the other at the toji temple in kyoto - the city that gave its name to the agreement to try to reduce global greenhouse gases .
a japanese act , the yellow magic orchestra is headlining there .
also on the bill at the tokyo gig is rihanna , currently riding high in the british charts .
japanese acts include kumi koda , ai otsuka , rize and ayaka .
to try to reduce the environmental impact of the gig the organisers say people will be asked to separate their rubbish into nine different categories to maximise the potential for recycling while trees will be planted to offset the carbon impact of the event .
hamburg - steve rosenberg hamburg has been trying hard to promote its live earth event .
in the run up to the big day , cinemas have been offering free tickets to al gore 's documentary about climate change - an inconvenient truth - and local nightclubs have donated some of their takings to live earth .
but ticket sales for the concert itself have been disappointing , resulting in a last-minute push to make sure the concert venue - hamburg 's football stadium - will be full on saturday .
topping the bill are shakira , enrique iglesias and yusuf islam , formerly known as cat stevens .
sydney - nick bryant live earth bursts into life in a country whose government has not only stubbornly refused to sign the kyoto protocol , but which has been openly critical of al gore 's attempts to highlight the issue of global warming .
film actress toni collette will appear in her guise as a musician so the performers at aussie stadium in sydney will be directing their message at the government in canberra as much as the rest of the world .
they include crowded house , jack johnson , wolfmother , john butler trio , missy higgins , eskimo joe , sneaky sound system , paul kelly , ghostwriters , film star toni collette and her band the finish .
also look out for singer-turned-politician peter garrett , the former lead singer of midnight oil , who is now the opposition labor party 's high-profile environment spokesman .
johannesburg - peter biles live earth sa may be part of a global series of concerts , but the johannesburg event has generated little publicity so far .
nonetheless , there is a top-class line-up of internationally-known artists performing here on saturday , including joss stone , ub40 , angelique kidjo , vusi mahlasela and the soweto gospel choir .
benin singer angelique kijdo will bring an african flavour to the event the event was to have been staged at the cradle of humankind , a world heritage site , but for logistical reasons , it has been moved to a stadium closer to johannesburg .
the organisers say this will mean a larger audience and reduce the carbon output created by getting there .
but the south african government still has a long way to go in raising public awareness of climate change and global warming .
rio de janeiro - gary duffy there can be few more spectacular venues in the world for an outdoor concert than the famed copacabana beach in rio de janeiro .
in february 2006 the rolling stones held a gig here that attracted more than a million people .
the stage was the height of a seven-storey building .
more than a million people saw the stones at copacabana beach so no pressure on live earth , then .
brazil is the only country hosting a concert in this worldwide event entirely for free , and the organisers are hoping for a big turnout .
and of course as home to the amazon , one of the greatest ecosystems and forests on the planet , brazil 's place in the climate change debate , and in live earth , is undoubtedly central .
the event is supported by a wide range of brazilian environmental organisations , including groups set up to defend the amazon and to oppose deforestation .
headline acts will include pharrell williams , lenny kravitz and macy gray .
a brazilian flavour to the party will be given by among others , the eclectic combination of children 's television star xuxa , and rio-born singer jorge ben jor , whose first single mas que nada was recently covered by the black eye peas with sergio mendes .
the song became a massive hit after it was used in a tv advertising campaign during the 2006 world cup .
so if it does all goes to plan , it should be quite a beach party .
shanghai - daniel griffiths live earth is coming to shanghai - but so far china 's most glitzy , glamorous city is not getting terribly excited .
there 's been little publicity and many locals are complaining that the ticket prices are too high .
the line up is largely made up of chinese acts - hong kong legend eason chan is the biggest name .
but he 's the only one with real superstar status .
the lack of interest here will be a disappointment for the organisers .
thanks to its booming economy , china is one of the world 's largest emitters of greenhouse gases .
to tackle climate change the world needs countries like china on board .
but interest in green issues is still a low priority for most people here .
a good job , home and car are what matters to many .
and concerts like this one are n't going to change that mindset .
new jersey - james coomarasamy it 's only a couple of days before the event , but i do n't have a sense that there 's much of a buzz about it here in the states .
not yet , at least .
if there 's been an advertising blitz , i have n't noticed one - tickets are still available and most people you ask do n't seem aware of the concert .
that will probably change now that al gore - the man who inspired it all - is doing the interview circuit .
he has undoubtedly done much to raise the profile of climate change issues in the us , but you do have to wonder how the crowds will compare with 2005 's free live 8 concert , given ticket prices of $ 55 .
still - the new jersey -lrb- not new york - the jersey-ites are n't too happy that the distinction is n't being made -rrb- line-up - featuring the reformed police and smashing pumpkins , seems a bit of an improvement on the philadelphia concert of two years ago .

the concert at london 's wembley stadium is expected to be one of the focal points , attracting some of the world 's musical superstars including madonna .
bbc correspondents from other cities putting on shows report on what is expected from the gigs , giving a taste of how each event aims to raise environmental awareness .
tokyo - chris hogg tokyo 's live earth show will be headlined by the us nu-metal band linkin park , who have already pledged to plant a tree for each person who attends their gigs on their upcoming tour .
linkin park will headline the tokyo leg of live earth there will be two concerts in japan , one at the makuhari messe , a cavernous venue on the outskirts of tokyo , the other at the toji temple in kyoto - the city that gave its name to the agreement to try to reduce global greenhouse gases .
a japanese act , the yellow magic orchestra is headlining there .
also on the bill at the tokyo gig is rihanna , currently riding high in the british charts .
japanese acts include kumi koda , ai otsuka , rize and ayaka .
to try to reduce the environmental impact of the gig the organisers say people will be asked to separate their rubbish into nine different categories to maximise the potential for recycling while trees will be planted to offset the carbon impact of the event .
hamburg - steve rosenberg hamburg has been trying hard to promote its live earth event .
in the run up to the big day , cinemas have been offering free tickets to al gore 's documentary about climate change - an inconvenient truth - and local nightclubs have donated some of their takings to live earth .
but ticket sales for the concert itself have been disappointing , resulting in a last-minute push to make sure the concert venue - hamburg 's football stadium - will be full on saturday .
topping the bill are shakira , enrique iglesias and yusuf islam , formerly known as cat stevens .
sydney - nick bryant live earth bursts into life in a country whose government has not only stubbornly refused to sign the kyoto protocol , but which has been openly critical of al gore 's attempts to highlight the issue of global warming .
film actress toni collette will appear in her guise as a musician so the performers at aussie stadium in sydney will be directing their message at the government in canberra as much as the rest of the world .
they include crowded house , jack johnson , wolfmother , john butler trio , missy higgins , eskimo joe , sneaky sound system , paul kelly , ghostwriters , film star toni collette and her band the finish .
also look out for singer-turned-politician peter garrett , the former lead singer of midnight oil , who is now the opposition labor party 's high-profile environment spokesman .
johannesburg - peter biles live earth sa may be part of a global series of concerts , but the johannesburg event has generated little publicity so far .
nonetheless , there is a top-class line-up of internationally-known artists performing here on saturday , including joss stone , ub40 , angelique kidjo , vusi mahlasela and the soweto gospel choir .
benin singer angelique kijdo will bring an african flavour to the event the event was to have been staged at the cradle of humankind , a world heritage site , but for logistical reasons , it has been moved to a stadium closer to johannesburg .
the organisers say this will mean a larger audience and reduce the carbon output created by getting there .
but the south african government still has a long way to go in raising public awareness of climate change and global warming .
rio de janeiro - gary duffy there can be few more spectacular venues in the world for an outdoor concert than the famed copacabana beach in rio de janeiro .
in february 2006 the rolling stones held a gig here that attracted more than a million people .
the stage was the height of a seven-storey building .
more than a million people saw the stones at copacabana beach so no pressure on live earth , then .
brazil is the only country hosting a concert in this worldwide event entirely for free , and the organisers are hoping for a big turnout .
and of course as home to the amazon , one of the greatest ecosystems and forests on the planet , brazil 's place in the climate change debate , and in live earth , is undoubtedly central .
the event is supported by a wide range of brazilian environmental organisations , including groups set up to defend the amazon and to oppose deforestation .
headline acts will include pharrell williams , lenny kravitz and macy gray .
a brazilian flavour to the party will be given by among others , the eclectic combination of children 's television star xuxa , and rio-born singer jorge ben jor , whose first single mas que nada was recently covered by the black eye peas with sergio mendes .
the song became a massive hit after it was used in a tv advertising campaign during the 2006 world cup .
so if it does all goes to plan , it should be quite a beach party .
shanghai - daniel griffiths live earth is coming to shanghai - but so far china 's most glitzy , glamorous city is not getting terribly excited .
there 's been little publicity and many locals are complaining that the ticket prices are too high .
the line up is largely made up of chinese acts - hong kong legend eason chan is the biggest name .
but he 's the only one with real superstar status .
the lack of interest here will be a disappointment for the organisers .
thanks to its booming economy , china is one of the world 's largest emitters of greenhouse gases .
to tackle climate change the world needs countries like china on board .
but interest in green issues is still a low priority for most people here .
a good job , home and car are what matters to many .
and concerts like this one are n't going to change that mindset .
new jersey - james coomarasamy it 's only a couple of days before the event , but i do n't have a sense that there 's much of a buzz about it here in the states .
not yet , at least .
if there 's been an advertising blitz , i have n't noticed one - tickets are still available and most people you ask do n't seem aware of the concert .
that will probably change now that al gore - the man who inspired it all - is doing the interview circuit .
he has undoubtedly done much to raise the profile of climate change issues in the us , but you do have to wonder how the crowds will compare with 2005 's free live 8 concert , given ticket prices of $ 55 .
still - the new jersey -lrb- not new york - the jersey-ites are n't too happy that the distinction is n't being made -rrb- line-up - featuring the reformed police and smashing pumpkins , seems a bit of an improvement on the philadelphia concert of two years ago .

songwriters tommy dunbar and james gangwer allege lavigne 's girlfriend was lifted from their 1979 song i wanna be your boyfriend .
lavigne 's spokeswoman declined to comment about the allegations .
in a statement , dunbar said : " we are not so naive as to chalk it up to some sort of cosmic coincidence . "
he added : " the lyric , the metre , the rhythm - they 're identical . "
the case will be heard in oakland , california , on 28 august .
new wave group the rubinoos toured and recorded from 1975 to 1983 and had a hit with a cover version of tommy james and the shondells ' i think we 're alone now .
they also wrote the theme song for the movie revenge of the nerds .
lavigne , best known for hits such as complicated and sk8er boi , recently scooped the award for favourite canadian artist at the muchmusic video awards in toronto .
