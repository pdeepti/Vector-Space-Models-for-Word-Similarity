" we take this development very seriously , " eu commission spokesman martin selmayr told reporters wednesday .
minsk and moscow should resolve their dispute without delay and create conditions for the timely resumption of deliveries , he said .
if needed the commission could convene a meeting of a european union " gas coordination group " to study implications the row could have on energy supplies to the 27-nation bloc , selmayr said .
subsidized prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin -lrb- right -rrb- and belarus leader alexander lukashenko have been drifting apart about one fifth of russian gas exports to europe transit belarus , but western customers had been told about the planned reduction of supplies , according to gazprom .
gazprom has accused the belarus gas company beltransgas of having paid for about half of its imports of russian natural gas in the first half of 2007 .
russia and belarus previously clashed over energy supplies at the beginning of 2007 .
while a complete stoppage of gas supplies to belarus was avoided , russia reduced its supplies of oil for several days - a decision that also affected the transit pipeline into the eu .
" gazprom will take all possible measures for the transportation of russian gas through the territory of belarus in full accordance with current obligations to european customers , " the company said in a statement , adding it would pursue legal action against belarus if it siphoned gas out of transit pipelines . alexander burgansky , an analyst at renaissance capital , said belarus was unlikely to start taking gas from transit pipelines . " consumption is seasonally low , and underground storage facilities are full everywhere , " he told reuters .
the cause of the current conflict is moscow 's attempt to raise step by step the strongly subsidized energy prices for belarus to an international level .
estonians against sea pipeline bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many estonians do n't want the pipeline off their shores plans for an alternative gas delivery route from russia to western europe were also dealt a blow on wednesday after an academic report called on the estonian government to not allow a consortium behind a controversial gas pipeline to construct it in estonian waters .
a possible russian military presence and potential harm to the environment should force the government to deny a request from the nord stream consortium to conduct an environmental study in estonian waters , daily postimees reported quoting the study by the country 's academy of sciences .
" neutral states like finland and sweden can allow the presence of the russian armed forces and gazprom armed operatives in their economic zones or territorial waters , but as nato members estonia and poland can not allow that , " the report said .
in april , nord stream asked estonian authorities to measure the depth of the baltic sea in estonian waters to determine if it was possible to shift the pipeline south of the finnish coast .
the authorities turned to scientists for an opinion .
bitter dispute gazprom has stressed its 2005 agreement with german firms eon and basf to lay a 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 745-mile -rrb- gas pipeline , known as nord stream , across the baltic sea from russia to germany , saying it would boost europe 's energy security and cut out the potential for political conflict with transit countries .
former german chancellor gerhard schröder is the chairman of nord stream 's shareholders ' committee .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since in was first proposed in 2005 .
many of the states bordering the baltic have argued that it could disturb stores of chemical weapons dumped in the sea after world war ii .
so far more than 20,000 people , mostly from the baltic states , have signed a petition to stop the construction of the pipeline .
if completed , the pipeline would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the list includes a dozen early renaissance portraits and biblical scenes by lucas cranach the elder , best known for his oil renditions of martin luther , as well as an oil-on-canvas rubens portrait from the 1600s of the archbishop antonio trieste of ghent . the agency , which is a division of the finance ministry and has branches throughout germany , was established last year to handle claims not only for looted art , antique furniture and other cultural artifacts , but also the restitution of real estate and property seized by the nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biblical themes are common in works by lucas cranach the elder according to the badv 's harald könig , the body of case-law dealing with restitution issues and compensation for assets confiscated by the nazis is still growing more than 60 years after the end of the war . although most legal claims were settled in the post-war years in the former west germany , the origins of much of the art unearthed in the eastern states after the reunification in 1990 , has only recently begun being documented and returned to the original owners . mostly oil paintings on list of looted art so far the provenance of 36 objects out of nearly 600 that have been thoroughly documented have been or are in the process of being returned to holocaust survivors or their descendents , said könig . returning the art to its proper owners is nearly always a long legal process that can take years , or even decades , for owners to prove the art belongs to them . the looted listed on the badv 's web page consists mainly of oil paintings , but also italian , english and german antiques replete with detailed descriptions , historical references and a black and white photo .
most of the art has been loaned out to museums throughout germany , including several works that had been originally intended for hitler 's museum in linz , austria . the nazis looted about 650,000 artworks in all according to estimates by the jewish claims conference , of which only a fraction have been returned in spite of highly publicized restitution efforts since the mid-1990s .
one of the main reasons for the meager returns was the difficulty involved in adequately documenting the provenance of art assets . list needs to be in english for target audience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : descendents of holocaust survivors no longer speak german " it 's marvelous that such information is now being posted by the badv , " said anne webber , who is co-chair of the non-profit london-based commission for looted art in europe , though she added that the comprehensive list compiled by the agency would benefit from being translated into english . only last month , the national fund of the republic of austria for victims of national socialism , which published its comprehensive database of stolen nazi art in german last december , provided an english page as well . " such sites need to be accessible to their target audiences worldwide , " webber said .
" the rightful owners are not likely to live in german speaking countries , nor speak german anymore . " although parts of badv 's web page are available in english , the detailed list of paintings and artworks are not .

in germany , the regional states decide where to light up , resulting in patchwork laws .
now three states have taken the no-smoking initiative . most of germany 's 16 regional states plan to implement smoking bans by january next year , but anti-smoking laws already went into effect in three states on aug .
1 . starting in september , smoking will also be banned in federal buildings and on all modes of public transport as well as taxis , trains and airports . in baden-württemberg , lower saxony and mecklenburg-west pomerania , smoking is now prohibited in all local government buildings , hospitals , schools and other institutions for children and youth . in the first two states , where hanover , heidelberg and stuttgart are located , smoking will still be permitted in restaurants and bars , but only in designated areas , whereas in the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , the anti-smoking laws will take effect in gastronomical establishments starting jan .
1 . the states of hesse , rhineland-palatinate and saxony - where frankfurt , mainz and dresden are located - want to enforce anti-smoking rules before the end of the year . patchwork laws in different states restaurant and bar owners in lower saxony , who are responsible for enforcing the ban , will be subject to checks by the local police as of november , so even though the rule takes effect now , there will be no penalties for violating the law until then .

critics of the patchwork laws in the various states say that unlike other european countries , such as france , italy and britain , the lack of a comprehensive ban throughout germany , sends the wrong signal .
although berlin has tried to introduce anti-smoking laws nationwide , it could only enforce the rules in federal buildings , since germany 's constitution gives its states considerable latitude in such matters .
in march , the federal government agreed on a framework with the 16 states on anti-smoking rules in public buildings , but each state would have to ratify its own laws .

" health protection should not be age-related , " said binding , who campaigned for a comprehensive ban in the german parliament last year . others applauded the state initiatives .

some 200,000 people have lost their lives and more than 2 million became refugees as a result of the genocide that 's been taking place in the crisis region of darfur in western sudan .
countless attempts were needed in the un security council to - finally - adopt a resolution that 's been described as " historic " by un secretary-general ban ki-moon .
a peacekeeping force of 26,000 soldiers is now meant to put an end to the darfur genocide .
it 's a mission that completely overwhelms the underfinanced and badly equipped african union troops that are currently stationed there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie duckstein but despite the " historic " praise by the highest body of world diplomacy , the resolution can only be called a timid attempt as it is a compromise .
it 's an agreement with concessions that all 15 members of the un security council managed to unanimously agree on .
britain and france cleared the way for a watered-down draft that no longer talks about continuing attacks of sudanese government troops and janjaweed militia .
it 's also a compromise because the peacekeeping forces will not be able to confiscate illegal weapons .
the existing arms embargo against sudan is weak and is circumvented by countries such as china and russia .
the resolution also stops short of far-reaching sanctions against the african state .
security council veto power china had opposed the enforcement of sanctions .
the chinese government called them " unfair and untimely " and had repeatedly prevented a resolution by abstaining from the vote .
again and again , human rights organizations have presented evidence of genocide and the sudanese government 's responsibility - without success .
while the tragedy continues in its fourth year in darfur , the timid implementation of a un peacekeeping mission is hard to understand .
more than 50 previous declarations were necessary that expressed " collective concerns , " " continuing grave concerns , " or " great fear . "
this was cynical diplomatic terminology while women , children and elderly were dying in misery at the same time .
even sudan 's un ambassador , abdalmahmood abdalhaleem mohamad , seems happy with the agreement that has been reached .
last week , the country 's president , omar al-bashir , had shrugged off the genocide as propaganda by western media after visiting the crisis region for three days .
al-bashir so far has prevented every attempt to station a hybrid force of un and african union soldiers - despite showing signs of cooperation from time to time .
that 's why the un resolution has to be seen as nothing more than a signal of western diplomacy for the time being .
it does not represent an end to genocide .
people are still killed on a daily basis , thousands fell from the crisis region to neighboring chad and the central african republic and still are not protected from attacks by the janjaweed militia .
experts think that it will take a year until the biggest un mission ever is ready .
fearfully it 's a year during which masses of people will continue to die .

" we take this development very seriously , " eu commission spokesman martin selmayr told reporters wednesday .
minsk and moscow should resolve their dispute without delay and create conditions for the timely resumption of deliveries , he said .
if needed the commission could convene a meeting of a european union " gas coordination group " to study implications the row could have on energy supplies to the 27-nation bloc , selmayr said .
subsidized prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin -lrb- right -rrb- and belarus leader alexander lukashenko have been drifting apart about one fifth of russian gas exports to europe transit belarus , but western customers had been told about the planned reduction of supplies , according to gazprom .
gazprom has accused the belarus gas company beltransgas of having paid for about half of its imports of russian natural gas in the first half of 2007 .
russia and belarus previously clashed over energy supplies at the beginning of 2007 .
while a complete stoppage of gas supplies to belarus was avoided , russia reduced its supplies of oil for several days - a decision that also affected the transit pipeline into the eu .
" gazprom will take all possible measures for the transportation of russian gas through the territory of belarus in full accordance with current obligations to european customers , " the company said in a statement , adding it would pursue legal action against belarus if it siphoned gas out of transit pipelines . alexander burgansky , an analyst at renaissance capital , said belarus was unlikely to start taking gas from transit pipelines . " consumption is seasonally low , and underground storage facilities are full everywhere , " he told reuters .
the cause of the current conflict is moscow 's attempt to raise step by step the strongly subsidized energy prices for belarus to an international level .
estonians against sea pipeline bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many estonians do n't want the pipeline off their shores plans for an alternative gas delivery route from russia to western europe were also dealt a blow on wednesday after an academic report called on the estonian government to not allow a consortium behind a controversial gas pipeline to construct it in estonian waters .
a possible russian military presence and potential harm to the environment should force the government to deny a request from the nord stream consortium to conduct an environmental study in estonian waters , daily postimees reported quoting the study by the country 's academy of sciences .
" neutral states like finland and sweden can allow the presence of the russian armed forces and gazprom armed operatives in their economic zones or territorial waters , but as nato members estonia and poland can not allow that , " the report said .
in april , nord stream asked estonian authorities to measure the depth of the baltic sea in estonian waters to determine if it was possible to shift the pipeline south of the finnish coast .
the authorities turned to scientists for an opinion .
bitter dispute gazprom has stressed its 2005 agreement with german firms eon and basf to lay a 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 745-mile -rrb- gas pipeline , known as nord stream , across the baltic sea from russia to germany , saying it would boost europe 's energy security and cut out the potential for political conflict with transit countries .
former german chancellor gerhard schröder is the chairman of nord stream 's shareholders ' committee .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since in was first proposed in 2005 .
many of the states bordering the baltic have argued that it could disturb stores of chemical weapons dumped in the sea after world war ii .
so far more than 20,000 people , mostly from the baltic states , have signed a petition to stop the construction of the pipeline .
if completed , the pipeline would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 01.08.2007 germany 's bundesbank faces midlife crisis großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reacting to criticism , the bundesbank is planning to trim its staff since the euro made its debut in 2002 , the bundesbank - germany 's venerable central bank - has been slowly sinking into insignificance .
is it time to send the 50-year-old financial institution into retirement ? for decades , germany 's central bank was a national icon that stood as guarantor for a strong currency and the country 's postwar economic miracle .
with the advent of the euro , however , it started sinking into insignificance .
" not all germans believe in god , but they all believe in the bundesbank , " said european union head jacques delors back in 1992 .
things changed a decade later with the introduction of the common european currency .
at that time , the bundesbank lost its prime function of setting interest rates to the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- .
an important role ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deutsche mark was replaced by the euro in jan .
2002 and even though cost-cutting and job losses overshadow the 50th anniversary of bundesbank on aug .
1 , the bank 's president , axel weber , believes it has an important role to play in deciding the course of european monetary policy .
" we need a strong bundesbank as an integral part of the euro system , " he said .
weber represents europe 's biggest economy in the ecb 's 19-member rate-setting council , where germany has the same clout as much smaller nations like slovenia or luxembourg .
but what does it do ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesbank was one of the most respected german institutions the bundesbank 's main functions today are lending money to trading banks , making sure there is enough cash to fuel the economy , overseeing banking operations and advising the federal government .
but some experts , like professor dirk schiereck of the european business school in oestrich-winkel , believe there is no need for a central bank any more .
" as an institution , it has outlived its usefulness , " schiereck said .
" in 50 years ' time , there wo n't be a bundesbank any more . "
since handing the baton to the ecb , the central bank has been searching for a new role , something which is proving difficult in the 13-storey concrete tower where it has its headquarters in frankfurt .
a more slender profile bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesbank 's big brother , the european central bank , is also located in frankfurt the bank reacted to criticism that it is bloated by announcing plans to cut the number of branches from 127 to 47 by 2012 and trim staff from 10,970 at present to 9,000 over the same period .
the future , however , wo n't be anywhere near as illustrious as the past when the bank underscored its independence in clashes with various chancellors and finance ministers over monetary policy .
" with an unprecedented policy of stability , the central bank made the deutsche mark one of the world 's most stable currencies , " said udo steffens , a professor at the frankfurt school of finance and management .
the biggest ever cash transfer the bundesbank thus became a model for the ecb , which is also headquartered in frankfurt .

" we take this development very seriously , " eu commission spokesman martin selmayr told reporters wednesday .
minsk and moscow should resolve their dispute without delay and create conditions for the timely resumption of deliveries , he said .
if needed the commission could convene a meeting of a european union " gas coordination group " to study implications the row could have on energy supplies to the 27-nation bloc , selmayr said .
subsidized prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin -lrb- right -rrb- and belarus leader alexander lukashenko have been drifting apart about one fifth of russian gas exports to europe transit belarus , but western customers had been told about the planned reduction of supplies , according to gazprom .
gazprom has accused the belarus gas company beltransgas of having paid for about half of its imports of russian natural gas in the first half of 2007 .
russia and belarus previously clashed over energy supplies at the beginning of 2007 .
while a complete stoppage of gas supplies to belarus was avoided , russia reduced its supplies of oil for several days - a decision that also affected the transit pipeline into the eu .
" gazprom will take all possible measures for the transportation of russian gas through the territory of belarus in full accordance with current obligations to european customers , " the company said in a statement , adding it would pursue legal action against belarus if it siphoned gas out of transit pipelines . alexander burgansky , an analyst at renaissance capital , said belarus was unlikely to start taking gas from transit pipelines . " consumption is seasonally low , and underground storage facilities are full everywhere , " he told reuters .
the cause of the current conflict is moscow 's attempt to raise step by step the strongly subsidized energy prices for belarus to an international level .
estonians against sea pipeline bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many estonians do n't want the pipeline off their shores plans for an alternative gas delivery route from russia to western europe were also dealt a blow on wednesday after an academic report called on the estonian government to not allow a consortium behind a controversial gas pipeline to construct it in estonian waters .
a possible russian military presence and potential harm to the environment should force the government to deny a request from the nord stream consortium to conduct an environmental study in estonian waters , daily postimees reported quoting the study by the country 's academy of sciences .
" neutral states like finland and sweden can allow the presence of the russian armed forces and gazprom armed operatives in their economic zones or territorial waters , but as nato members estonia and poland can not allow that , " the report said .
in april , nord stream asked estonian authorities to measure the depth of the baltic sea in estonian waters to determine if it was possible to shift the pipeline south of the finnish coast .
the authorities turned to scientists for an opinion .
bitter dispute gazprom has stressed its 2005 agreement with german firms eon and basf to lay a 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 745-mile -rrb- gas pipeline , known as nord stream , across the baltic sea from russia to germany , saying it would boost europe 's energy security and cut out the potential for political conflict with transit countries .
former german chancellor gerhard schröder is the chairman of nord stream 's shareholders ' committee .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since in was first proposed in 2005 .
many of the states bordering the baltic have argued that it could disturb stores of chemical weapons dumped in the sea after world war ii .
so far more than 20,000 people , mostly from the baltic states , have signed a petition to stop the construction of the pipeline .
if completed , the pipeline would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de peacekeeping -pipe- 01.08.2007 opinion : un peace mission in sudan - a timid compromise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un officials may hail the sudan peacekeeping mission as " historic , " but the watered-down resolution adopted by the security council wo n't stop the genocide for at least another year , says dw 's stefanie duckstein . the indecision , the pondering and the struggle to reach an agreement has been costly .
some 200,000 people have lost their lives and more than 2 million became refugees as a result of the genocide that 's been taking place in the crisis region of darfur in western sudan .
countless attempts were needed in the un security council to - finally - adopt a resolution that 's been described as " historic " by un secretary-general ban ki-moon .
a peacekeeping force of 26,000 soldiers is now meant to put an end to the darfur genocide .
it 's a mission that completely overwhelms the underfinanced and badly equipped african union troops that are currently stationed there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie duckstein but despite the " historic " praise by the highest body of world diplomacy , the resolution can only be called a timid attempt as it is a compromise .
it 's an agreement with concessions that all 15 members of the un security council managed to unanimously agree on .
britain and france cleared the way for a watered-down draft that no longer talks about continuing attacks of sudanese government troops and janjaweed militia .
it 's also a compromise because the peacekeeping forces will not be able to confiscate illegal weapons .
the existing arms embargo against sudan is weak and is circumvented by countries such as china and russia .
the resolution also stops short of far-reaching sanctions against the african state .
security council veto power china had opposed the enforcement of sanctions .
the chinese government called them " unfair and untimely " and had repeatedly prevented a resolution by abstaining from the vote .
again and again , human rights organizations have presented evidence of genocide and the sudanese government 's responsibility - without success .
while the tragedy continues in its fourth year in darfur , the timid implementation of a un peacekeeping mission is hard to understand .
more than 50 previous declarations were necessary that expressed " collective concerns , " " continuing grave concerns , " or " great fear . "
this was cynical diplomatic terminology while women , children and elderly were dying in misery at the same time .
even sudan 's un ambassador , abdalmahmood abdalhaleem mohamad , seems happy with the agreement that has been reached .
last week , the country 's president , omar al-bashir , had shrugged off the genocide as propaganda by western media after visiting the crisis region for three days .
al-bashir so far has prevented every attempt to station a hybrid force of un and african union soldiers - despite showing signs of cooperation from time to time .
that 's why the un resolution has to be seen as nothing more than a signal of western diplomacy for the time being .
it does not represent an end to genocide .
people are still killed on a daily basis , thousands fell from the crisis region to neighboring chad and the central african republic and still are not protected from attacks by the janjaweed militia .
experts think that it will take a year until the biggest un mission ever is ready .
fearfully it 's a year during which masses of people will continue to die .

" we take this development very seriously , " eu commission spokesman martin selmayr told reporters wednesday .
minsk and moscow should resolve their dispute without delay and create conditions for the timely resumption of deliveries , he said .
if needed the commission could convene a meeting of a european union " gas coordination group " to study implications the row could have on energy supplies to the 27-nation bloc , selmayr said .
subsidized prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin -lrb- right -rrb- and belarus leader alexander lukashenko have been drifting apart about one fifth of russian gas exports to europe transit belarus , but western customers had been told about the planned reduction of supplies , according to gazprom .
gazprom has accused the belarus gas company beltransgas of having paid for about half of its imports of russian natural gas in the first half of 2007 .
russia and belarus previously clashed over energy supplies at the beginning of 2007 .
while a complete stoppage of gas supplies to belarus was avoided , russia reduced its supplies of oil for several days - a decision that also affected the transit pipeline into the eu .
" gazprom will take all possible measures for the transportation of russian gas through the territory of belarus in full accordance with current obligations to european customers , " the company said in a statement , adding it would pursue legal action against belarus if it siphoned gas out of transit pipelines . alexander burgansky , an analyst at renaissance capital , said belarus was unlikely to start taking gas from transit pipelines . " consumption is seasonally low , and underground storage facilities are full everywhere , " he told reuters .
the cause of the current conflict is moscow 's attempt to raise step by step the strongly subsidized energy prices for belarus to an international level .
estonians against sea pipeline bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many estonians do n't want the pipeline off their shores plans for an alternative gas delivery route from russia to western europe were also dealt a blow on wednesday after an academic report called on the estonian government to not allow a consortium behind a controversial gas pipeline to construct it in estonian waters .
a possible russian military presence and potential harm to the environment should force the government to deny a request from the nord stream consortium to conduct an environmental study in estonian waters , daily postimees reported quoting the study by the country 's academy of sciences .
" neutral states like finland and sweden can allow the presence of the russian armed forces and gazprom armed operatives in their economic zones or territorial waters , but as nato members estonia and poland can not allow that , " the report said .
in april , nord stream asked estonian authorities to measure the depth of the baltic sea in estonian waters to determine if it was possible to shift the pipeline south of the finnish coast .
the authorities turned to scientists for an opinion .
bitter dispute gazprom has stressed its 2005 agreement with german firms eon and basf to lay a 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 745-mile -rrb- gas pipeline , known as nord stream , across the baltic sea from russia to germany , saying it would boost europe 's energy security and cut out the potential for political conflict with transit countries .
former german chancellor gerhard schröder is the chairman of nord stream 's shareholders ' committee .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since in was first proposed in 2005 .
many of the states bordering the baltic have argued that it could disturb stores of chemical weapons dumped in the sea after world war ii .
so far more than 20,000 people , mostly from the baltic states , have signed a petition to stop the construction of the pipeline .
if completed , the pipeline would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

being a child star can take its toll .
few are the pint-sized performers who reach adulthood unscarred .
more common are the youthful tales of substance abuse , eating disorders and therapy , like those now faced by knut . it seems the public has an endless appetite for tales of glory gone sour .
now , the latest celebrity to fall prey to this taste for schadenfreude is knut , the irresistibly cuddly polar bear cub that was born in the berlin zoo just eight months ago . at the time , no one could have predicted the adorable ball of white fluff would soon be vying for headlines - and therapy clinic time - with drew , lindsay , britney & co .
but perhaps they should have seen it coming . tough at the top so what caused " cute knut 's " inevitable downfall among berlin 's animal adoring public ?

now , knut 's four daily meals are being cut down to three . call it the south pole diet . survival reserves , or unsightly love handles ? " if knut lived outdoors this would n't be so bad - he would simply build up his fat reserves for winter , " zoo veterinarian andreas ochs told news services on tuesday .
but in captivity , ochs said , the extra weight is unnecessary . knut currently is fed a baby-bear diet of porridge , milk , meat , cod liver oil , and supplements , but he will soon graduate to grown-up bear food : fish and solid meat . " extras like croissants will need to be dropped , " ochs said , adding french pastries to the list of foods no one previously knew were fed to zoo animals . bonaduce , take note bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zenith of fame : a vanity fair cover while the bear 's fall from grace may not be on as big a scale as some - after all , knut is no danny bonaduce - his story can still serve as a cautionary tale about the pitfalls of fame and greed . one day you 're on the cover of vanity fair , the next its weight watchers magazine . how did this all come about ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 01.08.2007 eu calls on russia , belarus to solve gas dispute großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not the first time russia has threatened to turn off gas supplies to its neighbors the european commission on wednesday urged russia and belarus to seek an amicable solution to their latest dispute over energy supplies , which could also affect gas deliveries to western europe . the russian gas monopoly gazprom said it would reduce gas supplies to its neighbor by 45 percent beginning on friday due to outstanding belarusian debt after a doubling of gas prices had caused minsk to fall $ 456 million -lrb- 333 million euros -rrb- behind on its payments in recent months .
" we take this development very seriously , " eu commission spokesman martin selmayr told reporters wednesday .
minsk and moscow should resolve their dispute without delay and create conditions for the timely resumption of deliveries , he said .
if needed the commission could convene a meeting of a european union " gas coordination group " to study implications the row could have on energy supplies to the 27-nation bloc , selmayr said .
subsidized prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin -lrb- right -rrb- and belarus leader alexander lukashenko have been drifting apart about one fifth of russian gas exports to europe transit belarus , but western customers had been told about the planned reduction of supplies , according to gazprom .
gazprom has accused the belarus gas company beltransgas of having paid for about half of its imports of russian natural gas in the first half of 2007 .
russia and belarus previously clashed over energy supplies at the beginning of 2007 .
while a complete stoppage of gas supplies to belarus was avoided , russia reduced its supplies of oil for several days - a decision that also affected the transit pipeline into the eu .
" gazprom will take all possible measures for the transportation of russian gas through the territory of belarus in full accordance with current obligations to european customers , " the company said in a statement , adding it would pursue legal action against belarus if it siphoned gas out of transit pipelines . alexander burgansky , an analyst at renaissance capital , said belarus was unlikely to start taking gas from transit pipelines . " consumption is seasonally low , and underground storage facilities are full everywhere , " he told reuters .
the cause of the current conflict is moscow 's attempt to raise step by step the strongly subsidized energy prices for belarus to an international level .
estonians against sea pipeline bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many estonians do n't want the pipeline off their shores plans for an alternative gas delivery route from russia to western europe were also dealt a blow on wednesday after an academic report called on the estonian government to not allow a consortium behind a controversial gas pipeline to construct it in estonian waters .
a possible russian military presence and potential harm to the environment should force the government to deny a request from the nord stream consortium to conduct an environmental study in estonian waters , daily postimees reported quoting the study by the country 's academy of sciences .
" neutral states like finland and sweden can allow the presence of the russian armed forces and gazprom armed operatives in their economic zones or territorial waters , but as nato members estonia and poland can not allow that , " the report said .
in april , nord stream asked estonian authorities to measure the depth of the baltic sea in estonian waters to determine if it was possible to shift the pipeline south of the finnish coast .
the authorities turned to scientists for an opinion .
bitter dispute gazprom has stressed its 2005 agreement with german firms eon and basf to lay a 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 745-mile -rrb- gas pipeline , known as nord stream , across the baltic sea from russia to germany , saying it would boost europe 's energy security and cut out the potential for political conflict with transit countries .
former german chancellor gerhard schröder is the chairman of nord stream 's shareholders ' committee .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since in was first proposed in 2005 .
many of the states bordering the baltic have argued that it could disturb stores of chemical weapons dumped in the sea after world war ii .
so far more than 20,000 people , mostly from the baltic states , have signed a petition to stop the construction of the pipeline .
if completed , the pipeline would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .

being a child star can take its toll .
few are the pint-sized performers who reach adulthood unscarred .
more common are the youthful tales of substance abuse , eating disorders and therapy , like those now faced by knut . it seems the public has an endless appetite for tales of glory gone sour .
now , the latest celebrity to fall prey to this taste for schadenfreude is knut , the irresistibly cuddly polar bear cub that was born in the berlin zoo just eight months ago . at the time , no one could have predicted the adorable ball of white fluff would soon be vying for headlines - and therapy clinic time - with drew , lindsay , britney & co .
but perhaps they should have seen it coming . tough at the top so what caused " cute knut 's " inevitable downfall among berlin 's animal adoring public ?
pills ?
booze ?
scientology ? bildunterschrift : ' cute knut ' back when he was , well , cuter think again : earlier this week , the zoo announced that knut - an irresistible , cuddly , and extremely photogenic ball of white fluff whose every development has been avidly documented -lrb- some say exploited -rrb- , since he was introduced to the world in december - is being put on a diet . it seems the bear has been packing on the pounds - an unsightly development for a celebrity , even of the ursine persuasion .
now , knut 's four daily meals are being cut down to three . call it the south pole diet . survival reserves , or unsightly love handles ? " if knut lived outdoors this would n't be so bad - he would simply build up his fat reserves for winter , " zoo veterinarian andreas ochs told news services on tuesday .
but in captivity , ochs said , the extra weight is unnecessary . knut currently is fed a baby-bear diet of porridge , milk , meat , cod liver oil , and supplements , but he will soon graduate to grown-up bear food : fish and solid meat . " extras like croissants will need to be dropped , " ochs said , adding french pastries to the list of foods no one previously knew were fed to zoo animals . bonaduce , take note bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zenith of fame : a vanity fair cover while the bear 's fall from grace may not be on as big a scale as some - after all , knut is no danny bonaduce - his story can still serve as a cautionary tale about the pitfalls of fame and greed . one day you 're on the cover of vanity fair , the next its weight watchers magazine . how did this all come about ?
as knut 's long-haired keeper - himself a much-photographed celebrity of sorts since he introduced his protegee to the world - told the berliner zeitung newspaper that the bear 's dietary dilemma results from a common problem . " knut likes to nibble between meals , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 01.08.2007 eu calls on russia , belarus to solve gas dispute großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not the first time russia has threatened to turn off gas supplies to its neighbors the european commission on wednesday urged russia and belarus to seek an amicable solution to their latest dispute over energy supplies , which could also affect gas deliveries to western europe . the russian gas monopoly gazprom said it would reduce gas supplies to its neighbor by 45 percent beginning on friday due to outstanding belarusian debt after a doubling of gas prices had caused minsk to fall $ 456 million -lrb- 333 million euros -rrb- behind on its payments in recent months .
" we take this development very seriously , " eu commission spokesman martin selmayr told reporters wednesday .
minsk and moscow should resolve their dispute without delay and create conditions for the timely resumption of deliveries , he said .
if needed the commission could convene a meeting of a european union " gas coordination group " to study implications the row could have on energy supplies to the 27-nation bloc , selmayr said .
subsidized prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin -lrb- right -rrb- and belarus leader alexander lukashenko have been drifting apart about one fifth of russian gas exports to europe transit belarus , but western customers had been told about the planned reduction of supplies , according to gazprom .
gazprom has accused the belarus gas company beltransgas of having paid for about half of its imports of russian natural gas in the first half of 2007 .
russia and belarus previously clashed over energy supplies at the beginning of 2007 .
while a complete stoppage of gas supplies to belarus was avoided , russia reduced its supplies of oil for several days - a decision that also affected the transit pipeline into the eu .
" gazprom will take all possible measures for the transportation of russian gas through the territory of belarus in full accordance with current obligations to european customers , " the company said in a statement , adding it would pursue legal action against belarus if it siphoned gas out of transit pipelines . alexander burgansky , an analyst at renaissance capital , said belarus was unlikely to start taking gas from transit pipelines . " consumption is seasonally low , and underground storage facilities are full everywhere , " he told reuters .
the cause of the current conflict is moscow 's attempt to raise step by step the strongly subsidized energy prices for belarus to an international level .
estonians against sea pipeline bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many estonians do n't want the pipeline off their shores plans for an alternative gas delivery route from russia to western europe were also dealt a blow on wednesday after an academic report called on the estonian government to not allow a consortium behind a controversial gas pipeline to construct it in estonian waters .
a possible russian military presence and potential harm to the environment should force the government to deny a request from the nord stream consortium to conduct an environmental study in estonian waters , daily postimees reported quoting the study by the country 's academy of sciences .
" neutral states like finland and sweden can allow the presence of the russian armed forces and gazprom armed operatives in their economic zones or territorial waters , but as nato members estonia and poland can not allow that , " the report said .
in april , nord stream asked estonian authorities to measure the depth of the baltic sea in estonian waters to determine if it was possible to shift the pipeline south of the finnish coast .
the authorities turned to scientists for an opinion .
bitter dispute gazprom has stressed its 2005 agreement with german firms eon and basf to lay a 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 745-mile -rrb- gas pipeline , known as nord stream , across the baltic sea from russia to germany , saying it would boost europe 's energy security and cut out the potential for political conflict with transit countries .
former german chancellor gerhard schröder is the chairman of nord stream 's shareholders ' committee .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since in was first proposed in 2005 .
many of the states bordering the baltic have argued that it could disturb stores of chemical weapons dumped in the sea after world war ii .
so far more than 20,000 people , mostly from the baltic states , have signed a petition to stop the construction of the pipeline .
if completed , the pipeline would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

is it time to send the 50-year-old financial institution into retirement ? for decades , germany 's central bank was a national icon that stood as guarantor for a strong currency and the country 's postwar economic miracle .
with the advent of the euro , however , it started sinking into insignificance .
" not all germans believe in god , but they all believe in the bundesbank , " said european union head jacques delors back in 1992 .
things changed a decade later with the introduction of the common european currency .
at that time , the bundesbank lost its prime function of setting interest rates to the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- .
an important role ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deutsche mark was replaced by the euro in jan .
2002 and even though cost-cutting and job losses overshadow the 50th anniversary of bundesbank on aug .
1 , the bank 's president , axel weber , believes it has an important role to play in deciding the course of european monetary policy .
" we need a strong bundesbank as an integral part of the euro system , " he said .
weber represents europe 's biggest economy in the ecb 's 19-member rate-setting council , where germany has the same clout as much smaller nations like slovenia or luxembourg .
but what does it do ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesbank was one of the most respected german institutions the bundesbank 's main functions today are lending money to trading banks , making sure there is enough cash to fuel the economy , overseeing banking operations and advising the federal government .
but some experts , like professor dirk schiereck of the european business school in oestrich-winkel , believe there is no need for a central bank any more .
" as an institution , it has outlived its usefulness , " schiereck said .
" in 50 years ' time , there wo n't be a bundesbank any more . "
since handing the baton to the ecb , the central bank has been searching for a new role , something which is proving difficult in the 13-storey concrete tower where it has its headquarters in frankfurt .
a more slender profile bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesbank 's big brother , the european central bank , is also located in frankfurt the bank reacted to criticism that it is bloated by announcing plans to cut the number of branches from 127 to 47 by 2012 and trim staff from 10,970 at present to 9,000 over the same period .
the future , however , wo n't be anywhere near as illustrious as the past when the bank underscored its independence in clashes with various chancellors and finance ministers over monetary policy .
" with an unprecedented policy of stability , the central bank made the deutsche mark one of the world 's most stable currencies , " said udo steffens , a professor at the frankfurt school of finance and management .
the biggest ever cash transfer the bundesbank thus became a model for the ecb , which is also headquartered in frankfurt .
" if it had n't been for a strong mark , the euro would n't be as strong as it is today , " steffens said .
the bank presided over the introduction of the euro in germany , in what was the biggest ever transfer of cash .
over a period of days , transport firms distributed 71,500 tons of coins and 2.5 billion banknotes to customers .
but the bank was also tainted by scandal in 2004 when weber 's predecessor , ernst welteke , was forced to resign for accepting largesse from a bank he was supposed to oversee . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

some 200,000 people have lost their lives and more than 2 million became refugees as a result of the genocide that 's been taking place in the crisis region of darfur in western sudan .
countless attempts were needed in the un security council to - finally - adopt a resolution that 's been described as " historic " by un secretary-general ban ki-moon .
a peacekeeping force of 26,000 soldiers is now meant to put an end to the darfur genocide .
it 's a mission that completely overwhelms the underfinanced and badly equipped african union troops that are currently stationed there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie duckstein but despite the " historic " praise by the highest body of world diplomacy , the resolution can only be called a timid attempt as it is a compromise .
it 's an agreement with concessions that all 15 members of the un security council managed to unanimously agree on .
britain and france cleared the way for a watered-down draft that no longer talks about continuing attacks of sudanese government troops and janjaweed militia .
it 's also a compromise because the peacekeeping forces will not be able to confiscate illegal weapons .
the existing arms embargo against sudan is weak and is circumvented by countries such as china and russia .
the resolution also stops short of far-reaching sanctions against the african state .
security council veto power china had opposed the enforcement of sanctions .
the chinese government called them " unfair and untimely " and had repeatedly prevented a resolution by abstaining from the vote .
again and again , human rights organizations have presented evidence of genocide and the sudanese government 's responsibility - without success .
while the tragedy continues in its fourth year in darfur , the timid implementation of a un peacekeeping mission is hard to understand .
more than 50 previous declarations were necessary that expressed " collective concerns , " " continuing grave concerns , " or " great fear . "
this was cynical diplomatic terminology while women , children and elderly were dying in misery at the same time .
even sudan 's un ambassador , abdalmahmood abdalhaleem mohamad , seems happy with the agreement that has been reached .
last week , the country 's president , omar al-bashir , had shrugged off the genocide as propaganda by western media after visiting the crisis region for three days .
al-bashir so far has prevented every attempt to station a hybrid force of un and african union soldiers - despite showing signs of cooperation from time to time .
that 's why the un resolution has to be seen as nothing more than a signal of western diplomacy for the time being .
it does not represent an end to genocide .
people are still killed on a daily basis , thousands fell from the crisis region to neighboring chad and the central african republic and still are not protected from attacks by the janjaweed militia .
experts think that it will take a year until the biggest un mission ever is ready .
fearfully it 's a year during which masses of people will continue to die .

is it time to send the 50-year-old financial institution into retirement ? for decades , germany 's central bank was a national icon that stood as guarantor for a strong currency and the country 's postwar economic miracle .
with the advent of the euro , however , it started sinking into insignificance .
" not all germans believe in god , but they all believe in the bundesbank , " said european union head jacques delors back in 1992 .
things changed a decade later with the introduction of the common european currency .
at that time , the bundesbank lost its prime function of setting interest rates to the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- .
an important role ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the deutsche mark was replaced by the euro in jan .
2002 and even though cost-cutting and job losses overshadow the 50th anniversary of bundesbank on aug .
1 , the bank 's president , axel weber , believes it has an important role to play in deciding the course of european monetary policy .
" we need a strong bundesbank as an integral part of the euro system , " he said .
weber represents europe 's biggest economy in the ecb 's 19-member rate-setting council , where germany has the same clout as much smaller nations like slovenia or luxembourg .
but what does it do ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesbank was one of the most respected german institutions the bundesbank 's main functions today are lending money to trading banks , making sure there is enough cash to fuel the economy , overseeing banking operations and advising the federal government .
but some experts , like professor dirk schiereck of the european business school in oestrich-winkel , believe there is no need for a central bank any more .
" as an institution , it has outlived its usefulness , " schiereck said .
" in 50 years ' time , there wo n't be a bundesbank any more . "
since handing the baton to the ecb , the central bank has been searching for a new role , something which is proving difficult in the 13-storey concrete tower where it has its headquarters in frankfurt .
a more slender profile bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bundesbank 's big brother , the european central bank , is also located in frankfurt the bank reacted to criticism that it is bloated by announcing plans to cut the number of branches from 127 to 47 by 2012 and trim staff from 10,970 at present to 9,000 over the same period .
the future , however , wo n't be anywhere near as illustrious as the past when the bank underscored its independence in clashes with various chancellors and finance ministers over monetary policy .
" with an unprecedented policy of stability , the central bank made the deutsche mark one of the world 's most stable currencies , " said udo steffens , a professor at the frankfurt school of finance and management .
the biggest ever cash transfer the bundesbank thus became a model for the ecb , which is also headquartered in frankfurt .
" if it had n't been for a strong mark , the euro would n't be as strong as it is today , " steffens said .
the bank presided over the introduction of the euro in germany , in what was the biggest ever transfer of cash .
over a period of days , transport firms distributed 71,500 tons of coins and 2.5 billion banknotes to customers .
but the bank was also tainted by scandal in 2004 when weber 's predecessor , ernst welteke , was forced to resign for accepting largesse from a bank he was supposed to oversee . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

being a child star can take its toll .
few are the pint-sized performers who reach adulthood unscarred .
more common are the youthful tales of substance abuse , eating disorders and therapy , like those now faced by knut . it seems the public has an endless appetite for tales of glory gone sour .
now , the latest celebrity to fall prey to this taste for schadenfreude is knut , the irresistibly cuddly polar bear cub that was born in the berlin zoo just eight months ago . at the time , no one could have predicted the adorable ball of white fluff would soon be vying for headlines - and therapy clinic time - with drew , lindsay , britney & co .
but perhaps they should have seen it coming . tough at the top so what caused " cute knut 's " inevitable downfall among berlin 's animal adoring public ?
pills ?
booze ?
scientology ? bildunterschrift : ' cute knut ' back when he was , well , cuter think again : earlier this week , the zoo announced that knut - an irresistible , cuddly , and extremely photogenic ball of white fluff whose every development has been avidly documented -lrb- some say exploited -rrb- , since he was introduced to the world in december - is being put on a diet . it seems the bear has been packing on the pounds - an unsightly development for a celebrity , even of the ursine persuasion .
now , knut 's four daily meals are being cut down to three . call it the south pole diet . survival reserves , or unsightly love handles ? " if knut lived outdoors this would n't be so bad - he would simply build up his fat reserves for winter , " zoo veterinarian andreas ochs told news services on tuesday .
but in captivity , ochs said , the extra weight is unnecessary . knut currently is fed a baby-bear diet of porridge , milk , meat , cod liver oil , and supplements , but he will soon graduate to grown-up bear food : fish and solid meat . " extras like croissants will need to be dropped , " ochs said , adding french pastries to the list of foods no one previously knew were fed to zoo animals . bonaduce , take note bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zenith of fame : a vanity fair cover while the bear 's fall from grace may not be on as big a scale as some - after all , knut is no danny bonaduce - his story can still serve as a cautionary tale about the pitfalls of fame and greed . one day you 're on the cover of vanity fair , the next its weight watchers magazine . how did this all come about ?
as knut 's long-haired keeper - himself a much-photographed celebrity of sorts since he introduced his protegee to the world - told the berliner zeitung newspaper that the bear 's dietary dilemma results from a common problem . " knut likes to nibble between meals , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

knut , the polar bear , is the most famous living berliner .

the list includes a dozen early renaissance portraits and biblical scenes by lucas cranach the elder , best known for his oil renditions of martin luther , as well as an oil-on-canvas rubens portrait from the 1600s of the archbishop antonio trieste of ghent . the agency , which is a division of the finance ministry and has branches throughout germany , was established last year to handle claims not only for looted art , antique furniture and other cultural artifacts , but also the restitution of real estate and property seized by the nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biblical themes are common in works by lucas cranach the elder according to the badv 's harald könig , the body of case-law dealing with restitution issues and compensation for assets confiscated by the nazis is still growing more than 60 years after the end of the war . although most legal claims were settled in the post-war years in the former west germany , the origins of much of the art unearthed in the eastern states after the reunification in 1990 , has only recently begun being documented and returned to the original owners . mostly oil paintings on list of looted art so far the provenance of 36 objects out of nearly 600 that have been thoroughly documented have been or are in the process of being returned to holocaust survivors or their descendents , said könig . returning the art to its proper owners is nearly always a long legal process that can take years , or even decades , for owners to prove the art belongs to them . the looted listed on the badv 's web page consists mainly of oil paintings , but also italian , english and german antiques replete with detailed descriptions , historical references and a black and white photo .
most of the art has been loaned out to museums throughout germany , including several works that had been originally intended for hitler 's museum in linz , austria . the nazis looted about 650,000 artworks in all according to estimates by the jewish claims conference , of which only a fraction have been returned in spite of highly publicized restitution efforts since the mid-1990s .
one of the main reasons for the meager returns was the difficulty involved in adequately documenting the provenance of art assets . list needs to be in english for target audience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : descendents of holocaust survivors no longer speak german " it 's marvelous that such information is now being posted by the badv , " said anne webber , who is co-chair of the non-profit london-based commission for looted art in europe , though she added that the comprehensive list compiled by the agency would benefit from being translated into english . only last month , the national fund of the republic of austria for victims of national socialism , which published its comprehensive database of stolen nazi art in german last december , provided an english page as well . " such sites need to be accessible to their target audiences worldwide , " webber said .
" the rightful owners are not likely to live in german speaking countries , nor speak german anymore . " although parts of badv 's web page are available in english , the detailed list of paintings and artworks are not .

in germany , the regional states decide where to light up , resulting in patchwork laws .
now three states have taken the no-smoking initiative . most of germany 's 16 regional states plan to implement smoking bans by january next year , but anti-smoking laws already went into effect in three states on aug .
1 . starting in september , smoking will also be banned in federal buildings and on all modes of public transport as well as taxis , trains and airports . in baden-württemberg , lower saxony and mecklenburg-west pomerania , smoking is now prohibited in all local government buildings , hospitals , schools and other institutions for children and youth . in the first two states , where hanover , heidelberg and stuttgart are located , smoking will still be permitted in restaurants and bars , but only in designated areas , whereas in the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , the anti-smoking laws will take effect in gastronomical establishments starting jan .

critics of the patchwork laws in the various states say that unlike other european countries , such as france , italy and britain , the lack of a comprehensive ban throughout germany , sends the wrong signal .
although berlin has tried to introduce anti-smoking laws nationwide , it could only enforce the rules in federal buildings , since germany 's constitution gives its states considerable latitude in such matters .
in march , the federal government agreed on a framework with the 16 states on anti-smoking rules in public buildings , but each state would have to ratify its own laws .
critics in favor of comprehensive smoking bans lothar binding , a social democratic parliamentarian , told the berlin daily newspaper tageszeitung , " health protection should n't be restricted to only a few states .

" health protection should not be age-related , " said binding , who campaigned for a comprehensive ban in the german parliament last year . others applauded the state initiatives .
" it is a hopeful start that states where the smoking issue has been a smoking gun have become models for other states , " said martina pötschke-langer , head of heidelberg 's german cancer research institute -lrb- dkfz -rrb- in an interview with the associated press . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " health protection should not be aged related " owners favor laws according to a survey by the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , most barkeepers and restaurant owners favor the new laws .

statistics from the german health ministry show that one-third of german adults are smokers , of which 140,000 die annually from their habit .
in addition , more than 3,000 non-smoker deaths a year are attributed to the effects of passive inhalation . article based on news reports -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in germany , the regional states decide where to light up , resulting in patchwork laws .
now three states have taken the no-smoking initiative . most of germany 's 16 regional states plan to implement smoking bans by january next year , but anti-smoking laws already went into effect in three states on aug .
1 . starting in september , smoking will also be banned in federal buildings and on all modes of public transport as well as taxis , trains and airports . in baden-württemberg , lower saxony and mecklenburg-west pomerania , smoking is now prohibited in all local government buildings , hospitals , schools and other institutions for children and youth . in the first two states , where hanover , heidelberg and stuttgart are located , smoking will still be permitted in restaurants and bars , but only in designated areas , whereas in the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , the anti-smoking laws will take effect in gastronomical establishments starting jan .
1 . the states of hesse , rhineland-palatinate and saxony - where frankfurt , mainz and dresden are located - want to enforce anti-smoking rules before the end of the year . patchwork laws in different states restaurant and bar owners in lower saxony , who are responsible for enforcing the ban , will be subject to checks by the local police as of november , so even though the rule takes effect now , there will be no penalties for violating the law until then .
afterwards offenders could face fines of up to 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,365 -rrb- , and in mecklenburg-western pomerania the fine could be as much as 10,000 euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking rules in discos vary , depending on region rules in discotheques also vary . the southwestern state baden-württemberg will impose a comprehensive ban , whereas discos in the northern state lower saxony will permit smoking in a sealed off area .
critics of the patchwork laws in the various states say that unlike other european countries , such as france , italy and britain , the lack of a comprehensive ban throughout germany , sends the wrong signal .
although berlin has tried to introduce anti-smoking laws nationwide , it could only enforce the rules in federal buildings , since germany 's constitution gives its states considerable latitude in such matters .
in march , the federal government agreed on a framework with the 16 states on anti-smoking rules in public buildings , but each state would have to ratify its own laws .
critics in favor of comprehensive smoking bans lothar binding , a social democratic parliamentarian , told the berlin daily newspaper tageszeitung , " health protection should n't be restricted to only a few states .
a non-smoker in stuttgart has the same right to clean air as one in rostock , " he added . furthermore , in baden-württemberg , it is up to individual schools to decide whether those teenagers who are no longer minors may smoke in sealed-off areas on school premises .
" health protection should not be age-related , " said binding , who campaigned for a comprehensive ban in the german parliament last year . others applauded the state initiatives .

in germany , the regional states decide where to light up , resulting in patchwork laws .
now three states have taken the no-smoking initiative . most of germany 's 16 regional states plan to implement smoking bans by january next year , but anti-smoking laws already went into effect in three states on aug .
1 . starting in september , smoking will also be banned in federal buildings and on all modes of public transport as well as taxis , trains and airports . in baden-württemberg , lower saxony and mecklenburg-west pomerania , smoking is now prohibited in all local government buildings , hospitals , schools and other institutions for children and youth . in the first two states , where hanover , heidelberg and stuttgart are located , smoking will still be permitted in restaurants and bars , but only in designated areas , whereas in the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , the anti-smoking laws will take effect in gastronomical establishments starting jan .
1 . the states of hesse , rhineland-palatinate and saxony - where frankfurt , mainz and dresden are located - want to enforce anti-smoking rules before the end of the year . patchwork laws in different states restaurant and bar owners in lower saxony , who are responsible for enforcing the ban , will be subject to checks by the local police as of november , so even though the rule takes effect now , there will be no penalties for violating the law until then .
afterwards offenders could face fines of up to 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,365 -rrb- , and in mecklenburg-western pomerania the fine could be as much as 10,000 euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking rules in discos vary , depending on region rules in discotheques also vary . the southwestern state baden-württemberg will impose a comprehensive ban , whereas discos in the northern state lower saxony will permit smoking in a sealed off area .
critics of the patchwork laws in the various states say that unlike other european countries , such as france , italy and britain , the lack of a comprehensive ban throughout germany , sends the wrong signal .
although berlin has tried to introduce anti-smoking laws nationwide , it could only enforce the rules in federal buildings , since germany 's constitution gives its states considerable latitude in such matters .
in march , the federal government agreed on a framework with the 16 states on anti-smoking rules in public buildings , but each state would have to ratify its own laws .
critics in favor of comprehensive smoking bans lothar binding , a social democratic parliamentarian , told the berlin daily newspaper tageszeitung , " health protection should n't be restricted to only a few states .
a non-smoker in stuttgart has the same right to clean air as one in rostock , " he added . furthermore , in baden-württemberg , it is up to individual schools to decide whether those teenagers who are no longer minors may smoke in sealed-off areas on school premises .
" health protection should not be age-related , " said binding , who campaigned for a comprehensive ban in the german parliament last year . others applauded the state initiatives .
" it is a hopeful start that states where the smoking issue has been a smoking gun have become models for other states , " said martina pötschke-langer , head of heidelberg 's german cancer research institute -lrb- dkfz -rrb- in an interview with the associated press . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " health protection should not be aged related " owners favor laws according to a survey by the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , most barkeepers and restaurant owners favor the new laws .
in the past two years , the number of restaurants , bars and inns with specially designated areas has nearly doubled , reflecting changing public attitudes . those in favor of voluntary restrictions comprise only 20 percent of proprietors and only 10 percent of those surveyed are against the introduction of any non-smoker protection laws at all . a slight majority of germans have also approved smoking bans and restrictions , according to a forsa survey .
statistics from the german health ministry show that one-third of german adults are smokers , of which 140,000 die annually from their habit .
in addition , more than 3,000 non-smoker deaths a year are attributed to the effects of passive inhalation . article based on news reports -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 01.08.2007 eu calls on russia , belarus to solve gas dispute großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not the first time russia has threatened to turn off gas supplies to its neighbors the european commission on wednesday urged russia and belarus to seek an amicable solution to their latest dispute over energy supplies , which could also affect gas deliveries to western europe . the russian gas monopoly gazprom said it would reduce gas supplies to its neighbor by 45 percent beginning on friday due to outstanding belarusian debt after a doubling of gas prices had caused minsk to fall $ 456 million -lrb- 333 million euros -rrb- behind on its payments in recent months .
" we take this development very seriously , " eu commission spokesman martin selmayr told reporters wednesday .
minsk and moscow should resolve their dispute without delay and create conditions for the timely resumption of deliveries , he said .
if needed the commission could convene a meeting of a european union " gas coordination group " to study implications the row could have on energy supplies to the 27-nation bloc , selmayr said .
subsidized prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin -lrb- right -rrb- and belarus leader alexander lukashenko have been drifting apart about one fifth of russian gas exports to europe transit belarus , but western customers had been told about the planned reduction of supplies , according to gazprom .
gazprom has accused the belarus gas company beltransgas of having paid for about half of its imports of russian natural gas in the first half of 2007 .
russia and belarus previously clashed over energy supplies at the beginning of 2007 .
while a complete stoppage of gas supplies to belarus was avoided , russia reduced its supplies of oil for several days - a decision that also affected the transit pipeline into the eu .
" gazprom will take all possible measures for the transportation of russian gas through the territory of belarus in full accordance with current obligations to european customers , " the company said in a statement , adding it would pursue legal action against belarus if it siphoned gas out of transit pipelines . alexander burgansky , an analyst at renaissance capital , said belarus was unlikely to start taking gas from transit pipelines . " consumption is seasonally low , and underground storage facilities are full everywhere , " he told reuters .
the cause of the current conflict is moscow 's attempt to raise step by step the strongly subsidized energy prices for belarus to an international level .
estonians against sea pipeline bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many estonians do n't want the pipeline off their shores plans for an alternative gas delivery route from russia to western europe were also dealt a blow on wednesday after an academic report called on the estonian government to not allow a consortium behind a controversial gas pipeline to construct it in estonian waters .
a possible russian military presence and potential harm to the environment should force the government to deny a request from the nord stream consortium to conduct an environmental study in estonian waters , daily postimees reported quoting the study by the country 's academy of sciences .
" neutral states like finland and sweden can allow the presence of the russian armed forces and gazprom armed operatives in their economic zones or territorial waters , but as nato members estonia and poland can not allow that , " the report said .
in april , nord stream asked estonian authorities to measure the depth of the baltic sea in estonian waters to determine if it was possible to shift the pipeline south of the finnish coast .
the authorities turned to scientists for an opinion .
bitter dispute gazprom has stressed its 2005 agreement with german firms eon and basf to lay a 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 745-mile -rrb- gas pipeline , known as nord stream , across the baltic sea from russia to germany , saying it would boost europe 's energy security and cut out the potential for political conflict with transit countries .
former german chancellor gerhard schröder is the chairman of nord stream 's shareholders ' committee .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since in was first proposed in 2005 .
many of the states bordering the baltic have argued that it could disturb stores of chemical weapons dumped in the sea after world war ii .

if completed , the pipeline would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany said wednesday that it will continue to stay out of business with the african nation . france has agreed to sell libya anti-tank missiles as part of the military agreement reached last week by french president nicolas sarkozy and libyan leader moammar gadhafi . " we are going to buy rocket-propelled grenades of the milan type worth around 100 million euros in france , " gadhafi 's son saif al-islam gaddafi was quoted as saying in an interview published in thursday 's french daily le monde .
" there 's also a project for a weapons factory . " a shoulder-mounted anti-tank weapon , the milan is built by a subsidiary of europe 's joint eads defense and aerospace company . the deal is part of a defense memorandum of understanding for a nuclear energy agreed to by sarkozy when he visited tripoli last week , after helping to free foreign medics imprisoned in libya . the french government has denied a direct link between the two countries ' military cooperation and the release of the bulgarian medics .

" first deal after arms embargo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six bulgarian medics held in libya for over eight years were set free last week the 35-year-old islam said it was the first arms supply from a western country , and added that he anticipated more deals to be made with other nations soon . since the arms embargo ended in 2004 there had been an unofficial embargo against his country , he said , pointing out that germany had been especially reserved in dealings with the country while other european nations have proven more willing to negotiate , islam said . though careful to avoid criticizing paris directly for the details of its deal with with tripoli , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he wished france had better communicated its intentions with other eu members . " i would have certainly wished that france had informed and gotten its european partners on board with the offer to libya , " he told the thursday 's handelsblatt newspaper .
" i think the french side now sees that it could have better chosen the order .

" there will soon be an extradition agreement with britain , " he said . that 's a statement the british government has denied . " there is no link between mr. megrahi and the release of the bulgarian and palestinian medics , " a spokesman told afp news agency , adding that there is no extradition agreement between britain and the north african country . the spokesman did , however , add that , " the uk and libyan government are looking into a wide range of areas pertaining to judicial cooperation .

countless attempts were needed in the un security council to - finally - adopt a resolution that 's been described as " historic " by un secretary-general ban ki-moon .
a peacekeeping force of 26,000 soldiers is now meant to put an end to the darfur genocide .
it 's a mission that completely overwhelms the underfinanced and badly equipped african union troops that are currently stationed there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie duckstein but despite the " historic " praise by the highest body of world diplomacy , the resolution can only be called a timid attempt as it is a compromise .
it 's an agreement with concessions that all 15 members of the un security council managed to unanimously agree on .
britain and france cleared the way for a watered-down draft that no longer talks about continuing attacks of sudanese government troops and janjaweed militia .
it 's also a compromise because the peacekeeping forces will not be able to confiscate illegal weapons .
the existing arms embargo against sudan is weak and is circumvented by countries such as china and russia .
the resolution also stops short of far-reaching sanctions against the african state .
security council veto power china had opposed the enforcement of sanctions .
the chinese government called them " unfair and untimely " and had repeatedly prevented a resolution by abstaining from the vote .
again and again , human rights organizations have presented evidence of genocide and the sudanese government 's responsibility - without success .
while the tragedy continues in its fourth year in darfur , the timid implementation of a un peacekeeping mission is hard to understand .
more than 50 previous declarations were necessary that expressed " collective concerns , " " continuing grave concerns , " or " great fear . "
this was cynical diplomatic terminology while women , children and elderly were dying in misery at the same time .
even sudan 's un ambassador , abdalmahmood abdalhaleem mohamad , seems happy with the agreement that has been reached .
last week , the country 's president , omar al-bashir , had shrugged off the genocide as propaganda by western media after visiting the crisis region for three days .
al-bashir so far has prevented every attempt to station a hybrid force of un and african union soldiers - despite showing signs of cooperation from time to time .
that 's why the un resolution has to be seen as nothing more than a signal of western diplomacy for the time being .
it does not represent an end to genocide .
people are still killed on a daily basis , thousands fell from the crisis region to neighboring chad and the central african republic and still are not protected from attacks by the janjaweed militia .
experts think that it will take a year until the biggest un mission ever is ready .
fearfully it 's a year during which masses of people will continue to die .

in germany , the regional states decide where to light up , resulting in patchwork laws .
now three states have taken the no-smoking initiative . most of germany 's 16 regional states plan to implement smoking bans by january next year , but anti-smoking laws already went into effect in three states on aug .
1 . starting in september , smoking will also be banned in federal buildings and on all modes of public transport as well as taxis , trains and airports . in baden-württemberg , lower saxony and mecklenburg-west pomerania , smoking is now prohibited in all local government buildings , hospitals , schools and other institutions for children and youth . in the first two states , where hanover , heidelberg and stuttgart are located , smoking will still be permitted in restaurants and bars , but only in designated areas , whereas in the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , the anti-smoking laws will take effect in gastronomical establishments starting jan .
1 . the states of hesse , rhineland-palatinate and saxony - where frankfurt , mainz and dresden are located - want to enforce anti-smoking rules before the end of the year . patchwork laws in different states restaurant and bar owners in lower saxony , who are responsible for enforcing the ban , will be subject to checks by the local police as of november , so even though the rule takes effect now , there will be no penalties for violating the law until then .
afterwards offenders could face fines of up to 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,365 -rrb- , and in mecklenburg-western pomerania the fine could be as much as 10,000 euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking rules in discos vary , depending on region rules in discotheques also vary . the southwestern state baden-württemberg will impose a comprehensive ban , whereas discos in the northern state lower saxony will permit smoking in a sealed off area .
critics of the patchwork laws in the various states say that unlike other european countries , such as france , italy and britain , the lack of a comprehensive ban throughout germany , sends the wrong signal .
although berlin has tried to introduce anti-smoking laws nationwide , it could only enforce the rules in federal buildings , since germany 's constitution gives its states considerable latitude in such matters .
in march , the federal government agreed on a framework with the 16 states on anti-smoking rules in public buildings , but each state would have to ratify its own laws .
critics in favor of comprehensive smoking bans lothar binding , a social democratic parliamentarian , told the berlin daily newspaper tageszeitung , " health protection should n't be restricted to only a few states .
a non-smoker in stuttgart has the same right to clean air as one in rostock , " he added . furthermore , in baden-württemberg , it is up to individual schools to decide whether those teenagers who are no longer minors may smoke in sealed-off areas on school premises .
" health protection should not be age-related , " said binding , who campaigned for a comprehensive ban in the german parliament last year . others applauded the state initiatives .
" it is a hopeful start that states where the smoking issue has been a smoking gun have become models for other states , " said martina pötschke-langer , head of heidelberg 's german cancer research institute -lrb- dkfz -rrb- in an interview with the associated press . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " health protection should not be aged related " owners favor laws according to a survey by the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , most barkeepers and restaurant owners favor the new laws .
in the past two years , the number of restaurants , bars and inns with specially designated areas has nearly doubled , reflecting changing public attitudes . those in favor of voluntary restrictions comprise only 20 percent of proprietors and only 10 percent of those surveyed are against the introduction of any non-smoker protection laws at all . a slight majority of germans have also approved smoking bans and restrictions , according to a forsa survey .
statistics from the german health ministry show that one-third of german adults are smokers , of which 140,000 die annually from their habit .
in addition , more than 3,000 non-smoker deaths a year are attributed to the effects of passive inhalation . article based on news reports -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany said wednesday that it will continue to stay out of business with the african nation . france has agreed to sell libya anti-tank missiles as part of the military agreement reached last week by french president nicolas sarkozy and libyan leader moammar gadhafi . " we are going to buy rocket-propelled grenades of the milan type worth around 100 million euros in france , " gadhafi 's son saif al-islam gaddafi was quoted as saying in an interview published in thursday 's french daily le monde .
" there 's also a project for a weapons factory . " a shoulder-mounted anti-tank weapon , the milan is built by a subsidiary of europe 's joint eads defense and aerospace company . the deal is part of a defense memorandum of understanding for a nuclear energy agreed to by sarkozy when he visited tripoli last week , after helping to free foreign medics imprisoned in libya . the french government has denied a direct link between the two countries ' military cooperation and the release of the bulgarian medics .
when asked what france offered in exchange for the six medics ' release sarkozy answered , " nothing . " first deal after arms embargo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six bulgarian medics held in libya for over eight years were set free last week the 35-year-old islam said it was the first arms supply from a western country , and added that he anticipated more deals to be made with other nations soon . since the arms embargo ended in 2004 there had been an unofficial embargo against his country , he said , pointing out that germany had been especially reserved in dealings with the country while other european nations have proven more willing to negotiate , islam said . though careful to avoid criticizing paris directly for the details of its deal with with tripoli , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he wished france had better communicated its intentions with other eu members . " i would have certainly wished that france had informed and gotten its european partners on board with the offer to libya , " he told the thursday 's handelsblatt newspaper .
" i think the french side now sees that it could have better chosen the order . " german politicians , including steinmeier 's deputy , have recently criticized the french deal with libya and recommended that german companies continue not to do business with the african state . uk extradition rumored bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a libyan convicted for having a role in the lockerbie bombing could be extradited negotiations over a possible extradition of libyan secret service agent ali al-magrahi , who was sentenced to life imprisonment over the 1998 lockerbie attack and is serving time in a prison near glasgow , also played an important role , gaddafi told the french paper . " there will soon be an extradition agreement with britain , " he said . that 's a statement the british government has denied . " there is no link between mr. megrahi and the release of the bulgarian and palestinian medics , " a spokesman told afp news agency , adding that there is no extradition agreement between britain and the north african country . the spokesman did , however , add that , " the uk and libyan government are looking into a wide range of areas pertaining to judicial cooperation .

in germany , the regional states decide where to light up , resulting in patchwork laws .
now three states have taken the no-smoking initiative . most of germany 's 16 regional states plan to implement smoking bans by january next year , but anti-smoking laws already went into effect in three states on aug .
1 . starting in september , smoking will also be banned in federal buildings and on all modes of public transport as well as taxis , trains and airports . in baden-württemberg , lower saxony and mecklenburg-west pomerania , smoking is now prohibited in all local government buildings , hospitals , schools and other institutions for children and youth . in the first two states , where hanover , heidelberg and stuttgart are located , smoking will still be permitted in restaurants and bars , but only in designated areas , whereas in the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , the anti-smoking laws will take effect in gastronomical establishments starting jan .
1 . the states of hesse , rhineland-palatinate and saxony - where frankfurt , mainz and dresden are located - want to enforce anti-smoking rules before the end of the year . patchwork laws in different states restaurant and bar owners in lower saxony , who are responsible for enforcing the ban , will be subject to checks by the local police as of november , so even though the rule takes effect now , there will be no penalties for violating the law until then .
afterwards offenders could face fines of up to 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,365 -rrb- , and in mecklenburg-western pomerania the fine could be as much as 10,000 euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking rules in discos vary , depending on region rules in discotheques also vary . the southwestern state baden-württemberg will impose a comprehensive ban , whereas discos in the northern state lower saxony will permit smoking in a sealed off area .
critics of the patchwork laws in the various states say that unlike other european countries , such as france , italy and britain , the lack of a comprehensive ban throughout germany , sends the wrong signal .
although berlin has tried to introduce anti-smoking laws nationwide , it could only enforce the rules in federal buildings , since germany 's constitution gives its states considerable latitude in such matters .
in march , the federal government agreed on a framework with the 16 states on anti-smoking rules in public buildings , but each state would have to ratify its own laws .
critics in favor of comprehensive smoking bans lothar binding , a social democratic parliamentarian , told the berlin daily newspaper tageszeitung , " health protection should n't be restricted to only a few states .
a non-smoker in stuttgart has the same right to clean air as one in rostock , " he added . furthermore , in baden-württemberg , it is up to individual schools to decide whether those teenagers who are no longer minors may smoke in sealed-off areas on school premises .
" health protection should not be age-related , " said binding , who campaigned for a comprehensive ban in the german parliament last year . others applauded the state initiatives .
" it is a hopeful start that states where the smoking issue has been a smoking gun have become models for other states , " said martina pötschke-langer , head of heidelberg 's german cancer research institute -lrb- dkfz -rrb- in an interview with the associated press . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " health protection should not be aged related " owners favor laws according to a survey by the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , most barkeepers and restaurant owners favor the new laws .

statistics from the german health ministry show that one-third of german adults are smokers , of which 140,000 die annually from their habit .

" we call on the government of sudan and all rebel groups to immediately cease hostilities in darfur and pursue a political settlement ­ under un and au leadership that results in a sustainable peace in sudan . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 01.08.2007 first smoking bans take effect in german states großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lighting up will only be permitted in designated areas other european countries have enforced nationwide bans against smoking .
in germany , the regional states decide where to light up , resulting in patchwork laws .
now three states have taken the no-smoking initiative . most of germany 's 16 regional states plan to implement smoking bans by january next year , but anti-smoking laws already went into effect in three states on aug .
1 . starting in september , smoking will also be banned in federal buildings and on all modes of public transport as well as taxis , trains and airports . in baden-württemberg , lower saxony and mecklenburg-west pomerania , smoking is now prohibited in all local government buildings , hospitals , schools and other institutions for children and youth . in the first two states , where hanover , heidelberg and stuttgart are located , smoking will still be permitted in restaurants and bars , but only in designated areas , whereas in the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , the anti-smoking laws will take effect in gastronomical establishments starting jan .
1 . the states of hesse , rhineland-palatinate and saxony - where frankfurt , mainz and dresden are located - want to enforce anti-smoking rules before the end of the year . patchwork laws in different states restaurant and bar owners in lower saxony , who are responsible for enforcing the ban , will be subject to checks by the local police as of november , so even though the rule takes effect now , there will be no penalties for violating the law until then .
afterwards offenders could face fines of up to 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,365 -rrb- , and in mecklenburg-western pomerania the fine could be as much as 10,000 euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking rules in discos vary , depending on region rules in discotheques also vary . the southwestern state baden-württemberg will impose a comprehensive ban , whereas discos in the northern state lower saxony will permit smoking in a sealed off area .
critics of the patchwork laws in the various states say that unlike other european countries , such as france , italy and britain , the lack of a comprehensive ban throughout germany , sends the wrong signal .
although berlin has tried to introduce anti-smoking laws nationwide , it could only enforce the rules in federal buildings , since germany 's constitution gives its states considerable latitude in such matters .
in march , the federal government agreed on a framework with the 16 states on anti-smoking rules in public buildings , but each state would have to ratify its own laws .
critics in favor of comprehensive smoking bans lothar binding , a social democratic parliamentarian , told the berlin daily newspaper tageszeitung , " health protection should n't be restricted to only a few states .
a non-smoker in stuttgart has the same right to clean air as one in rostock , " he added . furthermore , in baden-württemberg , it is up to individual schools to decide whether those teenagers who are no longer minors may smoke in sealed-off areas on school premises .
" health protection should not be age-related , " said binding , who campaigned for a comprehensive ban in the german parliament last year . others applauded the state initiatives .
" it is a hopeful start that states where the smoking issue has been a smoking gun have become models for other states , " said martina pötschke-langer , head of heidelberg 's german cancer research institute -lrb- dkfz -rrb- in an interview with the associated press . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " health protection should not be aged related " owners favor laws according to a survey by the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , most barkeepers and restaurant owners favor the new laws .
in the past two years , the number of restaurants , bars and inns with specially designated areas has nearly doubled , reflecting changing public attitudes . those in favor of voluntary restrictions comprise only 20 percent of proprietors and only 10 percent of those surveyed are against the introduction of any non-smoker protection laws at all . a slight majority of germans have also approved smoking bans and restrictions , according to a forsa survey .
statistics from the german health ministry show that one-third of german adults are smokers , of which 140,000 die annually from their habit .
in addition , more than 3,000 non-smoker deaths a year are attributed to the effects of passive inhalation . article based on news reports -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we support this resolution and the rejuvenation of peace talks , " the ambassador said .
" sudan will be a partner in this process and we 're taken onboard . "

" we welcome the united nations security council 's unanimous passing of resolution 1769 , reaffirming the international commitment to a lasting political solution and sustained security in darfur , " us state department deputy spokesman tom casey said .
" we call on the government of sudan and all rebel groups to immediately cease hostilities in darfur and pursue a political settlement ­ under un and au leadership that results in a sustainable peace in sudan . "
predominantly african peace force sudan and the 15-nation council agreed that the joint operation , a so-called hybrid force , will have " a predominantly african character and the troops should , as far as possible , be sourced from african countries , " the adopted resolution said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zalmay khalilzad us ambassador zalmay khalilzad warned the sudanese government that any attempts to block the deployment will result in the us taking unilateral or multilateral sanctions against it .
" all eyes are on sudan and we look to the government to do the right thing and pursue the path of peace , " khalilzad said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 01.08.2007 eu calls on russia , belarus to solve gas dispute großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not the first time russia has threatened to turn off gas supplies to its neighbors the european commission on wednesday urged russia and belarus to seek an amicable solution to their latest dispute over energy supplies , which could also affect gas deliveries to western europe . the russian gas monopoly gazprom said it would reduce gas supplies to its neighbor by 45 percent beginning on friday due to outstanding belarusian debt after a doubling of gas prices had caused minsk to fall $ 456 million -lrb- 333 million euros -rrb- behind on its payments in recent months .
" we take this development very seriously , " eu commission spokesman martin selmayr told reporters wednesday .
minsk and moscow should resolve their dispute without delay and create conditions for the timely resumption of deliveries , he said .
if needed the commission could convene a meeting of a european union " gas coordination group " to study implications the row could have on energy supplies to the 27-nation bloc , selmayr said .
subsidized prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin -lrb- right -rrb- and belarus leader alexander lukashenko have been drifting apart about one fifth of russian gas exports to europe transit belarus , but western customers had been told about the planned reduction of supplies , according to gazprom .
gazprom has accused the belarus gas company beltransgas of having paid for about half of its imports of russian natural gas in the first half of 2007 .
russia and belarus previously clashed over energy supplies at the beginning of 2007 .
while a complete stoppage of gas supplies to belarus was avoided , russia reduced its supplies of oil for several days - a decision that also affected the transit pipeline into the eu .
" gazprom will take all possible measures for the transportation of russian gas through the territory of belarus in full accordance with current obligations to european customers , " the company said in a statement , adding it would pursue legal action against belarus if it siphoned gas out of transit pipelines . alexander burgansky , an analyst at renaissance capital , said belarus was unlikely to start taking gas from transit pipelines . " consumption is seasonally low , and underground storage facilities are full everywhere , " he told reuters .
the cause of the current conflict is moscow 's attempt to raise step by step the strongly subsidized energy prices for belarus to an international level .
estonians against sea pipeline bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many estonians do n't want the pipeline off their shores plans for an alternative gas delivery route from russia to western europe were also dealt a blow on wednesday after an academic report called on the estonian government to not allow a consortium behind a controversial gas pipeline to construct it in estonian waters .
a possible russian military presence and potential harm to the environment should force the government to deny a request from the nord stream consortium to conduct an environmental study in estonian waters , daily postimees reported quoting the study by the country 's academy of sciences .
" neutral states like finland and sweden can allow the presence of the russian armed forces and gazprom armed operatives in their economic zones or territorial waters , but as nato members estonia and poland can not allow that , " the report said .
in april , nord stream asked estonian authorities to measure the depth of the baltic sea in estonian waters to determine if it was possible to shift the pipeline south of the finnish coast .
the authorities turned to scientists for an opinion .
bitter dispute gazprom has stressed its 2005 agreement with german firms eon and basf to lay a 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 745-mile -rrb- gas pipeline , known as nord stream , across the baltic sea from russia to germany , saying it would boost europe 's energy security and cut out the potential for political conflict with transit countries .
former german chancellor gerhard schröder is the chairman of nord stream 's shareholders ' committee .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since in was first proposed in 2005 .
many of the states bordering the baltic have argued that it could disturb stores of chemical weapons dumped in the sea after world war ii .
so far more than 20,000 people , mostly from the baltic states , have signed a petition to stop the construction of the pipeline .
if completed , the pipeline would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de peacekeeping -pipe- 01.08.2007 opinion : un peace mission in sudan - a timid compromise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un officials may hail the sudan peacekeeping mission as " historic , " but the watered-down resolution adopted by the security council wo n't stop the genocide for at least another year , says dw 's stefanie duckstein . the indecision , the pondering and the struggle to reach an agreement has been costly .
some 200,000 people have lost their lives and more than 2 million became refugees as a result of the genocide that 's been taking place in the crisis region of darfur in western sudan .
countless attempts were needed in the un security council to - finally - adopt a resolution that 's been described as " historic " by un secretary-general ban ki-moon .
a peacekeeping force of 26,000 soldiers is now meant to put an end to the darfur genocide .
it 's a mission that completely overwhelms the underfinanced and badly equipped african union troops that are currently stationed there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie duckstein but despite the " historic " praise by the highest body of world diplomacy , the resolution can only be called a timid attempt as it is a compromise .
it 's an agreement with concessions that all 15 members of the un security council managed to unanimously agree on .
britain and france cleared the way for a watered-down draft that no longer talks about continuing attacks of sudanese government troops and janjaweed militia .
it 's also a compromise because the peacekeeping forces will not be able to confiscate illegal weapons .
the existing arms embargo against sudan is weak and is circumvented by countries such as china and russia .
the resolution also stops short of far-reaching sanctions against the african state .
security council veto power china had opposed the enforcement of sanctions .
the chinese government called them " unfair and untimely " and had repeatedly prevented a resolution by abstaining from the vote .
again and again , human rights organizations have presented evidence of genocide and the sudanese government 's responsibility - without success .
while the tragedy continues in its fourth year in darfur , the timid implementation of a un peacekeeping mission is hard to understand .
more than 50 previous declarations were necessary that expressed " collective concerns , " " continuing grave concerns , " or " great fear . "
this was cynical diplomatic terminology while women , children and elderly were dying in misery at the same time .
even sudan 's un ambassador , abdalmahmood abdalhaleem mohamad , seems happy with the agreement that has been reached .
last week , the country 's president , omar al-bashir , had shrugged off the genocide as propaganda by western media after visiting the crisis region for three days .
al-bashir so far has prevented every attempt to station a hybrid force of un and african union soldiers - despite showing signs of cooperation from time to time .
that 's why the un resolution has to be seen as nothing more than a signal of western diplomacy for the time being .
it does not represent an end to genocide .
people are still killed on a daily basis , thousands fell from the crisis region to neighboring chad and the central african republic and still are not protected from attacks by the janjaweed militia .
experts think that it will take a year until the biggest un mission ever is ready .
fearfully it 's a year during which masses of people will continue to die .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de peacekeeping -pipe- 01.08.2007 opinion : un peace mission in sudan - a timid compromise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un officials may hail the sudan peacekeeping mission as " historic , " but the watered-down resolution adopted by the security council wo n't stop the genocide for at least another year , says dw 's stefanie duckstein . the indecision , the pondering and the struggle to reach an agreement has been costly .
some 200,000 people have lost their lives and more than 2 million became refugees as a result of the genocide that 's been taking place in the crisis region of darfur in western sudan .
countless attempts were needed in the un security council to - finally - adopt a resolution that 's been described as " historic " by un secretary-general ban ki-moon .
a peacekeeping force of 26,000 soldiers is now meant to put an end to the darfur genocide .
it 's a mission that completely overwhelms the underfinanced and badly equipped african union troops that are currently stationed there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie duckstein but despite the " historic " praise by the highest body of world diplomacy , the resolution can only be called a timid attempt as it is a compromise .
it 's an agreement with concessions that all 15 members of the un security council managed to unanimously agree on .
britain and france cleared the way for a watered-down draft that no longer talks about continuing attacks of sudanese government troops and janjaweed militia .
it 's also a compromise because the peacekeeping forces will not be able to confiscate illegal weapons .
the existing arms embargo against sudan is weak and is circumvented by countries such as china and russia .
the resolution also stops short of far-reaching sanctions against the african state .
security council veto power china had opposed the enforcement of sanctions .
the chinese government called them " unfair and untimely " and had repeatedly prevented a resolution by abstaining from the vote .
again and again , human rights organizations have presented evidence of genocide and the sudanese government 's responsibility - without success .
while the tragedy continues in its fourth year in darfur , the timid implementation of a un peacekeeping mission is hard to understand .
more than 50 previous declarations were necessary that expressed " collective concerns , " " continuing grave concerns , " or " great fear . "
this was cynical diplomatic terminology while women , children and elderly were dying in misery at the same time .
even sudan 's un ambassador , abdalmahmood abdalhaleem mohamad , seems happy with the agreement that has been reached .
last week , the country 's president , omar al-bashir , had shrugged off the genocide as propaganda by western media after visiting the crisis region for three days .
al-bashir so far has prevented every attempt to station a hybrid force of un and african union soldiers - despite showing signs of cooperation from time to time .
that 's why the un resolution has to be seen as nothing more than a signal of western diplomacy for the time being .
it does not represent an end to genocide .
people are still killed on a daily basis , thousands fell from the crisis region to neighboring chad and the central african republic and still are not protected from attacks by the janjaweed militia .
experts think that it will take a year until the biggest un mission ever is ready .
fearfully it 's a year during which masses of people will continue to die .

some 200,000 people have lost their lives and more than 2 million became refugees as a result of the genocide that 's been taking place in the crisis region of darfur in western sudan .
countless attempts were needed in the un security council to - finally - adopt a resolution that 's been described as " historic " by un secretary-general ban ki-moon .
a peacekeeping force of 26,000 soldiers is now meant to put an end to the darfur genocide .
it 's a mission that completely overwhelms the underfinanced and badly equipped african union troops that are currently stationed there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie duckstein but despite the " historic " praise by the highest body of world diplomacy , the resolution can only be called a timid attempt as it is a compromise .
it 's an agreement with concessions that all 15 members of the un security council managed to unanimously agree on .
britain and france cleared the way for a watered-down draft that no longer talks about continuing attacks of sudanese government troops and janjaweed militia .
it 's also a compromise because the peacekeeping forces will not be able to confiscate illegal weapons .
the existing arms embargo against sudan is weak and is circumvented by countries such as china and russia .
the resolution also stops short of far-reaching sanctions against the african state .
security council veto power china had opposed the enforcement of sanctions .
the chinese government called them " unfair and untimely " and had repeatedly prevented a resolution by abstaining from the vote .
again and again , human rights organizations have presented evidence of genocide and the sudanese government 's responsibility - without success .
while the tragedy continues in its fourth year in darfur , the timid implementation of a un peacekeeping mission is hard to understand .
more than 50 previous declarations were necessary that expressed " collective concerns , " " continuing grave concerns , " or " great fear . "
this was cynical diplomatic terminology while women , children and elderly were dying in misery at the same time .
even sudan 's un ambassador , abdalmahmood abdalhaleem mohamad , seems happy with the agreement that has been reached .
last week , the country 's president , omar al-bashir , had shrugged off the genocide as propaganda by western media after visiting the crisis region for three days .
al-bashir so far has prevented every attempt to station a hybrid force of un and african union soldiers - despite showing signs of cooperation from time to time .
that 's why the un resolution has to be seen as nothing more than a signal of western diplomacy for the time being .
it does not represent an end to genocide .
people are still killed on a daily basis , thousands fell from the crisis region to neighboring chad and the central african republic and still are not protected from attacks by the janjaweed militia .
experts think that it will take a year until the biggest un mission ever is ready .
fearfully it 's a year during which masses of people will continue to die .

in germany , the regional states decide where to light up , resulting in patchwork laws .
now three states have taken the no-smoking initiative . most of germany 's 16 regional states plan to implement smoking bans by january next year , but anti-smoking laws already went into effect in three states on aug .
1 . starting in september , smoking will also be banned in federal buildings and on all modes of public transport as well as taxis , trains and airports . in baden-württemberg , lower saxony and mecklenburg-west pomerania , smoking is now prohibited in all local government buildings , hospitals , schools and other institutions for children and youth . in the first two states , where hanover , heidelberg and stuttgart are located , smoking will still be permitted in restaurants and bars , but only in designated areas , whereas in the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , the anti-smoking laws will take effect in gastronomical establishments starting jan .
1 . the states of hesse , rhineland-palatinate and saxony - where frankfurt , mainz and dresden are located - want to enforce anti-smoking rules before the end of the year . patchwork laws in different states restaurant and bar owners in lower saxony , who are responsible for enforcing the ban , will be subject to checks by the local police as of november , so even though the rule takes effect now , there will be no penalties for violating the law until then .
afterwards offenders could face fines of up to 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,365 -rrb- , and in mecklenburg-western pomerania the fine could be as much as 10,000 euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking rules in discos vary , depending on region rules in discotheques also vary . the southwestern state baden-württemberg will impose a comprehensive ban , whereas discos in the northern state lower saxony will permit smoking in a sealed off area .
critics of the patchwork laws in the various states say that unlike other european countries , such as france , italy and britain , the lack of a comprehensive ban throughout germany , sends the wrong signal .
although berlin has tried to introduce anti-smoking laws nationwide , it could only enforce the rules in federal buildings , since germany 's constitution gives its states considerable latitude in such matters .
in march , the federal government agreed on a framework with the 16 states on anti-smoking rules in public buildings , but each state would have to ratify its own laws .
critics in favor of comprehensive smoking bans lothar binding , a social democratic parliamentarian , told the berlin daily newspaper tageszeitung , " health protection should n't be restricted to only a few states .
a non-smoker in stuttgart has the same right to clean air as one in rostock , " he added . furthermore , in baden-württemberg , it is up to individual schools to decide whether those teenagers who are no longer minors may smoke in sealed-off areas on school premises .
" health protection should not be age-related , " said binding , who campaigned for a comprehensive ban in the german parliament last year . others applauded the state initiatives .
" it is a hopeful start that states where the smoking issue has been a smoking gun have become models for other states , " said martina pötschke-langer , head of heidelberg 's german cancer research institute -lrb- dkfz -rrb- in an interview with the associated press . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " health protection should not be aged related " owners favor laws according to a survey by the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , most barkeepers and restaurant owners favor the new laws .

statistics from the german health ministry show that one-third of german adults are smokers , of which 140,000 die annually from their habit .

some 200,000 people have lost their lives and more than 2 million became refugees as a result of the genocide that 's been taking place in the crisis region of darfur in western sudan .
countless attempts were needed in the un security council to - finally - adopt a resolution that 's been described as " historic " by un secretary-general ban ki-moon .
a peacekeeping force of 26,000 soldiers is now meant to put an end to the darfur genocide .
it 's a mission that completely overwhelms the underfinanced and badly equipped african union troops that are currently stationed there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie duckstein but despite the " historic " praise by the highest body of world diplomacy , the resolution can only be called a timid attempt as it is a compromise .
it 's an agreement with concessions that all 15 members of the un security council managed to unanimously agree on .
britain and france cleared the way for a watered-down draft that no longer talks about continuing attacks of sudanese government troops and janjaweed militia .
it 's also a compromise because the peacekeeping forces will not be able to confiscate illegal weapons .
the existing arms embargo against sudan is weak and is circumvented by countries such as china and russia .
the resolution also stops short of far-reaching sanctions against the african state .
security council veto power china had opposed the enforcement of sanctions .
the chinese government called them " unfair and untimely " and had repeatedly prevented a resolution by abstaining from the vote .
again and again , human rights organizations have presented evidence of genocide and the sudanese government 's responsibility - without success .
while the tragedy continues in its fourth year in darfur , the timid implementation of a un peacekeeping mission is hard to understand .
more than 50 previous declarations were necessary that expressed " collective concerns , " " continuing grave concerns , " or " great fear . "
this was cynical diplomatic terminology while women , children and elderly were dying in misery at the same time .
even sudan 's un ambassador , abdalmahmood abdalhaleem mohamad , seems happy with the agreement that has been reached .
last week , the country 's president , omar al-bashir , had shrugged off the genocide as propaganda by western media after visiting the crisis region for three days .
al-bashir so far has prevented every attempt to station a hybrid force of un and african union soldiers - despite showing signs of cooperation from time to time .
that 's why the un resolution has to be seen as nothing more than a signal of western diplomacy for the time being .
it does not represent an end to genocide .
people are still killed on a daily basis , thousands fell from the crisis region to neighboring chad and the central african republic and still are not protected from attacks by the janjaweed militia .
experts think that it will take a year until the biggest un mission ever is ready .
fearfully it 's a year during which masses of people will continue to die .

" we take this development very seriously , " eu commission spokesman martin selmayr told reporters wednesday .
minsk and moscow should resolve their dispute without delay and create conditions for the timely resumption of deliveries , he said .
if needed the commission could convene a meeting of a european union " gas coordination group " to study implications the row could have on energy supplies to the 27-nation bloc , selmayr said .
subsidized prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin -lrb- right -rrb- and belarus leader alexander lukashenko have been drifting apart about one fifth of russian gas exports to europe transit belarus , but western customers had been told about the planned reduction of supplies , according to gazprom .
gazprom has accused the belarus gas company beltransgas of having paid for about half of its imports of russian natural gas in the first half of 2007 .
russia and belarus previously clashed over energy supplies at the beginning of 2007 .
while a complete stoppage of gas supplies to belarus was avoided , russia reduced its supplies of oil for several days - a decision that also affected the transit pipeline into the eu .
" gazprom will take all possible measures for the transportation of russian gas through the territory of belarus in full accordance with current obligations to european customers , " the company said in a statement , adding it would pursue legal action against belarus if it siphoned gas out of transit pipelines . alexander burgansky , an analyst at renaissance capital , said belarus was unlikely to start taking gas from transit pipelines . " consumption is seasonally low , and underground storage facilities are full everywhere , " he told reuters .
the cause of the current conflict is moscow 's attempt to raise step by step the strongly subsidized energy prices for belarus to an international level .
estonians against sea pipeline bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many estonians do n't want the pipeline off their shores plans for an alternative gas delivery route from russia to western europe were also dealt a blow on wednesday after an academic report called on the estonian government to not allow a consortium behind a controversial gas pipeline to construct it in estonian waters .
a possible russian military presence and potential harm to the environment should force the government to deny a request from the nord stream consortium to conduct an environmental study in estonian waters , daily postimees reported quoting the study by the country 's academy of sciences .
" neutral states like finland and sweden can allow the presence of the russian armed forces and gazprom armed operatives in their economic zones or territorial waters , but as nato members estonia and poland can not allow that , " the report said .
in april , nord stream asked estonian authorities to measure the depth of the baltic sea in estonian waters to determine if it was possible to shift the pipeline south of the finnish coast .
the authorities turned to scientists for an opinion .
bitter dispute gazprom has stressed its 2005 agreement with german firms eon and basf to lay a 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 745-mile -rrb- gas pipeline , known as nord stream , across the baltic sea from russia to germany , saying it would boost europe 's energy security and cut out the potential for political conflict with transit countries .
former german chancellor gerhard schröder is the chairman of nord stream 's shareholders ' committee .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since in was first proposed in 2005 .
many of the states bordering the baltic have argued that it could disturb stores of chemical weapons dumped in the sea after world war ii .
so far more than 20,000 people , mostly from the baltic states , have signed a petition to stop the construction of the pipeline .
if completed , the pipeline would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de peacekeeping -pipe- 01.08.2007 opinion : un peace mission in sudan - a timid compromise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un officials may hail the sudan peacekeeping mission as " historic , " but the watered-down resolution adopted by the security council wo n't stop the genocide for at least another year , says dw 's stefanie duckstein . the indecision , the pondering and the struggle to reach an agreement has been costly .
some 200,000 people have lost their lives and more than 2 million became refugees as a result of the genocide that 's been taking place in the crisis region of darfur in western sudan .
countless attempts were needed in the un security council to - finally - adopt a resolution that 's been described as " historic " by un secretary-general ban ki-moon .
a peacekeeping force of 26,000 soldiers is now meant to put an end to the darfur genocide .
it 's a mission that completely overwhelms the underfinanced and badly equipped african union troops that are currently stationed there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie duckstein but despite the " historic " praise by the highest body of world diplomacy , the resolution can only be called a timid attempt as it is a compromise .
it 's an agreement with concessions that all 15 members of the un security council managed to unanimously agree on .
britain and france cleared the way for a watered-down draft that no longer talks about continuing attacks of sudanese government troops and janjaweed militia .
it 's also a compromise because the peacekeeping forces will not be able to confiscate illegal weapons .
the existing arms embargo against sudan is weak and is circumvented by countries such as china and russia .
the resolution also stops short of far-reaching sanctions against the african state .
security council veto power china had opposed the enforcement of sanctions .
the chinese government called them " unfair and untimely " and had repeatedly prevented a resolution by abstaining from the vote .
again and again , human rights organizations have presented evidence of genocide and the sudanese government 's responsibility - without success .
while the tragedy continues in its fourth year in darfur , the timid implementation of a un peacekeeping mission is hard to understand .
more than 50 previous declarations were necessary that expressed " collective concerns , " " continuing grave concerns , " or " great fear . "
this was cynical diplomatic terminology while women , children and elderly were dying in misery at the same time .
even sudan 's un ambassador , abdalmahmood abdalhaleem mohamad , seems happy with the agreement that has been reached .
last week , the country 's president , omar al-bashir , had shrugged off the genocide as propaganda by western media after visiting the crisis region for three days .
al-bashir so far has prevented every attempt to station a hybrid force of un and african union soldiers - despite showing signs of cooperation from time to time .
that 's why the un resolution has to be seen as nothing more than a signal of western diplomacy for the time being .
it does not represent an end to genocide .
people are still killed on a daily basis , thousands fell from the crisis region to neighboring chad and the central african republic and still are not protected from attacks by the janjaweed militia .
experts think that it will take a year until the biggest un mission ever is ready .
fearfully it 's a year during which masses of people will continue to die .

some 200,000 people have lost their lives and more than 2 million became refugees as a result of the genocide that 's been taking place in the crisis region of darfur in western sudan .
countless attempts were needed in the un security council to - finally - adopt a resolution that 's been described as " historic " by un secretary-general ban ki-moon .
a peacekeeping force of 26,000 soldiers is now meant to put an end to the darfur genocide .
it 's a mission that completely overwhelms the underfinanced and badly equipped african union troops that are currently stationed there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie duckstein but despite the " historic " praise by the highest body of world diplomacy , the resolution can only be called a timid attempt as it is a compromise .
it 's an agreement with concessions that all 15 members of the un security council managed to unanimously agree on .
britain and france cleared the way for a watered-down draft that no longer talks about continuing attacks of sudanese government troops and janjaweed militia .
it 's also a compromise because the peacekeeping forces will not be able to confiscate illegal weapons .
the existing arms embargo against sudan is weak and is circumvented by countries such as china and russia .
the resolution also stops short of far-reaching sanctions against the african state .
security council veto power china had opposed the enforcement of sanctions .
the chinese government called them " unfair and untimely " and had repeatedly prevented a resolution by abstaining from the vote .
again and again , human rights organizations have presented evidence of genocide and the sudanese government 's responsibility - without success .
while the tragedy continues in its fourth year in darfur , the timid implementation of a un peacekeeping mission is hard to understand .
more than 50 previous declarations were necessary that expressed " collective concerns , " " continuing grave concerns , " or " great fear . "
this was cynical diplomatic terminology while women , children and elderly were dying in misery at the same time .
even sudan 's un ambassador , abdalmahmood abdalhaleem mohamad , seems happy with the agreement that has been reached .
last week , the country 's president , omar al-bashir , had shrugged off the genocide as propaganda by western media after visiting the crisis region for three days .
al-bashir so far has prevented every attempt to station a hybrid force of un and african union soldiers - despite showing signs of cooperation from time to time .
that 's why the un resolution has to be seen as nothing more than a signal of western diplomacy for the time being .
it does not represent an end to genocide .
people are still killed on a daily basis , thousands fell from the crisis region to neighboring chad and the central african republic and still are not protected from attacks by the janjaweed militia .
experts think that it will take a year until the biggest un mission ever is ready .
fearfully it 's a year during which masses of people will continue to die .

" we take this development very seriously , " eu commission spokesman martin selmayr told reporters wednesday .
minsk and moscow should resolve their dispute without delay and create conditions for the timely resumption of deliveries , he said .
if needed the commission could convene a meeting of a european union " gas coordination group " to study implications the row could have on energy supplies to the 27-nation bloc , selmayr said .
subsidized prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin -lrb- right -rrb- and belarus leader alexander lukashenko have been drifting apart about one fifth of russian gas exports to europe transit belarus , but western customers had been told about the planned reduction of supplies , according to gazprom .
gazprom has accused the belarus gas company beltransgas of having paid for about half of its imports of russian natural gas in the first half of 2007 .
russia and belarus previously clashed over energy supplies at the beginning of 2007 .
while a complete stoppage of gas supplies to belarus was avoided , russia reduced its supplies of oil for several days - a decision that also affected the transit pipeline into the eu .
" gazprom will take all possible measures for the transportation of russian gas through the territory of belarus in full accordance with current obligations to european customers , " the company said in a statement , adding it would pursue legal action against belarus if it siphoned gas out of transit pipelines . alexander burgansky , an analyst at renaissance capital , said belarus was unlikely to start taking gas from transit pipelines . " consumption is seasonally low , and underground storage facilities are full everywhere , " he told reuters .
the cause of the current conflict is moscow 's attempt to raise step by step the strongly subsidized energy prices for belarus to an international level .
estonians against sea pipeline bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many estonians do n't want the pipeline off their shores plans for an alternative gas delivery route from russia to western europe were also dealt a blow on wednesday after an academic report called on the estonian government to not allow a consortium behind a controversial gas pipeline to construct it in estonian waters .
a possible russian military presence and potential harm to the environment should force the government to deny a request from the nord stream consortium to conduct an environmental study in estonian waters , daily postimees reported quoting the study by the country 's academy of sciences .
" neutral states like finland and sweden can allow the presence of the russian armed forces and gazprom armed operatives in their economic zones or territorial waters , but as nato members estonia and poland can not allow that , " the report said .
in april , nord stream asked estonian authorities to measure the depth of the baltic sea in estonian waters to determine if it was possible to shift the pipeline south of the finnish coast .
the authorities turned to scientists for an opinion .
bitter dispute gazprom has stressed its 2005 agreement with german firms eon and basf to lay a 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 745-mile -rrb- gas pipeline , known as nord stream , across the baltic sea from russia to germany , saying it would boost europe 's energy security and cut out the potential for political conflict with transit countries .
former german chancellor gerhard schröder is the chairman of nord stream 's shareholders ' committee .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since in was first proposed in 2005 .
many of the states bordering the baltic have argued that it could disturb stores of chemical weapons dumped in the sea after world war ii .
so far more than 20,000 people , mostly from the baltic states , have signed a petition to stop the construction of the pipeline .
if completed , the pipeline would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 01.08.2007 first smoking bans take effect in german states großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lighting up will only be permitted in designated areas other european countries have enforced nationwide bans against smoking .
in germany , the regional states decide where to light up , resulting in patchwork laws .
now three states have taken the no-smoking initiative . most of germany 's 16 regional states plan to implement smoking bans by january next year , but anti-smoking laws already went into effect in three states on aug .
1 . starting in september , smoking will also be banned in federal buildings and on all modes of public transport as well as taxis , trains and airports . in baden-württemberg , lower saxony and mecklenburg-west pomerania , smoking is now prohibited in all local government buildings , hospitals , schools and other institutions for children and youth . in the first two states , where hanover , heidelberg and stuttgart are located , smoking will still be permitted in restaurants and bars , but only in designated areas , whereas in the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , the anti-smoking laws will take effect in gastronomical establishments starting jan .
1 . the states of hesse , rhineland-palatinate and saxony - where frankfurt , mainz and dresden are located - want to enforce anti-smoking rules before the end of the year . patchwork laws in different states restaurant and bar owners in lower saxony , who are responsible for enforcing the ban , will be subject to checks by the local police as of november , so even though the rule takes effect now , there will be no penalties for violating the law until then .
afterwards offenders could face fines of up to 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,365 -rrb- , and in mecklenburg-western pomerania the fine could be as much as 10,000 euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking rules in discos vary , depending on region rules in discotheques also vary . the southwestern state baden-württemberg will impose a comprehensive ban , whereas discos in the northern state lower saxony will permit smoking in a sealed off area .
critics of the patchwork laws in the various states say that unlike other european countries , such as france , italy and britain , the lack of a comprehensive ban throughout germany , sends the wrong signal .
although berlin has tried to introduce anti-smoking laws nationwide , it could only enforce the rules in federal buildings , since germany 's constitution gives its states considerable latitude in such matters .
in march , the federal government agreed on a framework with the 16 states on anti-smoking rules in public buildings , but each state would have to ratify its own laws .
critics in favor of comprehensive smoking bans lothar binding , a social democratic parliamentarian , told the berlin daily newspaper tageszeitung , " health protection should n't be restricted to only a few states .
a non-smoker in stuttgart has the same right to clean air as one in rostock , " he added . furthermore , in baden-württemberg , it is up to individual schools to decide whether those teenagers who are no longer minors may smoke in sealed-off areas on school premises .
" health protection should not be age-related , " said binding , who campaigned for a comprehensive ban in the german parliament last year . others applauded the state initiatives .
" it is a hopeful start that states where the smoking issue has been a smoking gun have become models for other states , " said martina pötschke-langer , head of heidelberg 's german cancer research institute -lrb- dkfz -rrb- in an interview with the associated press . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " health protection should not be aged related " owners favor laws according to a survey by the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , most barkeepers and restaurant owners favor the new laws .
in the past two years , the number of restaurants , bars and inns with specially designated areas has nearly doubled , reflecting changing public attitudes . those in favor of voluntary restrictions comprise only 20 percent of proprietors and only 10 percent of those surveyed are against the introduction of any non-smoker protection laws at all . a slight majority of germans have also approved smoking bans and restrictions , according to a forsa survey .
statistics from the german health ministry show that one-third of german adults are smokers , of which 140,000 die annually from their habit .
in addition , more than 3,000 non-smoker deaths a year are attributed to the effects of passive inhalation . article based on news reports -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we support this resolution and the rejuvenation of peace talks , " the ambassador said .
" sudan will be a partner in this process and we 're taken onboard . "
the force , once fully deployed , would be the largest-ever un peacekeeping operation .

" no more german troops germany , however , will not be contributing ground troops to the un-mandated force , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on wednesday . " essentially , africans want to take on this difficult task themselves , " steinmeier said while in he nigerian capital abuja on a visit to west africa .
" that is a positive development . " the german military currently has some 75 observers in southern sudan and can deploy up to 200 soldiers for the logistical support of the au mission in darfur if necessary . both german chancellor angela merkel and steinmeier have in the past rejected a participation of german ground forces in a peacekeeping mission in sudan , referring to the large number of foreign missions currently underway . new peace talks a new round of peace talks is scheduled to begin this weekend in tanzania .

" we welcome the united nations security council 's unanimous passing of resolution 1769 , reaffirming the international commitment to a lasting political solution and sustained security in darfur , " us state department deputy spokesman tom casey said .
" we call on the government of sudan and all rebel groups to immediately cease hostilities in darfur and pursue a political settlement ­ under un and au leadership that results in a sustainable peace in sudan . "
predominantly african peace force sudan and the 15-nation council agreed that the joint operation , a so-called hybrid force , will have " a predominantly african character and the troops should , as far as possible , be sourced from african countries , " the adopted resolution said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zalmay khalilzad us ambassador zalmay khalilzad warned the sudanese government that any attempts to block the deployment will result in the us taking unilateral or multilateral sanctions against it .
" all eyes are on sudan and we look to the government to do the right thing and pursue the path of peace , " khalilzad said .
the peacekeeping headquarters should be in place in darfur before the end of the year , with preparations for setting up the command and control structure to start as early as october .
the force will have 20,000 un and african union troops and up to 4,000 police personnel .

germany said wednesday that it will continue to stay out of business with the african nation . france has agreed to sell libya anti-tank missiles as part of the military agreement reached last week by french president nicolas sarkozy and libyan leader moammar gadhafi . " we are going to buy rocket-propelled grenades of the milan type worth around 100 million euros in france , " gadhafi 's son saif al-islam gaddafi was quoted as saying in an interview published in thursday 's french daily le monde .
" there 's also a project for a weapons factory . " a shoulder-mounted anti-tank weapon , the milan is built by a subsidiary of europe 's joint eads defense and aerospace company . the deal is part of a defense memorandum of understanding for a nuclear energy agreed to by sarkozy when he visited tripoli last week , after helping to free foreign medics imprisoned in libya . the french government has denied a direct link between the two countries ' military cooperation and the release of the bulgarian medics .
when asked what france offered in exchange for the six medics ' release sarkozy answered , " nothing . " first deal after arms embargo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six bulgarian medics held in libya for over eight years were set free last week the 35-year-old islam said it was the first arms supply from a western country , and added that he anticipated more deals to be made with other nations soon . since the arms embargo ended in 2004 there had been an unofficial embargo against his country , he said , pointing out that germany had been especially reserved in dealings with the country while other european nations have proven more willing to negotiate , islam said . though careful to avoid criticizing paris directly for the details of its deal with with tripoli , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he wished france had better communicated its intentions with other eu members . " i would have certainly wished that france had informed and gotten its european partners on board with the offer to libya , " he told the thursday 's handelsblatt newspaper .
" i think the french side now sees that it could have better chosen the order . " german politicians , including steinmeier 's deputy , have recently criticized the french deal with libya and recommended that german companies continue not to do business with the african state . uk extradition rumored bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a libyan convicted for having a role in the lockerbie bombing could be extradited negotiations over a possible extradition of libyan secret service agent ali al-magrahi , who was sentenced to life imprisonment over the 1998 lockerbie attack and is serving time in a prison near glasgow , also played an important role , gaddafi told the french paper . " there will soon be an extradition agreement with britain , " he said . that 's a statement the british government has denied . " there is no link between mr. megrahi and the release of the bulgarian and palestinian medics , " a spokesman told afp news agency , adding that there is no extradition agreement between britain and the north african country . the spokesman did , however , add that , " the uk and libyan government are looking into a wide range of areas pertaining to judicial cooperation .

germany said wednesday that it will continue to stay out of business with the african nation . france has agreed to sell libya anti-tank missiles as part of the military agreement reached last week by french president nicolas sarkozy and libyan leader moammar gadhafi . " we are going to buy rocket-propelled grenades of the milan type worth around 100 million euros in france , " gadhafi 's son saif al-islam gaddafi was quoted as saying in an interview published in thursday 's french daily le monde .
" there 's also a project for a weapons factory . " a shoulder-mounted anti-tank weapon , the milan is built by a subsidiary of europe 's joint eads defense and aerospace company . the deal is part of a defense memorandum of understanding for a nuclear energy agreed to by sarkozy when he visited tripoli last week , after helping to free foreign medics imprisoned in libya . the french government has denied a direct link between the two countries ' military cooperation and the release of the bulgarian medics .
when asked what france offered in exchange for the six medics ' release sarkozy answered , " nothing . " first deal after arms embargo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six bulgarian medics held in libya for over eight years were set free last week the 35-year-old islam said it was the first arms supply from a western country , and added that he anticipated more deals to be made with other nations soon . since the arms embargo ended in 2004 there had been an unofficial embargo against his country , he said , pointing out that germany had been especially reserved in dealings with the country while other european nations have proven more willing to negotiate , islam said . though careful to avoid criticizing paris directly for the details of its deal with with tripoli , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he wished france had better communicated its intentions with other eu members . " i would have certainly wished that france had informed and gotten its european partners on board with the offer to libya , " he told the thursday 's handelsblatt newspaper .
" i think the french side now sees that it could have better chosen the order . " german politicians , including steinmeier 's deputy , have recently criticized the french deal with libya and recommended that german companies continue not to do business with the african state . uk extradition rumored bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a libyan convicted for having a role in the lockerbie bombing could be extradited negotiations over a possible extradition of libyan secret service agent ali al-magrahi , who was sentenced to life imprisonment over the 1998 lockerbie attack and is serving time in a prison near glasgow , also played an important role , gaddafi told the french paper . " there will soon be an extradition agreement with britain , " he said . that 's a statement the british government has denied . " there is no link between mr. megrahi and the release of the bulgarian and palestinian medics , " a spokesman told afp news agency , adding that there is no extradition agreement between britain and the north african country . the spokesman did , however , add that , " the uk and libyan government are looking into a wide range of areas pertaining to judicial cooperation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de peacekeeping -pipe- 01.08.2007 opinion : un peace mission in sudan - a timid compromise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un officials may hail the sudan peacekeeping mission as " historic , " but the watered-down resolution adopted by the security council wo n't stop the genocide for at least another year , says dw 's stefanie duckstein . the indecision , the pondering and the struggle to reach an agreement has been costly .
some 200,000 people have lost their lives and more than 2 million became refugees as a result of the genocide that 's been taking place in the crisis region of darfur in western sudan .
countless attempts were needed in the un security council to - finally - adopt a resolution that 's been described as " historic " by un secretary-general ban ki-moon .
a peacekeeping force of 26,000 soldiers is now meant to put an end to the darfur genocide .
it 's a mission that completely overwhelms the underfinanced and badly equipped african union troops that are currently stationed there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie duckstein but despite the " historic " praise by the highest body of world diplomacy , the resolution can only be called a timid attempt as it is a compromise .
it 's an agreement with concessions that all 15 members of the un security council managed to unanimously agree on .
britain and france cleared the way for a watered-down draft that no longer talks about continuing attacks of sudanese government troops and janjaweed militia .
it 's also a compromise because the peacekeeping forces will not be able to confiscate illegal weapons .
the existing arms embargo against sudan is weak and is circumvented by countries such as china and russia .
the resolution also stops short of far-reaching sanctions against the african state .
security council veto power china had opposed the enforcement of sanctions .
the chinese government called them " unfair and untimely " and had repeatedly prevented a resolution by abstaining from the vote .
again and again , human rights organizations have presented evidence of genocide and the sudanese government 's responsibility - without success .
while the tragedy continues in its fourth year in darfur , the timid implementation of a un peacekeeping mission is hard to understand .
more than 50 previous declarations were necessary that expressed " collective concerns , " " continuing grave concerns , " or " great fear . "
this was cynical diplomatic terminology while women , children and elderly were dying in misery at the same time .
even sudan 's un ambassador , abdalmahmood abdalhaleem mohamad , seems happy with the agreement that has been reached .
last week , the country 's president , omar al-bashir , had shrugged off the genocide as propaganda by western media after visiting the crisis region for three days .
al-bashir so far has prevented every attempt to station a hybrid force of un and african union soldiers - despite showing signs of cooperation from time to time .
that 's why the un resolution has to be seen as nothing more than a signal of western diplomacy for the time being .
it does not represent an end to genocide .
people are still killed on a daily basis , thousands fell from the crisis region to neighboring chad and the central african republic and still are not protected from attacks by the janjaweed militia .
experts think that it will take a year until the biggest un mission ever is ready .
fearfully it 's a year during which masses of people will continue to die .

in germany , the regional states decide where to light up , resulting in patchwork laws .
now three states have taken the no-smoking initiative . most of germany 's 16 regional states plan to implement smoking bans by january next year , but anti-smoking laws already went into effect in three states on aug .
1 . starting in september , smoking will also be banned in federal buildings and on all modes of public transport as well as taxis , trains and airports . in baden-württemberg , lower saxony and mecklenburg-west pomerania , smoking is now prohibited in all local government buildings , hospitals , schools and other institutions for children and youth . in the first two states , where hanover , heidelberg and stuttgart are located , smoking will still be permitted in restaurants and bars , but only in designated areas , whereas in the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , the anti-smoking laws will take effect in gastronomical establishments starting jan .
1 . the states of hesse , rhineland-palatinate and saxony - where frankfurt , mainz and dresden are located - want to enforce anti-smoking rules before the end of the year . patchwork laws in different states restaurant and bar owners in lower saxony , who are responsible for enforcing the ban , will be subject to checks by the local police as of november , so even though the rule takes effect now , there will be no penalties for violating the law until then .
afterwards offenders could face fines of up to 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,365 -rrb- , and in mecklenburg-western pomerania the fine could be as much as 10,000 euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking rules in discos vary , depending on region rules in discotheques also vary . the southwestern state baden-württemberg will impose a comprehensive ban , whereas discos in the northern state lower saxony will permit smoking in a sealed off area .
critics of the patchwork laws in the various states say that unlike other european countries , such as france , italy and britain , the lack of a comprehensive ban throughout germany , sends the wrong signal .
although berlin has tried to introduce anti-smoking laws nationwide , it could only enforce the rules in federal buildings , since germany 's constitution gives its states considerable latitude in such matters .
in march , the federal government agreed on a framework with the 16 states on anti-smoking rules in public buildings , but each state would have to ratify its own laws .
critics in favor of comprehensive smoking bans lothar binding , a social democratic parliamentarian , told the berlin daily newspaper tageszeitung , " health protection should n't be restricted to only a few states .
a non-smoker in stuttgart has the same right to clean air as one in rostock , " he added . furthermore , in baden-württemberg , it is up to individual schools to decide whether those teenagers who are no longer minors may smoke in sealed-off areas on school premises .
" health protection should not be age-related , " said binding , who campaigned for a comprehensive ban in the german parliament last year . others applauded the state initiatives .
" it is a hopeful start that states where the smoking issue has been a smoking gun have become models for other states , " said martina pötschke-langer , head of heidelberg 's german cancer research institute -lrb- dkfz -rrb- in an interview with the associated press . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " health protection should not be aged related " owners favor laws according to a survey by the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , most barkeepers and restaurant owners favor the new laws .
in the past two years , the number of restaurants , bars and inns with specially designated areas has nearly doubled , reflecting changing public attitudes . those in favor of voluntary restrictions comprise only 20 percent of proprietors and only 10 percent of those surveyed are against the introduction of any non-smoker protection laws at all . a slight majority of germans have also approved smoking bans and restrictions , according to a forsa survey .
statistics from the german health ministry show that one-third of german adults are smokers , of which 140,000 die annually from their habit .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de peacekeeping -pipe- 01.08.2007 opinion : un peace mission in sudan - a timid compromise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un officials may hail the sudan peacekeeping mission as " historic , " but the watered-down resolution adopted by the security council wo n't stop the genocide for at least another year , says dw 's stefanie duckstein . the indecision , the pondering and the struggle to reach an agreement has been costly .
some 200,000 people have lost their lives and more than 2 million became refugees as a result of the genocide that 's been taking place in the crisis region of darfur in western sudan .
countless attempts were needed in the un security council to - finally - adopt a resolution that 's been described as " historic " by un secretary-general ban ki-moon .
a peacekeeping force of 26,000 soldiers is now meant to put an end to the darfur genocide .
it 's a mission that completely overwhelms the underfinanced and badly equipped african union troops that are currently stationed there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie duckstein but despite the " historic " praise by the highest body of world diplomacy , the resolution can only be called a timid attempt as it is a compromise .
it 's an agreement with concessions that all 15 members of the un security council managed to unanimously agree on .
britain and france cleared the way for a watered-down draft that no longer talks about continuing attacks of sudanese government troops and janjaweed militia .
it 's also a compromise because the peacekeeping forces will not be able to confiscate illegal weapons .
the existing arms embargo against sudan is weak and is circumvented by countries such as china and russia .
the resolution also stops short of far-reaching sanctions against the african state .
security council veto power china had opposed the enforcement of sanctions .
the chinese government called them " unfair and untimely " and had repeatedly prevented a resolution by abstaining from the vote .
again and again , human rights organizations have presented evidence of genocide and the sudanese government 's responsibility - without success .
while the tragedy continues in its fourth year in darfur , the timid implementation of a un peacekeeping mission is hard to understand .
more than 50 previous declarations were necessary that expressed " collective concerns , " " continuing grave concerns , " or " great fear . "
this was cynical diplomatic terminology while women , children and elderly were dying in misery at the same time .
even sudan 's un ambassador , abdalmahmood abdalhaleem mohamad , seems happy with the agreement that has been reached .
last week , the country 's president , omar al-bashir , had shrugged off the genocide as propaganda by western media after visiting the crisis region for three days .
al-bashir so far has prevented every attempt to station a hybrid force of un and african union soldiers - despite showing signs of cooperation from time to time .
that 's why the un resolution has to be seen as nothing more than a signal of western diplomacy for the time being .
it does not represent an end to genocide .
people are still killed on a daily basis , thousands fell from the crisis region to neighboring chad and the central african republic and still are not protected from attacks by the janjaweed militia .
experts think that it will take a year until the biggest un mission ever is ready .
fearfully it 's a year during which masses of people will continue to die .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de peacekeeping -pipe- 01.08.2007 opinion : un peace mission in sudan - a timid compromise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un officials may hail the sudan peacekeeping mission as " historic , " but the watered-down resolution adopted by the security council wo n't stop the genocide for at least another year , says dw 's stefanie duckstein . the indecision , the pondering and the struggle to reach an agreement has been costly .
some 200,000 people have lost their lives and more than 2 million became refugees as a result of the genocide that 's been taking place in the crisis region of darfur in western sudan .
countless attempts were needed in the un security council to - finally - adopt a resolution that 's been described as " historic " by un secretary-general ban ki-moon .
a peacekeeping force of 26,000 soldiers is now meant to put an end to the darfur genocide .
it 's a mission that completely overwhelms the underfinanced and badly equipped african union troops that are currently stationed there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie duckstein but despite the " historic " praise by the highest body of world diplomacy , the resolution can only be called a timid attempt as it is a compromise .
it 's an agreement with concessions that all 15 members of the un security council managed to unanimously agree on .
britain and france cleared the way for a watered-down draft that no longer talks about continuing attacks of sudanese government troops and janjaweed militia .
it 's also a compromise because the peacekeeping forces will not be able to confiscate illegal weapons .
the existing arms embargo against sudan is weak and is circumvented by countries such as china and russia .
the resolution also stops short of far-reaching sanctions against the african state .
security council veto power china had opposed the enforcement of sanctions .
the chinese government called them " unfair and untimely " and had repeatedly prevented a resolution by abstaining from the vote .
again and again , human rights organizations have presented evidence of genocide and the sudanese government 's responsibility - without success .
while the tragedy continues in its fourth year in darfur , the timid implementation of a un peacekeeping mission is hard to understand .
more than 50 previous declarations were necessary that expressed " collective concerns , " " continuing grave concerns , " or " great fear . "
this was cynical diplomatic terminology while women , children and elderly were dying in misery at the same time .
even sudan 's un ambassador , abdalmahmood abdalhaleem mohamad , seems happy with the agreement that has been reached .
last week , the country 's president , omar al-bashir , had shrugged off the genocide as propaganda by western media after visiting the crisis region for three days .
al-bashir so far has prevented every attempt to station a hybrid force of un and african union soldiers - despite showing signs of cooperation from time to time .
that 's why the un resolution has to be seen as nothing more than a signal of western diplomacy for the time being .
it does not represent an end to genocide .
people are still killed on a daily basis , thousands fell from the crisis region to neighboring chad and the central african republic and still are not protected from attacks by the janjaweed militia .
experts think that it will take a year until the biggest un mission ever is ready .
fearfully it 's a year during which masses of people will continue to die .

being a child star can take its toll .
few are the pint-sized performers who reach adulthood unscarred .
more common are the youthful tales of substance abuse , eating disorders and therapy , like those now faced by knut . it seems the public has an endless appetite for tales of glory gone sour .
now , the latest celebrity to fall prey to this taste for schadenfreude is knut , the irresistibly cuddly polar bear cub that was born in the berlin zoo just eight months ago . at the time , no one could have predicted the adorable ball of white fluff would soon be vying for headlines - and therapy clinic time - with drew , lindsay , britney & co .
but perhaps they should have seen it coming . tough at the top so what caused " cute knut 's " inevitable downfall among berlin 's animal adoring public ?
pills ?
booze ?
scientology ? bildunterschrift : ' cute knut ' back when he was , well , cuter think again : earlier this week , the zoo announced that knut - an irresistible , cuddly , and extremely photogenic ball of white fluff whose every development has been avidly documented -lrb- some say exploited -rrb- , since he was introduced to the world in december - is being put on a diet . it seems the bear has been packing on the pounds - an unsightly development for a celebrity , even of the ursine persuasion .
now , knut 's four daily meals are being cut down to three . call it the south pole diet . survival reserves , or unsightly love handles ? " if knut lived outdoors this would n't be so bad - he would simply build up his fat reserves for winter , " zoo veterinarian andreas ochs told news services on tuesday .
but in captivity , ochs said , the extra weight is unnecessary . knut currently is fed a baby-bear diet of porridge , milk , meat , cod liver oil , and supplements , but he will soon graduate to grown-up bear food : fish and solid meat . " extras like croissants will need to be dropped , " ochs said , adding french pastries to the list of foods no one previously knew were fed to zoo animals . bonaduce , take note bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zenith of fame : a vanity fair cover while the bear 's fall from grace may not be on as big a scale as some - after all , knut is no danny bonaduce - his story can still serve as a cautionary tale about the pitfalls of fame and greed . one day you 're on the cover of vanity fair , the next its weight watchers magazine . how did this all come about ?
as knut 's long-haired keeper - himself a much-photographed celebrity of sorts since he introduced his protegee to the world - told the berliner zeitung newspaper that the bear 's dietary dilemma results from a common problem . " knut likes to nibble between meals , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 01.08.2007 eu calls on russia , belarus to solve gas dispute großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not the first time russia has threatened to turn off gas supplies to its neighbors the european commission on wednesday urged russia and belarus to seek an amicable solution to their latest dispute over energy supplies , which could also affect gas deliveries to western europe . the russian gas monopoly gazprom said it would reduce gas supplies to its neighbor by 45 percent beginning on friday due to outstanding belarusian debt after a doubling of gas prices had caused minsk to fall $ 456 million -lrb- 333 million euros -rrb- behind on its payments in recent months .
" we take this development very seriously , " eu commission spokesman martin selmayr told reporters wednesday .
minsk and moscow should resolve their dispute without delay and create conditions for the timely resumption of deliveries , he said .
if needed the commission could convene a meeting of a european union " gas coordination group " to study implications the row could have on energy supplies to the 27-nation bloc , selmayr said .
subsidized prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin -lrb- right -rrb- and belarus leader alexander lukashenko have been drifting apart about one fifth of russian gas exports to europe transit belarus , but western customers had been told about the planned reduction of supplies , according to gazprom .
gazprom has accused the belarus gas company beltransgas of having paid for about half of its imports of russian natural gas in the first half of 2007 .

former german chancellor gerhard schröder is the chairman of nord stream 's shareholders ' committee .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since in was first proposed in 2005 .
many of the states bordering the baltic have argued that it could disturb stores of chemical weapons dumped in the sea after world war ii .
so far more than 20,000 people , mostly from the baltic states , have signed a petition to stop the construction of the pipeline .
if completed , the pipeline would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de art -pipe- 01.08.2007 germany posts list of looted nazi art on internet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the painting is part of an collection of art stolen by the nazis over 60 years ago a new web page run by germany 's finance ministry attempts to find the proper owners of looted nazi art by documenting photos and descriptions of paintings and other pieces of art confiscated during the third reich . an online catalog of some 100 art objects looted by the nazis was posted online by the federal office for central services and unresolved property issues -lrb- badv -rrb- on wednesday .
the list includes a dozen early renaissance portraits and biblical scenes by lucas cranach the elder , best known for his oil renditions of martin luther , as well as an oil-on-canvas rubens portrait from the 1600s of the archbishop antonio trieste of ghent . the agency , which is a division of the finance ministry and has branches throughout germany , was established last year to handle claims not only for looted art , antique furniture and other cultural artifacts , but also the restitution of real estate and property seized by the nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biblical themes are common in works by lucas cranach the elder according to the badv 's harald könig , the body of case-law dealing with restitution issues and compensation for assets confiscated by the nazis is still growing more than 60 years after the end of the war . although most legal claims were settled in the post-war years in the former west germany , the origins of much of the art unearthed in the eastern states after the reunification in 1990 , has only recently begun being documented and returned to the original owners . mostly oil paintings on list of looted art so far the provenance of 36 objects out of nearly 600 that have been thoroughly documented have been or are in the process of being returned to holocaust survivors or their descendents , said könig . returning the art to its proper owners is nearly always a long legal process that can take years , or even decades , for owners to prove the art belongs to them . the looted listed on the badv 's web page consists mainly of oil paintings , but also italian , english and german antiques replete with detailed descriptions , historical references and a black and white photo .
most of the art has been loaned out to museums throughout germany , including several works that had been originally intended for hitler 's museum in linz , austria . the nazis looted about 650,000 artworks in all according to estimates by the jewish claims conference , of which only a fraction have been returned in spite of highly publicized restitution efforts since the mid-1990s .

the list includes a dozen early renaissance portraits and biblical scenes by lucas cranach the elder , best known for his oil renditions of martin luther , as well as an oil-on-canvas rubens portrait from the 1600s of the archbishop antonio trieste of ghent . the agency , which is a division of the finance ministry and has branches throughout germany , was established last year to handle claims not only for looted art , antique furniture and other cultural artifacts , but also the restitution of real estate and property seized by the nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biblical themes are common in works by lucas cranach the elder according to the badv 's harald könig , the body of case-law dealing with restitution issues and compensation for assets confiscated by the nazis is still growing more than 60 years after the end of the war . although most legal claims were settled in the post-war years in the former west germany , the origins of much of the art unearthed in the eastern states after the reunification in 1990 , has only recently begun being documented and returned to the original owners . mostly oil paintings on list of looted art so far the provenance of 36 objects out of nearly 600 that have been thoroughly documented have been or are in the process of being returned to holocaust survivors or their descendents , said könig . returning the art to its proper owners is nearly always a long legal process that can take years , or even decades , for owners to prove the art belongs to them . the looted listed on the badv 's web page consists mainly of oil paintings , but also italian , english and german antiques replete with detailed descriptions , historical references and a black and white photo .
most of the art has been loaned out to museums throughout germany , including several works that had been originally intended for hitler 's museum in linz , austria . the nazis looted about 650,000 artworks in all according to estimates by the jewish claims conference , of which only a fraction have been returned in spite of highly publicized restitution efforts since the mid-1990s .
one of the main reasons for the meager returns was the difficulty involved in adequately documenting the provenance of art assets . list needs to be in english for target audience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : descendents of holocaust survivors no longer speak german " it 's marvelous that such information is now being posted by the badv , " said anne webber , who is co-chair of the non-profit london-based commission for looted art in europe , though she added that the comprehensive list compiled by the agency would benefit from being translated into english . only last month , the national fund of the republic of austria for victims of national socialism , which published its comprehensive database of stolen nazi art in german last december , provided an english page as well . " such sites need to be accessible to their target audiences worldwide , " webber said .
" the rightful owners are not likely to live in german speaking countries , nor speak german anymore . " although parts of badv 's web page are available in english , the detailed list of paintings and artworks are not .
" we ’ ll translate the page if the demand is there , " said könig . diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany said wednesday that it will continue to stay out of business with the african nation . france has agreed to sell libya anti-tank missiles as part of the military agreement reached last week by french president nicolas sarkozy and libyan leader moammar gadhafi . " we are going to buy rocket-propelled grenades of the milan type worth around 100 million euros in france , " gadhafi 's son saif al-islam gaddafi was quoted as saying in an interview published in thursday 's french daily le monde .
" there 's also a project for a weapons factory . " a shoulder-mounted anti-tank weapon , the milan is built by a subsidiary of europe 's joint eads defense and aerospace company . the deal is part of a defense memorandum of understanding for a nuclear energy agreed to by sarkozy when he visited tripoli last week , after helping to free foreign medics imprisoned in libya . the french government has denied a direct link between the two countries ' military cooperation and the release of the bulgarian medics .
when asked what france offered in exchange for the six medics ' release sarkozy answered , " nothing . " first deal after arms embargo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six bulgarian medics held in libya for over eight years were set free last week the 35-year-old islam said it was the first arms supply from a western country , and added that he anticipated more deals to be made with other nations soon . since the arms embargo ended in 2004 there had been an unofficial embargo against his country , he said , pointing out that germany had been especially reserved in dealings with the country while other european nations have proven more willing to negotiate , islam said . though careful to avoid criticizing paris directly for the details of its deal with with tripoli , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he wished france had better communicated its intentions with other eu members . " i would have certainly wished that france had informed and gotten its european partners on board with the offer to libya , " he told the thursday 's handelsblatt newspaper .
" i think the french side now sees that it could have better chosen the order . " german politicians , including steinmeier 's deputy , have recently criticized the french deal with libya and recommended that german companies continue not to do business with the african state . uk extradition rumored bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a libyan convicted for having a role in the lockerbie bombing could be extradited negotiations over a possible extradition of libyan secret service agent ali al-magrahi , who was sentenced to life imprisonment over the 1998 lockerbie attack and is serving time in a prison near glasgow , also played an important role , gaddafi told the french paper . " there will soon be an extradition agreement with britain , " he said . that 's a statement the british government has denied . " there is no link between mr. megrahi and the release of the bulgarian and palestinian medics , " a spokesman told afp news agency , adding that there is no extradition agreement between britain and the north african country . the spokesman did , however , add that , " the uk and libyan government are looking into a wide range of areas pertaining to judicial cooperation .

is it time to send the 50-year-old financial institution into retirement ? for decades , germany 's central bank was a national icon that stood as guarantor for a strong currency and the country 's postwar economic miracle .
with the advent of the euro , however , it started sinking into insignificance .
" not all germans believe in god , but they all believe in the bundesbank , " said european union head jacques delors back in 1992 .
things changed a decade later with the introduction of the common european currency .
at that time , the bundesbank lost its prime function of setting interest rates to the european central bank -lrb- ecb -rrb- .
an important role ?

" we need a strong bundesbank as an integral part of the euro system , " he said .
weber represents europe 's biggest economy in the ecb 's 19-member rate-setting council , where germany has the same clout as much smaller nations like slovenia or luxembourg .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 01.08.2007 eu calls on russia , belarus to solve gas dispute großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not the first time russia has threatened to turn off gas supplies to its neighbors the european commission on wednesday urged russia and belarus to seek an amicable solution to their latest dispute over energy supplies , which could also affect gas deliveries to western europe . the russian gas monopoly gazprom said it would reduce gas supplies to its neighbor by 45 percent beginning on friday due to outstanding belarusian debt after a doubling of gas prices had caused minsk to fall $ 456 million -lrb- 333 million euros -rrb- behind on its payments in recent months .
" we take this development very seriously , " eu commission spokesman martin selmayr told reporters wednesday .
minsk and moscow should resolve their dispute without delay and create conditions for the timely resumption of deliveries , he said .
if needed the commission could convene a meeting of a european union " gas coordination group " to study implications the row could have on energy supplies to the 27-nation bloc , selmayr said .
subsidized prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin -lrb- right -rrb- and belarus leader alexander lukashenko have been drifting apart about one fifth of russian gas exports to europe transit belarus , but western customers had been told about the planned reduction of supplies , according to gazprom .
gazprom has accused the belarus gas company beltransgas of having paid for about half of its imports of russian natural gas in the first half of 2007 .
russia and belarus previously clashed over energy supplies at the beginning of 2007 .
while a complete stoppage of gas supplies to belarus was avoided , russia reduced its supplies of oil for several days - a decision that also affected the transit pipeline into the eu .
" gazprom will take all possible measures for the transportation of russian gas through the territory of belarus in full accordance with current obligations to european customers , " the company said in a statement , adding it would pursue legal action against belarus if it siphoned gas out of transit pipelines . alexander burgansky , an analyst at renaissance capital , said belarus was unlikely to start taking gas from transit pipelines . " consumption is seasonally low , and underground storage facilities are full everywhere , " he told reuters .
the cause of the current conflict is moscow 's attempt to raise step by step the strongly subsidized energy prices for belarus to an international level .
estonians against sea pipeline bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many estonians do n't want the pipeline off their shores plans for an alternative gas delivery route from russia to western europe were also dealt a blow on wednesday after an academic report called on the estonian government to not allow a consortium behind a controversial gas pipeline to construct it in estonian waters .
a possible russian military presence and potential harm to the environment should force the government to deny a request from the nord stream consortium to conduct an environmental study in estonian waters , daily postimees reported quoting the study by the country 's academy of sciences .
" neutral states like finland and sweden can allow the presence of the russian armed forces and gazprom armed operatives in their economic zones or territorial waters , but as nato members estonia and poland can not allow that , " the report said .
in april , nord stream asked estonian authorities to measure the depth of the baltic sea in estonian waters to determine if it was possible to shift the pipeline south of the finnish coast .
the authorities turned to scientists for an opinion .
bitter dispute gazprom has stressed its 2005 agreement with german firms eon and basf to lay a 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 745-mile -rrb- gas pipeline , known as nord stream , across the baltic sea from russia to germany , saying it would boost europe 's energy security and cut out the potential for political conflict with transit countries .
former german chancellor gerhard schröder is the chairman of nord stream 's shareholders ' committee .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since in was first proposed in 2005 .
many of the states bordering the baltic have argued that it could disturb stores of chemical weapons dumped in the sea after world war ii .
so far more than 20,000 people , mostly from the baltic states , have signed a petition to stop the construction of the pipeline .
if completed , the pipeline would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but perhaps they should have seen it coming . tough at the top so what caused " cute knut 's " inevitable downfall among berlin 's animal adoring public ?

scientology ? bildunterschrift : ' cute knut ' back when he was , well , cuter think again : earlier this week , the zoo announced that knut - an irresistible , cuddly , and extremely photogenic ball of white fluff whose every development has been avidly documented -lrb- some say exploited -rrb- , since he was introduced to the world in december - is being put on a diet . it seems the bear has been packing on the pounds - an unsightly development for a celebrity , even of the ursine persuasion .
now , knut 's four daily meals are being cut down to three . call it the south pole diet . survival reserves , or unsightly love handles ? " if knut lived outdoors this would n't be so bad - he would simply build up his fat reserves for winter , " zoo veterinarian andreas ochs told news services on tuesday .
but in captivity , ochs said , the extra weight is unnecessary . knut currently is fed a baby-bear diet of porridge , milk , meat , cod liver oil , and supplements , but he will soon graduate to grown-up bear food : fish and solid meat . " extras like croissants will need to be dropped , " ochs said , adding french pastries to the list of foods no one previously knew were fed to zoo animals . bonaduce , take note bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zenith of fame : a vanity fair cover while the bear 's fall from grace may not be on as big a scale as some - after all , knut is no danny bonaduce - his story can still serve as a cautionary tale about the pitfalls of fame and greed . one day you 're on the cover of vanity fair , the next its weight watchers magazine . how did this all come about ?
as knut 's long-haired keeper - himself a much-photographed celebrity of sorts since he introduced his protegee to the world - told the berliner zeitung newspaper that the bear 's dietary dilemma results from a common problem . " knut likes to nibble between meals , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 01.08.2007 eu calls on russia , belarus to solve gas dispute großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not the first time russia has threatened to turn off gas supplies to its neighbors the european commission on wednesday urged russia and belarus to seek an amicable solution to their latest dispute over energy supplies , which could also affect gas deliveries to western europe . the russian gas monopoly gazprom said it would reduce gas supplies to its neighbor by 45 percent beginning on friday due to outstanding belarusian debt after a doubling of gas prices had caused minsk to fall $ 456 million -lrb- 333 million euros -rrb- behind on its payments in recent months .
" we take this development very seriously , " eu commission spokesman martin selmayr told reporters wednesday .
minsk and moscow should resolve their dispute without delay and create conditions for the timely resumption of deliveries , he said .
if needed the commission could convene a meeting of a european union " gas coordination group " to study implications the row could have on energy supplies to the 27-nation bloc , selmayr said .
subsidized prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin -lrb- right -rrb- and belarus leader alexander lukashenko have been drifting apart about one fifth of russian gas exports to europe transit belarus , but western customers had been told about the planned reduction of supplies , according to gazprom .
gazprom has accused the belarus gas company beltransgas of having paid for about half of its imports of russian natural gas in the first half of 2007 .
russia and belarus previously clashed over energy supplies at the beginning of 2007 .
while a complete stoppage of gas supplies to belarus was avoided , russia reduced its supplies of oil for several days - a decision that also affected the transit pipeline into the eu .
" gazprom will take all possible measures for the transportation of russian gas through the territory of belarus in full accordance with current obligations to european customers , " the company said in a statement , adding it would pursue legal action against belarus if it siphoned gas out of transit pipelines . alexander burgansky , an analyst at renaissance capital , said belarus was unlikely to start taking gas from transit pipelines . " consumption is seasonally low , and underground storage facilities are full everywhere , " he told reuters .
the cause of the current conflict is moscow 's attempt to raise step by step the strongly subsidized energy prices for belarus to an international level .
estonians against sea pipeline bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many estonians do n't want the pipeline off their shores plans for an alternative gas delivery route from russia to western europe were also dealt a blow on wednesday after an academic report called on the estonian government to not allow a consortium behind a controversial gas pipeline to construct it in estonian waters .
a possible russian military presence and potential harm to the environment should force the government to deny a request from the nord stream consortium to conduct an environmental study in estonian waters , daily postimees reported quoting the study by the country 's academy of sciences .
" neutral states like finland and sweden can allow the presence of the russian armed forces and gazprom armed operatives in their economic zones or territorial waters , but as nato members estonia and poland can not allow that , " the report said .
in april , nord stream asked estonian authorities to measure the depth of the baltic sea in estonian waters to determine if it was possible to shift the pipeline south of the finnish coast .
the authorities turned to scientists for an opinion .
bitter dispute gazprom has stressed its 2005 agreement with german firms eon and basf to lay a 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 745-mile -rrb- gas pipeline , known as nord stream , across the baltic sea from russia to germany , saying it would boost europe 's energy security and cut out the potential for political conflict with transit countries .
former german chancellor gerhard schröder is the chairman of nord stream 's shareholders ' committee .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since in was first proposed in 2005 .
many of the states bordering the baltic have argued that it could disturb stores of chemical weapons dumped in the sea after world war ii .
so far more than 20,000 people , mostly from the baltic states , have signed a petition to stop the construction of the pipeline .
if completed , the pipeline would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we support this resolution and the rejuvenation of peace talks , " the ambassador said .

" we call on the government of sudan and all rebel groups to immediately cease hostilities in darfur and pursue a political settlement ­ under un and au leadership that results in a sustainable peace in sudan . "
predominantly african peace force sudan and the 15-nation council agreed that the joint operation , a so-called hybrid force , will have " a predominantly african character and the troops should , as far as possible , be sourced from african countries , " the adopted resolution said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zalmay khalilzad us ambassador zalmay khalilzad warned the sudanese government that any attempts to block the deployment will result in the us taking unilateral or multilateral sanctions against it .
" all eyes are on sudan and we look to the government to do the right thing and pursue the path of peace , " khalilzad said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 01.08.2007 eu calls on russia , belarus to solve gas dispute großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not the first time russia has threatened to turn off gas supplies to its neighbors the european commission on wednesday urged russia and belarus to seek an amicable solution to their latest dispute over energy supplies , which could also affect gas deliveries to western europe . the russian gas monopoly gazprom said it would reduce gas supplies to its neighbor by 45 percent beginning on friday due to outstanding belarusian debt after a doubling of gas prices had caused minsk to fall $ 456 million -lrb- 333 million euros -rrb- behind on its payments in recent months .
" we take this development very seriously , " eu commission spokesman martin selmayr told reporters wednesday .
minsk and moscow should resolve their dispute without delay and create conditions for the timely resumption of deliveries , he said .
if needed the commission could convene a meeting of a european union " gas coordination group " to study implications the row could have on energy supplies to the 27-nation bloc , selmayr said .
subsidized prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin -lrb- right -rrb- and belarus leader alexander lukashenko have been drifting apart about one fifth of russian gas exports to europe transit belarus , but western customers had been told about the planned reduction of supplies , according to gazprom .
gazprom has accused the belarus gas company beltransgas of having paid for about half of its imports of russian natural gas in the first half of 2007 .
russia and belarus previously clashed over energy supplies at the beginning of 2007 .
while a complete stoppage of gas supplies to belarus was avoided , russia reduced its supplies of oil for several days - a decision that also affected the transit pipeline into the eu .
" gazprom will take all possible measures for the transportation of russian gas through the territory of belarus in full accordance with current obligations to european customers , " the company said in a statement , adding it would pursue legal action against belarus if it siphoned gas out of transit pipelines . alexander burgansky , an analyst at renaissance capital , said belarus was unlikely to start taking gas from transit pipelines . " consumption is seasonally low , and underground storage facilities are full everywhere , " he told reuters .
the cause of the current conflict is moscow 's attempt to raise step by step the strongly subsidized energy prices for belarus to an international level .
estonians against sea pipeline bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many estonians do n't want the pipeline off their shores plans for an alternative gas delivery route from russia to western europe were also dealt a blow on wednesday after an academic report called on the estonian government to not allow a consortium behind a controversial gas pipeline to construct it in estonian waters .
a possible russian military presence and potential harm to the environment should force the government to deny a request from the nord stream consortium to conduct an environmental study in estonian waters , daily postimees reported quoting the study by the country 's academy of sciences .
" neutral states like finland and sweden can allow the presence of the russian armed forces and gazprom armed operatives in their economic zones or territorial waters , but as nato members estonia and poland can not allow that , " the report said .
in april , nord stream asked estonian authorities to measure the depth of the baltic sea in estonian waters to determine if it was possible to shift the pipeline south of the finnish coast .
the authorities turned to scientists for an opinion .
bitter dispute gazprom has stressed its 2005 agreement with german firms eon and basf to lay a 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 745-mile -rrb- gas pipeline , known as nord stream , across the baltic sea from russia to germany , saying it would boost europe 's energy security and cut out the potential for political conflict with transit countries .
former german chancellor gerhard schröder is the chairman of nord stream 's shareholders ' committee .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since in was first proposed in 2005 .
many of the states bordering the baltic have argued that it could disturb stores of chemical weapons dumped in the sea after world war ii .
so far more than 20,000 people , mostly from the baltic states , have signed a petition to stop the construction of the pipeline .
if completed , the pipeline would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de peacekeeping -pipe- 01.08.2007 opinion : un peace mission in sudan - a timid compromise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un officials may hail the sudan peacekeeping mission as " historic , " but the watered-down resolution adopted by the security council wo n't stop the genocide for at least another year , says dw 's stefanie duckstein . the indecision , the pondering and the struggle to reach an agreement has been costly .
some 200,000 people have lost their lives and more than 2 million became refugees as a result of the genocide that 's been taking place in the crisis region of darfur in western sudan .
countless attempts were needed in the un security council to - finally - adopt a resolution that 's been described as " historic " by un secretary-general ban ki-moon .
a peacekeeping force of 26,000 soldiers is now meant to put an end to the darfur genocide .
it 's a mission that completely overwhelms the underfinanced and badly equipped african union troops that are currently stationed there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie duckstein but despite the " historic " praise by the highest body of world diplomacy , the resolution can only be called a timid attempt as it is a compromise .
it 's an agreement with concessions that all 15 members of the un security council managed to unanimously agree on .
britain and france cleared the way for a watered-down draft that no longer talks about continuing attacks of sudanese government troops and janjaweed militia .
it 's also a compromise because the peacekeeping forces will not be able to confiscate illegal weapons .
the existing arms embargo against sudan is weak and is circumvented by countries such as china and russia .
the resolution also stops short of far-reaching sanctions against the african state .
security council veto power china had opposed the enforcement of sanctions .
the chinese government called them " unfair and untimely " and had repeatedly prevented a resolution by abstaining from the vote .
again and again , human rights organizations have presented evidence of genocide and the sudanese government 's responsibility - without success .
while the tragedy continues in its fourth year in darfur , the timid implementation of a un peacekeeping mission is hard to understand .
more than 50 previous declarations were necessary that expressed " collective concerns , " " continuing grave concerns , " or " great fear . "
this was cynical diplomatic terminology while women , children and elderly were dying in misery at the same time .
even sudan 's un ambassador , abdalmahmood abdalhaleem mohamad , seems happy with the agreement that has been reached .
last week , the country 's president , omar al-bashir , had shrugged off the genocide as propaganda by western media after visiting the crisis region for three days .
al-bashir so far has prevented every attempt to station a hybrid force of un and african union soldiers - despite showing signs of cooperation from time to time .
that 's why the un resolution has to be seen as nothing more than a signal of western diplomacy for the time being .
it does not represent an end to genocide .
people are still killed on a daily basis , thousands fell from the crisis region to neighboring chad and the central african republic and still are not protected from attacks by the janjaweed militia .
experts think that it will take a year until the biggest un mission ever is ready .
fearfully it 's a year during which masses of people will continue to die .

some 200,000 people have lost their lives and more than 2 million became refugees as a result of the genocide that 's been taking place in the crisis region of darfur in western sudan .
countless attempts were needed in the un security council to - finally - adopt a resolution that 's been described as " historic " by un secretary-general ban ki-moon .
a peacekeeping force of 26,000 soldiers is now meant to put an end to the darfur genocide .
it 's a mission that completely overwhelms the underfinanced and badly equipped african union troops that are currently stationed there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie duckstein but despite the " historic " praise by the highest body of world diplomacy , the resolution can only be called a timid attempt as it is a compromise .
it 's an agreement with concessions that all 15 members of the un security council managed to unanimously agree on .
britain and france cleared the way for a watered-down draft that no longer talks about continuing attacks of sudanese government troops and janjaweed militia .
it 's also a compromise because the peacekeeping forces will not be able to confiscate illegal weapons .
the existing arms embargo against sudan is weak and is circumvented by countries such as china and russia .
the resolution also stops short of far-reaching sanctions against the african state .
security council veto power china had opposed the enforcement of sanctions .
the chinese government called them " unfair and untimely " and had repeatedly prevented a resolution by abstaining from the vote .
again and again , human rights organizations have presented evidence of genocide and the sudanese government 's responsibility - without success .
while the tragedy continues in its fourth year in darfur , the timid implementation of a un peacekeeping mission is hard to understand .
more than 50 previous declarations were necessary that expressed " collective concerns , " " continuing grave concerns , " or " great fear . "
this was cynical diplomatic terminology while women , children and elderly were dying in misery at the same time .
even sudan 's un ambassador , abdalmahmood abdalhaleem mohamad , seems happy with the agreement that has been reached .
last week , the country 's president , omar al-bashir , had shrugged off the genocide as propaganda by western media after visiting the crisis region for three days .
al-bashir so far has prevented every attempt to station a hybrid force of un and african union soldiers - despite showing signs of cooperation from time to time .
that 's why the un resolution has to be seen as nothing more than a signal of western diplomacy for the time being .
it does not represent an end to genocide .
people are still killed on a daily basis , thousands fell from the crisis region to neighboring chad and the central african republic and still are not protected from attacks by the janjaweed militia .
experts think that it will take a year until the biggest un mission ever is ready .
fearfully it 's a year during which masses of people will continue to die .

germany said it will not contribute additional soldiers . sudan 's un ambassador abdalmahmood abdalhaleem mohamad told dpa news service that his government endorses the deployment , which came in the form of a resolution adopted in a 15-0 vote by the council on tuesday .
" we support this resolution and the rejuvenation of peace talks , " the ambassador said .
" sudan will be a partner in this process and we 're taken onboard . "
the force , once fully deployed , would be the largest-ever un peacekeeping operation .
" historic and unprecedented " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands have died as a result of the conflict un secretary general ban ki-moon called the force 's approval an " historic and unprecedented " decision to end the conflict , in which more than 300,000 people have been killed and some 2 million displaced since 2003 .
britain and france , both permanent security council members who were very much involved in reaching an agreement , also welcomed the adoption of the resolution .
" we must ensure that a large , robust , effective and coherent -lsb- hybrid -rsb- force deploys to darfur in the coming months , to protect civilians , to prevent armed attacks , from any quarter , to give hope and security to the people of darfur , " britain 's outgoing un ambassador emyr jones parry told reporters .
in paris , french foreign minister bernard kouchner said that the resolution " brings very great hope for darfur " and added : " it is now up to us to make good on that hope . " no more german troops germany , however , will not be contributing ground troops to the un-mandated force , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on wednesday . " essentially , africans want to take on this difficult task themselves , " steinmeier said while in he nigerian capital abuja on a visit to west africa .
" that is a positive development . " the german military currently has some 75 observers in southern sudan and can deploy up to 200 soldiers for the logistical support of the au mission in darfur if necessary . both german chancellor angela merkel and steinmeier have in the past rejected a participation of german ground forces in a peacekeeping mission in sudan , referring to the large number of foreign missions currently underway . new peace talks a new round of peace talks is scheduled to begin this weekend in tanzania .
khartoum and african rebels signed a darfur peace agreement in 2005 in arusha , nigeria .
but its terms have not been fully implemented and a ceasefire regularly broken . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an oil field in southern sudan the un has imposed an arms embargo and a travel and diplomatic ban on some sudanese officials for failing to end the darfur killing .
the united states has enacted additional sanctions on oil investments and military operations to pressure the sudanese government to allow the deployment of the force and take steps to end the violence .
" we welcome the united nations security council 's unanimous passing of resolution 1769 , reaffirming the international commitment to a lasting political solution and sustained security in darfur , " us state department deputy spokesman tom casey said .
" we call on the government of sudan and all rebel groups to immediately cease hostilities in darfur and pursue a political settlement ­ under un and au leadership that results in a sustainable peace in sudan . "
predominantly african peace force sudan and the 15-nation council agreed that the joint operation , a so-called hybrid force , will have " a predominantly african character and the troops should , as far as possible , be sourced from african countries , " the adopted resolution said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zalmay khalilzad us ambassador zalmay khalilzad warned the sudanese government that any attempts to block the deployment will result in the us taking unilateral or multilateral sanctions against it .
" all eyes are on sudan and we look to the government to do the right thing and pursue the path of peace , " khalilzad said .
the peacekeeping headquarters should be in place in darfur before the end of the year , with preparations for setting up the command and control structure to start as early as october .
the force will have 20,000 un and african union troops and up to 4,000 police personnel .

germany said it will not contribute additional soldiers . sudan 's un ambassador abdalmahmood abdalhaleem mohamad told dpa news service that his government endorses the deployment , which came in the form of a resolution adopted in a 15-0 vote by the council on tuesday .
" we support this resolution and the rejuvenation of peace talks , " the ambassador said .
" sudan will be a partner in this process and we 're taken onboard . "
the force , once fully deployed , would be the largest-ever un peacekeeping operation .
" historic and unprecedented " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hundreds of thousands have died as a result of the conflict un secretary general ban ki-moon called the force 's approval an " historic and unprecedented " decision to end the conflict , in which more than 300,000 people have been killed and some 2 million displaced since 2003 .
britain and france , both permanent security council members who were very much involved in reaching an agreement , also welcomed the adoption of the resolution .
" we must ensure that a large , robust , effective and coherent -lsb- hybrid -rsb- force deploys to darfur in the coming months , to protect civilians , to prevent armed attacks , from any quarter , to give hope and security to the people of darfur , " britain 's outgoing un ambassador emyr jones parry told reporters .
in paris , french foreign minister bernard kouchner said that the resolution " brings very great hope for darfur " and added : " it is now up to us to make good on that hope . " no more german troops germany , however , will not be contributing ground troops to the un-mandated force , foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said on wednesday . " essentially , africans want to take on this difficult task themselves , " steinmeier said while in he nigerian capital abuja on a visit to west africa .
" that is a positive development . " the german military currently has some 75 observers in southern sudan and can deploy up to 200 soldiers for the logistical support of the au mission in darfur if necessary . both german chancellor angela merkel and steinmeier have in the past rejected a participation of german ground forces in a peacekeeping mission in sudan , referring to the large number of foreign missions currently underway . new peace talks a new round of peace talks is scheduled to begin this weekend in tanzania .
khartoum and african rebels signed a darfur peace agreement in 2005 in arusha , nigeria .
but its terms have not been fully implemented and a ceasefire regularly broken . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an oil field in southern sudan the un has imposed an arms embargo and a travel and diplomatic ban on some sudanese officials for failing to end the darfur killing .
the united states has enacted additional sanctions on oil investments and military operations to pressure the sudanese government to allow the deployment of the force and take steps to end the violence .
" we welcome the united nations security council 's unanimous passing of resolution 1769 , reaffirming the international commitment to a lasting political solution and sustained security in darfur , " us state department deputy spokesman tom casey said .
" we call on the government of sudan and all rebel groups to immediately cease hostilities in darfur and pursue a political settlement ­ under un and au leadership that results in a sustainable peace in sudan . "
predominantly african peace force sudan and the 15-nation council agreed that the joint operation , a so-called hybrid force , will have " a predominantly african character and the troops should , as far as possible , be sourced from african countries , " the adopted resolution said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zalmay khalilzad us ambassador zalmay khalilzad warned the sudanese government that any attempts to block the deployment will result in the us taking unilateral or multilateral sanctions against it .
" all eyes are on sudan and we look to the government to do the right thing and pursue the path of peace , " khalilzad said .
the peacekeeping headquarters should be in place in darfur before the end of the year , with preparations for setting up the command and control structure to start as early as october .
the force will have 20,000 un and african union troops and up to 4,000 police personnel .

in germany , the regional states decide where to light up , resulting in patchwork laws .
now three states have taken the no-smoking initiative . most of germany 's 16 regional states plan to implement smoking bans by january next year , but anti-smoking laws already went into effect in three states on aug .
1 . starting in september , smoking will also be banned in federal buildings and on all modes of public transport as well as taxis , trains and airports . in baden-württemberg , lower saxony and mecklenburg-west pomerania , smoking is now prohibited in all local government buildings , hospitals , schools and other institutions for children and youth . in the first two states , where hanover , heidelberg and stuttgart are located , smoking will still be permitted in restaurants and bars , but only in designated areas , whereas in the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , the anti-smoking laws will take effect in gastronomical establishments starting jan .
1 . the states of hesse , rhineland-palatinate and saxony - where frankfurt , mainz and dresden are located - want to enforce anti-smoking rules before the end of the year . patchwork laws in different states restaurant and bar owners in lower saxony , who are responsible for enforcing the ban , will be subject to checks by the local police as of november , so even though the rule takes effect now , there will be no penalties for violating the law until then .
afterwards offenders could face fines of up to 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,365 -rrb- , and in mecklenburg-western pomerania the fine could be as much as 10,000 euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking rules in discos vary , depending on region rules in discotheques also vary . the southwestern state baden-württemberg will impose a comprehensive ban , whereas discos in the northern state lower saxony will permit smoking in a sealed off area .
critics of the patchwork laws in the various states say that unlike other european countries , such as france , italy and britain , the lack of a comprehensive ban throughout germany , sends the wrong signal .
although berlin has tried to introduce anti-smoking laws nationwide , it could only enforce the rules in federal buildings , since germany 's constitution gives its states considerable latitude in such matters .
in march , the federal government agreed on a framework with the 16 states on anti-smoking rules in public buildings , but each state would have to ratify its own laws .
critics in favor of comprehensive smoking bans lothar binding , a social democratic parliamentarian , told the berlin daily newspaper tageszeitung , " health protection should n't be restricted to only a few states .
a non-smoker in stuttgart has the same right to clean air as one in rostock , " he added . furthermore , in baden-württemberg , it is up to individual schools to decide whether those teenagers who are no longer minors may smoke in sealed-off areas on school premises .
" health protection should not be age-related , " said binding , who campaigned for a comprehensive ban in the german parliament last year . others applauded the state initiatives .
" it is a hopeful start that states where the smoking issue has been a smoking gun have become models for other states , " said martina pötschke-langer , head of heidelberg 's german cancer research institute -lrb- dkfz -rrb- in an interview with the associated press . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " health protection should not be aged related " owners favor laws according to a survey by the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , most barkeepers and restaurant owners favor the new laws .
in the past two years , the number of restaurants , bars and inns with specially designated areas has nearly doubled , reflecting changing public attitudes . those in favor of voluntary restrictions comprise only 20 percent of proprietors and only 10 percent of those surveyed are against the introduction of any non-smoker protection laws at all . a slight majority of germans have also approved smoking bans and restrictions , according to a forsa survey .
statistics from the german health ministry show that one-third of german adults are smokers , of which 140,000 die annually from their habit .
in addition , more than 3,000 non-smoker deaths a year are attributed to the effects of passive inhalation . article based on news reports -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the list includes a dozen early renaissance portraits and biblical scenes by lucas cranach the elder , best known for his oil renditions of martin luther , as well as an oil-on-canvas rubens portrait from the 1600s of the archbishop antonio trieste of ghent . the agency , which is a division of the finance ministry and has branches throughout germany , was established last year to handle claims not only for looted art , antique furniture and other cultural artifacts , but also the restitution of real estate and property seized by the nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biblical themes are common in works by lucas cranach the elder according to the badv 's harald könig , the body of case-law dealing with restitution issues and compensation for assets confiscated by the nazis is still growing more than 60 years after the end of the war . although most legal claims were settled in the post-war years in the former west germany , the origins of much of the art unearthed in the eastern states after the reunification in 1990 , has only recently begun being documented and returned to the original owners . mostly oil paintings on list of looted art so far the provenance of 36 objects out of nearly 600 that have been thoroughly documented have been or are in the process of being returned to holocaust survivors or their descendents , said könig . returning the art to its proper owners is nearly always a long legal process that can take years , or even decades , for owners to prove the art belongs to them . the looted listed on the badv 's web page consists mainly of oil paintings , but also italian , english and german antiques replete with detailed descriptions , historical references and a black and white photo .
most of the art has been loaned out to museums throughout germany , including several works that had been originally intended for hitler 's museum in linz , austria . the nazis looted about 650,000 artworks in all according to estimates by the jewish claims conference , of which only a fraction have been returned in spite of highly publicized restitution efforts since the mid-1990s .
one of the main reasons for the meager returns was the difficulty involved in adequately documenting the provenance of art assets . list needs to be in english for target audience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : descendents of holocaust survivors no longer speak german " it 's marvelous that such information is now being posted by the badv , " said anne webber , who is co-chair of the non-profit london-based commission for looted art in europe , though she added that the comprehensive list compiled by the agency would benefit from being translated into english . only last month , the national fund of the republic of austria for victims of national socialism , which published its comprehensive database of stolen nazi art in german last december , provided an english page as well . " such sites need to be accessible to their target audiences worldwide , " webber said .
" the rightful owners are not likely to live in german speaking countries , nor speak german anymore . " although parts of badv 's web page are available in english , the detailed list of paintings and artworks are not .

in germany , the regional states decide where to light up , resulting in patchwork laws .
now three states have taken the no-smoking initiative . most of germany 's 16 regional states plan to implement smoking bans by january next year , but anti-smoking laws already went into effect in three states on aug .
1 . starting in september , smoking will also be banned in federal buildings and on all modes of public transport as well as taxis , trains and airports . in baden-württemberg , lower saxony and mecklenburg-west pomerania , smoking is now prohibited in all local government buildings , hospitals , schools and other institutions for children and youth . in the first two states , where hanover , heidelberg and stuttgart are located , smoking will still be permitted in restaurants and bars , but only in designated areas , whereas in the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , the anti-smoking laws will take effect in gastronomical establishments starting jan .
1 . the states of hesse , rhineland-palatinate and saxony - where frankfurt , mainz and dresden are located - want to enforce anti-smoking rules before the end of the year . patchwork laws in different states restaurant and bar owners in lower saxony , who are responsible for enforcing the ban , will be subject to checks by the local police as of november , so even though the rule takes effect now , there will be no penalties for violating the law until then .
afterwards offenders could face fines of up to 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,365 -rrb- , and in mecklenburg-western pomerania the fine could be as much as 10,000 euros .

critics of the patchwork laws in the various states say that unlike other european countries , such as france , italy and britain , the lack of a comprehensive ban throughout germany , sends the wrong signal .
although berlin has tried to introduce anti-smoking laws nationwide , it could only enforce the rules in federal buildings , since germany 's constitution gives its states considerable latitude in such matters .
in march , the federal government agreed on a framework with the 16 states on anti-smoking rules in public buildings , but each state would have to ratify its own laws .

" health protection should not be age-related , " said binding , who campaigned for a comprehensive ban in the german parliament last year . others applauded the state initiatives .
" it is a hopeful start that states where the smoking issue has been a smoking gun have become models for other states , " said martina pötschke-langer , head of heidelberg 's german cancer research institute -lrb- dkfz -rrb- in an interview with the associated press . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " health protection should not be aged related " owners favor laws according to a survey by the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , most barkeepers and restaurant owners favor the new laws .

being a child star can take its toll .
few are the pint-sized performers who reach adulthood unscarred .
more common are the youthful tales of substance abuse , eating disorders and therapy , like those now faced by knut . it seems the public has an endless appetite for tales of glory gone sour .
now , the latest celebrity to fall prey to this taste for schadenfreude is knut , the irresistibly cuddly polar bear cub that was born in the berlin zoo just eight months ago . at the time , no one could have predicted the adorable ball of white fluff would soon be vying for headlines - and therapy clinic time - with drew , lindsay , britney & co .
but perhaps they should have seen it coming . tough at the top so what caused " cute knut 's " inevitable downfall among berlin 's animal adoring public ?
pills ?
booze ?
scientology ? bildunterschrift : ' cute knut ' back when he was , well , cuter think again : earlier this week , the zoo announced that knut - an irresistible , cuddly , and extremely photogenic ball of white fluff whose every development has been avidly documented -lrb- some say exploited -rrb- , since he was introduced to the world in december - is being put on a diet . it seems the bear has been packing on the pounds - an unsightly development for a celebrity , even of the ursine persuasion .
now , knut 's four daily meals are being cut down to three . call it the south pole diet . survival reserves , or unsightly love handles ? " if knut lived outdoors this would n't be so bad - he would simply build up his fat reserves for winter , " zoo veterinarian andreas ochs told news services on tuesday .
but in captivity , ochs said , the extra weight is unnecessary . knut currently is fed a baby-bear diet of porridge , milk , meat , cod liver oil , and supplements , but he will soon graduate to grown-up bear food : fish and solid meat . " extras like croissants will need to be dropped , " ochs said , adding french pastries to the list of foods no one previously knew were fed to zoo animals . bonaduce , take note bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the zenith of fame : a vanity fair cover while the bear 's fall from grace may not be on as big a scale as some - after all , knut is no danny bonaduce - his story can still serve as a cautionary tale about the pitfalls of fame and greed . one day you 're on the cover of vanity fair , the next its weight watchers magazine . how did this all come about ?
as knut 's long-haired keeper - himself a much-photographed celebrity of sorts since he introduced his protegee to the world - told the berliner zeitung newspaper that the bear 's dietary dilemma results from a common problem . " knut likes to nibble between meals , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de peacekeeping -pipe- 01.08.2007 opinion : un peace mission in sudan - a timid compromise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un officials may hail the sudan peacekeeping mission as " historic , " but the watered-down resolution adopted by the security council wo n't stop the genocide for at least another year , says dw 's stefanie duckstein . the indecision , the pondering and the struggle to reach an agreement has been costly .
some 200,000 people have lost their lives and more than 2 million became refugees as a result of the genocide that 's been taking place in the crisis region of darfur in western sudan .
countless attempts were needed in the un security council to - finally - adopt a resolution that 's been described as " historic " by un secretary-general ban ki-moon .
a peacekeeping force of 26,000 soldiers is now meant to put an end to the darfur genocide .
it 's a mission that completely overwhelms the underfinanced and badly equipped african union troops that are currently stationed there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie duckstein but despite the " historic " praise by the highest body of world diplomacy , the resolution can only be called a timid attempt as it is a compromise .
it 's an agreement with concessions that all 15 members of the un security council managed to unanimously agree on .
britain and france cleared the way for a watered-down draft that no longer talks about continuing attacks of sudanese government troops and janjaweed militia .
it 's also a compromise because the peacekeeping forces will not be able to confiscate illegal weapons .
the existing arms embargo against sudan is weak and is circumvented by countries such as china and russia .
the resolution also stops short of far-reaching sanctions against the african state .
security council veto power china had opposed the enforcement of sanctions .
the chinese government called them " unfair and untimely " and had repeatedly prevented a resolution by abstaining from the vote .
again and again , human rights organizations have presented evidence of genocide and the sudanese government 's responsibility - without success .
while the tragedy continues in its fourth year in darfur , the timid implementation of a un peacekeeping mission is hard to understand .
more than 50 previous declarations were necessary that expressed " collective concerns , " " continuing grave concerns , " or " great fear . "
this was cynical diplomatic terminology while women , children and elderly were dying in misery at the same time .
even sudan 's un ambassador , abdalmahmood abdalhaleem mohamad , seems happy with the agreement that has been reached .
last week , the country 's president , omar al-bashir , had shrugged off the genocide as propaganda by western media after visiting the crisis region for three days .
al-bashir so far has prevented every attempt to station a hybrid force of un and african union soldiers - despite showing signs of cooperation from time to time .
that 's why the un resolution has to be seen as nothing more than a signal of western diplomacy for the time being .
it does not represent an end to genocide .
people are still killed on a daily basis , thousands fell from the crisis region to neighboring chad and the central african republic and still are not protected from attacks by the janjaweed militia .
experts think that it will take a year until the biggest un mission ever is ready .
fearfully it 's a year during which masses of people will continue to die .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de peacekeeping -pipe- 01.08.2007 opinion : un peace mission in sudan - a timid compromise großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : un officials may hail the sudan peacekeeping mission as " historic , " but the watered-down resolution adopted by the security council wo n't stop the genocide for at least another year , says dw 's stefanie duckstein . the indecision , the pondering and the struggle to reach an agreement has been costly .
some 200,000 people have lost their lives and more than 2 million became refugees as a result of the genocide that 's been taking place in the crisis region of darfur in western sudan .
countless attempts were needed in the un security council to - finally - adopt a resolution that 's been described as " historic " by un secretary-general ban ki-moon .
a peacekeeping force of 26,000 soldiers is now meant to put an end to the darfur genocide .
it 's a mission that completely overwhelms the underfinanced and badly equipped african union troops that are currently stationed there .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stefanie duckstein but despite the " historic " praise by the highest body of world diplomacy , the resolution can only be called a timid attempt as it is a compromise .
it 's an agreement with concessions that all 15 members of the un security council managed to unanimously agree on .
britain and france cleared the way for a watered-down draft that no longer talks about continuing attacks of sudanese government troops and janjaweed militia .
it 's also a compromise because the peacekeeping forces will not be able to confiscate illegal weapons .
the existing arms embargo against sudan is weak and is circumvented by countries such as china and russia .
the resolution also stops short of far-reaching sanctions against the african state .
security council veto power china had opposed the enforcement of sanctions .
the chinese government called them " unfair and untimely " and had repeatedly prevented a resolution by abstaining from the vote .
again and again , human rights organizations have presented evidence of genocide and the sudanese government 's responsibility - without success .
while the tragedy continues in its fourth year in darfur , the timid implementation of a un peacekeeping mission is hard to understand .
more than 50 previous declarations were necessary that expressed " collective concerns , " " continuing grave concerns , " or " great fear . "
this was cynical diplomatic terminology while women , children and elderly were dying in misery at the same time .
even sudan 's un ambassador , abdalmahmood abdalhaleem mohamad , seems happy with the agreement that has been reached .
last week , the country 's president , omar al-bashir , had shrugged off the genocide as propaganda by western media after visiting the crisis region for three days .
al-bashir so far has prevented every attempt to station a hybrid force of un and african union soldiers - despite showing signs of cooperation from time to time .
that 's why the un resolution has to be seen as nothing more than a signal of western diplomacy for the time being .
it does not represent an end to genocide .
people are still killed on a daily basis , thousands fell from the crisis region to neighboring chad and the central african republic and still are not protected from attacks by the janjaweed militia .
experts think that it will take a year until the biggest un mission ever is ready .
fearfully it 's a year during which masses of people will continue to die .

in germany , the regional states decide where to light up , resulting in patchwork laws .
now three states have taken the no-smoking initiative . most of germany 's 16 regional states plan to implement smoking bans by january next year , but anti-smoking laws already went into effect in three states on aug .
1 . starting in september , smoking will also be banned in federal buildings and on all modes of public transport as well as taxis , trains and airports . in baden-württemberg , lower saxony and mecklenburg-west pomerania , smoking is now prohibited in all local government buildings , hospitals , schools and other institutions for children and youth . in the first two states , where hanover , heidelberg and stuttgart are located , smoking will still be permitted in restaurants and bars , but only in designated areas , whereas in the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , the anti-smoking laws will take effect in gastronomical establishments starting jan .
1 . the states of hesse , rhineland-palatinate and saxony - where frankfurt , mainz and dresden are located - want to enforce anti-smoking rules before the end of the year . patchwork laws in different states restaurant and bar owners in lower saxony , who are responsible for enforcing the ban , will be subject to checks by the local police as of november , so even though the rule takes effect now , there will be no penalties for violating the law until then .
afterwards offenders could face fines of up to 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,365 -rrb- , and in mecklenburg-western pomerania the fine could be as much as 10,000 euros .

critics of the patchwork laws in the various states say that unlike other european countries , such as france , italy and britain , the lack of a comprehensive ban throughout germany , sends the wrong signal .
although berlin has tried to introduce anti-smoking laws nationwide , it could only enforce the rules in federal buildings , since germany 's constitution gives its states considerable latitude in such matters .
in march , the federal government agreed on a framework with the 16 states on anti-smoking rules in public buildings , but each state would have to ratify its own laws .

" health protection should not be age-related , " said binding , who campaigned for a comprehensive ban in the german parliament last year . others applauded the state initiatives .
" it is a hopeful start that states where the smoking issue has been a smoking gun have become models for other states , " said martina pötschke-langer , head of heidelberg 's german cancer research institute -lrb- dkfz -rrb- in an interview with the associated press . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " health protection should not be aged related " owners favor laws according to a survey by the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , most barkeepers and restaurant owners favor the new laws .

critics of the patchwork laws in the various states say that unlike other european countries , such as france , italy and britain , the lack of a comprehensive ban throughout germany , sends the wrong signal .
although berlin has tried to introduce anti-smoking laws nationwide , it could only enforce the rules in federal buildings , since germany 's constitution gives its states considerable latitude in such matters .
in march , the federal government agreed on a framework with the 16 states on anti-smoking rules in public buildings , but each state would have to ratify its own laws .
critics in favor of comprehensive smoking bans lothar binding , a social democratic parliamentarian , told the berlin daily newspaper tageszeitung , " health protection should n't be restricted to only a few states .
a non-smoker in stuttgart has the same right to clean air as one in rostock , " he added . furthermore , in baden-württemberg , it is up to individual schools to decide whether those teenagers who are no longer minors may smoke in sealed-off areas on school premises .
" health protection should not be age-related , " said binding , who campaigned for a comprehensive ban in the german parliament last year . others applauded the state initiatives .
" it is a hopeful start that states where the smoking issue has been a smoking gun have become models for other states , " said martina pötschke-langer , head of heidelberg 's german cancer research institute -lrb- dkfz -rrb- in an interview with the associated press . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " health protection should not be aged related " owners favor laws according to a survey by the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , most barkeepers and restaurant owners favor the new laws .
in the past two years , the number of restaurants , bars and inns with specially designated areas has nearly doubled , reflecting changing public attitudes . those in favor of voluntary restrictions comprise only 20 percent of proprietors and only 10 percent of those surveyed are against the introduction of any non-smoker protection laws at all . a slight majority of germans have also approved smoking bans and restrictions , according to a forsa survey .
statistics from the german health ministry show that one-third of german adults are smokers , of which 140,000 die annually from their habit .
in addition , more than 3,000 non-smoker deaths a year are attributed to the effects of passive inhalation . article based on news reports -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany said wednesday that it will continue to stay out of business with the african nation . france has agreed to sell libya anti-tank missiles as part of the military agreement reached last week by french president nicolas sarkozy and libyan leader moammar gadhafi . " we are going to buy rocket-propelled grenades of the milan type worth around 100 million euros in france , " gadhafi 's son saif al-islam gaddafi was quoted as saying in an interview published in thursday 's french daily le monde .
" there 's also a project for a weapons factory . " a shoulder-mounted anti-tank weapon , the milan is built by a subsidiary of europe 's joint eads defense and aerospace company . the deal is part of a defense memorandum of understanding for a nuclear energy agreed to by sarkozy when he visited tripoli last week , after helping to free foreign medics imprisoned in libya . the french government has denied a direct link between the two countries ' military cooperation and the release of the bulgarian medics .
when asked what france offered in exchange for the six medics ' release sarkozy answered , " nothing . " first deal after arms embargo bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : six bulgarian medics held in libya for over eight years were set free last week the 35-year-old islam said it was the first arms supply from a western country , and added that he anticipated more deals to be made with other nations soon . since the arms embargo ended in 2004 there had been an unofficial embargo against his country , he said , pointing out that germany had been especially reserved in dealings with the country while other european nations have proven more willing to negotiate , islam said . though careful to avoid criticizing paris directly for the details of its deal with with tripoli , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier said he wished france had better communicated its intentions with other eu members . " i would have certainly wished that france had informed and gotten its european partners on board with the offer to libya , " he told the thursday 's handelsblatt newspaper .
" i think the french side now sees that it could have better chosen the order . " german politicians , including steinmeier 's deputy , have recently criticized the french deal with libya and recommended that german companies continue not to do business with the african state . uk extradition rumored bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a libyan convicted for having a role in the lockerbie bombing could be extradited negotiations over a possible extradition of libyan secret service agent ali al-magrahi , who was sentenced to life imprisonment over the 1998 lockerbie attack and is serving time in a prison near glasgow , also played an important role , gaddafi told the french paper . " there will soon be an extradition agreement with britain , " he said . that 's a statement the british government has denied . " there is no link between mr. megrahi and the release of the bulgarian and palestinian medics , " a spokesman told afp news agency , adding that there is no extradition agreement between britain and the north african country . the spokesman did , however , add that , " the uk and libyan government are looking into a wide range of areas pertaining to judicial cooperation .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 01.08.2007 eu calls on russia , belarus to solve gas dispute großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's not the first time russia has threatened to turn off gas supplies to its neighbors the european commission on wednesday urged russia and belarus to seek an amicable solution to their latest dispute over energy supplies , which could also affect gas deliveries to western europe . the russian gas monopoly gazprom said it would reduce gas supplies to its neighbor by 45 percent beginning on friday due to outstanding belarusian debt after a doubling of gas prices had caused minsk to fall $ 456 million -lrb- 333 million euros -rrb- behind on its payments in recent months .
" we take this development very seriously , " eu commission spokesman martin selmayr told reporters wednesday .
minsk and moscow should resolve their dispute without delay and create conditions for the timely resumption of deliveries , he said .
if needed the commission could convene a meeting of a european union " gas coordination group " to study implications the row could have on energy supplies to the 27-nation bloc , selmayr said .
subsidized prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin -lrb- right -rrb- and belarus leader alexander lukashenko have been drifting apart about one fifth of russian gas exports to europe transit belarus , but western customers had been told about the planned reduction of supplies , according to gazprom .
gazprom has accused the belarus gas company beltransgas of having paid for about half of its imports of russian natural gas in the first half of 2007 .
russia and belarus previously clashed over energy supplies at the beginning of 2007 .
while a complete stoppage of gas supplies to belarus was avoided , russia reduced its supplies of oil for several days - a decision that also affected the transit pipeline into the eu .
" gazprom will take all possible measures for the transportation of russian gas through the territory of belarus in full accordance with current obligations to european customers , " the company said in a statement , adding it would pursue legal action against belarus if it siphoned gas out of transit pipelines . alexander burgansky , an analyst at renaissance capital , said belarus was unlikely to start taking gas from transit pipelines . " consumption is seasonally low , and underground storage facilities are full everywhere , " he told reuters .
the cause of the current conflict is moscow 's attempt to raise step by step the strongly subsidized energy prices for belarus to an international level .
estonians against sea pipeline bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many estonians do n't want the pipeline off their shores plans for an alternative gas delivery route from russia to western europe were also dealt a blow on wednesday after an academic report called on the estonian government to not allow a consortium behind a controversial gas pipeline to construct it in estonian waters .
a possible russian military presence and potential harm to the environment should force the government to deny a request from the nord stream consortium to conduct an environmental study in estonian waters , daily postimees reported quoting the study by the country 's academy of sciences .
" neutral states like finland and sweden can allow the presence of the russian armed forces and gazprom armed operatives in their economic zones or territorial waters , but as nato members estonia and poland can not allow that , " the report said .
in april , nord stream asked estonian authorities to measure the depth of the baltic sea in estonian waters to determine if it was possible to shift the pipeline south of the finnish coast .
the authorities turned to scientists for an opinion .
bitter dispute gazprom has stressed its 2005 agreement with german firms eon and basf to lay a 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 745-mile -rrb- gas pipeline , known as nord stream , across the baltic sea from russia to germany , saying it would boost europe 's energy security and cut out the potential for political conflict with transit countries .
former german chancellor gerhard schröder is the chairman of nord stream 's shareholders ' committee .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since in was first proposed in 2005 .
many of the states bordering the baltic have argued that it could disturb stores of chemical weapons dumped in the sea after world war ii .
so far more than 20,000 people , mostly from the baltic states , have signed a petition to stop the construction of the pipeline .
if completed , the pipeline would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we take this development very seriously , " eu commission spokesman martin selmayr told reporters wednesday .
minsk and moscow should resolve their dispute without delay and create conditions for the timely resumption of deliveries , he said .
if needed the commission could convene a meeting of a european union " gas coordination group " to study implications the row could have on energy supplies to the 27-nation bloc , selmayr said .
subsidized prices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian president vladimir putin -lrb- right -rrb- and belarus leader alexander lukashenko have been drifting apart about one fifth of russian gas exports to europe transit belarus , but western customers had been told about the planned reduction of supplies , according to gazprom .
gazprom has accused the belarus gas company beltransgas of having paid for about half of its imports of russian natural gas in the first half of 2007 .
russia and belarus previously clashed over energy supplies at the beginning of 2007 .
while a complete stoppage of gas supplies to belarus was avoided , russia reduced its supplies of oil for several days - a decision that also affected the transit pipeline into the eu .
" gazprom will take all possible measures for the transportation of russian gas through the territory of belarus in full accordance with current obligations to european customers , " the company said in a statement , adding it would pursue legal action against belarus if it siphoned gas out of transit pipelines . alexander burgansky , an analyst at renaissance capital , said belarus was unlikely to start taking gas from transit pipelines . " consumption is seasonally low , and underground storage facilities are full everywhere , " he told reuters .
the cause of the current conflict is moscow 's attempt to raise step by step the strongly subsidized energy prices for belarus to an international level .
estonians against sea pipeline bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many estonians do n't want the pipeline off their shores plans for an alternative gas delivery route from russia to western europe were also dealt a blow on wednesday after an academic report called on the estonian government to not allow a consortium behind a controversial gas pipeline to construct it in estonian waters .
a possible russian military presence and potential harm to the environment should force the government to deny a request from the nord stream consortium to conduct an environmental study in estonian waters , daily postimees reported quoting the study by the country 's academy of sciences .
" neutral states like finland and sweden can allow the presence of the russian armed forces and gazprom armed operatives in their economic zones or territorial waters , but as nato members estonia and poland can not allow that , " the report said .
in april , nord stream asked estonian authorities to measure the depth of the baltic sea in estonian waters to determine if it was possible to shift the pipeline south of the finnish coast .
the authorities turned to scientists for an opinion .
bitter dispute gazprom has stressed its 2005 agreement with german firms eon and basf to lay a 1,200-kilometer -lrb- 745-mile -rrb- gas pipeline , known as nord stream , across the baltic sea from russia to germany , saying it would boost europe 's energy security and cut out the potential for political conflict with transit countries .
former german chancellor gerhard schröder is the chairman of nord stream 's shareholders ' committee .
the pipeline has been the subject of bitter dispute in the baltic region ever since in was first proposed in 2005 .
many of the states bordering the baltic have argued that it could disturb stores of chemical weapons dumped in the sea after world war ii .
so far more than 20,000 people , mostly from the baltic states , have signed a petition to stop the construction of the pipeline .
if completed , the pipeline would create separate routes for russia to supply gas to eastern and western europe .
as a result , the eu 's eastern european member states have complained that it would allow russia to cut off their gas supplies - as it did to ukraine in january 2006 - without affecting supplies to its richer western clients . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the list includes a dozen early renaissance portraits and biblical scenes by lucas cranach the elder , best known for his oil renditions of martin luther , as well as an oil-on-canvas rubens portrait from the 1600s of the archbishop antonio trieste of ghent . the agency , which is a division of the finance ministry and has branches throughout germany , was established last year to handle claims not only for looted art , antique furniture and other cultural artifacts , but also the restitution of real estate and property seized by the nazis . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : biblical themes are common in works by lucas cranach the elder according to the badv 's harald könig , the body of case-law dealing with restitution issues and compensation for assets confiscated by the nazis is still growing more than 60 years after the end of the war . although most legal claims were settled in the post-war years in the former west germany , the origins of much of the art unearthed in the eastern states after the reunification in 1990 , has only recently begun being documented and returned to the original owners . mostly oil paintings on list of looted art so far the provenance of 36 objects out of nearly 600 that have been thoroughly documented have been or are in the process of being returned to holocaust survivors or their descendents , said könig . returning the art to its proper owners is nearly always a long legal process that can take years , or even decades , for owners to prove the art belongs to them . the looted listed on the badv 's web page consists mainly of oil paintings , but also italian , english and german antiques replete with detailed descriptions , historical references and a black and white photo .
most of the art has been loaned out to museums throughout germany , including several works that had been originally intended for hitler 's museum in linz , austria . the nazis looted about 650,000 artworks in all according to estimates by the jewish claims conference , of which only a fraction have been returned in spite of highly publicized restitution efforts since the mid-1990s .
one of the main reasons for the meager returns was the difficulty involved in adequately documenting the provenance of art assets . list needs to be in english for target audience bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : descendents of holocaust survivors no longer speak german " it 's marvelous that such information is now being posted by the badv , " said anne webber , who is co-chair of the non-profit london-based commission for looted art in europe , though she added that the comprehensive list compiled by the agency would benefit from being translated into english . only last month , the national fund of the republic of austria for victims of national socialism , which published its comprehensive database of stolen nazi art in german last december , provided an english page as well . " such sites need to be accessible to their target audiences worldwide , " webber said .
" the rightful owners are not likely to live in german speaking countries , nor speak german anymore . " although parts of badv 's web page are available in english , the detailed list of paintings and artworks are not .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de health -pipe- 01.08.2007 first smoking bans take effect in german states großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lighting up will only be permitted in designated areas other european countries have enforced nationwide bans against smoking .
in germany , the regional states decide where to light up , resulting in patchwork laws .
now three states have taken the no-smoking initiative . most of germany 's 16 regional states plan to implement smoking bans by january next year , but anti-smoking laws already went into effect in three states on aug .
1 . starting in september , smoking will also be banned in federal buildings and on all modes of public transport as well as taxis , trains and airports . in baden-württemberg , lower saxony and mecklenburg-west pomerania , smoking is now prohibited in all local government buildings , hospitals , schools and other institutions for children and youth . in the first two states , where hanover , heidelberg and stuttgart are located , smoking will still be permitted in restaurants and bars , but only in designated areas , whereas in the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , the anti-smoking laws will take effect in gastronomical establishments starting jan .
1 . the states of hesse , rhineland-palatinate and saxony - where frankfurt , mainz and dresden are located - want to enforce anti-smoking rules before the end of the year . patchwork laws in different states restaurant and bar owners in lower saxony , who are responsible for enforcing the ban , will be subject to checks by the local police as of november , so even though the rule takes effect now , there will be no penalties for violating the law until then .
afterwards offenders could face fines of up to 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,365 -rrb- , and in mecklenburg-western pomerania the fine could be as much as 10,000 euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking rules in discos vary , depending on region rules in discotheques also vary . the southwestern state baden-württemberg will impose a comprehensive ban , whereas discos in the northern state lower saxony will permit smoking in a sealed off area .
critics of the patchwork laws in the various states say that unlike other european countries , such as france , italy and britain , the lack of a comprehensive ban throughout germany , sends the wrong signal .
although berlin has tried to introduce anti-smoking laws nationwide , it could only enforce the rules in federal buildings , since germany 's constitution gives its states considerable latitude in such matters .
in march , the federal government agreed on a framework with the 16 states on anti-smoking rules in public buildings , but each state would have to ratify its own laws .
critics in favor of comprehensive smoking bans lothar binding , a social democratic parliamentarian , told the berlin daily newspaper tageszeitung , " health protection should n't be restricted to only a few states .
a non-smoker in stuttgart has the same right to clean air as one in rostock , " he added . furthermore , in baden-württemberg , it is up to individual schools to decide whether those teenagers who are no longer minors may smoke in sealed-off areas on school premises .
" health protection should not be age-related , " said binding , who campaigned for a comprehensive ban in the german parliament last year . others applauded the state initiatives .
" it is a hopeful start that states where the smoking issue has been a smoking gun have become models for other states , " said martina pötschke-langer , head of heidelberg 's german cancer research institute -lrb- dkfz -rrb- in an interview with the associated press . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " health protection should not be aged related " owners favor laws according to a survey by the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , most barkeepers and restaurant owners favor the new laws .
in the past two years , the number of restaurants , bars and inns with specially designated areas has nearly doubled , reflecting changing public attitudes . those in favor of voluntary restrictions comprise only 20 percent of proprietors and only 10 percent of those surveyed are against the introduction of any non-smoker protection laws at all . a slight majority of germans have also approved smoking bans and restrictions , according to a forsa survey .
statistics from the german health ministry show that one-third of german adults are smokers , of which 140,000 die annually from their habit .
in addition , more than 3,000 non-smoker deaths a year are attributed to the effects of passive inhalation . article based on news reports -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in germany , the regional states decide where to light up , resulting in patchwork laws .
now three states have taken the no-smoking initiative . most of germany 's 16 regional states plan to implement smoking bans by january next year , but anti-smoking laws already went into effect in three states on aug .
1 . starting in september , smoking will also be banned in federal buildings and on all modes of public transport as well as taxis , trains and airports . in baden-württemberg , lower saxony and mecklenburg-west pomerania , smoking is now prohibited in all local government buildings , hospitals , schools and other institutions for children and youth . in the first two states , where hanover , heidelberg and stuttgart are located , smoking will still be permitted in restaurants and bars , but only in designated areas , whereas in the northeastern state of mecklenburg-western pomerania , the anti-smoking laws will take effect in gastronomical establishments starting jan .
1 . the states of hesse , rhineland-palatinate and saxony - where frankfurt , mainz and dresden are located - want to enforce anti-smoking rules before the end of the year . patchwork laws in different states restaurant and bar owners in lower saxony , who are responsible for enforcing the ban , will be subject to checks by the local police as of november , so even though the rule takes effect now , there will be no penalties for violating the law until then .
afterwards offenders could face fines of up to 1,000 euros -lrb- $ 1,365 -rrb- , and in mecklenburg-western pomerania the fine could be as much as 10,000 euros .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smoking rules in discos vary , depending on region rules in discotheques also vary . the southwestern state baden-württemberg will impose a comprehensive ban , whereas discos in the northern state lower saxony will permit smoking in a sealed off area .
critics of the patchwork laws in the various states say that unlike other european countries , such as france , italy and britain , the lack of a comprehensive ban throughout germany , sends the wrong signal .
although berlin has tried to introduce anti-smoking laws nationwide , it could only enforce the rules in federal buildings , since germany 's constitution gives its states considerable latitude in such matters .
in march , the federal government agreed on a framework with the 16 states on anti-smoking rules in public buildings , but each state would have to ratify its own laws .
critics in favor of comprehensive smoking bans lothar binding , a social democratic parliamentarian , told the berlin daily newspaper tageszeitung , " health protection should n't be restricted to only a few states .
a non-smoker in stuttgart has the same right to clean air as one in rostock , " he added . furthermore , in baden-württemberg , it is up to individual schools to decide whether those teenagers who are no longer minors may smoke in sealed-off areas on school premises .
" health protection should not be age-related , " said binding , who campaigned for a comprehensive ban in the german parliament last year . others applauded the state initiatives .
" it is a hopeful start that states where the smoking issue has been a smoking gun have become models for other states , " said martina pötschke-langer , head of heidelberg 's german cancer research institute -lrb- dkfz -rrb- in an interview with the associated press . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " health protection should not be aged related " owners favor laws according to a survey by the german chamber of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , most barkeepers and restaurant owners favor the new laws .
in the past two years , the number of restaurants , bars and inns with specially designated areas has nearly doubled , reflecting changing public attitudes . those in favor of voluntary restrictions comprise only 20 percent of proprietors and only 10 percent of those surveyed are against the introduction of any non-smoker protection laws at all . a slight majority of germans have also approved smoking bans and restrictions , according to a forsa survey .
statistics from the german health ministry show that one-third of german adults are smokers , of which 140,000 die annually from their habit .
in addition , more than 3,000 non-smoker deaths a year are attributed to the effects of passive inhalation . article based on news reports -lrb- df -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the review has also highlighted an increase in the mistreatment of horses .
the review said rspca inspectors dealt with a " shocking catalogue " of crimes , including a cat killed in a washing machine and a mummified dog .
but the rspca said the animal welfare act in march had made an impact , and allowed inspectors to intervene sooner .
among the complaints investigated for the 2006 review were that of a dog that died of starvation in a cupboard in ebbw vale , blaenau gwent .
the 27-year-old owner was jailed for four months in may for abandoning his black and tan cross breed bitch after losing his keys to a council house .
the dog was shut in a small room in the property for three weeks and suffered an " agonising " death , the court heard .
wales animal cruelty 2006 126 cases reported -lrb- up from 94 in 2005 -rrb- 193 defendants reported -lrb- up from 131 -rrb- 25 cautions -lrb- up from 19 -rrb- 56 defendants convicted -lrb- down from 73 -rrb- 79 convictions -lrb- down from 119 16 defendants convicted in west wales -lrb- up from 10 -rrb- plaster had been gouged from the room 's walls , indicating the animal had tried to escape .
in another case , a stallion 's hooves were found to have overgrown by more than one metre -lrb- 3ft 3in -rrb- in what an rspca officer called the worst case of its kind she had seen .
its owner , aged 62 , of pembrokeshire , was banned from owning horses for three years , fined £ 1,000 and told to pay £ 1,800 costs after admitting causing unnecessary suffering in november 2006 .
martyn hubbard , rspca superintendent for the wales and the west , said neglect was the most common form of cruelty . "
it 's so shocking to discover animals that have starved to death , simply because their owners could n't be bothered to feed them " martyn hubbard , rspca cymru " animals depend totally on their owners to meet their day-to-day needs .
ignoring this basic responsibility has heart-breaking consequences , " he said .
" these cases defy belief .
it 's so shocking to discover animals that have starved to death , simply because their owners could n't be bothered to feed them . "
the increase in cruelty against horses was also " particularly disturbing " , said mr hubbard .
" the magnificent creatures have very specific needs in terms of feeding , exercise , habitat and veterinary attention .
" as with cruelty against other animals , we will not stand by and watch them suffer silently in fields and stables " .
cruelty statistics for wales and england showed a general increase in offences against horses , up 33 % on the previous year .
but there were some positive trends , with offences against dogs and cats down by 15.6 % and 9.5 % respectively .

the review said rspca inspectors dealt with a " shocking catalogue " of crimes , including a cat killed in a washing machine and a mummified dog .
but the rspca said the animal welfare act in march had made an impact , and allowed inspectors to intervene sooner .
among the complaints investigated for the 2006 review were that of a dog that died of starvation in a cupboard in ebbw vale , blaenau gwent .
the 27-year-old owner was jailed for four months in may for abandoning his black and tan cross breed bitch after losing his keys to a council house .
the dog was shut in a small room in the property for three weeks and suffered an " agonising " death , the court heard .

in another case , a stallion 's hooves were found to have overgrown by more than one metre -lrb- 3ft 3in -rrb- in what an rspca officer called the worst case of its kind she had seen .
its owner , aged 62 , of pembrokeshire , was banned from owning horses for three years , fined £ 1,000 and told to pay £ 1,800 costs after admitting causing unnecessary suffering in november 2006 .
martyn hubbard , rspca superintendent for the wales and the west , said neglect was the most common form of cruelty .
it 's so shocking to discover animals that have starved to death , simply because their owners could n't be bothered to feed them martyn hubbard , rspca cymru " animals depend totally on their owners to meet their day-to-day needs .
ignoring this basic responsibility has heart-breaking consequences , " he said .
" these cases defy belief .
it 's so shocking to discover animals that have starved to death , simply because their owners could n't be bothered to feed them . "
the increase in cruelty against horses was also " particularly disturbing " , said mr hubbard .
" the magnificent creatures have very specific needs in terms of feeding , exercise , habitat and veterinary attention .
" as with cruelty against other animals , we will not stand by and watch them suffer silently in fields and stables " .
cruelty statistics for wales and england showed a general increase in offences against horses , up 33 % on the previous year .
but there were some positive trends , with offences against dogs and cats down by 15.6 % and 9.5 % respectively .

the unity mine at cwmgwrach , has been closed since 1998 , but is estimated to have reserves of up to 90 million tonnes .
around 120 jobs should be created at the site by early next year .
the mine 's owners said that it will be capable of producing up to one million tonnes of coal a year for the next 25 years .
chairman gerwyn williams said : " the mine is capable of producing about a million tonnes of coal a year .
market conditions " there are transport conditions to consider but that 's what we 're aiming for - for about a million tonnes a year for about 20 to 25 years . "
the drift mine - one that men can walk into rather than being transported in a lift - is the first to be opened in wales since betws colliery in ammanford in 1974 .
the rising amount of imported coal , coupled with global price increases and demand makes formerly uneconomic sites commercial again .
mr williams said coal had risen by about 40 to 50 % over the last six years full production at the mine will begin next year " extraction is expensive but given market conditions currently - globally that is and they are mainly due to the increases in the economy of china and india - then coal prices worldwide have increased , " he said .
on wednesday unity mining will bring to the surface the first of what is called development coal which must be extracted so that further engineering work can take place .
it is hoped full industrial production will begin in early 2008 .
but mr williams warned they may have to look overseas in the short term to find miners to work there because of a " generation " gap in skilled miners with the run down of the coal industry in the uk .
he said recruiting in poland would be a " short tem fix , not a long term answer " .
unity also have four other mine sites in south wales under development .

the unity mine at cwmgwrach , has been closed since 1998 , but is estimated to have reserves of up to 90 million tonnes .
around 120 jobs should be created at the site by early next year .
the mine 's owners said that it will be capable of producing up to one million tonnes of coal a year for the next 25 years .
chairman gerwyn williams said : " the mine is capable of producing about a million tonnes of coal a year .
market conditions " there are transport conditions to consider but that 's what we 're aiming for - for about a million tonnes a year for about 20 to 25 years . "
the drift mine - one that men can walk into rather than being transported in a lift - is the first to be opened in wales since betws colliery in ammanford in 1974 .
the rising amount of imported coal , coupled with global price increases and demand makes formerly uneconomic sites commercial again .
mr williams said coal had risen by about 40 to 50 % over the last six years full production at the mine will begin next year " extraction is expensive but given market conditions currently - globally that is and they are mainly due to the increases in the economy of china and india - then coal prices worldwide have increased , " he said .
on wednesday unity mining will bring to the surface the first of what is called development coal which must be extracted so that further engineering work can take place .
it is hoped full industrial production will begin in early 2008 .
but mr williams warned they may have to look overseas in the short term to find miners to work there because of a " generation " gap in skilled miners with the run down of the coal industry in the uk .
he said recruiting in poland would be a " short tem fix , not a long term answer " .
unity also have four other mine sites in south wales under development .

the packs - intended to speed up sales - contain title deeds , local searches and an energy performance certificate , and cost about £ 400- £ 700 to compile .
initially , only properties with four or more bedrooms will have to have a hip but the government plans to extend the scheme to all properties soon .
critics argue hips make house-selling more expensive and bureaucratic .
scotland is set to get its own version of hips in 2008 .
delay originally the government planned to introduce hips for all houses put up for sale in england and wales from 1 june .
however , the introduction was postponed by two months and the initial roll-out limited to properties with four or more bedrooms .
packs will include evidence of title copies of planning , listed building or building regulations consents a local search guarantees for any work on the property an energy performance certificate q & a : hips explained training to be an inspector the government said hips were delayed because there were too few qualified inspectors to produce energy performance certificates , a key component of the packs .
industry groups and opposition political parties have been vehemently opposed to the introduction of hips .
the royal institution of chartered surveyors -lrb- rics -rrb- , the law society , the national association of estate agents and the council of mortgage lenders have all called for hips to be overhauled or scrapped entirely .
critics ' objections to hips include : there are too few inspectors to carry out the assessments necessary for issuing energy performance certificates key information in the packs , such as local authority searches , will soon go out of date some mortgage companies and legal bodies have said they may require the buyer to commission local searches to supplement those in the pack rics said it was " committed to the implementation of energy performance certificates and improving the carbon footprint of homes across the uk . "
nevertheless , the group added that there were " uncertainties in the legislation , and the number and geographical spread of energy inspectors across the uk " .
in response , the government has said that hips will speed up the house selling process and give buyers key information about the energy efficiency of their properties .
" the home buying and selling process has not changed for a generation - consumers are currently getting a bad deal , " a communities and local government spokesman said .
" home information packs and energy certificates will cut nearly a million tonnes of carbon a year , lower family fuel bills by hundreds of pounds and help to reduce the millions of pounds wasted by consumers when buying and selling their homes , " he added .
housing minister yvette cooper told the bbc that hips would make the house buying process " more transparent and clearer . "
and according to the association of home information pack providers , the government has reached its target of having more than 2,000 accredited inspectors trained to produce energy performance certificates . "
if an agent fails to comply , this could trigger an investigation into an agent 's fitness to continue estate agency work " mike haley , oft penalties the penalties for putting a property up for sale without a hip can be severe .
homeowners who have not commissioned a hip by the time they market their property can face fines of up to £ 200 a day .
on tuesday , the office of fair trading -lrb- oft -rrb- warned estate agents that if they failed to comply with hip rules and sold properties without a pack , they could be put out of business .
" if an agent fails to comply , this could trigger an investigation into an agent 's fitness to continue estate agency work , " said mike haley , oft head of consumer protection .
the oft 's stance has drawn fire from some estate agents .
" there is a lot of confusion out there amongst sellers and estate agents , " trevor kent , former head of the national association of estate agents told bbc news .
" after all the delays , some agents genuinely do not think that hips are going ahead ...

his news corporation company is paying $ 5.6bn -lrb- £ 2.7bn -rrb- for dow jones , after agreement was reached between the two boards .
as significantly , mr murdoch has managing to secure the backing of a majority of the bancroft family , which controls 64 % of the dow jones ' voting shares .
why is the wall street journal such a prized asset ?
the wall street journal is one of the most successful and influential papers in the world .
for some years , it had the largest paid-for circulation of any newspaper in the us , and now has daily american sales of 1.7 million .
in financial and political circles , it is regarded as a must-read title , so much so that its nickname is the " business bible " .
it is known for its detailed reporting , and respected for its authoritative commentary , although not everyone has always approved of its views , seen to be staunchly conservative .
it has tried to shake off its rather traditional image in recent years , publishing a new weekend edition in 2005 and printing adverts on its front page for the first time in 2006 .
the paper has successfully diversified its brand overseas and on the internet .
it launched an asian edition in 1976 and a european version in 1983 , while its website has more than 930,000 paying subscribers .
the broader dow jones business also owns a number of financial information suppliers , such as dow jones newswires , as well as other print and tv interests .
its overseas interests include a stake in the russian newspaper vedomosti .
why did rupert murdoch decide to buy dow jones ?
news corp surprised many analysts when it made its initial $ 5bn bid for dow jones in may .
the murdoch controlled firm is principally attracted by the wall street journal , the jewel in the crown of the dow jones business .
most of news corp 's papers operate only in their domestic markets , while the wall street journal is one of very few global newspaper brands .
ownership of the wall street journal will add a hugely successful newspaper to news corp 's stable of titles , while giving its whole business added prestige .
business journalism has been a major growth area in recent years , as interest in the stock market has spread more widely and strong economic growth has boosted advertising .
a business-focused firm such as dow jones would complement news corp 's existing assets , which are mainly focused on more volatile , consumer markets .
has there been any opposition to the deal ?
yes .
although the dow jones board has backed the deal , one of its directors resigned in protest at the move .
dieter von holtzbrinck said he was " very worried " about the impact of the bid on the wall street journal 's editorial independence another , leslie hill , reportedly quit as a director as the final deal took shape .
news corp has vowed to respect and protect the paper 's position .
however , critics point to mr murdoch 's track record of interfering in the editorial decisions of papers that he owns , such as the new york post and the sun .
who are the bancrofts and why are they so crucial ?
bancroft family members control 64 % of the firm 's voting shares , both directly and through various trusts .
the family has been connected with the business since the early 20th century , when hugh bancroft became president of the firm .
without the bancrofts ' support , the news corp bid could not have succeeded .
news corp and dow jones said in their joint statement that bancroft family members and trustees representing 37 % of the company 's shareholder vote had agreed to support the deal .
taken together with the 29 % of the vote held by public shareholders who are very likely to support news corp 's bid , the deal is all but assured of passing .
what happens next ?
with the majority of bancrofts pledging their support , a meeting of all shareholders will be convened in either september or october to vote on the deal - with it likely to proceed .
however , the situation is complicated by the possibility of a rival bid .
former myspace founder brad greenspan is reported to have lined up investors to make an alternative proposal .
when and how did dow jones come into being ?
the current dow jones business traces its roots back to 1882 when three men - charles dow , edward davis jones and charles bergstresser - formed a business in new york to produce daily hand-written financial bulletins for investors .
the trio hoped to cash in on the hunger for financial information at a time when the us economy was expanding rapidly and businesses were looking to expand abroad .
a year later , they launched the customers ' afternoon letter which , in 1889 , was to change its name to the now familiar wall street journal .
the journal published details of company stocks , a list initially dominated by railway firms .
this formed the basis of what was to become the now famous dow jones industrial average , the share index of the largest us and international companies .

his news corporation company is paying $ 5.6bn -lrb- £ 2.7bn -rrb- for dow jones , after agreement was reached between the two boards .
as significantly , mr murdoch has managing to secure the backing of a majority of the bancroft family , which controls 64 % of the dow jones ' voting shares .
why is the wall street journal such a prized asset ?
the wall street journal is one of the most successful and influential papers in the world .
for some years , it had the largest paid-for circulation of any newspaper in the us , and now has daily american sales of 1.7 million .
in financial and political circles , it is regarded as a must-read title , so much so that its nickname is the " business bible " .
it is known for its detailed reporting , and respected for its authoritative commentary , although not everyone has always approved of its views , seen to be staunchly conservative .
it has tried to shake off its rather traditional image in recent years , publishing a new weekend edition in 2005 and printing adverts on its front page for the first time in 2006 .
the paper has successfully diversified its brand overseas and on the internet .
it launched an asian edition in 1976 and a european version in 1983 , while its website has more than 930,000 paying subscribers .
the broader dow jones business also owns a number of financial information suppliers , such as dow jones newswires , as well as other print and tv interests .
its overseas interests include a stake in the russian newspaper vedomosti .
why did rupert murdoch decide to buy dow jones ?
news corp surprised many analysts when it made its initial $ 5bn bid for dow jones in may .
the murdoch controlled firm is principally attracted by the wall street journal , the jewel in the crown of the dow jones business .
rupert murdoch wants to get his hands on a global brand most of news corp 's papers operate only in their domestic markets , while the wall street journal is one of very few global newspaper brands .
ownership of the wall street journal will add a hugely successful newspaper to news corp 's stable of titles , while giving its whole business added prestige .
business journalism has been a major growth area in recent years , as interest in the stock market has spread more widely and strong economic growth has boosted advertising .
a business-focused firm such as dow jones would complement news corp 's existing assets , which are mainly focused on more volatile , consumer markets .
has there been any opposition to the deal ?
yes .
although the dow jones board has backed the deal , one of its directors resigned in protest at the move .
dieter von holtzbrinck said he was " very worried " about the impact of the bid on the wall street journal 's editorial independence another , leslie hill , reportedly quit as a director as the final deal took shape .
news corp has vowed to respect and protect the paper 's position .
however , critics point to mr murdoch 's track record of interfering in the editorial decisions of papers that he owns , such as the new york post and the sun .
who are the bancrofts and why are they so crucial ?
bancroft family members control 64 % of the firm 's voting shares , both directly and through various trusts .
the family has been connected with the business since the early 20th century , when hugh bancroft became president of the firm .
without the bancrofts ' support , the news corp bid could not have succeeded .
news corp and dow jones said in their joint statement that bancroft family members and trustees representing 37 % of the company 's shareholder vote had agreed to support the deal .
taken together with the 29 % of the vote held by public shareholders who are very likely to support news corp 's bid , the deal is all but assured of passing .
what happens next ?
with the majority of bancrofts pledging their support , a meeting of all shareholders will be convened in either september or october to vote on the deal - with it likely to proceed .
however , the situation is complicated by the possibility of a rival bid .
former myspace founder brad greenspan is reported to have lined up investors to make an alternative proposal .
when and how did dow jones come into being ?
the current dow jones business traces its roots back to 1882 when three men - charles dow , edward davis jones and charles bergstresser - formed a business in new york to produce daily hand-written financial bulletins for investors .
the trio hoped to cash in on the hunger for financial information at a time when the us economy was expanding rapidly and businesses were looking to expand abroad .
a year later , they launched the customers ' afternoon letter which , in 1889 , was to change its name to the now familiar wall street journal .
the journal published details of company stocks , a list initially dominated by railway firms .
this formed the basis of what was to become the now famous dow jones industrial average , the share index of the largest us and international companies .

the independent monitoring board -lrb- imb -rrb- said it was also concerned there was no psychiatrist who specialised in young people with mental illness .
however , the report commended the company which runs parc , group 4 securicor -lrb- g4s -rrb- on recent improvements .
parc , near bridgend , has around 1,110 places for adults and young offenders .
the imb , which monitors the state of prison premises and the treatment of inmates , issued the report covering the period between march 2006 and february 2007 .
deportation according to its findings , there were more than 80 referrals of prisoners with mental healthcare needs between march and november 2006 .
also in november 2006 a mental health team at parc treated 52 cases , the majority of them adults .
both the imb and g4s voiced an " urgent need " for a dedicated " young offenders own interest " unit in south wales .
john homfray , chair of the independent monitoring board at the jail , said the 15-place health care facility was used like a " cupboard " to keep mentally ill patients .
he told radio wales : " what happens is that if somebody goes on a normal wing and is found to be mentally ill - and therefore ca n't cope properly on that wing or causes terrible disruptions - then they get transferred to health care .
' in a cupboard ' " the health care facility is basically to deal with acute problems that arise in the prison , so then you get a warehousing situation in this very tightly-run , small , facility and they stay there .
" because the prison copes well with them , to the extent that they 're not causing any trouble elsewhere , they just stay there .
like in a cupboard . "
the report also highlights the ineffective arrangements for the deportation of foreign national prisoners at the end of their sentences in the uk .
however , the imb commended g4s on the " many improvements " at parc since the chief inspector of prison 's visit in january 2006 .

pre-tax profits for the six months to 30 june rose 13 % to £ 2.997bn , and hbos raised its first-half dividend by 23 % .
the bank 's share of net mortgage lending halved to 8 % in the period after a new pricing plan backfired .
hbos also said it had returned £ 79m to customers who claimed they had been overcharged for overdraft fees .
customers have launched a series of court actions against the uk 's top high street banks , arguing that their overdraft charges are unreasonable and illegal .
the banks have settled thousands of complaints out of court .
this week , hsbc said the cost of its refunds had reached £ 116m , while lloyds tsb said it had refunded £ 36m in the first half of the year .
fee crackdown hbos had said in june this year that its share of mortgage sales had plunged after a new pricing strategy went wrong .
the bank said that its mortgage share had now recovered after it took corrective action .
in the past three months , the bank said its net lending was " comfortably " back in its target range of 15-20 % .
however , the fall in mortgage lending contributed to an 8 % fall in underlying profit at hbos 's retail unit to £ 1.04bn , which was also hit by tougher price competition .
the bank added that regulatory pressure was cutting income at its uk retail banking operations .
the office of fair trading 's crackdown on credit card charges , together with lower mortgage exit fees following pressure from the financial services authority , is set to cut fee income by £ 65m in 2007 , hbos said .
dividend boost hbos 's 23 % rise in its half-year dividend lifted it to 16.6 pence per share , and was the biggest dividend rise the bank has announced since it was formed by the merger of the halifax and bank of scotland six years ago .
the bank added that nearly 70,000 of its staff would receive a total of £ 80m in free shares next week .
hbos said underlying profits at its general insurance business fell 10 % to £ 107m in the first half of the year as a result of june 's floods , which are expected to have cost £ 60m in claims .
the recent flooding in south and central england in july is set to lead to " further significant claims " .
the firm said that this was expected to lead to claims " modestly higher " than those seen for june 's floods .

the 63-year-old , who formed the band in the early 1960s , has spoken candidly about his music , heroin addiction and battles with bandmate sir mick jagger .
publisher michael pietsch of little , brown and company said extracts he had read were " delicious " .
the associated press reports richards will receive $ 7.3m -lrb- £ 3.6m -rrb- for writing the book .
' cultural force ' other rolling stones members have written memoirs , including former bassist bill wyman and fellow guitarist ron wood , whose book is due out shortly .
sir mick jagger has reportedly tried writing his autobiography , but given up , claiming he could not remember anything of interest .
richards is writing the book with the help of close friend james fox , the author of white mischief .
the stones are in the middle of their a bigger bang world tour " for nearly 50 years he has been at the very centre of the vortex of stardom and of entertainment as a cultural force , " said mr pietsch .
" to have the story of his own life in one book , there 's no experience like that .
and there will be stories he has never uttered before , " he added .
earlier this year , richards denied he had snorted the ashes of his late father during a drugs binge , after comments he made to music weekly nme .
the rolling stones are currently in the middle of the european leg of their a bigger bang world tour .

this compares with a profit of 1.23bn euros for the same time last year .

rising car sales although bmw 's group-wide profits fell during the second quarter , its revenues continued to rise , added 11 % from a year earlier to 14.68bn euros .
quarterly sales across its three car brands were up 8.6 % to 397,009 , again compared with the same period last year .
the continuing high value of the euro against the dollar and yen means that bmw is not able to make as much money from its sales in the us and japan .

reporting its results for the april to june period , the german carmaker made a pre-tax profit of 1.065bn euros -lrb- $ 1.45bn ; £ 718m -rrb- .
this compares with a profit of 1.23bn euros for the same time last year .
despite the fall , bmw , whose other brands are mini and rolls-royce , said its profits for 2007 remained on target to beat last year 's record 4bn euros .
rising car sales although bmw 's group-wide profits fell during the second quarter , its revenues continued to rise , added 11 % from a year earlier to 14.68bn euros .
quarterly sales across its three car brands were up 8.6 % to 397,009 , again compared with the same period last year .
the continuing high value of the euro against the dollar and yen means that bmw is not able to make as much money from its sales in the us and japan .

a study in lancet oncology highlighted the fact that diagnosis for some types of cancer is three times more likely in germany than the uk .
professor alan craft , of the university of newcastle , said child cancer was a low priority for the nhs , and called for urgent reforms .
the department of health said measures had been taken to improve services . "
i would like to reassure all of the families that might be confronting a diagnosis of cancer right now that they wo n't be getting treated better anywhere in europe than they are now in the uk " professor alex markham cancer research uk and cancer experts said standards had improved significantly in recent years .
the paper highlighted trials carried out on wilm 's tumour - a common childhood tumour - in germany .
it showed that , between 1994 and 2001 , 27.4 % of patients had a cancer that was first identified during a visit to a health professional for an unrelated problem , or by routine surveillance .
by comparison , in the uk , just 11 % of patients presenting to the royal marsden hospital in london and 4 % of patients referred to the newcastle hospital or the royal victoria infirmary in newcastle were identified .
more resources professor craft , and co-author dr kathy pritchard-jones , of the royal marsden hospital in surrey , called for routine surveillance of children as standard across the uk .
they said health visitors needed to be more aware of the symptoms of cancer .
they also believe children in the uk have been receiving a different treatment protocol from their european neighbours , possibly involving first-line treatment or less-intensive treatment during relapse .
professor craft said : " waiting lists and hospital beds keep chief executives awake at night , but i do n't think the health of children does . "
professor alex markham , senior medical advisor to the charity cancer research uk , said the paper gave a snapshot of cancer care from a decade ago .
" the landscape for the treatment of children with cancer in britain has changed beyond recognition in the period since .
" i would like to reassure all of the families that might be confronting a diagnosis of cancer right now that they wo n't be getting treated better anywhere in europe than they are now in the uk . "
measures in place dr carole easton , chief executive of childhood cancer charity clic sargent , said uk survival rates for childhood cancer have increased over the past 30 years , with seven out of 10 now surviving their illness .
