1 , 2008 , it will focus on issues close to home : kosovo 's independence and the efforts of neighboring balkan countries to join the bloc . for the next six months slovenia will sit at the epicenter of the eu .
taking on the presidency is an unprecedented challenge for the affluent alpine country of 2 million people .
slovenia declared independence from yugoslavia in 1991 .
in the years since , it has sprinted towards the west , joining both the eu and nato in 2004 .
now , it 's the first new eu member country to lead the 27-nation bloc .
" this is a historic project for us , " said slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel . " it 's not normal for us to be asked to lead such a presidency and so we want to make an extra effort . "
slovenia has budgeted 62 million euros -lrb- $ 91 million -rrb- as it has hired a slew of translators and advisors to make sure the next six months go over smoothly . the country will be responsible for organizing dozens of conferences , including minister-level meetings .
slovenia sees the presidency as a chance to increase its visibility in europe .
kosovo 's future will top the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo will top the agenda the eu presidency rotates every six months and was previously held by germany and portugal .
in many ways , slovenia will carry on the priorities - such as climate change and job creation initiatives - started by its predecessors .
the three countries decided to combine forces to set an agenda that would provide the bloc with more continuity .
other agenda points will be determined by events outside the eu 's direct control .
it 's widely assumed that the serbian breakaway province of kosovo will declare independence before slovenia 's presidency is up in june of 2008 .
recent united nations security council efforts to mediate a solution between serbia and kosovo have failed .
and the eu has begun to debate how it should react if the southern serbian province does declare independence .
rupel said the eu and kosovo must " agree on what to do next . "
rupel has carefully avoided using the word " independence " when referring to kosovo , but did say that europe is ready to " recognize the realities of the situation in the western balkans . "
" we believe it is high time for the yugoslav crisis to be over , " rupel told journalists .

slovenia has experience of balkans politics and personalities , jansa told reuters .
he dismissed concerns that slovenia might be influenced by strong business ties to serbia .
" we know the situation very well , also the details which are not easily understandable for countries which are far away , " jansa said .
" we are not one-sided in this case .
slovenia has excellent cooperation with serbia , also kosovo , with all former yugoslav republics . "
yet slovenia 's ability to lead in the area could be tricky given ongoing border disputes with neighboring croatia .
the biggest is resolving the maritime borders in the bay of piran .
croatia has claimed half of the bay it shares with croatia and italy .
that leaves slovenia without what it feels is an important access to international waters .
slovenia supports neighbors ' eu dreams bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia wants other balkan countries to join the club despite the border dispute , slovenia is supportive of croatia joining the eu .

yet european countries have become less enthusiastic recently about further expanding the bloc .
slovenia hopes to keep the momentum going , rupel said .
serbia 's unwavering stance on kosovo has complicated its own possibility of joining the eu .

when general manager uli hoeness said that bayern would soon be so far off into the distance , their rivals would need binoculars to see them , he said so without the omnipresent braggadocio but with a cold assertion .
in response , the rest of germany just sadly nodded in agreement and started ruminating about who 'd be munich 's closest rivals . the reason for hoeness ' brusque dismissal of the other 17 teams in the bundesliga and the country 's acceptance of his statement as fact could be summed up in three words : klose , ribery , toni . unprecedented spending spree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the signing of the prolific klose put fear into munich 's rivals bayern 's unprecedented summer spending spree seemed to have sealed the championship deal before a ball had even been kicked in anger .

the consumer index was recorded at 4.4 points in november , the fourth month of decline in a row , but december 's showed a slight increase to 4.5 points .
the gfk claimed on the back of the results that " the consumer climate has stabilized as the year draws to a close " and that the december figures were the result of people getting out to do their christmas shopping .
economists have forecast for some time that dropping german unemployment rates would boost consumer spending , historically the weak link in the country 's export-driven economy .
the rate of employment growth has already begun to taper off , however .
analysts credit other financial factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have rediscovered their love of shopping " household income and business cycle expectations are significantly down in the wake of slowing employment growth and inflation gaining speed but the willingness to buy is improving again , " said sylvain broyer , an analyst at corporate and investment bankers ixis-cib .
" this could be related to christmas but is also a consequence of a fading impact of the vat shock in spending habits . "
an increase in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 to 19 percent last january hit retail sales this year , notably for big-ticket items such as automobiles .
in 2008 , lower german exports and corporate investment are expected to slow economic growth to 2.0 percent from an estimated 2.4 percent in 2007 owing to the euro 's strength against the dollar , a weaker us economy , high prices for oil and other commodities and tighter credit conditions .
a spike in inflation caused by rising costs of energy and food products has also dampened consumer sentiment in the second half of 2007 .
institute looks forward to further boosts in 2008 bildunterschrift : germany 's shopping streets may thrive again in 2008 now however , gfk said " the current trend offers good opportunities for a boost in domestic demand in the coming year . "
the institute welcomed a government decision to lower unemployment insurance charges , saying it " will not only impact positively on purchasing power but will also have a favorable effect on employment . "
broyer added that if the vat shock faded , " consumer confidence could improve progressively next year . "
risks faced by the german economy , such as persistent inflation or continued turbulence on financial markets , could nonetheless quickly cause consumers to pull back and put more of their income into savings , gfk said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the consumer index was recorded at 4.4 points in november , the fourth month of decline in a row , but december 's showed a slight increase to 4.5 points .
the gfk claimed on the back of the results that " the consumer climate has stabilized as the year draws to a close " and that the december figures were the result of people getting out to do their christmas shopping .
economists have forecast for some time that dropping german unemployment rates would boost consumer spending , historically the weak link in the country 's export-driven economy .
the rate of employment growth has already begun to taper off , however .
analysts credit other financial factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have rediscovered their love of shopping " household income and business cycle expectations are significantly down in the wake of slowing employment growth and inflation gaining speed but the willingness to buy is improving again , " said sylvain broyer , an analyst at corporate and investment bankers ixis-cib .
" this could be related to christmas but is also a consequence of a fading impact of the vat shock in spending habits . "
an increase in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 to 19 percent last january hit retail sales this year , notably for big-ticket items such as automobiles .
in 2008 , lower german exports and corporate investment are expected to slow economic growth to 2.0 percent from an estimated 2.4 percent in 2007 owing to the euro 's strength against the dollar , a weaker us economy , high prices for oil and other commodities and tighter credit conditions .
a spike in inflation caused by rising costs of energy and food products has also dampened consumer sentiment in the second half of 2007 .
institute looks forward to further boosts in 2008 bildunterschrift : germany 's shopping streets may thrive again in 2008 now however , gfk said " the current trend offers good opportunities for a boost in domestic demand in the coming year . "
the institute welcomed a government decision to lower unemployment insurance charges , saying it " will not only impact positively on purchasing power but will also have a favorable effect on employment . "
broyer added that if the vat shock faded , " consumer confidence could improve progressively next year . "
risks faced by the german economy , such as persistent inflation or continued turbulence on financial markets , could nonetheless quickly cause consumers to pull back and put more of their income into savings , gfk said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the election generally failed to meet many osce commitments for democratic elections , " the organization for security and cooperation in europe said in a statement .
karimov won 88.1 percent of the sunday vote , the uzbek election commission said , compared with 91 percent in 2000 .
poll hugely flawed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karimov is said to preside over one of the most repressive governments the osce 's monitoring mission 's chief , walter siegl , underlined that because the three nominal challengers to karimov in sunday 's polls " publicly endorsed the incumbent , the electorate was deprived of a genuine choice . "
the osce fielded a team of just 26 observers to the ex-soviet republic of 28 million people , saying that the lack of competitive conditions for the vote made a bigger team pointless .
" the hardly visible election campaign was characterized by the absence of any real competition of ideas and political views , " the osce statement said .
" coverage of the campaign in the media was very limited , without debates among candidates , direct speeches or the presentation of alternative views , which could help the electorate make an informed choice . "

the uzbek election commission in november allowed karimov to stand for reelection for a third time though the constitution foresees no more than two terms for the president .
karimov has ruled the country , rich in natural gas and other resources , for the last 18 years .
during that time , karimov has suppressed independent political and religious activity , human rights groups say .
according to observers , karimov leads one of the most repressive governments in central asia .
opposition groups and human rights organizations described the vote as a farce because there was no real alternative to karimov .

but those who rushed to crown bayern before a ball was even kicked forgot that the league already had its own superstars . before this season got underway , everyone was braced for the usual blast of arrogance from the south of germany .
but instead of a warm front of imperiousness emanating from the area around bayern munich 's allianz arena , the rest of the country was hit by an icy blast of realism . the message from bavaria was the same as in previous years but this time the delivery and reception were different .
when general manager uli hoeness said that bayern would soon be so far off into the distance , their rivals would need binoculars to see them , he said so without the omnipresent braggadocio but with a cold assertion .
in response , the rest of germany just sadly nodded in agreement and started ruminating about who 'd be munich 's closest rivals . the reason for hoeness ' brusque dismissal of the other 17 teams in the bundesliga and the country 's acceptance of his statement as fact could be summed up in three words : klose , ribery , toni . unprecedented spending spree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the signing of the prolific klose put fear into munich 's rivals bayern 's unprecedented summer spending spree seemed to have sealed the championship deal before a ball had even been kicked in anger .
the acquisition of the german national team 's most prolific striker , france 's player of the year and an italian world cup-winning forward was more than just a statement of intent ; it was a declaration of closure .
game over , in other words . yet , with the bundesliga now tucked up in its thermal underwear and slippers for the winter , bayern 's trailblazing early league form is fading like the topic of a drunken conversation over christmas turkey leftovers . even though bayern have lost just once - a 3-1 reverse in stuttgart - ottmar hitzfeld 's side reverted to type as the season wore on with a methodical but slow-paced and ultimately blunt style of play .
as the winter break neared , bayern recorded four drab goalless draws in their last seven league fixtures against deep-lying teams whose sole aim was to smother , thwart and claim a point . bayern 's gallop reduced to a trot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzfeld 's honeymoon period is well and truly over the thoroughbred which was the only entry in a seemingly one-horse race lost its way and finally plodded to the midway point like a retired carthorse in need of a breather .
despite ending the first half of the season on top of the heap , bayern munich 's gallop has been reduced to a trudge . " it could end up a two-horse race , " uli hoeness recently conceded . while those who took great pain from agreeing with hoeness at the start of the season will now be celebrating the fact that the bavarian galacticos have been exposed as mere mortals , a more honorable celebration should be taking place .
bayern may have come a little unstuck but the fact that they lead the bundesliga on goal difference alone at the winter break should be heralded as a sign that german soccer is alive and well . the bundesliga is often ridiculed as the poor relation of the english premiership , spain 's primera liga and serie a in italy .
the soccer is viewed as below most european standards , the spectacle derided and the glamour deemed non-existent . all of which contributed to the view that a sizeable chunk of bayern 's fortune thrown at a trio of international stars would lead to a procession .
with such poor opposition being lined-up for them , it was no surprise that the lavishly put-together bavarian giants were expected to walk it . rival stars driving bayern 's competitors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's second season at bremen is eclipsing his first the league at the halfway point , however , tells a different story .
bayern , and the majority of non-partisan observers , have underestimated the other teams and the impact of many of the other international stars which have slowly contributed to the bundesliga 's rehabilitation . far from being a boring one-team march , this season 's bundesliga is looking like a competition worthy of attention with world stars catching the eye . inspired by diego , the league 's top playmaker and joint top scorer with nine goals , werder bremen have their own international stars driving their championship challenge . bremen looked to have sold their best chance of recapturing the league title when klose joined bayern in the summer but while munich were courting the big names of the 2006 world cup , bremen snapped up boubacar sanogo from hamburg and carlos alberto from porto .
the result is a second-placed team winning games with intercontinental flair . third-placed hamburg are also hot on munich 's heels thanks to another of the league 's superstars . bringing more quality to the league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van der vaart is one of the league 's shining lights the diminutive and prolific rafael van der vaart was a coup signing when he moved from ajax in 2005 .
while the dutchman 's decision to come to germany was a shock to many of those expecting a transfer to italy or spain , van der vaart has shown why he favored a german challenge by helping transform hsv 's fortunes and bringing more quality to the league . the bundesliga may not be able to boast as many big names as other leagues but those who have taken a chance in germany have given the bundesliga a dash of the flair and panache at times , certainly more than in recent years , and have contributed to the sold-out stadiums and thrilling match day atmosphere which are now back in fashion . with these world-class stars spread throughout the chasing pack , bayern munich 's coronation is on hold and the bundesliga is a lot better for it .
as a result , the future for german club soccer looks a lot rosier than it has for a number of years . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the election generally failed to meet many osce commitments for democratic elections , " the organization for security and cooperation in europe said in a statement .
karimov won 88.1 percent of the sunday vote , the uzbek election commission said , compared with 91 percent in 2000 .
poll hugely flawed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karimov is said to preside over one of the most repressive governments the osce 's monitoring mission 's chief , walter siegl , underlined that because the three nominal challengers to karimov in sunday 's polls " publicly endorsed the incumbent , the electorate was deprived of a genuine choice . "
the osce fielded a team of just 26 observers to the ex-soviet republic of 28 million people , saying that the lack of competitive conditions for the vote made a bigger team pointless .
" the hardly visible election campaign was characterized by the absence of any real competition of ideas and political views , " the osce statement said .
" coverage of the campaign in the media was very limited , without debates among candidates , direct speeches or the presentation of alternative views , which could help the electorate make an informed choice . "
the statement also questioned the " unusually high " turnout of 90.6 percent .
repressive government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is very little democratic debate going on in the uzbek parliament karimov said he was confident of being declared the winner following voting on sunday .
the people know that they are voting for peace and prosperity , the 69-year-old said in the capital tashkent .
the uzbek election commission in november allowed karimov to stand for reelection for a third time though the constitution foresees no more than two terms for the president .
karimov has ruled the country , rich in natural gas and other resources , for the last 18 years .
during that time , karimov has suppressed independent political and religious activity , human rights groups say .
according to observers , karimov leads one of the most repressive governments in central asia .
opposition groups and human rights organizations described the vote as a farce because there was no real alternative to karimov .

stanislav vavilov , deputy head of the central election commission , said that the " preliminary plan " was to invite observers " in the same number and time period " as for the parliamentary poll which was held on dec .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 24.12.2007 christmas credited for rise in germany 's economic fortunes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are waiting until the last minute to buy christmas gifts christmas has been credited with boosting germany 's slothful economy after the gfk institute showed that the euro zone 's biggest economy had benefited from a fresh taste for shopping . according to the financial institute 's consumer index , german shoppers , inspired by the festive season 's yuletide consumerism , had given the economy a boost in the month leading up to christmas .
the consumer index was recorded at 4.4 points in november , the fourth month of decline in a row , but december 's showed a slight increase to 4.5 points .
the gfk claimed on the back of the results that " the consumer climate has stabilized as the year draws to a close " and that the december figures were the result of people getting out to do their christmas shopping .
economists have forecast for some time that dropping german unemployment rates would boost consumer spending , historically the weak link in the country 's export-driven economy .
the rate of employment growth has already begun to taper off , however .
analysts credit other financial factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have rediscovered their love of shopping " household income and business cycle expectations are significantly down in the wake of slowing employment growth and inflation gaining speed but the willingness to buy is improving again , " said sylvain broyer , an analyst at corporate and investment bankers ixis-cib .
" this could be related to christmas but is also a consequence of a fading impact of the vat shock in spending habits . "
an increase in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 to 19 percent last january hit retail sales this year , notably for big-ticket items such as automobiles .
in 2008 , lower german exports and corporate investment are expected to slow economic growth to 2.0 percent from an estimated 2.4 percent in 2007 owing to the euro 's strength against the dollar , a weaker us economy , high prices for oil and other commodities and tighter credit conditions .
a spike in inflation caused by rising costs of energy and food products has also dampened consumer sentiment in the second half of 2007 .
institute looks forward to further boosts in 2008 bildunterschrift : germany 's shopping streets may thrive again in 2008 now however , gfk said " the current trend offers good opportunities for a boost in domestic demand in the coming year . "
the institute welcomed a government decision to lower unemployment insurance charges , saying it " will not only impact positively on purchasing power but will also have a favorable effect on employment . "
broyer added that if the vat shock faded , " consumer confidence could improve progressively next year . "
risks faced by the german economy , such as persistent inflation or continued turbulence on financial markets , could nonetheless quickly cause consumers to pull back and put more of their income into savings , gfk said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

just mouth along not a regular church-goer but still like to attend christmas mass ?
you 're not alone .
but please make sure you do n't embarrass yourself or irritate others by following this handy set of rules . attending christmas eve mass is a time-honored tradition in germany .
so much so , that on this one day of the year , normally empty churches are suddenly packed to overflowing with people jostling for a seat .
it would therefore not be amiss to suggest that most people at christmas mass are not regular church-goers , and as such , not overly familiar with the proper procedure .
but never fear , help is at hand , just in time for this christmas eve .
germany 's protestant press service , the evangelische pressedienst -lrb- epd -rrb- , has published a handbook of 10 golden rules to ensure that any once-a-year worshiper can survive christmas mass unscathed .
at the top of the epd 's list of rules : no mobile phones !
and seriously , is there anything more mortifying than your freshly downloaded " jingle bells " ringtone reverberating through the church in a moment of quiet prayer ?
be prepared to live without your cell for about an hour , the epd advises .
navigating holy water and hymns church attendees who wind up in a catholic house of worship may be puzzled about the little dish of water at the entrance .
why is everyone putting their fingers in it , and then touching their head , chest and shoulders ?
do n't panic .
it 's holy water , and catholics use it to bless themselves with the sign of the cross when they enter .
according to the epd , you can follow suit , but you do n't have to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : applauding at the end of the sermon is taboo rule three deals with singing .
in some churches , you 'll be handed a hymnal at the entrance .
the numbers on the board next to the altar indicate which hymns are meant to be sung throughout the service .
if the tune is unfamiliar , or you feel uncomfortable singing in public , do n't worry .
just sing along quietly or keep silent .
assuming you arrive at the church early enough , you may have a choice of seating - for some , a conundrum in itself .
the epd 's guide reassuringly informs you that you may sit wherever you like without your pew-mates wondering what business you have being in their church .
please do n't clap when it 's over but getting a seat is just the first hurdle .
all through the service , you will notice people around you at times sitting , standing , or kneeling .
how do they know when to do what ?
what if you give yourself away as a novice by standing when everyone else kneels ?
slow down , says the fifth rule .
watch the people around you , and do the same as they do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if in doubt , watch your neighbor the sixth rule is all about the sermon .
it usually lasts about 15 minutes and refers to a passage in the bible .
please do n't clap when it 's over .
you can always discuss the sermon with the priest afterwards .
other useful advice included in the golden rules concerns the collection basket .
you got into christmas mass for free , so do n't skimp when the basket comes your way as the proceeds generally go to a good cause .
once you 've made it this far , you 're practically home free .
but how do you recognize when the service has come to an end ?

just mouth along not a regular church-goer but still like to attend christmas mass ?
you 're not alone .
but please make sure you do n't embarrass yourself or irritate others by following this handy set of rules . attending christmas eve mass is a time-honored tradition in germany .
so much so , that on this one day of the year , normally empty churches are suddenly packed to overflowing with people jostling for a seat .
it would therefore not be amiss to suggest that most people at christmas mass are not regular church-goers , and as such , not overly familiar with the proper procedure .
but never fear , help is at hand , just in time for this christmas eve .
germany 's protestant press service , the evangelische pressedienst -lrb- epd -rrb- , has published a handbook of 10 golden rules to ensure that any once-a-year worshiper can survive christmas mass unscathed .
at the top of the epd 's list of rules : no mobile phones !
and seriously , is there anything more mortifying than your freshly downloaded " jingle bells " ringtone reverberating through the church in a moment of quiet prayer ?
be prepared to live without your cell for about an hour , the epd advises .
navigating holy water and hymns church attendees who wind up in a catholic house of worship may be puzzled about the little dish of water at the entrance .
why is everyone putting their fingers in it , and then touching their head , chest and shoulders ?
do n't panic .
it 's holy water , and catholics use it to bless themselves with the sign of the cross when they enter .
according to the epd , you can follow suit , but you do n't have to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : applauding at the end of the sermon is taboo rule three deals with singing .
in some churches , you 'll be handed a hymnal at the entrance .
the numbers on the board next to the altar indicate which hymns are meant to be sung throughout the service .
if the tune is unfamiliar , or you feel uncomfortable singing in public , do n't worry .
just sing along quietly or keep silent .
assuming you arrive at the church early enough , you may have a choice of seating - for some , a conundrum in itself .
the epd 's guide reassuringly informs you that you may sit wherever you like without your pew-mates wondering what business you have being in their church .
please do n't clap when it 's over but getting a seat is just the first hurdle .
all through the service , you will notice people around you at times sitting , standing , or kneeling .
how do they know when to do what ?
what if you give yourself away as a novice by standing when everyone else kneels ?
slow down , says the fifth rule .
watch the people around you , and do the same as they do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if in doubt , watch your neighbor the sixth rule is all about the sermon .
it usually lasts about 15 minutes and refers to a passage in the bible .
please do n't clap when it 's over .
you can always discuss the sermon with the priest afterwards .
other useful advice included in the golden rules concerns the collection basket .
you got into christmas mass for free , so do n't skimp when the basket comes your way as the proceeds generally go to a good cause .
once you 've made it this far , you 're practically home free .
but how do you recognize when the service has come to an end ?
watch for the blessing , the epd advises .
sometimes , you may hear organ music .
just stay seated and listen .
then , it 's polite to wish your neighbor a merry christmas . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

taking on the presidency is an unprecedented challenge for the affluent alpine country of 2 million people .
slovenia declared independence from yugoslavia in 1991 .
in the years since , it has sprinted towards the west , joining both the eu and nato in 2004 .
now , it 's the first new eu member country to lead the 27-nation bloc .
" this is a historic project for us , " said slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel . " it 's not normal for us to be asked to lead such a presidency and so we want to make an extra effort . "
slovenia has budgeted 62 million euros -lrb- $ 91 million -rrb- as it has hired a slew of translators and advisors to make sure the next six months go over smoothly . the country will be responsible for organizing dozens of conferences , including minister-level meetings .

the three countries decided to combine forces to set an agenda that would provide the bloc with more continuity .
other agenda points will be determined by events outside the eu 's direct control .
it 's widely assumed that the serbian breakaway province of kosovo will declare independence before slovenia 's presidency is up in june of 2008 .
recent united nations security council efforts to mediate a solution between serbia and kosovo have failed .
and the eu has begun to debate how it should react if the southern serbian province does declare independence .
rupel said the eu and kosovo must " agree on what to do next . "
rupel has carefully avoided using the word " independence " when referring to kosovo , but did say that europe is ready to " recognize the realities of the situation in the western balkans . "
" we believe it is high time for the yugoslav crisis to be over , " rupel told journalists .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 24.12.2007 christmas credited for rise in germany 's economic fortunes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are waiting until the last minute to buy christmas gifts christmas has been credited with boosting germany 's slothful economy after the gfk institute showed that the euro zone 's biggest economy had benefited from a fresh taste for shopping . according to the financial institute 's consumer index , german shoppers , inspired by the festive season 's yuletide consumerism , had given the economy a boost in the month leading up to christmas .
the consumer index was recorded at 4.4 points in november , the fourth month of decline in a row , but december 's showed a slight increase to 4.5 points .
the gfk claimed on the back of the results that " the consumer climate has stabilized as the year draws to a close " and that the december figures were the result of people getting out to do their christmas shopping .
economists have forecast for some time that dropping german unemployment rates would boost consumer spending , historically the weak link in the country 's export-driven economy .
the rate of employment growth has already begun to taper off , however .
analysts credit other financial factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have rediscovered their love of shopping " household income and business cycle expectations are significantly down in the wake of slowing employment growth and inflation gaining speed but the willingness to buy is improving again , " said sylvain broyer , an analyst at corporate and investment bankers ixis-cib .
" this could be related to christmas but is also a consequence of a fading impact of the vat shock in spending habits . "
an increase in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 to 19 percent last january hit retail sales this year , notably for big-ticket items such as automobiles .
in 2008 , lower german exports and corporate investment are expected to slow economic growth to 2.0 percent from an estimated 2.4 percent in 2007 owing to the euro 's strength against the dollar , a weaker us economy , high prices for oil and other commodities and tighter credit conditions .
a spike in inflation caused by rising costs of energy and food products has also dampened consumer sentiment in the second half of 2007 .
institute looks forward to further boosts in 2008 bildunterschrift : germany 's shopping streets may thrive again in 2008 now however , gfk said " the current trend offers good opportunities for a boost in domestic demand in the coming year . "
the institute welcomed a government decision to lower unemployment insurance charges , saying it " will not only impact positively on purchasing power but will also have a favorable effect on employment . "
broyer added that if the vat shock faded , " consumer confidence could improve progressively next year . "
risks faced by the german economy , such as persistent inflation or continued turbulence on financial markets , could nonetheless quickly cause consumers to pull back and put more of their income into savings , gfk said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the election generally failed to meet many osce commitments for democratic elections , " the organization for security and cooperation in europe said in a statement .
karimov won 88.1 percent of the sunday vote , the uzbek election commission said , compared with 91 percent in 2000 .
poll hugely flawed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karimov is said to preside over one of the most repressive governments the osce 's monitoring mission 's chief , walter siegl , underlined that because the three nominal challengers to karimov in sunday 's polls " publicly endorsed the incumbent , the electorate was deprived of a genuine choice . "
the osce fielded a team of just 26 observers to the ex-soviet republic of 28 million people , saying that the lack of competitive conditions for the vote made a bigger team pointless .
" the hardly visible election campaign was characterized by the absence of any real competition of ideas and political views , " the osce statement said .
" coverage of the campaign in the media was very limited , without debates among candidates , direct speeches or the presentation of alternative views , which could help the electorate make an informed choice . "
the statement also questioned the " unusually high " turnout of 90.6 percent .
repressive government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is very little democratic debate going on in the uzbek parliament karimov said he was confident of being declared the winner following voting on sunday .
the people know that they are voting for peace and prosperity , the 69-year-old said in the capital tashkent .
the uzbek election commission in november allowed karimov to stand for reelection for a third time though the constitution foresees no more than two terms for the president .
karimov has ruled the country , rich in natural gas and other resources , for the last 18 years .
during that time , karimov has suppressed independent political and religious activity , human rights groups say .
according to observers , karimov leads one of the most repressive governments in central asia .
opposition groups and human rights organizations described the vote as a farce because there was no real alternative to karimov .

but those who rushed to crown bayern before a ball was even kicked forgot that the league already had its own superstars . before this season got underway , everyone was braced for the usual blast of arrogance from the south of germany .
but instead of a warm front of imperiousness emanating from the area around bayern munich 's allianz arena , the rest of the country was hit by an icy blast of realism . the message from bavaria was the same as in previous years but this time the delivery and reception were different .
when general manager uli hoeness said that bayern would soon be so far off into the distance , their rivals would need binoculars to see them , he said so without the omnipresent braggadocio but with a cold assertion .
in response , the rest of germany just sadly nodded in agreement and started ruminating about who 'd be munich 's closest rivals . the reason for hoeness ' brusque dismissal of the other 17 teams in the bundesliga and the country 's acceptance of his statement as fact could be summed up in three words : klose , ribery , toni . unprecedented spending spree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the signing of the prolific klose put fear into munich 's rivals bayern 's unprecedented summer spending spree seemed to have sealed the championship deal before a ball had even been kicked in anger .
the acquisition of the german national team 's most prolific striker , france 's player of the year and an italian world cup-winning forward was more than just a statement of intent ; it was a declaration of closure .
game over , in other words . yet , with the bundesliga now tucked up in its thermal underwear and slippers for the winter , bayern 's trailblazing early league form is fading like the topic of a drunken conversation over christmas turkey leftovers . even though bayern have lost just once - a 3-1 reverse in stuttgart - ottmar hitzfeld 's side reverted to type as the season wore on with a methodical but slow-paced and ultimately blunt style of play .

despite ending the first half of the season on top of the heap , bayern munich 's gallop has been reduced to a trudge . " it could end up a two-horse race , " uli hoeness recently conceded . while those who took great pain from agreeing with hoeness at the start of the season will now be celebrating the fact that the bavarian galacticos have been exposed as mere mortals , a more honorable celebration should be taking place .
bayern may have come a little unstuck but the fact that they lead the bundesliga on goal difference alone at the winter break should be heralded as a sign that german soccer is alive and well . the bundesliga is often ridiculed as the poor relation of the english premiership , spain 's primera liga and serie a in italy .
the soccer is viewed as below most european standards , the spectacle derided and the glamour deemed non-existent . all of which contributed to the view that a sizeable chunk of bayern 's fortune thrown at a trio of international stars would lead to a procession .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 24.12.2007 world class stars aiding bundesliga 's rehabilitation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's luca toni and franck ribery joined a league slowly recruiting superstar players when bayern munich bought some of the world 's most wanted players , it looked like game over .
but those who rushed to crown bayern before a ball was even kicked forgot that the league already had its own superstars . before this season got underway , everyone was braced for the usual blast of arrogance from the south of germany .
but instead of a warm front of imperiousness emanating from the area around bayern munich 's allianz arena , the rest of the country was hit by an icy blast of realism . the message from bavaria was the same as in previous years but this time the delivery and reception were different .
when general manager uli hoeness said that bayern would soon be so far off into the distance , their rivals would need binoculars to see them , he said so without the omnipresent braggadocio but with a cold assertion .
in response , the rest of germany just sadly nodded in agreement and started ruminating about who 'd be munich 's closest rivals . the reason for hoeness ' brusque dismissal of the other 17 teams in the bundesliga and the country 's acceptance of his statement as fact could be summed up in three words : klose , ribery , toni . unprecedented spending spree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the signing of the prolific klose put fear into munich 's rivals bayern 's unprecedented summer spending spree seemed to have sealed the championship deal before a ball had even been kicked in anger .
the acquisition of the german national team 's most prolific striker , france 's player of the year and an italian world cup-winning forward was more than just a statement of intent ; it was a declaration of closure .
game over , in other words . yet , with the bundesliga now tucked up in its thermal underwear and slippers for the winter , bayern 's trailblazing early league form is fading like the topic of a drunken conversation over christmas turkey leftovers . even though bayern have lost just once - a 3-1 reverse in stuttgart - ottmar hitzfeld 's side reverted to type as the season wore on with a methodical but slow-paced and ultimately blunt style of play .
as the winter break neared , bayern recorded four drab goalless draws in their last seven league fixtures against deep-lying teams whose sole aim was to smother , thwart and claim a point . bayern 's gallop reduced to a trot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzfeld 's honeymoon period is well and truly over the thoroughbred which was the only entry in a seemingly one-horse race lost its way and finally plodded to the midway point like a retired carthorse in need of a breather .
despite ending the first half of the season on top of the heap , bayern munich 's gallop has been reduced to a trudge . " it could end up a two-horse race , " uli hoeness recently conceded . while those who took great pain from agreeing with hoeness at the start of the season will now be celebrating the fact that the bavarian galacticos have been exposed as mere mortals , a more honorable celebration should be taking place .
bayern may have come a little unstuck but the fact that they lead the bundesliga on goal difference alone at the winter break should be heralded as a sign that german soccer is alive and well . the bundesliga is often ridiculed as the poor relation of the english premiership , spain 's primera liga and serie a in italy .
the soccer is viewed as below most european standards , the spectacle derided and the glamour deemed non-existent . all of which contributed to the view that a sizeable chunk of bayern 's fortune thrown at a trio of international stars would lead to a procession .
with such poor opposition being lined-up for them , it was no surprise that the lavishly put-together bavarian giants were expected to walk it . rival stars driving bayern 's competitors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's second season at bremen is eclipsing his first the league at the halfway point , however , tells a different story .
bayern , and the majority of non-partisan observers , have underestimated the other teams and the impact of many of the other international stars which have slowly contributed to the bundesliga 's rehabilitation . far from being a boring one-team march , this season 's bundesliga is looking like a competition worthy of attention with world stars catching the eye . inspired by diego , the league 's top playmaker and joint top scorer with nine goals , werder bremen have their own international stars driving their championship challenge . bremen looked to have sold their best chance of recapturing the league title when klose joined bayern in the summer but while munich were courting the big names of the 2006 world cup , bremen snapped up boubacar sanogo from hamburg and carlos alberto from porto .
the result is a second-placed team winning games with intercontinental flair . third-placed hamburg are also hot on munich 's heels thanks to another of the league 's superstars . bringing more quality to the league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van der vaart is one of the league 's shining lights the diminutive and prolific rafael van der vaart was a coup signing when he moved from ajax in 2005 .

taking on the presidency is an unprecedented challenge for the affluent alpine country of 2 million people .
slovenia declared independence from yugoslavia in 1991 .
in the years since , it has sprinted towards the west , joining both the eu and nato in 2004 .
now , it 's the first new eu member country to lead the 27-nation bloc .
" this is a historic project for us , " said slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel . " it 's not normal for us to be asked to lead such a presidency and so we want to make an extra effort . "
slovenia has budgeted 62 million euros -lrb- $ 91 million -rrb- as it has hired a slew of translators and advisors to make sure the next six months go over smoothly . the country will be responsible for organizing dozens of conferences , including minister-level meetings .
slovenia sees the presidency as a chance to increase its visibility in europe .

in many ways , slovenia will carry on the priorities - such as climate change and job creation initiatives - started by its predecessors .
the three countries decided to combine forces to set an agenda that would provide the bloc with more continuity .
other agenda points will be determined by events outside the eu 's direct control .
it 's widely assumed that the serbian breakaway province of kosovo will declare independence before slovenia 's presidency is up in june of 2008 .
recent united nations security council efforts to mediate a solution between serbia and kosovo have failed .
and the eu has begun to debate how it should react if the southern serbian province does declare independence .
rupel said the eu and kosovo must " agree on what to do next . "
rupel has carefully avoided using the word " independence " when referring to kosovo , but did say that europe is ready to " recognize the realities of the situation in the western balkans . "
" we believe it is high time for the yugoslav crisis to be over , " rupel told journalists .

he dismissed concerns that slovenia might be influenced by strong business ties to serbia .

" we are not one-sided in this case .
slovenia has excellent cooperation with serbia , also kosovo , with all former yugoslav republics . "
yet slovenia 's ability to lead in the area could be tricky given ongoing border disputes with neighboring croatia .

just mouth along not a regular church-goer but still like to attend christmas mass ?
you 're not alone .
but please make sure you do n't embarrass yourself or irritate others by following this handy set of rules . attending christmas eve mass is a time-honored tradition in germany .
so much so , that on this one day of the year , normally empty churches are suddenly packed to overflowing with people jostling for a seat .
it would therefore not be amiss to suggest that most people at christmas mass are not regular church-goers , and as such , not overly familiar with the proper procedure .
but never fear , help is at hand , just in time for this christmas eve .
germany 's protestant press service , the evangelische pressedienst -lrb- epd -rrb- , has published a handbook of 10 golden rules to ensure that any once-a-year worshiper can survive christmas mass unscathed .
at the top of the epd 's list of rules : no mobile phones !
and seriously , is there anything more mortifying than your freshly downloaded " jingle bells " ringtone reverberating through the church in a moment of quiet prayer ?
be prepared to live without your cell for about an hour , the epd advises .
navigating holy water and hymns church attendees who wind up in a catholic house of worship may be puzzled about the little dish of water at the entrance .
why is everyone putting their fingers in it , and then touching their head , chest and shoulders ?

and seriously , is there anything more mortifying than your freshly downloaded " jingle bells " ringtone reverberating through the church in a moment of quiet prayer ?
be prepared to live without your cell for about an hour , the epd advises .
navigating holy water and hymns church attendees who wind up in a catholic house of worship may be puzzled about the little dish of water at the entrance .
why is everyone putting their fingers in it , and then touching their head , chest and shoulders ?
do n't panic .
it 's holy water , and catholics use it to bless themselves with the sign of the cross when they enter .
according to the epd , you can follow suit , but you do n't have to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : applauding at the end of the sermon is taboo rule three deals with singing .
in some churches , you 'll be handed a hymnal at the entrance .
the numbers on the board next to the altar indicate which hymns are meant to be sung throughout the service .
if the tune is unfamiliar , or you feel uncomfortable singing in public , do n't worry .
just sing along quietly or keep silent .
assuming you arrive at the church early enough , you may have a choice of seating - for some , a conundrum in itself .
the epd 's guide reassuringly informs you that you may sit wherever you like without your pew-mates wondering what business you have being in their church .
please do n't clap when it 's over but getting a seat is just the first hurdle .
all through the service , you will notice people around you at times sitting , standing , or kneeling .
how do they know when to do what ?
what if you give yourself away as a novice by standing when everyone else kneels ?
slow down , says the fifth rule .
watch the people around you , and do the same as they do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if in doubt , watch your neighbor the sixth rule is all about the sermon .
it usually lasts about 15 minutes and refers to a passage in the bible .
please do n't clap when it 's over .
you can always discuss the sermon with the priest afterwards .
other useful advice included in the golden rules concerns the collection basket .
you got into christmas mass for free , so do n't skimp when the basket comes your way as the proceeds generally go to a good cause .
once you 've made it this far , you 're practically home free .
but how do you recognize when the service has come to an end ?
watch for the blessing , the epd advises .
sometimes , you may hear organ music .
just stay seated and listen .
then , it 's polite to wish your neighbor a merry christmas . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

just mouth along not a regular church-goer but still like to attend christmas mass ?
you 're not alone .
but please make sure you do n't embarrass yourself or irritate others by following this handy set of rules . attending christmas eve mass is a time-honored tradition in germany .
so much so , that on this one day of the year , normally empty churches are suddenly packed to overflowing with people jostling for a seat .
it would therefore not be amiss to suggest that most people at christmas mass are not regular church-goers , and as such , not overly familiar with the proper procedure .
but never fear , help is at hand , just in time for this christmas eve .
germany 's protestant press service , the evangelische pressedienst -lrb- epd -rrb- , has published a handbook of 10 golden rules to ensure that any once-a-year worshiper can survive christmas mass unscathed .

the consumer index was recorded at 4.4 points in november , the fourth month of decline in a row , but december 's showed a slight increase to 4.5 points .
the gfk claimed on the back of the results that " the consumer climate has stabilized as the year draws to a close " and that the december figures were the result of people getting out to do their christmas shopping .
economists have forecast for some time that dropping german unemployment rates would boost consumer spending , historically the weak link in the country 's export-driven economy .

analysts credit other financial factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have rediscovered their love of shopping " household income and business cycle expectations are significantly down in the wake of slowing employment growth and inflation gaining speed but the willingness to buy is improving again , " said sylvain broyer , an analyst at corporate and investment bankers ixis-cib .
" this could be related to christmas but is also a consequence of a fading impact of the vat shock in spending habits . "
an increase in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 to 19 percent last january hit retail sales this year , notably for big-ticket items such as automobiles .
in 2008 , lower german exports and corporate investment are expected to slow economic growth to 2.0 percent from an estimated 2.4 percent in 2007 owing to the euro 's strength against the dollar , a weaker us economy , high prices for oil and other commodities and tighter credit conditions .
a spike in inflation caused by rising costs of energy and food products has also dampened consumer sentiment in the second half of 2007 .

the institute welcomed a government decision to lower unemployment insurance charges , saying it " will not only impact positively on purchasing power but will also have a favorable effect on employment . "
broyer added that if the vat shock faded , " consumer confidence could improve progressively next year . "
risks faced by the german economy , such as persistent inflation or continued turbulence on financial markets , could nonetheless quickly cause consumers to pull back and put more of their income into savings , gfk said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 24.12.2007 christmas credited for rise in germany 's economic fortunes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans are waiting until the last minute to buy christmas gifts christmas has been credited with boosting germany 's slothful economy after the gfk institute showed that the euro zone 's biggest economy had benefited from a fresh taste for shopping . according to the financial institute 's consumer index , german shoppers , inspired by the festive season 's yuletide consumerism , had given the economy a boost in the month leading up to christmas .
the consumer index was recorded at 4.4 points in november , the fourth month of decline in a row , but december 's showed a slight increase to 4.5 points .
the gfk claimed on the back of the results that " the consumer climate has stabilized as the year draws to a close " and that the december figures were the result of people getting out to do their christmas shopping .
economists have forecast for some time that dropping german unemployment rates would boost consumer spending , historically the weak link in the country 's export-driven economy .
the rate of employment growth has already begun to taper off , however .
analysts credit other financial factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have rediscovered their love of shopping " household income and business cycle expectations are significantly down in the wake of slowing employment growth and inflation gaining speed but the willingness to buy is improving again , " said sylvain broyer , an analyst at corporate and investment bankers ixis-cib .
" this could be related to christmas but is also a consequence of a fading impact of the vat shock in spending habits . "
an increase in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 to 19 percent last january hit retail sales this year , notably for big-ticket items such as automobiles .
in 2008 , lower german exports and corporate investment are expected to slow economic growth to 2.0 percent from an estimated 2.4 percent in 2007 owing to the euro 's strength against the dollar , a weaker us economy , high prices for oil and other commodities and tighter credit conditions .
a spike in inflation caused by rising costs of energy and food products has also dampened consumer sentiment in the second half of 2007 .
institute looks forward to further boosts in 2008 bildunterschrift : germany 's shopping streets may thrive again in 2008 now however , gfk said " the current trend offers good opportunities for a boost in domestic demand in the coming year . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 24.12.2007 world class stars aiding bundesliga 's rehabilitation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's luca toni and franck ribery joined a league slowly recruiting superstar players when bayern munich bought some of the world 's most wanted players , it looked like game over .
but those who rushed to crown bayern before a ball was even kicked forgot that the league already had its own superstars . before this season got underway , everyone was braced for the usual blast of arrogance from the south of germany .
but instead of a warm front of imperiousness emanating from the area around bayern munich 's allianz arena , the rest of the country was hit by an icy blast of realism . the message from bavaria was the same as in previous years but this time the delivery and reception were different .
when general manager uli hoeness said that bayern would soon be so far off into the distance , their rivals would need binoculars to see them , he said so without the omnipresent braggadocio but with a cold assertion .
in response , the rest of germany just sadly nodded in agreement and started ruminating about who 'd be munich 's closest rivals . the reason for hoeness ' brusque dismissal of the other 17 teams in the bundesliga and the country 's acceptance of his statement as fact could be summed up in three words : klose , ribery , toni . unprecedented spending spree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the signing of the prolific klose put fear into munich 's rivals bayern 's unprecedented summer spending spree seemed to have sealed the championship deal before a ball had even been kicked in anger .
the acquisition of the german national team 's most prolific striker , france 's player of the year and an italian world cup-winning forward was more than just a statement of intent ; it was a declaration of closure .
game over , in other words . yet , with the bundesliga now tucked up in its thermal underwear and slippers for the winter , bayern 's trailblazing early league form is fading like the topic of a drunken conversation over christmas turkey leftovers . even though bayern have lost just once - a 3-1 reverse in stuttgart - ottmar hitzfeld 's side reverted to type as the season wore on with a methodical but slow-paced and ultimately blunt style of play .
as the winter break neared , bayern recorded four drab goalless draws in their last seven league fixtures against deep-lying teams whose sole aim was to smother , thwart and claim a point . bayern 's gallop reduced to a trot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzfeld 's honeymoon period is well and truly over the thoroughbred which was the only entry in a seemingly one-horse race lost its way and finally plodded to the midway point like a retired carthorse in need of a breather .
despite ending the first half of the season on top of the heap , bayern munich 's gallop has been reduced to a trudge . " it could end up a two-horse race , " uli hoeness recently conceded . while those who took great pain from agreeing with hoeness at the start of the season will now be celebrating the fact that the bavarian galacticos have been exposed as mere mortals , a more honorable celebration should be taking place .
bayern may have come a little unstuck but the fact that they lead the bundesliga on goal difference alone at the winter break should be heralded as a sign that german soccer is alive and well . the bundesliga is often ridiculed as the poor relation of the english premiership , spain 's primera liga and serie a in italy .
the soccer is viewed as below most european standards , the spectacle derided and the glamour deemed non-existent . all of which contributed to the view that a sizeable chunk of bayern 's fortune thrown at a trio of international stars would lead to a procession .
with such poor opposition being lined-up for them , it was no surprise that the lavishly put-together bavarian giants were expected to walk it . rival stars driving bayern 's competitors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's second season at bremen is eclipsing his first the league at the halfway point , however , tells a different story .
bayern , and the majority of non-partisan observers , have underestimated the other teams and the impact of many of the other international stars which have slowly contributed to the bundesliga 's rehabilitation . far from being a boring one-team march , this season 's bundesliga is looking like a competition worthy of attention with world stars catching the eye . inspired by diego , the league 's top playmaker and joint top scorer with nine goals , werder bremen have their own international stars driving their championship challenge . bremen looked to have sold their best chance of recapturing the league title when klose joined bayern in the summer but while munich were courting the big names of the 2006 world cup , bremen snapped up boubacar sanogo from hamburg and carlos alberto from porto .
the result is a second-placed team winning games with intercontinental flair . third-placed hamburg are also hot on munich 's heels thanks to another of the league 's superstars . bringing more quality to the league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van der vaart is one of the league 's shining lights the diminutive and prolific rafael van der vaart was a coup signing when he moved from ajax in 2005 .
while the dutchman 's decision to come to germany was a shock to many of those expecting a transfer to italy or spain , van der vaart has shown why he favored a german challenge by helping transform hsv 's fortunes and bringing more quality to the league . the bundesliga may not be able to boast as many big names as other leagues but those who have taken a chance in germany have given the bundesliga a dash of the flair and panache at times , certainly more than in recent years , and have contributed to the sold-out stadiums and thrilling match day atmosphere which are now back in fashion . with these world-class stars spread throughout the chasing pack , bayern munich 's coronation is on hold and the bundesliga is a lot better for it .
as a result , the future for german club soccer looks a lot rosier than it has for a number of years . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

just mouth along not a regular church-goer but still like to attend christmas mass ?
you 're not alone .
but please make sure you do n't embarrass yourself or irritate others by following this handy set of rules . attending christmas eve mass is a time-honored tradition in germany .
so much so , that on this one day of the year , normally empty churches are suddenly packed to overflowing with people jostling for a seat .
it would therefore not be amiss to suggest that most people at christmas mass are not regular church-goers , and as such , not overly familiar with the proper procedure .
but never fear , help is at hand , just in time for this christmas eve .
germany 's protestant press service , the evangelische pressedienst -lrb- epd -rrb- , has published a handbook of 10 golden rules to ensure that any once-a-year worshiper can survive christmas mass unscathed .
at the top of the epd 's list of rules : no mobile phones !
and seriously , is there anything more mortifying than your freshly downloaded " jingle bells " ringtone reverberating through the church in a moment of quiet prayer ?
be prepared to live without your cell for about an hour , the epd advises .
navigating holy water and hymns church attendees who wind up in a catholic house of worship may be puzzled about the little dish of water at the entrance .
why is everyone putting their fingers in it , and then touching their head , chest and shoulders ?
do n't panic .
it 's holy water , and catholics use it to bless themselves with the sign of the cross when they enter .
according to the epd , you can follow suit , but you do n't have to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : applauding at the end of the sermon is taboo rule three deals with singing .
in some churches , you 'll be handed a hymnal at the entrance .
the numbers on the board next to the altar indicate which hymns are meant to be sung throughout the service .
if the tune is unfamiliar , or you feel uncomfortable singing in public , do n't worry .
just sing along quietly or keep silent .
assuming you arrive at the church early enough , you may have a choice of seating - for some , a conundrum in itself .
the epd 's guide reassuringly informs you that you may sit wherever you like without your pew-mates wondering what business you have being in their church .
please do n't clap when it 's over but getting a seat is just the first hurdle .
all through the service , you will notice people around you at times sitting , standing , or kneeling .
how do they know when to do what ?
what if you give yourself away as a novice by standing when everyone else kneels ?
slow down , says the fifth rule .
watch the people around you , and do the same as they do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if in doubt , watch your neighbor the sixth rule is all about the sermon .
it usually lasts about 15 minutes and refers to a passage in the bible .
please do n't clap when it 's over .
you can always discuss the sermon with the priest afterwards .
other useful advice included in the golden rules concerns the collection basket .
you got into christmas mass for free , so do n't skimp when the basket comes your way as the proceeds generally go to a good cause .
once you 've made it this far , you 're practically home free .
but how do you recognize when the service has come to an end ?
watch for the blessing , the epd advises .

just mouth along not a regular church-goer but still like to attend christmas mass ?
you 're not alone .
but please make sure you do n't embarrass yourself or irritate others by following this handy set of rules . attending christmas eve mass is a time-honored tradition in germany .
so much so , that on this one day of the year , normally empty churches are suddenly packed to overflowing with people jostling for a seat .
it would therefore not be amiss to suggest that most people at christmas mass are not regular church-goers , and as such , not overly familiar with the proper procedure .
but never fear , help is at hand , just in time for this christmas eve .
germany 's protestant press service , the evangelische pressedienst -lrb- epd -rrb- , has published a handbook of 10 golden rules to ensure that any once-a-year worshiper can survive christmas mass unscathed .
at the top of the epd 's list of rules : no mobile phones !
and seriously , is there anything more mortifying than your freshly downloaded " jingle bells " ringtone reverberating through the church in a moment of quiet prayer ?
be prepared to live without your cell for about an hour , the epd advises .
navigating holy water and hymns church attendees who wind up in a catholic house of worship may be puzzled about the little dish of water at the entrance .
why is everyone putting their fingers in it , and then touching their head , chest and shoulders ?
do n't panic .
it 's holy water , and catholics use it to bless themselves with the sign of the cross when they enter .
according to the epd , you can follow suit , but you do n't have to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : applauding at the end of the sermon is taboo rule three deals with singing .
in some churches , you 'll be handed a hymnal at the entrance .
the numbers on the board next to the altar indicate which hymns are meant to be sung throughout the service .
if the tune is unfamiliar , or you feel uncomfortable singing in public , do n't worry .
just sing along quietly or keep silent .
assuming you arrive at the church early enough , you may have a choice of seating - for some , a conundrum in itself .
the epd 's guide reassuringly informs you that you may sit wherever you like without your pew-mates wondering what business you have being in their church .
please do n't clap when it 's over but getting a seat is just the first hurdle .
all through the service , you will notice people around you at times sitting , standing , or kneeling .
how do they know when to do what ?
what if you give yourself away as a novice by standing when everyone else kneels ?
slow down , says the fifth rule .
watch the people around you , and do the same as they do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if in doubt , watch your neighbor the sixth rule is all about the sermon .
it usually lasts about 15 minutes and refers to a passage in the bible .
please do n't clap when it 's over .
you can always discuss the sermon with the priest afterwards .
other useful advice included in the golden rules concerns the collection basket .
you got into christmas mass for free , so do n't skimp when the basket comes your way as the proceeds generally go to a good cause .
once you 've made it this far , you 're practically home free .
but how do you recognize when the service has come to an end ?

but those who rushed to crown bayern before a ball was even kicked forgot that the league already had its own superstars . before this season got underway , everyone was braced for the usual blast of arrogance from the south of germany .
but instead of a warm front of imperiousness emanating from the area around bayern munich 's allianz arena , the rest of the country was hit by an icy blast of realism . the message from bavaria was the same as in previous years but this time the delivery and reception were different .
when general manager uli hoeness said that bayern would soon be so far off into the distance , their rivals would need binoculars to see them , he said so without the omnipresent braggadocio but with a cold assertion .
in response , the rest of germany just sadly nodded in agreement and started ruminating about who 'd be munich 's closest rivals . the reason for hoeness ' brusque dismissal of the other 17 teams in the bundesliga and the country 's acceptance of his statement as fact could be summed up in three words : klose , ribery , toni . unprecedented spending spree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the signing of the prolific klose put fear into munich 's rivals bayern 's unprecedented summer spending spree seemed to have sealed the championship deal before a ball had even been kicked in anger .
the acquisition of the german national team 's most prolific striker , france 's player of the year and an italian world cup-winning forward was more than just a statement of intent ; it was a declaration of closure .
game over , in other words . yet , with the bundesliga now tucked up in its thermal underwear and slippers for the winter , bayern 's trailblazing early league form is fading like the topic of a drunken conversation over christmas turkey leftovers . even though bayern have lost just once - a 3-1 reverse in stuttgart - ottmar hitzfeld 's side reverted to type as the season wore on with a methodical but slow-paced and ultimately blunt style of play .
as the winter break neared , bayern recorded four drab goalless draws in their last seven league fixtures against deep-lying teams whose sole aim was to smother , thwart and claim a point . bayern 's gallop reduced to a trot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzfeld 's honeymoon period is well and truly over the thoroughbred which was the only entry in a seemingly one-horse race lost its way and finally plodded to the midway point like a retired carthorse in need of a breather .
despite ending the first half of the season on top of the heap , bayern munich 's gallop has been reduced to a trudge . " it could end up a two-horse race , " uli hoeness recently conceded . while those who took great pain from agreeing with hoeness at the start of the season will now be celebrating the fact that the bavarian galacticos have been exposed as mere mortals , a more honorable celebration should be taking place .
bayern may have come a little unstuck but the fact that they lead the bundesliga on goal difference alone at the winter break should be heralded as a sign that german soccer is alive and well . the bundesliga is often ridiculed as the poor relation of the english premiership , spain 's primera liga and serie a in italy .
the soccer is viewed as below most european standards , the spectacle derided and the glamour deemed non-existent . all of which contributed to the view that a sizeable chunk of bayern 's fortune thrown at a trio of international stars would lead to a procession .

bayern , and the majority of non-partisan observers , have underestimated the other teams and the impact of many of the other international stars which have slowly contributed to the bundesliga 's rehabilitation . far from being a boring one-team march , this season 's bundesliga is looking like a competition worthy of attention with world stars catching the eye . inspired by diego , the league 's top playmaker and joint top scorer with nine goals , werder bremen have their own international stars driving their championship challenge . bremen looked to have sold their best chance of recapturing the league title when klose joined bayern in the summer but while munich were courting the big names of the 2006 world cup , bremen snapped up boubacar sanogo from hamburg and carlos alberto from porto .
the result is a second-placed team winning games with intercontinental flair . third-placed hamburg are also hot on munich 's heels thanks to another of the league 's superstars . bringing more quality to the league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van der vaart is one of the league 's shining lights the diminutive and prolific rafael van der vaart was a coup signing when he moved from ajax in 2005 .

but those who rushed to crown bayern before a ball was even kicked forgot that the league already had its own superstars . before this season got underway , everyone was braced for the usual blast of arrogance from the south of germany .
but instead of a warm front of imperiousness emanating from the area around bayern munich 's allianz arena , the rest of the country was hit by an icy blast of realism . the message from bavaria was the same as in previous years but this time the delivery and reception were different .
when general manager uli hoeness said that bayern would soon be so far off into the distance , their rivals would need binoculars to see them , he said so without the omnipresent braggadocio but with a cold assertion .
in response , the rest of germany just sadly nodded in agreement and started ruminating about who 'd be munich 's closest rivals . the reason for hoeness ' brusque dismissal of the other 17 teams in the bundesliga and the country 's acceptance of his statement as fact could be summed up in three words : klose , ribery , toni . unprecedented spending spree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the signing of the prolific klose put fear into munich 's rivals bayern 's unprecedented summer spending spree seemed to have sealed the championship deal before a ball had even been kicked in anger .
the acquisition of the german national team 's most prolific striker , france 's player of the year and an italian world cup-winning forward was more than just a statement of intent ; it was a declaration of closure .
game over , in other words . yet , with the bundesliga now tucked up in its thermal underwear and slippers for the winter , bayern 's trailblazing early league form is fading like the topic of a drunken conversation over christmas turkey leftovers . even though bayern have lost just once - a 3-1 reverse in stuttgart - ottmar hitzfeld 's side reverted to type as the season wore on with a methodical but slow-paced and ultimately blunt style of play .

despite ending the first half of the season on top of the heap , bayern munich 's gallop has been reduced to a trudge . " it could end up a two-horse race , " uli hoeness recently conceded . while those who took great pain from agreeing with hoeness at the start of the season will now be celebrating the fact that the bavarian galacticos have been exposed as mere mortals , a more honorable celebration should be taking place .
bayern may have come a little unstuck but the fact that they lead the bundesliga on goal difference alone at the winter break should be heralded as a sign that german soccer is alive and well . the bundesliga is often ridiculed as the poor relation of the english premiership , spain 's primera liga and serie a in italy .
the soccer is viewed as below most european standards , the spectacle derided and the glamour deemed non-existent . all of which contributed to the view that a sizeable chunk of bayern 's fortune thrown at a trio of international stars would lead to a procession .

" the election generally failed to meet many osce commitments for democratic elections , " the organization for security and cooperation in europe said in a statement .

the people know that they are voting for peace and prosperity , the 69-year-old said in the capital tashkent .
the uzbek election commission in november allowed karimov to stand for reelection for a third time though the constitution foresees no more than two terms for the president .
karimov has ruled the country , rich in natural gas and other resources , for the last 18 years .
during that time , karimov has suppressed independent political and religious activity , human rights groups say .
according to observers , karimov leads one of the most repressive governments in central asia .
opposition groups and human rights organizations described the vote as a farce because there was no real alternative to karimov .

the consumer index was recorded at 4.4 points in november , the fourth month of decline in a row , but december 's showed a slight increase to 4.5 points .
the gfk claimed on the back of the results that " the consumer climate has stabilized as the year draws to a close " and that the december figures were the result of people getting out to do their christmas shopping .
economists have forecast for some time that dropping german unemployment rates would boost consumer spending , historically the weak link in the country 's export-driven economy .
the rate of employment growth has already begun to taper off , however .
analysts credit other financial factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have rediscovered their love of shopping " household income and business cycle expectations are significantly down in the wake of slowing employment growth and inflation gaining speed but the willingness to buy is improving again , " said sylvain broyer , an analyst at corporate and investment bankers ixis-cib .
" this could be related to christmas but is also a consequence of a fading impact of the vat shock in spending habits . "
an increase in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 to 19 percent last january hit retail sales this year , notably for big-ticket items such as automobiles .
in 2008 , lower german exports and corporate investment are expected to slow economic growth to 2.0 percent from an estimated 2.4 percent in 2007 owing to the euro 's strength against the dollar , a weaker us economy , high prices for oil and other commodities and tighter credit conditions .
a spike in inflation caused by rising costs of energy and food products has also dampened consumer sentiment in the second half of 2007 .

the institute welcomed a government decision to lower unemployment insurance charges , saying it " will not only impact positively on purchasing power but will also have a favorable effect on employment . "
broyer added that if the vat shock faded , " consumer confidence could improve progressively next year . "

the consumer index was recorded at 4.4 points in november , the fourth month of decline in a row , but december 's showed a slight increase to 4.5 points .
the gfk claimed on the back of the results that " the consumer climate has stabilized as the year draws to a close " and that the december figures were the result of people getting out to do their christmas shopping .

taking on the presidency is an unprecedented challenge for the affluent alpine country of 2 million people .
slovenia declared independence from yugoslavia in 1991 .
in the years since , it has sprinted towards the west , joining both the eu and nato in 2004 .

taking on the presidency is an unprecedented challenge for the affluent alpine country of 2 million people .
slovenia declared independence from yugoslavia in 1991 .
in the years since , it has sprinted towards the west , joining both the eu and nato in 2004 .
now , it 's the first new eu member country to lead the 27-nation bloc .
" this is a historic project for us , " said slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel . " it 's not normal for us to be asked to lead such a presidency and so we want to make an extra effort . "
slovenia has budgeted 62 million euros -lrb- $ 91 million -rrb- as it has hired a slew of translators and advisors to make sure the next six months go over smoothly . the country will be responsible for organizing dozens of conferences , including minister-level meetings .
slovenia sees the presidency as a chance to increase its visibility in europe .
kosovo 's future will top the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo will top the agenda the eu presidency rotates every six months and was previously held by germany and portugal .
in many ways , slovenia will carry on the priorities - such as climate change and job creation initiatives - started by its predecessors .
the three countries decided to combine forces to set an agenda that would provide the bloc with more continuity .
other agenda points will be determined by events outside the eu 's direct control .
it 's widely assumed that the serbian breakaway province of kosovo will declare independence before slovenia 's presidency is up in june of 2008 .
recent united nations security council efforts to mediate a solution between serbia and kosovo have failed .
and the eu has begun to debate how it should react if the southern serbian province does declare independence .
rupel said the eu and kosovo must " agree on what to do next . "
rupel has carefully avoided using the word " independence " when referring to kosovo , but did say that europe is ready to " recognize the realities of the situation in the western balkans . "
" we believe it is high time for the yugoslav crisis to be over , " rupel told journalists .

he dismissed concerns that slovenia might be influenced by strong business ties to serbia .
" we know the situation very well , also the details which are not easily understandable for countries which are far away , " jansa said .
" we are not one-sided in this case .
slovenia has excellent cooperation with serbia , also kosovo , with all former yugoslav republics . "
yet slovenia 's ability to lead in the area could be tricky given ongoing border disputes with neighboring croatia .
the biggest is resolving the maritime borders in the bay of piran .
croatia has claimed half of the bay it shares with croatia and italy .
that leaves slovenia without what it feels is an important access to international waters .

" the election generally failed to meet many osce commitments for democratic elections , " the organization for security and cooperation in europe said in a statement .
karimov won 88.1 percent of the sunday vote , the uzbek election commission said , compared with 91 percent in 2000 .
poll hugely flawed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karimov is said to preside over one of the most repressive governments the osce 's monitoring mission 's chief , walter siegl , underlined that because the three nominal challengers to karimov in sunday 's polls " publicly endorsed the incumbent , the electorate was deprived of a genuine choice . "
the osce fielded a team of just 26 observers to the ex-soviet republic of 28 million people , saying that the lack of competitive conditions for the vote made a bigger team pointless .
" the hardly visible election campaign was characterized by the absence of any real competition of ideas and political views , " the osce statement said .
" coverage of the campaign in the media was very limited , without debates among candidates , direct speeches or the presentation of alternative views , which could help the electorate make an informed choice . "
the statement also questioned the " unusually high " turnout of 90.6 percent .
repressive government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is very little democratic debate going on in the uzbek parliament karimov said he was confident of being declared the winner following voting on sunday .
the people know that they are voting for peace and prosperity , the 69-year-old said in the capital tashkent .
the uzbek election commission in november allowed karimov to stand for reelection for a third time though the constitution foresees no more than two terms for the president .
karimov has ruled the country , rich in natural gas and other resources , for the last 18 years .
during that time , karimov has suppressed independent political and religious activity , human rights groups say .
according to observers , karimov leads one of the most repressive governments in central asia .
opposition groups and human rights organizations described the vote as a farce because there was no real alternative to karimov .
fewer observes for russian elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's handpicked successor dmitry medvedev -lrb- left -rrb- is expected to face little opposition meanwhile , a russian senior elections official indicated on monday that russia would invite fewer foreign observers to the presidential election in march than it did four years ago .
stanislav vavilov , deputy head of the central election commission , said that the " preliminary plan " was to invite observers " in the same number and time period " as for the parliamentary poll which was held on dec .
2 . for those elections only 70 western observers monitored the election spread across 11 time zones , down from 400 observers which were present during the last parliamentary elections in 2003 and the presidential poll in 2004 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de european union -pipe- 24.12.2007 slovenia steps into european spotlight großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ljubljana , the capital , will get its chance to shine when slovenia takes over the european union presidency on jan .
1 , 2008 , it will focus on issues close to home : kosovo 's independence and the efforts of neighboring balkan countries to join the bloc . for the next six months slovenia will sit at the epicenter of the eu .
taking on the presidency is an unprecedented challenge for the affluent alpine country of 2 million people .
slovenia declared independence from yugoslavia in 1991 .
in the years since , it has sprinted towards the west , joining both the eu and nato in 2004 .
now , it 's the first new eu member country to lead the 27-nation bloc .
" this is a historic project for us , " said slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel . " it 's not normal for us to be asked to lead such a presidency and so we want to make an extra effort . "
slovenia has budgeted 62 million euros -lrb- $ 91 million -rrb- as it has hired a slew of translators and advisors to make sure the next six months go over smoothly . the country will be responsible for organizing dozens of conferences , including minister-level meetings .
slovenia sees the presidency as a chance to increase its visibility in europe .
kosovo 's future will top the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo will top the agenda the eu presidency rotates every six months and was previously held by germany and portugal .
in many ways , slovenia will carry on the priorities - such as climate change and job creation initiatives - started by its predecessors .
the three countries decided to combine forces to set an agenda that would provide the bloc with more continuity .
other agenda points will be determined by events outside the eu 's direct control .
it 's widely assumed that the serbian breakaway province of kosovo will declare independence before slovenia 's presidency is up in june of 2008 .
recent united nations security council efforts to mediate a solution between serbia and kosovo have failed .
and the eu has begun to debate how it should react if the southern serbian province does declare independence .
rupel said the eu and kosovo must " agree on what to do next . "
rupel has carefully avoided using the word " independence " when referring to kosovo , but did say that europe is ready to " recognize the realities of the situation in the western balkans . "
" we believe it is high time for the yugoslav crisis to be over , " rupel told journalists .
mediator in the balkans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenian politicians , such as rupel , will lead the eu slovenian prime minister janez jansa said his country could play a central role in helping to resolve the dispute .
slovenia has experience of balkans politics and personalities , jansa told reuters .
he dismissed concerns that slovenia might be influenced by strong business ties to serbia .
" we know the situation very well , also the details which are not easily understandable for countries which are far away , " jansa said .
" we are not one-sided in this case .
slovenia has excellent cooperation with serbia , also kosovo , with all former yugoslav republics . "
yet slovenia 's ability to lead in the area could be tricky given ongoing border disputes with neighboring croatia .
the biggest is resolving the maritime borders in the bay of piran .
croatia has claimed half of the bay it shares with croatia and italy .
that leaves slovenia without what it feels is an important access to international waters .
slovenia supports neighbors ' eu dreams bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenia wants other balkan countries to join the club despite the border dispute , slovenia is supportive of croatia joining the eu .
croatia is expected to become a member by 2010 , and the other west balkan nations are likely to follow within four to five years .
yet european countries have become less enthusiastic recently about further expanding the bloc .
slovenia hopes to keep the momentum going , rupel said .
serbia 's unwavering stance on kosovo has complicated its own possibility of joining the eu .
rupel stressed that serbia , as well as the other balkan countries , have a future as eu members .
" we wish for serbia to become a member of the european union as soon as possible , " he said . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the election generally failed to meet many osce commitments for democratic elections , " the organization for security and cooperation in europe said in a statement .
karimov won 88.1 percent of the sunday vote , the uzbek election commission said , compared with 91 percent in 2000 .
poll hugely flawed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karimov is said to preside over one of the most repressive governments the osce 's monitoring mission 's chief , walter siegl , underlined that because the three nominal challengers to karimov in sunday 's polls " publicly endorsed the incumbent , the electorate was deprived of a genuine choice . "
the osce fielded a team of just 26 observers to the ex-soviet republic of 28 million people , saying that the lack of competitive conditions for the vote made a bigger team pointless .
" the hardly visible election campaign was characterized by the absence of any real competition of ideas and political views , " the osce statement said .
" coverage of the campaign in the media was very limited , without debates among candidates , direct speeches or the presentation of alternative views , which could help the electorate make an informed choice . "
the statement also questioned the " unusually high " turnout of 90.6 percent .
repressive government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is very little democratic debate going on in the uzbek parliament karimov said he was confident of being declared the winner following voting on sunday .
the people know that they are voting for peace and prosperity , the 69-year-old said in the capital tashkent .
the uzbek election commission in november allowed karimov to stand for reelection for a third time though the constitution foresees no more than two terms for the president .
karimov has ruled the country , rich in natural gas and other resources , for the last 18 years .
during that time , karimov has suppressed independent political and religious activity , human rights groups say .
according to observers , karimov leads one of the most repressive governments in central asia .
opposition groups and human rights organizations described the vote as a farce because there was no real alternative to karimov .

stanislav vavilov , deputy head of the central election commission , said that the " preliminary plan " was to invite observers " in the same number and time period " as for the parliamentary poll which was held on dec .

" the election generally failed to meet many osce commitments for democratic elections , " the organization for security and cooperation in europe said in a statement .
karimov won 88.1 percent of the sunday vote , the uzbek election commission said , compared with 91 percent in 2000 .
poll hugely flawed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karimov is said to preside over one of the most repressive governments the osce 's monitoring mission 's chief , walter siegl , underlined that because the three nominal challengers to karimov in sunday 's polls " publicly endorsed the incumbent , the electorate was deprived of a genuine choice . "
the osce fielded a team of just 26 observers to the ex-soviet republic of 28 million people , saying that the lack of competitive conditions for the vote made a bigger team pointless .
" the hardly visible election campaign was characterized by the absence of any real competition of ideas and political views , " the osce statement said .
" coverage of the campaign in the media was very limited , without debates among candidates , direct speeches or the presentation of alternative views , which could help the electorate make an informed choice . "
the statement also questioned the " unusually high " turnout of 90.6 percent .

the people know that they are voting for peace and prosperity , the 69-year-old said in the capital tashkent .
the uzbek election commission in november allowed karimov to stand for reelection for a third time though the constitution foresees no more than two terms for the president .
karimov has ruled the country , rich in natural gas and other resources , for the last 18 years .
during that time , karimov has suppressed independent political and religious activity , human rights groups say .
according to observers , karimov leads one of the most repressive governments in central asia .
opposition groups and human rights organizations described the vote as a farce because there was no real alternative to karimov .

so much so , that on this one day of the year , normally empty churches are suddenly packed to overflowing with people jostling for a seat .
it would therefore not be amiss to suggest that most people at christmas mass are not regular church-goers , and as such , not overly familiar with the proper procedure .
but never fear , help is at hand , just in time for this christmas eve .
germany 's protestant press service , the evangelische pressedienst -lrb- epd -rrb- , has published a handbook of 10 golden rules to ensure that any once-a-year worshiper can survive christmas mass unscathed .
at the top of the epd 's list of rules : no mobile phones !
and seriously , is there anything more mortifying than your freshly downloaded " jingle bells " ringtone reverberating through the church in a moment of quiet prayer ?
be prepared to live without your cell for about an hour , the epd advises .
navigating holy water and hymns church attendees who wind up in a catholic house of worship may be puzzled about the little dish of water at the entrance .
why is everyone putting their fingers in it , and then touching their head , chest and shoulders ?
do n't panic .
it 's holy water , and catholics use it to bless themselves with the sign of the cross when they enter .
according to the epd , you can follow suit , but you do n't have to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : applauding at the end of the sermon is taboo rule three deals with singing .
in some churches , you 'll be handed a hymnal at the entrance .
the numbers on the board next to the altar indicate which hymns are meant to be sung throughout the service .
if the tune is unfamiliar , or you feel uncomfortable singing in public , do n't worry .
just sing along quietly or keep silent .
assuming you arrive at the church early enough , you may have a choice of seating - for some , a conundrum in itself .
the epd 's guide reassuringly informs you that you may sit wherever you like without your pew-mates wondering what business you have being in their church .
please do n't clap when it 's over but getting a seat is just the first hurdle .
all through the service , you will notice people around you at times sitting , standing , or kneeling .
how do they know when to do what ?
what if you give yourself away as a novice by standing when everyone else kneels ?
slow down , says the fifth rule .
watch the people around you , and do the same as they do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if in doubt , watch your neighbor the sixth rule is all about the sermon .
it usually lasts about 15 minutes and refers to a passage in the bible .
please do n't clap when it 's over .
you can always discuss the sermon with the priest afterwards .
other useful advice included in the golden rules concerns the collection basket .
you got into christmas mass for free , so do n't skimp when the basket comes your way as the proceeds generally go to a good cause .
once you 've made it this far , you 're practically home free .
but how do you recognize when the service has come to an end ?
watch for the blessing , the epd advises .
sometimes , you may hear organ music .
just stay seated and listen .
then , it 's polite to wish your neighbor a merry christmas . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but those who rushed to crown bayern before a ball was even kicked forgot that the league already had its own superstars . before this season got underway , everyone was braced for the usual blast of arrogance from the south of germany .
but instead of a warm front of imperiousness emanating from the area around bayern munich 's allianz arena , the rest of the country was hit by an icy blast of realism . the message from bavaria was the same as in previous years but this time the delivery and reception were different .
when general manager uli hoeness said that bayern would soon be so far off into the distance , their rivals would need binoculars to see them , he said so without the omnipresent braggadocio but with a cold assertion .
in response , the rest of germany just sadly nodded in agreement and started ruminating about who 'd be munich 's closest rivals . the reason for hoeness ' brusque dismissal of the other 17 teams in the bundesliga and the country 's acceptance of his statement as fact could be summed up in three words : klose , ribery , toni . unprecedented spending spree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the signing of the prolific klose put fear into munich 's rivals bayern 's unprecedented summer spending spree seemed to have sealed the championship deal before a ball had even been kicked in anger .
the acquisition of the german national team 's most prolific striker , france 's player of the year and an italian world cup-winning forward was more than just a statement of intent ; it was a declaration of closure .
game over , in other words . yet , with the bundesliga now tucked up in its thermal underwear and slippers for the winter , bayern 's trailblazing early league form is fading like the topic of a drunken conversation over christmas turkey leftovers . even though bayern have lost just once - a 3-1 reverse in stuttgart - ottmar hitzfeld 's side reverted to type as the season wore on with a methodical but slow-paced and ultimately blunt style of play .
as the winter break neared , bayern recorded four drab goalless draws in their last seven league fixtures against deep-lying teams whose sole aim was to smother , thwart and claim a point . bayern 's gallop reduced to a trot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzfeld 's honeymoon period is well and truly over the thoroughbred which was the only entry in a seemingly one-horse race lost its way and finally plodded to the midway point like a retired carthorse in need of a breather .
despite ending the first half of the season on top of the heap , bayern munich 's gallop has been reduced to a trudge . " it could end up a two-horse race , " uli hoeness recently conceded . while those who took great pain from agreeing with hoeness at the start of the season will now be celebrating the fact that the bavarian galacticos have been exposed as mere mortals , a more honorable celebration should be taking place .
bayern may have come a little unstuck but the fact that they lead the bundesliga on goal difference alone at the winter break should be heralded as a sign that german soccer is alive and well . the bundesliga is often ridiculed as the poor relation of the english premiership , spain 's primera liga and serie a in italy .
the soccer is viewed as below most european standards , the spectacle derided and the glamour deemed non-existent . all of which contributed to the view that a sizeable chunk of bayern 's fortune thrown at a trio of international stars would lead to a procession .
with such poor opposition being lined-up for them , it was no surprise that the lavishly put-together bavarian giants were expected to walk it . rival stars driving bayern 's competitors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's second season at bremen is eclipsing his first the league at the halfway point , however , tells a different story .
bayern , and the majority of non-partisan observers , have underestimated the other teams and the impact of many of the other international stars which have slowly contributed to the bundesliga 's rehabilitation . far from being a boring one-team march , this season 's bundesliga is looking like a competition worthy of attention with world stars catching the eye . inspired by diego , the league 's top playmaker and joint top scorer with nine goals , werder bremen have their own international stars driving their championship challenge . bremen looked to have sold their best chance of recapturing the league title when klose joined bayern in the summer but while munich were courting the big names of the 2006 world cup , bremen snapped up boubacar sanogo from hamburg and carlos alberto from porto .
the result is a second-placed team winning games with intercontinental flair . third-placed hamburg are also hot on munich 's heels thanks to another of the league 's superstars . bringing more quality to the league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van der vaart is one of the league 's shining lights the diminutive and prolific rafael van der vaart was a coup signing when he moved from ajax in 2005 .
while the dutchman 's decision to come to germany was a shock to many of those expecting a transfer to italy or spain , van der vaart has shown why he favored a german challenge by helping transform hsv 's fortunes and bringing more quality to the league . the bundesliga may not be able to boast as many big names as other leagues but those who have taken a chance in germany have given the bundesliga a dash of the flair and panache at times , certainly more than in recent years , and have contributed to the sold-out stadiums and thrilling match day atmosphere which are now back in fashion . with these world-class stars spread throughout the chasing pack , bayern munich 's coronation is on hold and the bundesliga is a lot better for it .

" the election generally failed to meet many osce commitments for democratic elections , " the organization for security and cooperation in europe said in a statement .

the osce fielded a team of just 26 observers to the ex-soviet republic of 28 million people , saying that the lack of competitive conditions for the vote made a bigger team pointless .

according to observers , karimov leads one of the most repressive governments in central asia .
opposition groups and human rights organizations described the vote as a farce because there was no real alternative to karimov .

critics say social welfare cuts have made the situation even worse . more than 2.5 million children in germany are eligible for welfare benefits .
that 's twice as many as was the case in 2005 , when the german government under social democrat gerhard schröder introduced cuts to the welfare system .
the increase in child poverty is a direct result of those cuts , according to cologne political scientist christoph butterwegge . " -lsb- charities -rsb- and poverty researchers like me warned that this labor market reform would be a slide into poverty and that children would be those mainly affected , " butterwegge said in an interview with the associated press .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greater numbers of people have been turning to die tafel for food donations sicne 2005 his comments received backing from the charity die tafel , which runs soup kitchens and distributes food packets to poor people all over germany .
of the 800,000 people nationwide who received food donations from the charity , around 200,000 were children , the group 's head , gerd häuser , told news agency dpa .
and the number of people die tafel served had grown significantly , from around 600,000 two years ago , and continued to do so .
teachers complain five to 10 percent of schoolchildren were forced to go without lunch , häuser said . " many teachers have complained that after the fourth period , many children run out of energy , because they have n't had a snack , " he said . parents ' benefits , introduced this year , by family minister ursula von der leyen , has meant less money for poor families , butterwegge said .
under the new scheme , all parents , regardless of their income , receive a monthly benefit of 300 euros -lrb- $ 430 -rrb- for a child 's first year .
previously , poor families had been able to collect 300 euros each month for two years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is crucial to fighting poverty butterwegge said the government 's family policy was based on the principle that those who do n't need money , get more , while money is taken from those who have little .
he called for an increase in welfare benefits .
education system cements poverty a study published by the children 's charity of germany in mid-november reported that every sixth child below the age of seven is dependent on welfare benefits .
since 1990 , the year of german unification , child poverty had grown strongly in comparison to other industrialized countries , a 2005 unicef study showed . butterwegge also said germany should change its educational system . " poverty is … caused by the socially selective school system , " he said , referring to the track system that determines at a relatively young age whether or not students will have the chance to study at a university . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the consumer index was recorded at 4.4 points in november , the fourth month of decline in a row , but december 's showed a slight increase to 4.5 points .
the gfk claimed on the back of the results that " the consumer climate has stabilized as the year draws to a close " and that the december figures were the result of people getting out to do their christmas shopping .
economists have forecast for some time that dropping german unemployment rates would boost consumer spending , historically the weak link in the country 's export-driven economy .
the rate of employment growth has already begun to taper off , however .
analysts credit other financial factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have rediscovered their love of shopping " household income and business cycle expectations are significantly down in the wake of slowing employment growth and inflation gaining speed but the willingness to buy is improving again , " said sylvain broyer , an analyst at corporate and investment bankers ixis-cib .
" this could be related to christmas but is also a consequence of a fading impact of the vat shock in spending habits . "
an increase in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 to 19 percent last january hit retail sales this year , notably for big-ticket items such as automobiles .
in 2008 , lower german exports and corporate investment are expected to slow economic growth to 2.0 percent from an estimated 2.4 percent in 2007 owing to the euro 's strength against the dollar , a weaker us economy , high prices for oil and other commodities and tighter credit conditions .
a spike in inflation caused by rising costs of energy and food products has also dampened consumer sentiment in the second half of 2007 .
institute looks forward to further boosts in 2008 bildunterschrift : germany 's shopping streets may thrive again in 2008 now however , gfk said " the current trend offers good opportunities for a boost in domestic demand in the coming year . "
the institute welcomed a government decision to lower unemployment insurance charges , saying it " will not only impact positively on purchasing power but will also have a favorable effect on employment . "
broyer added that if the vat shock faded , " consumer confidence could improve progressively next year . "
risks faced by the german economy , such as persistent inflation or continued turbulence on financial markets , could nonetheless quickly cause consumers to pull back and put more of their income into savings , gfk said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , 2008 , it will focus on issues close to home : kosovo 's independence and the efforts of neighboring balkan countries to join the bloc . for the next six months slovenia will sit at the epicenter of the eu .
taking on the presidency is an unprecedented challenge for the affluent alpine country of 2 million people .
slovenia declared independence from yugoslavia in 1991 .
in the years since , it has sprinted towards the west , joining both the eu and nato in 2004 .
now , it 's the first new eu member country to lead the 27-nation bloc .
" this is a historic project for us , " said slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel . " it 's not normal for us to be asked to lead such a presidency and so we want to make an extra effort . "
slovenia has budgeted 62 million euros -lrb- $ 91 million -rrb- as it has hired a slew of translators and advisors to make sure the next six months go over smoothly . the country will be responsible for organizing dozens of conferences , including minister-level meetings .
slovenia sees the presidency as a chance to increase its visibility in europe .
kosovo 's future will top the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo will top the agenda the eu presidency rotates every six months and was previously held by germany and portugal .
in many ways , slovenia will carry on the priorities - such as climate change and job creation initiatives - started by its predecessors .
the three countries decided to combine forces to set an agenda that would provide the bloc with more continuity .
other agenda points will be determined by events outside the eu 's direct control .
it 's widely assumed that the serbian breakaway province of kosovo will declare independence before slovenia 's presidency is up in june of 2008 .
recent united nations security council efforts to mediate a solution between serbia and kosovo have failed .
and the eu has begun to debate how it should react if the southern serbian province does declare independence .
rupel said the eu and kosovo must " agree on what to do next . "
rupel has carefully avoided using the word " independence " when referring to kosovo , but did say that europe is ready to " recognize the realities of the situation in the western balkans . "
" we believe it is high time for the yugoslav crisis to be over , " rupel told journalists .
mediator in the balkans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : slovenian politicians , such as rupel , will lead the eu slovenian prime minister janez jansa said his country could play a central role in helping to resolve the dispute .
slovenia has experience of balkans politics and personalities , jansa told reuters .
he dismissed concerns that slovenia might be influenced by strong business ties to serbia .
" we know the situation very well , also the details which are not easily understandable for countries which are far away , " jansa said .
" we are not one-sided in this case .
slovenia has excellent cooperation with serbia , also kosovo , with all former yugoslav republics . "
yet slovenia 's ability to lead in the area could be tricky given ongoing border disputes with neighboring croatia .
the biggest is resolving the maritime borders in the bay of piran .
croatia has claimed half of the bay it shares with croatia and italy .
that leaves slovenia without what it feels is an important access to international waters .

just mouth along not a regular church-goer but still like to attend christmas mass ?
you 're not alone .
but please make sure you do n't embarrass yourself or irritate others by following this handy set of rules . attending christmas eve mass is a time-honored tradition in germany .
so much so , that on this one day of the year , normally empty churches are suddenly packed to overflowing with people jostling for a seat .
it would therefore not be amiss to suggest that most people at christmas mass are not regular church-goers , and as such , not overly familiar with the proper procedure .
but never fear , help is at hand , just in time for this christmas eve .
germany 's protestant press service , the evangelische pressedienst -lrb- epd -rrb- , has published a handbook of 10 golden rules to ensure that any once-a-year worshiper can survive christmas mass unscathed .
at the top of the epd 's list of rules : no mobile phones !
and seriously , is there anything more mortifying than your freshly downloaded " jingle bells " ringtone reverberating through the church in a moment of quiet prayer ?
be prepared to live without your cell for about an hour , the epd advises .
navigating holy water and hymns church attendees who wind up in a catholic house of worship may be puzzled about the little dish of water at the entrance .
why is everyone putting their fingers in it , and then touching their head , chest and shoulders ?
do n't panic .
it 's holy water , and catholics use it to bless themselves with the sign of the cross when they enter .
according to the epd , you can follow suit , but you do n't have to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : applauding at the end of the sermon is taboo rule three deals with singing .
in some churches , you 'll be handed a hymnal at the entrance .
the numbers on the board next to the altar indicate which hymns are meant to be sung throughout the service .
if the tune is unfamiliar , or you feel uncomfortable singing in public , do n't worry .
just sing along quietly or keep silent .
assuming you arrive at the church early enough , you may have a choice of seating - for some , a conundrum in itself .
the epd 's guide reassuringly informs you that you may sit wherever you like without your pew-mates wondering what business you have being in their church .
please do n't clap when it 's over but getting a seat is just the first hurdle .
all through the service , you will notice people around you at times sitting , standing , or kneeling .
how do they know when to do what ?
what if you give yourself away as a novice by standing when everyone else kneels ?
slow down , says the fifth rule .
watch the people around you , and do the same as they do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if in doubt , watch your neighbor the sixth rule is all about the sermon .
it usually lasts about 15 minutes and refers to a passage in the bible .
please do n't clap when it 's over .
you can always discuss the sermon with the priest afterwards .
other useful advice included in the golden rules concerns the collection basket .
you got into christmas mass for free , so do n't skimp when the basket comes your way as the proceeds generally go to a good cause .
once you 've made it this far , you 're practically home free .
but how do you recognize when the service has come to an end ?
watch for the blessing , the epd advises .
sometimes , you may hear organ music .
just stay seated and listen .
then , it 's polite to wish your neighbor a merry christmas . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but those who rushed to crown bayern before a ball was even kicked forgot that the league already had its own superstars . before this season got underway , everyone was braced for the usual blast of arrogance from the south of germany .
but instead of a warm front of imperiousness emanating from the area around bayern munich 's allianz arena , the rest of the country was hit by an icy blast of realism . the message from bavaria was the same as in previous years but this time the delivery and reception were different .
when general manager uli hoeness said that bayern would soon be so far off into the distance , their rivals would need binoculars to see them , he said so without the omnipresent braggadocio but with a cold assertion .
in response , the rest of germany just sadly nodded in agreement and started ruminating about who 'd be munich 's closest rivals . the reason for hoeness ' brusque dismissal of the other 17 teams in the bundesliga and the country 's acceptance of his statement as fact could be summed up in three words : klose , ribery , toni . unprecedented spending spree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the signing of the prolific klose put fear into munich 's rivals bayern 's unprecedented summer spending spree seemed to have sealed the championship deal before a ball had even been kicked in anger .
the acquisition of the german national team 's most prolific striker , france 's player of the year and an italian world cup-winning forward was more than just a statement of intent ; it was a declaration of closure .
game over , in other words . yet , with the bundesliga now tucked up in its thermal underwear and slippers for the winter , bayern 's trailblazing early league form is fading like the topic of a drunken conversation over christmas turkey leftovers . even though bayern have lost just once - a 3-1 reverse in stuttgart - ottmar hitzfeld 's side reverted to type as the season wore on with a methodical but slow-paced and ultimately blunt style of play .
as the winter break neared , bayern recorded four drab goalless draws in their last seven league fixtures against deep-lying teams whose sole aim was to smother , thwart and claim a point . bayern 's gallop reduced to a trot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzfeld 's honeymoon period is well and truly over the thoroughbred which was the only entry in a seemingly one-horse race lost its way and finally plodded to the midway point like a retired carthorse in need of a breather .
despite ending the first half of the season on top of the heap , bayern munich 's gallop has been reduced to a trudge . " it could end up a two-horse race , " uli hoeness recently conceded . while those who took great pain from agreeing with hoeness at the start of the season will now be celebrating the fact that the bavarian galacticos have been exposed as mere mortals , a more honorable celebration should be taking place .
bayern may have come a little unstuck but the fact that they lead the bundesliga on goal difference alone at the winter break should be heralded as a sign that german soccer is alive and well . the bundesliga is often ridiculed as the poor relation of the english premiership , spain 's primera liga and serie a in italy .
the soccer is viewed as below most european standards , the spectacle derided and the glamour deemed non-existent . all of which contributed to the view that a sizeable chunk of bayern 's fortune thrown at a trio of international stars would lead to a procession .
with such poor opposition being lined-up for them , it was no surprise that the lavishly put-together bavarian giants were expected to walk it . rival stars driving bayern 's competitors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's second season at bremen is eclipsing his first the league at the halfway point , however , tells a different story .
bayern , and the majority of non-partisan observers , have underestimated the other teams and the impact of many of the other international stars which have slowly contributed to the bundesliga 's rehabilitation . far from being a boring one-team march , this season 's bundesliga is looking like a competition worthy of attention with world stars catching the eye . inspired by diego , the league 's top playmaker and joint top scorer with nine goals , werder bremen have their own international stars driving their championship challenge . bremen looked to have sold their best chance of recapturing the league title when klose joined bayern in the summer but while munich were courting the big names of the 2006 world cup , bremen snapped up boubacar sanogo from hamburg and carlos alberto from porto .
the result is a second-placed team winning games with intercontinental flair . third-placed hamburg are also hot on munich 's heels thanks to another of the league 's superstars . bringing more quality to the league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van der vaart is one of the league 's shining lights the diminutive and prolific rafael van der vaart was a coup signing when he moved from ajax in 2005 .
while the dutchman 's decision to come to germany was a shock to many of those expecting a transfer to italy or spain , van der vaart has shown why he favored a german challenge by helping transform hsv 's fortunes and bringing more quality to the league . the bundesliga may not be able to boast as many big names as other leagues but those who have taken a chance in germany have given the bundesliga a dash of the flair and panache at times , certainly more than in recent years , and have contributed to the sold-out stadiums and thrilling match day atmosphere which are now back in fashion . with these world-class stars spread throughout the chasing pack , bayern munich 's coronation is on hold and the bundesliga is a lot better for it .

but those who rushed to crown bayern before a ball was even kicked forgot that the league already had its own superstars . before this season got underway , everyone was braced for the usual blast of arrogance from the south of germany .
but instead of a warm front of imperiousness emanating from the area around bayern munich 's allianz arena , the rest of the country was hit by an icy blast of realism . the message from bavaria was the same as in previous years but this time the delivery and reception were different .
when general manager uli hoeness said that bayern would soon be so far off into the distance , their rivals would need binoculars to see them , he said so without the omnipresent braggadocio but with a cold assertion .
in response , the rest of germany just sadly nodded in agreement and started ruminating about who 'd be munich 's closest rivals . the reason for hoeness ' brusque dismissal of the other 17 teams in the bundesliga and the country 's acceptance of his statement as fact could be summed up in three words : klose , ribery , toni . unprecedented spending spree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the signing of the prolific klose put fear into munich 's rivals bayern 's unprecedented summer spending spree seemed to have sealed the championship deal before a ball had even been kicked in anger .
the acquisition of the german national team 's most prolific striker , france 's player of the year and an italian world cup-winning forward was more than just a statement of intent ; it was a declaration of closure .
game over , in other words . yet , with the bundesliga now tucked up in its thermal underwear and slippers for the winter , bayern 's trailblazing early league form is fading like the topic of a drunken conversation over christmas turkey leftovers . even though bayern have lost just once - a 3-1 reverse in stuttgart - ottmar hitzfeld 's side reverted to type as the season wore on with a methodical but slow-paced and ultimately blunt style of play .

despite ending the first half of the season on top of the heap , bayern munich 's gallop has been reduced to a trudge . " it could end up a two-horse race , " uli hoeness recently conceded . while those who took great pain from agreeing with hoeness at the start of the season will now be celebrating the fact that the bavarian galacticos have been exposed as mere mortals , a more honorable celebration should be taking place .
bayern may have come a little unstuck but the fact that they lead the bundesliga on goal difference alone at the winter break should be heralded as a sign that german soccer is alive and well . the bundesliga is often ridiculed as the poor relation of the english premiership , spain 's primera liga and serie a in italy .
the soccer is viewed as below most european standards , the spectacle derided and the glamour deemed non-existent . all of which contributed to the view that a sizeable chunk of bayern 's fortune thrown at a trio of international stars would lead to a procession .

just mouth along not a regular church-goer but still like to attend christmas mass ?
you 're not alone .
but please make sure you do n't embarrass yourself or irritate others by following this handy set of rules . attending christmas eve mass is a time-honored tradition in germany .
so much so , that on this one day of the year , normally empty churches are suddenly packed to overflowing with people jostling for a seat .
it would therefore not be amiss to suggest that most people at christmas mass are not regular church-goers , and as such , not overly familiar with the proper procedure .
but never fear , help is at hand , just in time for this christmas eve .
germany 's protestant press service , the evangelische pressedienst -lrb- epd -rrb- , has published a handbook of 10 golden rules to ensure that any once-a-year worshiper can survive christmas mass unscathed .
at the top of the epd 's list of rules : no mobile phones !
and seriously , is there anything more mortifying than your freshly downloaded " jingle bells " ringtone reverberating through the church in a moment of quiet prayer ?
be prepared to live without your cell for about an hour , the epd advises .
navigating holy water and hymns church attendees who wind up in a catholic house of worship may be puzzled about the little dish of water at the entrance .
why is everyone putting their fingers in it , and then touching their head , chest and shoulders ?
do n't panic .
it 's holy water , and catholics use it to bless themselves with the sign of the cross when they enter .
according to the epd , you can follow suit , but you do n't have to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : applauding at the end of the sermon is taboo rule three deals with singing .
in some churches , you 'll be handed a hymnal at the entrance .
the numbers on the board next to the altar indicate which hymns are meant to be sung throughout the service .
if the tune is unfamiliar , or you feel uncomfortable singing in public , do n't worry .
just sing along quietly or keep silent .
assuming you arrive at the church early enough , you may have a choice of seating - for some , a conundrum in itself .
the epd 's guide reassuringly informs you that you may sit wherever you like without your pew-mates wondering what business you have being in their church .
please do n't clap when it 's over but getting a seat is just the first hurdle .
all through the service , you will notice people around you at times sitting , standing , or kneeling .
how do they know when to do what ?
what if you give yourself away as a novice by standing when everyone else kneels ?
slow down , says the fifth rule .
watch the people around you , and do the same as they do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if in doubt , watch your neighbor the sixth rule is all about the sermon .
it usually lasts about 15 minutes and refers to a passage in the bible .
please do n't clap when it 's over .
you can always discuss the sermon with the priest afterwards .
other useful advice included in the golden rules concerns the collection basket .
you got into christmas mass for free , so do n't skimp when the basket comes your way as the proceeds generally go to a good cause .
once you 've made it this far , you 're practically home free .
but how do you recognize when the service has come to an end ?
watch for the blessing , the epd advises .
sometimes , you may hear organ music .
just stay seated and listen .
then , it 's polite to wish your neighbor a merry christmas . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the election generally failed to meet many osce commitments for democratic elections , " the organization for security and cooperation in europe said in a statement .
karimov won 88.1 percent of the sunday vote , the uzbek election commission said , compared with 91 percent in 2000 .
poll hugely flawed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : karimov is said to preside over one of the most repressive governments the osce 's monitoring mission 's chief , walter siegl , underlined that because the three nominal challengers to karimov in sunday 's polls " publicly endorsed the incumbent , the electorate was deprived of a genuine choice . "
the osce fielded a team of just 26 observers to the ex-soviet republic of 28 million people , saying that the lack of competitive conditions for the vote made a bigger team pointless .
" the hardly visible election campaign was characterized by the absence of any real competition of ideas and political views , " the osce statement said .
" coverage of the campaign in the media was very limited , without debates among candidates , direct speeches or the presentation of alternative views , which could help the electorate make an informed choice . "
the statement also questioned the " unusually high " turnout of 90.6 percent .
repressive government bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is very little democratic debate going on in the uzbek parliament karimov said he was confident of being declared the winner following voting on sunday .
the people know that they are voting for peace and prosperity , the 69-year-old said in the capital tashkent .
the uzbek election commission in november allowed karimov to stand for reelection for a third time though the constitution foresees no more than two terms for the president .
karimov has ruled the country , rich in natural gas and other resources , for the last 18 years .
during that time , karimov has suppressed independent political and religious activity , human rights groups say .
according to observers , karimov leads one of the most repressive governments in central asia .
opposition groups and human rights organizations described the vote as a farce because there was no real alternative to karimov .
fewer observes for russian elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's handpicked successor dmitry medvedev -lrb- left -rrb- is expected to face little opposition meanwhile , a russian senior elections official indicated on monday that russia would invite fewer foreign observers to the presidential election in march than it did four years ago .
stanislav vavilov , deputy head of the central election commission , said that the " preliminary plan " was to invite observers " in the same number and time period " as for the parliamentary poll which was held on dec .
2 . for those elections only 70 western observers monitored the election spread across 11 time zones , down from 400 observers which were present during the last parliamentary elections in 2003 and the presidential poll in 2004 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

just mouth along not a regular church-goer but still like to attend christmas mass ?
you 're not alone .
but please make sure you do n't embarrass yourself or irritate others by following this handy set of rules . attending christmas eve mass is a time-honored tradition in germany .
so much so , that on this one day of the year , normally empty churches are suddenly packed to overflowing with people jostling for a seat .
it would therefore not be amiss to suggest that most people at christmas mass are not regular church-goers , and as such , not overly familiar with the proper procedure .
but never fear , help is at hand , just in time for this christmas eve .
germany 's protestant press service , the evangelische pressedienst -lrb- epd -rrb- , has published a handbook of 10 golden rules to ensure that any once-a-year worshiper can survive christmas mass unscathed .
at the top of the epd 's list of rules : no mobile phones !
and seriously , is there anything more mortifying than your freshly downloaded " jingle bells " ringtone reverberating through the church in a moment of quiet prayer ?
be prepared to live without your cell for about an hour , the epd advises .
navigating holy water and hymns church attendees who wind up in a catholic house of worship may be puzzled about the little dish of water at the entrance .
why is everyone putting their fingers in it , and then touching their head , chest and shoulders ?
do n't panic .
it 's holy water , and catholics use it to bless themselves with the sign of the cross when they enter .
according to the epd , you can follow suit , but you do n't have to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : applauding at the end of the sermon is taboo rule three deals with singing .
in some churches , you 'll be handed a hymnal at the entrance .
the numbers on the board next to the altar indicate which hymns are meant to be sung throughout the service .
if the tune is unfamiliar , or you feel uncomfortable singing in public , do n't worry .
just sing along quietly or keep silent .
assuming you arrive at the church early enough , you may have a choice of seating - for some , a conundrum in itself .
the epd 's guide reassuringly informs you that you may sit wherever you like without your pew-mates wondering what business you have being in their church .
please do n't clap when it 's over but getting a seat is just the first hurdle .
all through the service , you will notice people around you at times sitting , standing , or kneeling .
how do they know when to do what ?
what if you give yourself away as a novice by standing when everyone else kneels ?
slow down , says the fifth rule .
watch the people around you , and do the same as they do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if in doubt , watch your neighbor the sixth rule is all about the sermon .
it usually lasts about 15 minutes and refers to a passage in the bible .
please do n't clap when it 's over .
you can always discuss the sermon with the priest afterwards .
other useful advice included in the golden rules concerns the collection basket .
you got into christmas mass for free , so do n't skimp when the basket comes your way as the proceeds generally go to a good cause .
once you 've made it this far , you 're practically home free .
but how do you recognize when the service has come to an end ?
watch for the blessing , the epd advises .
sometimes , you may hear organ music .
just stay seated and listen .
then , it 's polite to wish your neighbor a merry christmas . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the consumer index was recorded at 4.4 points in november , the fourth month of decline in a row , but december 's showed a slight increase to 4.5 points .
the gfk claimed on the back of the results that " the consumer climate has stabilized as the year draws to a close " and that the december figures were the result of people getting out to do their christmas shopping .
economists have forecast for some time that dropping german unemployment rates would boost consumer spending , historically the weak link in the country 's export-driven economy .
the rate of employment growth has already begun to taper off , however .
analysts credit other financial factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have rediscovered their love of shopping " household income and business cycle expectations are significantly down in the wake of slowing employment growth and inflation gaining speed but the willingness to buy is improving again , " said sylvain broyer , an analyst at corporate and investment bankers ixis-cib .
" this could be related to christmas but is also a consequence of a fading impact of the vat shock in spending habits . "
an increase in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 to 19 percent last january hit retail sales this year , notably for big-ticket items such as automobiles .
in 2008 , lower german exports and corporate investment are expected to slow economic growth to 2.0 percent from an estimated 2.4 percent in 2007 owing to the euro 's strength against the dollar , a weaker us economy , high prices for oil and other commodities and tighter credit conditions .
a spike in inflation caused by rising costs of energy and food products has also dampened consumer sentiment in the second half of 2007 .
institute looks forward to further boosts in 2008 bildunterschrift : germany 's shopping streets may thrive again in 2008 now however , gfk said " the current trend offers good opportunities for a boost in domestic demand in the coming year . "
the institute welcomed a government decision to lower unemployment insurance charges , saying it " will not only impact positively on purchasing power but will also have a favorable effect on employment . "
broyer added that if the vat shock faded , " consumer confidence could improve progressively next year . "
risks faced by the german economy , such as persistent inflation or continued turbulence on financial markets , could nonetheless quickly cause consumers to pull back and put more of their income into savings , gfk said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the gfk claimed on the back of the results that " the consumer climate has stabilized as the year draws to a close " and that the december figures were the result of people getting out to do their christmas shopping .
economists have forecast for some time that dropping german unemployment rates would boost consumer spending , historically the weak link in the country 's export-driven economy .
the rate of employment growth has already begun to taper off , however .
analysts credit other financial factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have rediscovered their love of shopping " household income and business cycle expectations are significantly down in the wake of slowing employment growth and inflation gaining speed but the willingness to buy is improving again , " said sylvain broyer , an analyst at corporate and investment bankers ixis-cib .
" this could be related to christmas but is also a consequence of a fading impact of the vat shock in spending habits . "
an increase in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 to 19 percent last january hit retail sales this year , notably for big-ticket items such as automobiles .
in 2008 , lower german exports and corporate investment are expected to slow economic growth to 2.0 percent from an estimated 2.4 percent in 2007 owing to the euro 's strength against the dollar , a weaker us economy , high prices for oil and other commodities and tighter credit conditions .
a spike in inflation caused by rising costs of energy and food products has also dampened consumer sentiment in the second half of 2007 .
institute looks forward to further boosts in 2008 bildunterschrift : germany 's shopping streets may thrive again in 2008 now however , gfk said " the current trend offers good opportunities for a boost in domestic demand in the coming year . "
the institute welcomed a government decision to lower unemployment insurance charges , saying it " will not only impact positively on purchasing power but will also have a favorable effect on employment . "
broyer added that if the vat shock faded , " consumer confidence could improve progressively next year . "
risks faced by the german economy , such as persistent inflation or continued turbulence on financial markets , could nonetheless quickly cause consumers to pull back and put more of their income into savings , gfk said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 24.12.2007 world class stars aiding bundesliga 's rehabilitation großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bayern 's luca toni and franck ribery joined a league slowly recruiting superstar players when bayern munich bought some of the world 's most wanted players , it looked like game over .
but those who rushed to crown bayern before a ball was even kicked forgot that the league already had its own superstars . before this season got underway , everyone was braced for the usual blast of arrogance from the south of germany .
but instead of a warm front of imperiousness emanating from the area around bayern munich 's allianz arena , the rest of the country was hit by an icy blast of realism . the message from bavaria was the same as in previous years but this time the delivery and reception were different .
when general manager uli hoeness said that bayern would soon be so far off into the distance , their rivals would need binoculars to see them , he said so without the omnipresent braggadocio but with a cold assertion .
in response , the rest of germany just sadly nodded in agreement and started ruminating about who 'd be munich 's closest rivals . the reason for hoeness ' brusque dismissal of the other 17 teams in the bundesliga and the country 's acceptance of his statement as fact could be summed up in three words : klose , ribery , toni . unprecedented spending spree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the signing of the prolific klose put fear into munich 's rivals bayern 's unprecedented summer spending spree seemed to have sealed the championship deal before a ball had even been kicked in anger .
the acquisition of the german national team 's most prolific striker , france 's player of the year and an italian world cup-winning forward was more than just a statement of intent ; it was a declaration of closure .
game over , in other words . yet , with the bundesliga now tucked up in its thermal underwear and slippers for the winter , bayern 's trailblazing early league form is fading like the topic of a drunken conversation over christmas turkey leftovers . even though bayern have lost just once - a 3-1 reverse in stuttgart - ottmar hitzfeld 's side reverted to type as the season wore on with a methodical but slow-paced and ultimately blunt style of play .
as the winter break neared , bayern recorded four drab goalless draws in their last seven league fixtures against deep-lying teams whose sole aim was to smother , thwart and claim a point . bayern 's gallop reduced to a trot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzfeld 's honeymoon period is well and truly over the thoroughbred which was the only entry in a seemingly one-horse race lost its way and finally plodded to the midway point like a retired carthorse in need of a breather .
despite ending the first half of the season on top of the heap , bayern munich 's gallop has been reduced to a trudge . " it could end up a two-horse race , " uli hoeness recently conceded . while those who took great pain from agreeing with hoeness at the start of the season will now be celebrating the fact that the bavarian galacticos have been exposed as mere mortals , a more honorable celebration should be taking place .
bayern may have come a little unstuck but the fact that they lead the bundesliga on goal difference alone at the winter break should be heralded as a sign that german soccer is alive and well . the bundesliga is often ridiculed as the poor relation of the english premiership , spain 's primera liga and serie a in italy .
the soccer is viewed as below most european standards , the spectacle derided and the glamour deemed non-existent . all of which contributed to the view that a sizeable chunk of bayern 's fortune thrown at a trio of international stars would lead to a procession .
with such poor opposition being lined-up for them , it was no surprise that the lavishly put-together bavarian giants were expected to walk it . rival stars driving bayern 's competitors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's second season at bremen is eclipsing his first the league at the halfway point , however , tells a different story .
bayern , and the majority of non-partisan observers , have underestimated the other teams and the impact of many of the other international stars which have slowly contributed to the bundesliga 's rehabilitation . far from being a boring one-team march , this season 's bundesliga is looking like a competition worthy of attention with world stars catching the eye . inspired by diego , the league 's top playmaker and joint top scorer with nine goals , werder bremen have their own international stars driving their championship challenge . bremen looked to have sold their best chance of recapturing the league title when klose joined bayern in the summer but while munich were courting the big names of the 2006 world cup , bremen snapped up boubacar sanogo from hamburg and carlos alberto from porto .
the result is a second-placed team winning games with intercontinental flair . third-placed hamburg are also hot on munich 's heels thanks to another of the league 's superstars . bringing more quality to the league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van der vaart is one of the league 's shining lights the diminutive and prolific rafael van der vaart was a coup signing when he moved from ajax in 2005 .
while the dutchman 's decision to come to germany was a shock to many of those expecting a transfer to italy or spain , van der vaart has shown why he favored a german challenge by helping transform hsv 's fortunes and bringing more quality to the league . the bundesliga may not be able to boast as many big names as other leagues but those who have taken a chance in germany have given the bundesliga a dash of the flair and panache at times , certainly more than in recent years , and have contributed to the sold-out stadiums and thrilling match day atmosphere which are now back in fashion . with these world-class stars spread throughout the chasing pack , bayern munich 's coronation is on hold and the bundesliga is a lot better for it .
as a result , the future for german club soccer looks a lot rosier than it has for a number of years . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , 2008 , it will focus on issues close to home : kosovo 's independence and the efforts of neighboring balkan countries to join the bloc . for the next six months slovenia will sit at the epicenter of the eu .
taking on the presidency is an unprecedented challenge for the affluent alpine country of 2 million people .
slovenia declared independence from yugoslavia in 1991 .
in the years since , it has sprinted towards the west , joining both the eu and nato in 2004 .
now , it 's the first new eu member country to lead the 27-nation bloc .
" this is a historic project for us , " said slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel . " it 's not normal for us to be asked to lead such a presidency and so we want to make an extra effort . "
slovenia has budgeted 62 million euros -lrb- $ 91 million -rrb- as it has hired a slew of translators and advisors to make sure the next six months go over smoothly . the country will be responsible for organizing dozens of conferences , including minister-level meetings .
slovenia sees the presidency as a chance to increase its visibility in europe .
kosovo 's future will top the agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo will top the agenda the eu presidency rotates every six months and was previously held by germany and portugal .
in many ways , slovenia will carry on the priorities - such as climate change and job creation initiatives - started by its predecessors .
the three countries decided to combine forces to set an agenda that would provide the bloc with more continuity .
other agenda points will be determined by events outside the eu 's direct control .
it 's widely assumed that the serbian breakaway province of kosovo will declare independence before slovenia 's presidency is up in june of 2008 .
recent united nations security council efforts to mediate a solution between serbia and kosovo have failed .
and the eu has begun to debate how it should react if the southern serbian province does declare independence .
rupel said the eu and kosovo must " agree on what to do next . "
rupel has carefully avoided using the word " independence " when referring to kosovo , but did say that europe is ready to " recognize the realities of the situation in the western balkans . "
" we believe it is high time for the yugoslav crisis to be over , " rupel told journalists .

he dismissed concerns that slovenia might be influenced by strong business ties to serbia .

" we are not one-sided in this case .
slovenia has excellent cooperation with serbia , also kosovo , with all former yugoslav republics . "
yet slovenia 's ability to lead in the area could be tricky given ongoing border disputes with neighboring croatia .
the biggest is resolving the maritime borders in the bay of piran .
croatia has claimed half of the bay it shares with croatia and italy .
that leaves slovenia without what it feels is an important access to international waters .

critics say social welfare cuts have made the situation even worse . more than 2.5 million children in germany are eligible for welfare benefits .
that 's twice as many as was the case in 2005 , when the german government under social democrat gerhard schröder introduced cuts to the welfare system .
the increase in child poverty is a direct result of those cuts , according to cologne political scientist christoph butterwegge . " -lsb- charities -rsb- and poverty researchers like me warned that this labor market reform would be a slide into poverty and that children would be those mainly affected , " butterwegge said in an interview with the associated press .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greater numbers of people have been turning to die tafel for food donations sicne 2005 his comments received backing from the charity die tafel , which runs soup kitchens and distributes food packets to poor people all over germany .
of the 800,000 people nationwide who received food donations from the charity , around 200,000 were children , the group 's head , gerd häuser , told news agency dpa .
and the number of people die tafel served had grown significantly , from around 600,000 two years ago , and continued to do so .
teachers complain five to 10 percent of schoolchildren were forced to go without lunch , häuser said . " many teachers have complained that after the fourth period , many children run out of energy , because they have n't had a snack , " he said . parents ' benefits , introduced this year , by family minister ursula von der leyen , has meant less money for poor families , butterwegge said .
under the new scheme , all parents , regardless of their income , receive a monthly benefit of 300 euros -lrb- $ 430 -rrb- for a child 's first year .
previously , poor families had been able to collect 300 euros each month for two years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is crucial to fighting poverty butterwegge said the government 's family policy was based on the principle that those who do n't need money , get more , while money is taken from those who have little .
he called for an increase in welfare benefits .
education system cements poverty a study published by the children 's charity of germany in mid-november reported that every sixth child below the age of seven is dependent on welfare benefits .
since 1990 , the year of german unification , child poverty had grown strongly in comparison to other industrialized countries , a 2005 unicef study showed . butterwegge also said germany should change its educational system . " poverty is … caused by the socially selective school system , " he said , referring to the track system that determines at a relatively young age whether or not students will have the chance to study at a university . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but those who rushed to crown bayern before a ball was even kicked forgot that the league already had its own superstars . before this season got underway , everyone was braced for the usual blast of arrogance from the south of germany .
but instead of a warm front of imperiousness emanating from the area around bayern munich 's allianz arena , the rest of the country was hit by an icy blast of realism . the message from bavaria was the same as in previous years but this time the delivery and reception were different .
when general manager uli hoeness said that bayern would soon be so far off into the distance , their rivals would need binoculars to see them , he said so without the omnipresent braggadocio but with a cold assertion .
in response , the rest of germany just sadly nodded in agreement and started ruminating about who 'd be munich 's closest rivals . the reason for hoeness ' brusque dismissal of the other 17 teams in the bundesliga and the country 's acceptance of his statement as fact could be summed up in three words : klose , ribery , toni . unprecedented spending spree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the signing of the prolific klose put fear into munich 's rivals bayern 's unprecedented summer spending spree seemed to have sealed the championship deal before a ball had even been kicked in anger .
the acquisition of the german national team 's most prolific striker , france 's player of the year and an italian world cup-winning forward was more than just a statement of intent ; it was a declaration of closure .
game over , in other words . yet , with the bundesliga now tucked up in its thermal underwear and slippers for the winter , bayern 's trailblazing early league form is fading like the topic of a drunken conversation over christmas turkey leftovers . even though bayern have lost just once - a 3-1 reverse in stuttgart - ottmar hitzfeld 's side reverted to type as the season wore on with a methodical but slow-paced and ultimately blunt style of play .
as the winter break neared , bayern recorded four drab goalless draws in their last seven league fixtures against deep-lying teams whose sole aim was to smother , thwart and claim a point . bayern 's gallop reduced to a trot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzfeld 's honeymoon period is well and truly over the thoroughbred which was the only entry in a seemingly one-horse race lost its way and finally plodded to the midway point like a retired carthorse in need of a breather .
despite ending the first half of the season on top of the heap , bayern munich 's gallop has been reduced to a trudge . " it could end up a two-horse race , " uli hoeness recently conceded . while those who took great pain from agreeing with hoeness at the start of the season will now be celebrating the fact that the bavarian galacticos have been exposed as mere mortals , a more honorable celebration should be taking place .
bayern may have come a little unstuck but the fact that they lead the bundesliga on goal difference alone at the winter break should be heralded as a sign that german soccer is alive and well . the bundesliga is often ridiculed as the poor relation of the english premiership , spain 's primera liga and serie a in italy .
the soccer is viewed as below most european standards , the spectacle derided and the glamour deemed non-existent . all of which contributed to the view that a sizeable chunk of bayern 's fortune thrown at a trio of international stars would lead to a procession .
with such poor opposition being lined-up for them , it was no surprise that the lavishly put-together bavarian giants were expected to walk it . rival stars driving bayern 's competitors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's second season at bremen is eclipsing his first the league at the halfway point , however , tells a different story .
bayern , and the majority of non-partisan observers , have underestimated the other teams and the impact of many of the other international stars which have slowly contributed to the bundesliga 's rehabilitation . far from being a boring one-team march , this season 's bundesliga is looking like a competition worthy of attention with world stars catching the eye . inspired by diego , the league 's top playmaker and joint top scorer with nine goals , werder bremen have their own international stars driving their championship challenge . bremen looked to have sold their best chance of recapturing the league title when klose joined bayern in the summer but while munich were courting the big names of the 2006 world cup , bremen snapped up boubacar sanogo from hamburg and carlos alberto from porto .
the result is a second-placed team winning games with intercontinental flair . third-placed hamburg are also hot on munich 's heels thanks to another of the league 's superstars . bringing more quality to the league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van der vaart is one of the league 's shining lights the diminutive and prolific rafael van der vaart was a coup signing when he moved from ajax in 2005 .
while the dutchman 's decision to come to germany was a shock to many of those expecting a transfer to italy or spain , van der vaart has shown why he favored a german challenge by helping transform hsv 's fortunes and bringing more quality to the league . the bundesliga may not be able to boast as many big names as other leagues but those who have taken a chance in germany have given the bundesliga a dash of the flair and panache at times , certainly more than in recent years , and have contributed to the sold-out stadiums and thrilling match day atmosphere which are now back in fashion . with these world-class stars spread throughout the chasing pack , bayern munich 's coronation is on hold and the bundesliga is a lot better for it .

just mouth along not a regular church-goer but still like to attend christmas mass ?
you 're not alone .
but please make sure you do n't embarrass yourself or irritate others by following this handy set of rules . attending christmas eve mass is a time-honored tradition in germany .
so much so , that on this one day of the year , normally empty churches are suddenly packed to overflowing with people jostling for a seat .
it would therefore not be amiss to suggest that most people at christmas mass are not regular church-goers , and as such , not overly familiar with the proper procedure .
but never fear , help is at hand , just in time for this christmas eve .
germany 's protestant press service , the evangelische pressedienst -lrb- epd -rrb- , has published a handbook of 10 golden rules to ensure that any once-a-year worshiper can survive christmas mass unscathed .
at the top of the epd 's list of rules : no mobile phones !
and seriously , is there anything more mortifying than your freshly downloaded " jingle bells " ringtone reverberating through the church in a moment of quiet prayer ?
be prepared to live without your cell for about an hour , the epd advises .
navigating holy water and hymns church attendees who wind up in a catholic house of worship may be puzzled about the little dish of water at the entrance .
why is everyone putting their fingers in it , and then touching their head , chest and shoulders ?
do n't panic .
it 's holy water , and catholics use it to bless themselves with the sign of the cross when they enter .
according to the epd , you can follow suit , but you do n't have to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : applauding at the end of the sermon is taboo rule three deals with singing .
in some churches , you 'll be handed a hymnal at the entrance .
the numbers on the board next to the altar indicate which hymns are meant to be sung throughout the service .
if the tune is unfamiliar , or you feel uncomfortable singing in public , do n't worry .
just sing along quietly or keep silent .
assuming you arrive at the church early enough , you may have a choice of seating - for some , a conundrum in itself .
the epd 's guide reassuringly informs you that you may sit wherever you like without your pew-mates wondering what business you have being in their church .
please do n't clap when it 's over but getting a seat is just the first hurdle .
all through the service , you will notice people around you at times sitting , standing , or kneeling .
how do they know when to do what ?
what if you give yourself away as a novice by standing when everyone else kneels ?
slow down , says the fifth rule .
watch the people around you , and do the same as they do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if in doubt , watch your neighbor the sixth rule is all about the sermon .
it usually lasts about 15 minutes and refers to a passage in the bible .
please do n't clap when it 's over .
you can always discuss the sermon with the priest afterwards .
other useful advice included in the golden rules concerns the collection basket .
you got into christmas mass for free , so do n't skimp when the basket comes your way as the proceeds generally go to a good cause .
once you 've made it this far , you 're practically home free .
but how do you recognize when the service has come to an end ?
watch for the blessing , the epd advises .
sometimes , you may hear organ music .
just stay seated and listen .

just mouth along not a regular church-goer but still like to attend christmas mass ?
you 're not alone .
but please make sure you do n't embarrass yourself or irritate others by following this handy set of rules . attending christmas eve mass is a time-honored tradition in germany .
so much so , that on this one day of the year , normally empty churches are suddenly packed to overflowing with people jostling for a seat .
it would therefore not be amiss to suggest that most people at christmas mass are not regular church-goers , and as such , not overly familiar with the proper procedure .
but never fear , help is at hand , just in time for this christmas eve .
germany 's protestant press service , the evangelische pressedienst -lrb- epd -rrb- , has published a handbook of 10 golden rules to ensure that any once-a-year worshiper can survive christmas mass unscathed .
at the top of the epd 's list of rules : no mobile phones !
and seriously , is there anything more mortifying than your freshly downloaded " jingle bells " ringtone reverberating through the church in a moment of quiet prayer ?
be prepared to live without your cell for about an hour , the epd advises .
navigating holy water and hymns church attendees who wind up in a catholic house of worship may be puzzled about the little dish of water at the entrance .
why is everyone putting their fingers in it , and then touching their head , chest and shoulders ?
do n't panic .
it 's holy water , and catholics use it to bless themselves with the sign of the cross when they enter .
according to the epd , you can follow suit , but you do n't have to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : applauding at the end of the sermon is taboo rule three deals with singing .
in some churches , you 'll be handed a hymnal at the entrance .
the numbers on the board next to the altar indicate which hymns are meant to be sung throughout the service .
if the tune is unfamiliar , or you feel uncomfortable singing in public , do n't worry .
just sing along quietly or keep silent .
assuming you arrive at the church early enough , you may have a choice of seating - for some , a conundrum in itself .
the epd 's guide reassuringly informs you that you may sit wherever you like without your pew-mates wondering what business you have being in their church .
please do n't clap when it 's over but getting a seat is just the first hurdle .
all through the service , you will notice people around you at times sitting , standing , or kneeling .
how do they know when to do what ?
what if you give yourself away as a novice by standing when everyone else kneels ?
slow down , says the fifth rule .
watch the people around you , and do the same as they do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if in doubt , watch your neighbor the sixth rule is all about the sermon .
it usually lasts about 15 minutes and refers to a passage in the bible .
please do n't clap when it 's over .
you can always discuss the sermon with the priest afterwards .
other useful advice included in the golden rules concerns the collection basket .
you got into christmas mass for free , so do n't skimp when the basket comes your way as the proceeds generally go to a good cause .
once you 've made it this far , you 're practically home free .
but how do you recognize when the service has come to an end ?
watch for the blessing , the epd advises .
sometimes , you may hear organ music .
just stay seated and listen .
then , it 's polite to wish your neighbor a merry christmas . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but those who rushed to crown bayern before a ball was even kicked forgot that the league already had its own superstars . before this season got underway , everyone was braced for the usual blast of arrogance from the south of germany .
but instead of a warm front of imperiousness emanating from the area around bayern munich 's allianz arena , the rest of the country was hit by an icy blast of realism . the message from bavaria was the same as in previous years but this time the delivery and reception were different .
when general manager uli hoeness said that bayern would soon be so far off into the distance , their rivals would need binoculars to see them , he said so without the omnipresent braggadocio but with a cold assertion .
in response , the rest of germany just sadly nodded in agreement and started ruminating about who 'd be munich 's closest rivals . the reason for hoeness ' brusque dismissal of the other 17 teams in the bundesliga and the country 's acceptance of his statement as fact could be summed up in three words : klose , ribery , toni . unprecedented spending spree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the signing of the prolific klose put fear into munich 's rivals bayern 's unprecedented summer spending spree seemed to have sealed the championship deal before a ball had even been kicked in anger .
the acquisition of the german national team 's most prolific striker , france 's player of the year and an italian world cup-winning forward was more than just a statement of intent ; it was a declaration of closure .
game over , in other words . yet , with the bundesliga now tucked up in its thermal underwear and slippers for the winter , bayern 's trailblazing early league form is fading like the topic of a drunken conversation over christmas turkey leftovers . even though bayern have lost just once - a 3-1 reverse in stuttgart - ottmar hitzfeld 's side reverted to type as the season wore on with a methodical but slow-paced and ultimately blunt style of play .
as the winter break neared , bayern recorded four drab goalless draws in their last seven league fixtures against deep-lying teams whose sole aim was to smother , thwart and claim a point . bayern 's gallop reduced to a trot bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzfeld 's honeymoon period is well and truly over the thoroughbred which was the only entry in a seemingly one-horse race lost its way and finally plodded to the midway point like a retired carthorse in need of a breather .
despite ending the first half of the season on top of the heap , bayern munich 's gallop has been reduced to a trudge . " it could end up a two-horse race , " uli hoeness recently conceded . while those who took great pain from agreeing with hoeness at the start of the season will now be celebrating the fact that the bavarian galacticos have been exposed as mere mortals , a more honorable celebration should be taking place .
bayern may have come a little unstuck but the fact that they lead the bundesliga on goal difference alone at the winter break should be heralded as a sign that german soccer is alive and well . the bundesliga is often ridiculed as the poor relation of the english premiership , spain 's primera liga and serie a in italy .
the soccer is viewed as below most european standards , the spectacle derided and the glamour deemed non-existent . all of which contributed to the view that a sizeable chunk of bayern 's fortune thrown at a trio of international stars would lead to a procession .
with such poor opposition being lined-up for them , it was no surprise that the lavishly put-together bavarian giants were expected to walk it . rival stars driving bayern 's competitors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's second season at bremen is eclipsing his first the league at the halfway point , however , tells a different story .
bayern , and the majority of non-partisan observers , have underestimated the other teams and the impact of many of the other international stars which have slowly contributed to the bundesliga 's rehabilitation . far from being a boring one-team march , this season 's bundesliga is looking like a competition worthy of attention with world stars catching the eye . inspired by diego , the league 's top playmaker and joint top scorer with nine goals , werder bremen have their own international stars driving their championship challenge . bremen looked to have sold their best chance of recapturing the league title when klose joined bayern in the summer but while munich were courting the big names of the 2006 world cup , bremen snapped up boubacar sanogo from hamburg and carlos alberto from porto .
the result is a second-placed team winning games with intercontinental flair . third-placed hamburg are also hot on munich 's heels thanks to another of the league 's superstars . bringing more quality to the league bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : van der vaart is one of the league 's shining lights the diminutive and prolific rafael van der vaart was a coup signing when he moved from ajax in 2005 .

the consumer index was recorded at 4.4 points in november , the fourth month of decline in a row , but december 's showed a slight increase to 4.5 points .
the gfk claimed on the back of the results that " the consumer climate has stabilized as the year draws to a close " and that the december figures were the result of people getting out to do their christmas shopping .
economists have forecast for some time that dropping german unemployment rates would boost consumer spending , historically the weak link in the country 's export-driven economy .
the rate of employment growth has already begun to taper off , however .
analysts credit other financial factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have rediscovered their love of shopping " household income and business cycle expectations are significantly down in the wake of slowing employment growth and inflation gaining speed but the willingness to buy is improving again , " said sylvain broyer , an analyst at corporate and investment bankers ixis-cib .
" this could be related to christmas but is also a consequence of a fading impact of the vat shock in spending habits . "
an increase in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 to 19 percent last january hit retail sales this year , notably for big-ticket items such as automobiles .
in 2008 , lower german exports and corporate investment are expected to slow economic growth to 2.0 percent from an estimated 2.4 percent in 2007 owing to the euro 's strength against the dollar , a weaker us economy , high prices for oil and other commodities and tighter credit conditions .
a spike in inflation caused by rising costs of energy and food products has also dampened consumer sentiment in the second half of 2007 .
institute looks forward to further boosts in 2008 bildunterschrift : germany 's shopping streets may thrive again in 2008 now however , gfk said " the current trend offers good opportunities for a boost in domestic demand in the coming year . "
the institute welcomed a government decision to lower unemployment insurance charges , saying it " will not only impact positively on purchasing power but will also have a favorable effect on employment . "
broyer added that if the vat shock faded , " consumer confidence could improve progressively next year . "
risks faced by the german economy , such as persistent inflation or continued turbulence on financial markets , could nonetheless quickly cause consumers to pull back and put more of their income into savings , gfk said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the gfk claimed on the back of the results that " the consumer climate has stabilized as the year draws to a close " and that the december figures were the result of people getting out to do their christmas shopping .
economists have forecast for some time that dropping german unemployment rates would boost consumer spending , historically the weak link in the country 's export-driven economy .
the rate of employment growth has already begun to taper off , however .
analysts credit other financial factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have rediscovered their love of shopping " household income and business cycle expectations are significantly down in the wake of slowing employment growth and inflation gaining speed but the willingness to buy is improving again , " said sylvain broyer , an analyst at corporate and investment bankers ixis-cib .
" this could be related to christmas but is also a consequence of a fading impact of the vat shock in spending habits . "
an increase in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 to 19 percent last january hit retail sales this year , notably for big-ticket items such as automobiles .
in 2008 , lower german exports and corporate investment are expected to slow economic growth to 2.0 percent from an estimated 2.4 percent in 2007 owing to the euro 's strength against the dollar , a weaker us economy , high prices for oil and other commodities and tighter credit conditions .
a spike in inflation caused by rising costs of energy and food products has also dampened consumer sentiment in the second half of 2007 .
institute looks forward to further boosts in 2008 bildunterschrift : germany 's shopping streets may thrive again in 2008 now however , gfk said " the current trend offers good opportunities for a boost in domestic demand in the coming year . "
the institute welcomed a government decision to lower unemployment insurance charges , saying it " will not only impact positively on purchasing power but will also have a favorable effect on employment . "
broyer added that if the vat shock faded , " consumer confidence could improve progressively next year . "
risks faced by the german economy , such as persistent inflation or continued turbulence on financial markets , could nonetheless quickly cause consumers to pull back and put more of their income into savings , gfk said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

taking on the presidency is an unprecedented challenge for the affluent alpine country of 2 million people .
slovenia declared independence from yugoslavia in 1991 .
in the years since , it has sprinted towards the west , joining both the eu and nato in 2004 .
now , it 's the first new eu member country to lead the 27-nation bloc .
" this is a historic project for us , " said slovenian foreign minister dimitrij rupel . " it 's not normal for us to be asked to lead such a presidency and so we want to make an extra effort . "
slovenia has budgeted 62 million euros -lrb- $ 91 million -rrb- as it has hired a slew of translators and advisors to make sure the next six months go over smoothly . the country will be responsible for organizing dozens of conferences , including minister-level meetings .

the three countries decided to combine forces to set an agenda that would provide the bloc with more continuity .
other agenda points will be determined by events outside the eu 's direct control .
it 's widely assumed that the serbian breakaway province of kosovo will declare independence before slovenia 's presidency is up in june of 2008 .
recent united nations security council efforts to mediate a solution between serbia and kosovo have failed .
and the eu has begun to debate how it should react if the southern serbian province does declare independence .
rupel said the eu and kosovo must " agree on what to do next . "
rupel has carefully avoided using the word " independence " when referring to kosovo , but did say that europe is ready to " recognize the realities of the situation in the western balkans . "

" we are not one-sided in this case .
slovenia has excellent cooperation with serbia , also kosovo , with all former yugoslav republics . "
yet slovenia 's ability to lead in the area could be tricky given ongoing border disputes with neighboring croatia .

critics say social welfare cuts have made the situation even worse . more than 2.5 million children in germany are eligible for welfare benefits .
that 's twice as many as was the case in 2005 , when the german government under social democrat gerhard schröder introduced cuts to the welfare system .
the increase in child poverty is a direct result of those cuts , according to cologne political scientist christoph butterwegge . " -lsb- charities -rsb- and poverty researchers like me warned that this labor market reform would be a slide into poverty and that children would be those mainly affected , " butterwegge said in an interview with the associated press .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : greater numbers of people have been turning to die tafel for food donations sicne 2005 his comments received backing from the charity die tafel , which runs soup kitchens and distributes food packets to poor people all over germany .
of the 800,000 people nationwide who received food donations from the charity , around 200,000 were children , the group 's head , gerd häuser , told news agency dpa .
and the number of people die tafel served had grown significantly , from around 600,000 two years ago , and continued to do so .
teachers complain five to 10 percent of schoolchildren were forced to go without lunch , häuser said . " many teachers have complained that after the fourth period , many children run out of energy , because they have n't had a snack , " he said . parents ' benefits , introduced this year , by family minister ursula von der leyen , has meant less money for poor families , butterwegge said .
under the new scheme , all parents , regardless of their income , receive a monthly benefit of 300 euros -lrb- $ 430 -rrb- for a child 's first year .
previously , poor families had been able to collect 300 euros each month for two years .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : education is crucial to fighting poverty butterwegge said the government 's family policy was based on the principle that those who do n't need money , get more , while money is taken from those who have little .
he called for an increase in welfare benefits .
education system cements poverty a study published by the children 's charity of germany in mid-november reported that every sixth child below the age of seven is dependent on welfare benefits .
since 1990 , the year of german unification , child poverty had grown strongly in comparison to other industrialized countries , a 2005 unicef study showed . butterwegge also said germany should change its educational system . " poverty is … caused by the socially selective school system , " he said , referring to the track system that determines at a relatively young age whether or not students will have the chance to study at a university . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the consumer index was recorded at 4.4 points in november , the fourth month of decline in a row , but december 's showed a slight increase to 4.5 points .
the gfk claimed on the back of the results that " the consumer climate has stabilized as the year draws to a close " and that the december figures were the result of people getting out to do their christmas shopping .
economists have forecast for some time that dropping german unemployment rates would boost consumer spending , historically the weak link in the country 's export-driven economy .
the rate of employment growth has already begun to taper off , however .
analysts credit other financial factors bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans have rediscovered their love of shopping " household income and business cycle expectations are significantly down in the wake of slowing employment growth and inflation gaining speed but the willingness to buy is improving again , " said sylvain broyer , an analyst at corporate and investment bankers ixis-cib .
" this could be related to christmas but is also a consequence of a fading impact of the vat shock in spending habits . "
an increase in value added tax -lrb- vat -rrb- from 16 to 19 percent last january hit retail sales this year , notably for big-ticket items such as automobiles .
in 2008 , lower german exports and corporate investment are expected to slow economic growth to 2.0 percent from an estimated 2.4 percent in 2007 owing to the euro 's strength against the dollar , a weaker us economy , high prices for oil and other commodities and tighter credit conditions .
a spike in inflation caused by rising costs of energy and food products has also dampened consumer sentiment in the second half of 2007 .
institute looks forward to further boosts in 2008 bildunterschrift : germany 's shopping streets may thrive again in 2008 now however , gfk said " the current trend offers good opportunities for a boost in domestic demand in the coming year . "
the institute welcomed a government decision to lower unemployment insurance charges , saying it " will not only impact positively on purchasing power but will also have a favorable effect on employment . "
broyer added that if the vat shock faded , " consumer confidence could improve progressively next year . "
risks faced by the german economy , such as persistent inflation or continued turbulence on financial markets , could nonetheless quickly cause consumers to pull back and put more of their income into savings , gfk said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

just mouth along not a regular church-goer but still like to attend christmas mass ?
you 're not alone .
but please make sure you do n't embarrass yourself or irritate others by following this handy set of rules . attending christmas eve mass is a time-honored tradition in germany .
so much so , that on this one day of the year , normally empty churches are suddenly packed to overflowing with people jostling for a seat .
it would therefore not be amiss to suggest that most people at christmas mass are not regular church-goers , and as such , not overly familiar with the proper procedure .
but never fear , help is at hand , just in time for this christmas eve .
germany 's protestant press service , the evangelische pressedienst -lrb- epd -rrb- , has published a handbook of 10 golden rules to ensure that any once-a-year worshiper can survive christmas mass unscathed .
at the top of the epd 's list of rules : no mobile phones !
and seriously , is there anything more mortifying than your freshly downloaded " jingle bells " ringtone reverberating through the church in a moment of quiet prayer ?
be prepared to live without your cell for about an hour , the epd advises .
navigating holy water and hymns church attendees who wind up in a catholic house of worship may be puzzled about the little dish of water at the entrance .
why is everyone putting their fingers in it , and then touching their head , chest and shoulders ?
do n't panic .
it 's holy water , and catholics use it to bless themselves with the sign of the cross when they enter .
according to the epd , you can follow suit , but you do n't have to .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : applauding at the end of the sermon is taboo rule three deals with singing .
in some churches , you 'll be handed a hymnal at the entrance .
the numbers on the board next to the altar indicate which hymns are meant to be sung throughout the service .
if the tune is unfamiliar , or you feel uncomfortable singing in public , do n't worry .
just sing along quietly or keep silent .
assuming you arrive at the church early enough , you may have a choice of seating - for some , a conundrum in itself .
the epd 's guide reassuringly informs you that you may sit wherever you like without your pew-mates wondering what business you have being in their church .
please do n't clap when it 's over but getting a seat is just the first hurdle .
all through the service , you will notice people around you at times sitting , standing , or kneeling .
how do they know when to do what ?
what if you give yourself away as a novice by standing when everyone else kneels ?
slow down , says the fifth rule .
watch the people around you , and do the same as they do .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if in doubt , watch your neighbor the sixth rule is all about the sermon .
it usually lasts about 15 minutes and refers to a passage in the bible .
please do n't clap when it 's over .
you can always discuss the sermon with the priest afterwards .
other useful advice included in the golden rules concerns the collection basket .
you got into christmas mass for free , so do n't skimp when the basket comes your way as the proceeds generally go to a good cause .
once you 've made it this far , you 're practically home free .
but how do you recognize when the service has come to an end ?
watch for the blessing , the epd advises .
sometimes , you may hear organ music .
just stay seated and listen .
then , it 's polite to wish your neighbor a merry christmas . dw staff -lrb- dc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the marines of 40 commando are vying to see who can grow the most outrageous piece of face furniture in a competition that will be judged by a panel of their peers on boxing day .
the conditions the men are living in may be basic in the extreme , and the fierce battles they find themselves in often hair-raising , but judging by some of the photos sent in by royal marine competitors , the men themselves are hairier .
the moustache competition is really just a bit of fun and light relief in an environment that is otherwise deadly serious major alex murray in pictures : the entrants what the duke of wellington once said of his own troops is clearly still true today : " i do n't know what they do to the enemy , but by god , they frighten me . "
second in command of 40 commando , major alex murray , terms the competition a " morale-boosting bit of fun " .
" generations of our forefathers have been marching around these hills with the most splendid array of facial hair , " he says .
" we found throughout history , the upper lip has been stiffened with a good moustache .
" some aspects of warfare are timeless , and in this case the requirement for impressive facial hair is as important today as it was for our forefathers working on the north west frontier .
another opts for a more central american feel -lrb- pic : mod -rrb- " generations of british marines have operated in places like afghanistan over the last two centuries .
often working in austere conditions , a good tash has proved essential in maintaining the stiff upper lip , and north helmand in the current clime is no exception . "
clearly , when the terrain is harsh , and the conditions the men live and fight in are - at best - austere , there is a need for a little light christmas distraction .
major murray says : " the moustache competition is really just a bit of fun and light relief in an environment that is otherwise deadly serious .
" daily the marines and soldiers of 40 commando are doing amazingly brave acts alongside our comrades from the afghan national army and police , and life can be pretty intense .
but one younger competitor can not produce much at all -lrb- pic : mod -rrb- " morale-boosting bits of fun like this go a long way to defusing the tension and keep everyone cheerful .
" morale in the unit is especially high at the moment , especially with the added support of family and friends and the wider public over the christmas period .
they are constantly in our thoughts and we look forward to our return in a few months time . "
the marines are not the only ones working over christmas ; most of the 7,800 men and women serving in afghanistan will be on duty on christmas day , working as normal , whether on the front lines or as support and logistics staff back at the main british bases .
however , few will be sporting quite the tash-tastic facial hair of 40 commando the royal marines .

the marines of 40 commando are vying to see who can grow the most outrageous piece of face furniture in a competition that will be judged by a panel of their peers on boxing day .
the conditions the men are living in may be basic in the extreme , and the fierce battles they find themselves in often hair-raising , but judging by some of the photos sent in by royal marine competitors , the men themselves are hairier .
the moustache competition is really just a bit of fun and light relief in an environment that is otherwise deadly serious major alex murray in pictures : the entrants what the duke of wellington once said of his own troops is clearly still true today : " i do n't know what they do to the enemy , but by god , they frighten me .

second in command of 40 commando , major alex murray , terms the competition a " morale-boosting bit of fun " .
" generations of our forefathers have been marching around these hills with the most splendid array of facial hair , " he says .
" we found throughout history , the upper lip has been stiffened with a good moustache .

clearly , when the terrain is harsh , and the conditions the men live and fight in are - at best - austere , there is a need for a little light christmas distraction .
major murray says : " the moustache competition is really just a bit of fun and light relief in an environment that is otherwise deadly serious .
" daily the marines and soldiers of 40 commando are doing amazingly brave acts alongside our comrades from the afghan national army and police , and life can be pretty intense .

" morale in the unit is especially high at the moment , especially with the added support of family and friends and the wider public over the christmas period .

the marines are not the only ones working over christmas ; most of the 7,800 men and women serving in afghanistan will be on duty on christmas day , working as normal , whether on the front lines or as support and logistics staff back at the main british bases .
however , few will be sporting quite the tash-tastic facial hair of 40 commando the royal marines .

the marines of 40 commando are vying to see who can grow the most outrageous piece of face furniture in a competition that will be judged by a panel of their peers on boxing day .
the conditions the men are living in may be basic in the extreme , and the fierce battles they find themselves in often hair-raising , but judging by some of the photos sent in by royal marine competitors , the men themselves are hairier .
the moustache competition is really just a bit of fun and light relief in an environment that is otherwise deadly serious major alex murray in pictures : the entrants what the duke of wellington once said of his own troops is clearly still true today : " i do n't know what they do to the enemy , but by god , they frighten me . "
second in command of 40 commando , major alex murray , terms the competition a " morale-boosting bit of fun " .
" generations of our forefathers have been marching around these hills with the most splendid array of facial hair , " he says .
" we found throughout history , the upper lip has been stiffened with a good moustache .
" some aspects of warfare are timeless , and in this case the requirement for impressive facial hair is as important today as it was for our forefathers working on the north west frontier .

often working in austere conditions , a good tash has proved essential in maintaining the stiff upper lip , and north helmand in the current clime is no exception . "
clearly , when the terrain is harsh , and the conditions the men live and fight in are - at best - austere , there is a need for a little light christmas distraction .
major murray says : " the moustache competition is really just a bit of fun and light relief in an environment that is otherwise deadly serious .
" daily the marines and soldiers of 40 commando are doing amazingly brave acts alongside our comrades from the afghan national army and police , and life can be pretty intense .
but one younger competitor can not produce much at all -lrb- pic : mod -rrb- " morale-boosting bits of fun like this go a long way to defusing the tension and keep everyone cheerful .
" morale in the unit is especially high at the moment , especially with the added support of family and friends and the wider public over the christmas period .
they are constantly in our thoughts and we look forward to our return in a few months time . "
the marines are not the only ones working over christmas ; most of the 7,800 men and women serving in afghanistan will be on duty on christmas day , working as normal , whether on the front lines or as support and logistics staff back at the main british bases .
however , few will be sporting quite the tash-tastic facial hair of 40 commando the royal marines .
