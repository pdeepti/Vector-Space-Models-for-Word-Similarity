program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 31.01.2007 germany upbeat about economy despite tax hike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things can only go up for germany , if the government is to be believed the expected global economic slowdown and a sharp rise in sales tax will have only a limited impact on the german economy this year when unemployment is expected to fall to a record low , the government said wednesday . in its annual economic report published wednesday , the german government raised its 2007 growth forecast to 1.7 percent in 2007 , instead of the previously forecast 1.4 percent . in 2006 , the german economy notched up growth of 2.5 percent , its fastest rate of growth since the boom of 2000 . and the annual average jobless rate would fall to 9.6 percent this year from 10.8 percent in 2006 , the government predicted . " with a bit of luck " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos is upbeat about germany 's economic prospects indeed , " with a bit of luck " , the annual average jobless total could fall below the key four-million mark , economy minister michael glos told a news conference in berlin on wednesday . in 2006 , the annual average jobless total stood at 4.487 million .
the last time unemployment in germany was less than four million was in 2001 . " the economic engine is running smoothly , " glos said .
and he expressed confidence that any negative economic effects from the sharp rise in value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- that came into on january 1 would be short-lived . " the vat effect will be overcome within a few months and household consumption will pick up again , " glos said . the government raised vat from 16 percent to 19 percent at the beginning of the year in a move which critics claimed would drag on consumer spending and on economic activity as a whole . glos : reforms made it possible glos said it was " particularly pleasing that , in addition to the impulses coming from foreign trade , the domestic economy is contributing increasingly to growth . " he added : " the economy is standing on two legs and is more robust to the global economic challenges facing us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economic engine is humming nicely the government 's recent labor market and social welfare reforms had helped enhance germany 's economic performance , glos said . " the deep and far-reaching reforms have given investors and consumers confidence for the future and set free economic forces , " he asserted . nevertheless , the government must not rest on its laurels and think the current upturn can solve the country 's remaining economic problems , glos continued . " further structural reforms are indispensable , " he concluded . the economics minister 's confidence is based on the hope that an increase in domestic demand will be added to germany 's already brilliant export balance . opposition remains wary glos also pointed out that it was n't just the government 's reforms that were responsible for the upswing . " there have been many players who 've made this upswing possible , among them employers and employees with their moderate wage bargaining deals , " he said .
" they 've added to germany 's increased competitiveness on the global market . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers are still shopping , despite the sales tax increase however opposition leaders have urged the grand coalition of christian and social democrats not to rest on their laurels and push on with the reform course . they criticize that the general economic upswing has not yet resulted in an improvement of the situation for the long-term unemployed .
it seems to be as hard for them to get a proper job now as it was before merkel 's government took office . turning to the state of germany 's public finances , which improved sharply in 2006 , glos said that the government would press ahead with budget consolidation . under eu rules , eurozone countries are not allowed to run up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp , a limit that germany had exceeded every year since 2002 .
but the german deficit ratio fell back within eu limits in 2006 owing to increased tax revenues from the booming economy and lower unemployment payouts . flow of good news the government 's confidence is backed up by the seemingly never-ending flow of positive economic data recently . on wednesday , the latest monthly unemployment data showed that the downward trend is still intact , despite an upward blip in the jobless total in january . retail sales rebounded in december , separate data showed , and inflation picked up only marginally , with the vat hike having a much more limited effect than feared . the federal labor agency in nuremberg calculated that the jobless total rose by 240,000 to 4.247 million in raw or unadjusted terms in january , pushing the jobless rate - which measures the total number of people out of work against the working population as a whole - up to 10.2 percent from 9.6 percent from december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the long lines at the job office are gradually shrinking nevertheless , the increase was not as steep as is usual at this time of year , when the jobless numbers are traditionally boosted by the bad weather and the end of seasonal christmas contracts . after taking such factors into account , unemployment continued to decline this month .
the bundesbank calculated that the seasonally-adjusted number of jobless declined by 106,000 to 3.976 million in january , cutting the adjusted jobless rate to 9.5 percent from 9.8 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : good news for germany 's economy although sales tax increases at the beginning of 2007 are likely to temporarily dampen the german economy , the economic outlook for next year is extremely positive , says dw-radio 's karl zawadzky .

" despite resurgent violence and record opium production levels , the jcmb has been able to oversee quiet but steady progress towards many vital goals , " the statement said . these included the creation of a mechanism to appoint civil servants , increased administrative support to the new national assembly and the introduction of procedures to ensure greater transparency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : königs has been in his current job for a year the un representative to afghanistan , tom königs , said the international community must move forward .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 31.01.2007 german court orders arrest of 13 over cia kidnapping großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el masri claims he was abducted by us agents in 2003 a german court ordered the arrest of 13 people behind the alleged cia-backed kidnapping of a german citizen , believed to be one of the most notorious us " renditions " of a terror suspect , prosecutors said wednesday . the prosecutor 's office in munich , southern germany , said the city 's administrative court had issued the arrest warrants against individuals thought to be cia agents on suspicion of abduction and grievous bodily harm . authorities are probing allegations by khaled el-masri , a lebanese-born german , that he was abducted by us agents in the macedonian capital skopje on new year 's eve 2003 .
he says he was flown to a prison in afghanistan for interrogation before being released five months later in albania . masri , a 43-year-old unemployed car salesman and father of six , has said he was drugged and tortured while imprisoned . the case raised tensions when us secretary of state condoleezza rice visited germany in december 2005 at the height of a controversy over the cia 's strategy of " rendition " - flying terror suspects through european states to detention in third countries where they risk being tortured . after the meeting with rice , german chancellor angela merkel said masri 's case " was accepted as a mistake by the us government , " although us officials later suggested her remark was the result of a misunderstanding . reports have indicated that us agents confused masri with a terror suspect with a similar name who was linked to the attacks of september 11 , 2001 . help from spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plane in question lifting off from mallorca 's airport the munich prosecutor 's office said it had received in december 2005 from masri 's lawyer a list of names of people on board the plane that took masri to afghanistan .
the list originated from a spanish journalist citing the country 's civil guard . the agents are believed to have taken off from the airport in palma de mallorca , picked up masri in macedonia and taken him to afghanistan .
in 2006 , spanish and italian authorities provided further information about the flights , the prosecutor 's office said . " according to the information we have , the suspects listed in the arrest warrants are believed to be so-called code names of cia agents , " the prosecutor 's office said in a statement .
" the investigation will now focus on learning the actual names of the suspects . " these findings , as well as other information uncovered in the probe , led to the strong suspicion that these 13 identifiable people were involved in the abduction of masri , " the office said . masri 's lawyer manfred gnijdic said that although the suspects ' extradition was unlikely , the warrants were a victory for his client . " german authorities have not accepted the criminal behavior of cia employees against a german citizen , " he said . tv report : us cooperation unlikely german public broadcaster ndr had reported earlier that most of the cia employees sought lived in the us state of north carolina .
ndr said spanish authorities had learned the identities of all 13 agents on board and had copies of some of their passports . although all of the names were believed to be aliases , ndr said it was possible , using other data , to learn their real identities .
the report said three of the suspects worked for aero contractors , believed to be the cia 's secret airline . ndr noted that the german arrest warrants were not valid in the united states and that us authorities had refused to cooperate with the investigation .
if the suspects were to travel to the european union , however , they could be arrested . us lawsuit , german investigation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german parliamentary committee has been charged with investigating the case el-masri has also filed a lawsuit in the us , but the complaint was thrown out by a us district court judge last year because of a perceived risk to national security .
the american civil liberties union -lrb- aclu -rrb- is appealing that decision . a german parliamentary committee is also reviewing the case .
members of germany 's former government of social democrats and greens , which was in power at the time , have testified that they knew nothing about the abduction . el-masri is one of the most high-profile cases of a suspected " extraordinary rendition " undertaken as part of us anti-terror efforts .
italy is conducting a similar investigation into the kidnapping of an egyptian cleric in milan . a european parliamentary committee approved a report last week saying that 13 eu countries were involved in renditions to secret detention camps . the arrest warrants come amid a controversy over the german government 's alleged refusal to help a german-born turk , murat kurnaz , who was held at the us lock-up for terror suspects in guantanamo bay , cuba , for four and a half years before being released in august without charge . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ministers deny helping us kidnap terror suspect in front of a parliamentary inquiry , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and his predecessor joschka fischer have denied knowing about the us abduction of a german citizen who says he was tortured by the cia .

" with a bit of luck " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos is upbeat about germany 's economic prospects indeed , " with a bit of luck " , the annual average jobless total could fall below the key four-million mark , economy minister michael glos told a news conference in berlin on wednesday . in 2006 , the annual average jobless total stood at 4.487 million .
the last time unemployment in germany was less than four million was in 2001 . " the economic engine is running smoothly , " glos said .
and he expressed confidence that any negative economic effects from the sharp rise in value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- that came into on january 1 would be short-lived . " the vat effect will be overcome within a few months and household consumption will pick up again , " glos said . the government raised vat from 16 percent to 19 percent at the beginning of the year in a move which critics claimed would drag on consumer spending and on economic activity as a whole . glos : reforms made it possible glos said it was " particularly pleasing that , in addition to the impulses coming from foreign trade , the domestic economy is contributing increasingly to growth . " he added : " the economy is standing on two legs and is more robust to the global economic challenges facing us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economic engine is humming nicely the government 's recent labor market and social welfare reforms had helped enhance germany 's economic performance , glos said . " the deep and far-reaching reforms have given investors and consumers confidence for the future and set free economic forces , " he asserted . nevertheless , the government must not rest on its laurels and think the current upturn can solve the country 's remaining economic problems , glos continued . " further structural reforms are indispensable , " he concluded . the economics minister 's confidence is based on the hope that an increase in domestic demand will be added to germany 's already brilliant export balance . opposition remains wary glos also pointed out that it was n't just the government 's reforms that were responsible for the upswing . " there have been many players who 've made this upswing possible , among them employers and employees with their moderate wage bargaining deals , " he said .
" they 've added to germany 's increased competitiveness on the global market . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers are still shopping , despite the sales tax increase however opposition leaders have urged the grand coalition of christian and social democrats not to rest on their laurels and push on with the reform course . they criticize that the general economic upswing has not yet resulted in an improvement of the situation for the long-term unemployed .
it seems to be as hard for them to get a proper job now as it was before merkel 's government took office . turning to the state of germany 's public finances , which improved sharply in 2006 , glos said that the government would press ahead with budget consolidation . under eu rules , eurozone countries are not allowed to run up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp , a limit that germany had exceeded every year since 2002 .
but the german deficit ratio fell back within eu limits in 2006 owing to increased tax revenues from the booming economy and lower unemployment payouts . flow of good news the government 's confidence is backed up by the seemingly never-ending flow of positive economic data recently . on wednesday , the latest monthly unemployment data showed that the downward trend is still intact , despite an upward blip in the jobless total in january . retail sales rebounded in december , separate data showed , and inflation picked up only marginally , with the vat hike having a much more limited effect than feared . the federal labor agency in nuremberg calculated that the jobless total rose by 240,000 to 4.247 million in raw or unadjusted terms in january , pushing the jobless rate - which measures the total number of people out of work against the working population as a whole - up to 10.2 percent from 9.6 percent from december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the long lines at the job office are gradually shrinking nevertheless , the increase was not as steep as is usual at this time of year , when the jobless numbers are traditionally boosted by the bad weather and the end of seasonal christmas contracts . after taking such factors into account , unemployment continued to decline this month .
the bundesbank calculated that the seasonally-adjusted number of jobless declined by 106,000 to 3.976 million in january , cutting the adjusted jobless rate to 9.5 percent from 9.8 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : good news for germany 's economy although sales tax increases at the beginning of 2007 are likely to temporarily dampen the german economy , the economic outlook for next year is extremely positive , says dw-radio 's karl zawadzky .

he says he was flown to a prison in afghanistan for interrogation before being released five months later in albania . masri , a 43-year-old unemployed car salesman and father of six , has said he was drugged and tortured while imprisoned . the case raised tensions when us secretary of state condoleezza rice visited germany in december 2005 at the height of a controversy over the cia 's strategy of " rendition " - flying terror suspects through european states to detention in third countries where they risk being tortured . after the meeting with rice , german chancellor angela merkel said masri 's case " was accepted as a mistake by the us government , " although us officials later suggested her remark was the result of a misunderstanding . reports have indicated that us agents confused masri with a terror suspect with a similar name who was linked to the attacks of september 11 , 2001 . help from spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plane in question lifting off from mallorca 's airport the munich prosecutor 's office said it had received in december 2005 from masri 's lawyer a list of names of people on board the plane that took masri to afghanistan .
the list originated from a spanish journalist citing the country 's civil guard . the agents are believed to have taken off from the airport in palma de mallorca , picked up masri in macedonia and taken him to afghanistan .

" german authorities have not accepted the criminal behavior of cia employees against a german citizen , " he said . tv report : us cooperation unlikely german public broadcaster ndr had reported earlier that most of the cia employees sought lived in the us state of north carolina .

members of germany 's former government of social democrats and greens , which was in power at the time , have testified that they knew nothing about the abduction . el-masri is one of the most high-profile cases of a suspected " extraordinary rendition " undertaken as part of us anti-terror efforts .
italy is conducting a similar investigation into the kidnapping of an egyptian cleric in milan . a european parliamentary committee approved a report last week saying that 13 eu countries were involved in renditions to secret detention camps . the arrest warrants come amid a controversy over the german government 's alleged refusal to help a german-born turk , murat kurnaz , who was held at the us lock-up for terror suspects in guantanamo bay , cuba , for four and a half years before being released in august without charge . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ministers deny helping us kidnap terror suspect in front of a parliamentary inquiry , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and his predecessor joschka fischer have denied knowing about the us abduction of a german citizen who says he was tortured by the cia .

he says he was flown to a prison in afghanistan for interrogation before being released five months later in albania . masri , a 43-year-old unemployed car salesman and father of six , has said he was drugged and tortured while imprisoned . the case raised tensions when us secretary of state condoleezza rice visited germany in december 2005 at the height of a controversy over the cia 's strategy of " rendition " - flying terror suspects through european states to detention in third countries where they risk being tortured . after the meeting with rice , german chancellor angela merkel said masri 's case " was accepted as a mistake by the us government , " although us officials later suggested her remark was the result of a misunderstanding . reports have indicated that us agents confused masri with a terror suspect with a similar name who was linked to the attacks of september 11 , 2001 . help from spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plane in question lifting off from mallorca 's airport the munich prosecutor 's office said it had received in december 2005 from masri 's lawyer a list of names of people on board the plane that took masri to afghanistan .
the list originated from a spanish journalist citing the country 's civil guard . the agents are believed to have taken off from the airport in palma de mallorca , picked up masri in macedonia and taken him to afghanistan .
in 2006 , spanish and italian authorities provided further information about the flights , the prosecutor 's office said . " according to the information we have , the suspects listed in the arrest warrants are believed to be so-called code names of cia agents , " the prosecutor 's office said in a statement .
" the investigation will now focus on learning the actual names of the suspects . " these findings , as well as other information uncovered in the probe , led to the strong suspicion that these 13 identifiable people were involved in the abduction of masri , " the office said . masri 's lawyer manfred gnijdic said that although the suspects ' extradition was unlikely , the warrants were a victory for his client . " german authorities have not accepted the criminal behavior of cia employees against a german citizen , " he said . tv report : us cooperation unlikely german public broadcaster ndr had reported earlier that most of the cia employees sought lived in the us state of north carolina .
ndr said spanish authorities had learned the identities of all 13 agents on board and had copies of some of their passports . although all of the names were believed to be aliases , ndr said it was possible , using other data , to learn their real identities .
the report said three of the suspects worked for aero contractors , believed to be the cia 's secret airline . ndr noted that the german arrest warrants were not valid in the united states and that us authorities had refused to cooperate with the investigation .
if the suspects were to travel to the european union , however , they could be arrested . us lawsuit , german investigation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german parliamentary committee has been charged with investigating the case el-masri has also filed a lawsuit in the us , but the complaint was thrown out by a us district court judge last year because of a perceived risk to national security .
the american civil liberties union -lrb- aclu -rrb- is appealing that decision . a german parliamentary committee is also reviewing the case .
members of germany 's former government of social democrats and greens , which was in power at the time , have testified that they knew nothing about the abduction . el-masri is one of the most high-profile cases of a suspected " extraordinary rendition " undertaken as part of us anti-terror efforts .
italy is conducting a similar investigation into the kidnapping of an egyptian cleric in milan . a european parliamentary committee approved a report last week saying that 13 eu countries were involved in renditions to secret detention camps . the arrest warrants come amid a controversy over the german government 's alleged refusal to help a german-born turk , murat kurnaz , who was held at the us lock-up for terror suspects in guantanamo bay , cuba , for four and a half years before being released in august without charge . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ministers deny helping us kidnap terror suspect in front of a parliamentary inquiry , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and his predecessor joschka fischer have denied knowing about the us abduction of a german citizen who says he was tortured by the cia .

he says he was flown to a prison in afghanistan for interrogation before being released five months later in albania . masri , a 43-year-old unemployed car salesman and father of six , has said he was drugged and tortured while imprisoned . the case raised tensions when us secretary of state condoleezza rice visited germany in december 2005 at the height of a controversy over the cia 's strategy of " rendition " - flying terror suspects through european states to detention in third countries where they risk being tortured . after the meeting with rice , german chancellor angela merkel said masri 's case " was accepted as a mistake by the us government , " although us officials later suggested her remark was the result of a misunderstanding . reports have indicated that us agents confused masri with a terror suspect with a similar name who was linked to the attacks of september 11 , 2001 . help from spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plane in question lifting off from mallorca 's airport the munich prosecutor 's office said it had received in december 2005 from masri 's lawyer a list of names of people on board the plane that took masri to afghanistan .
the list originated from a spanish journalist citing the country 's civil guard . the agents are believed to have taken off from the airport in palma de mallorca , picked up masri in macedonia and taken him to afghanistan .
in 2006 , spanish and italian authorities provided further information about the flights , the prosecutor 's office said . " according to the information we have , the suspects listed in the arrest warrants are believed to be so-called code names of cia agents , " the prosecutor 's office said in a statement .
" the investigation will now focus on learning the actual names of the suspects . " these findings , as well as other information uncovered in the probe , led to the strong suspicion that these 13 identifiable people were involved in the abduction of masri , " the office said . masri 's lawyer manfred gnijdic said that although the suspects ' extradition was unlikely , the warrants were a victory for his client . " german authorities have not accepted the criminal behavior of cia employees against a german citizen , " he said . tv report : us cooperation unlikely german public broadcaster ndr had reported earlier that most of the cia employees sought lived in the us state of north carolina .
ndr said spanish authorities had learned the identities of all 13 agents on board and had copies of some of their passports . although all of the names were believed to be aliases , ndr said it was possible , using other data , to learn their real identities .
the report said three of the suspects worked for aero contractors , believed to be the cia 's secret airline . ndr noted that the german arrest warrants were not valid in the united states and that us authorities had refused to cooperate with the investigation .
if the suspects were to travel to the european union , however , they could be arrested . us lawsuit , german investigation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german parliamentary committee has been charged with investigating the case el-masri has also filed a lawsuit in the us , but the complaint was thrown out by a us district court judge last year because of a perceived risk to national security .
the american civil liberties union -lrb- aclu -rrb- is appealing that decision . a german parliamentary committee is also reviewing the case .
members of germany 's former government of social democrats and greens , which was in power at the time , have testified that they knew nothing about the abduction . el-masri is one of the most high-profile cases of a suspected " extraordinary rendition " undertaken as part of us anti-terror efforts .
italy is conducting a similar investigation into the kidnapping of an egyptian cleric in milan . a european parliamentary committee approved a report last week saying that 13 eu countries were involved in renditions to secret detention camps . the arrest warrants come amid a controversy over the german government 's alleged refusal to help a german-born turk , murat kurnaz , who was held at the us lock-up for terror suspects in guantanamo bay , cuba , for four and a half years before being released in august without charge . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ministers deny helping us kidnap terror suspect in front of a parliamentary inquiry , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and his predecessor joschka fischer have denied knowing about the us abduction of a german citizen who says he was tortured by the cia .

since children are banned entry - the expo is for trade buyers only - anyone under 16 is refused admittance unless they have been hired as a toy demonstrator . the adults-only rule has sparked a whole range of new play products which industry observers say is all part of a trend toward stepping up marketing to " aging children " : people over 40 who play games to relax . and bollywood - india 's most popular cultural export - it seems , is a grown-up 's playground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aishwarya rai is one of bollywood 's hottest actresses the country 's trademark hip-gyrating song-and-dance films with its formulaic mix of indian family values , kitsch and sexual titillation have apparently proved an inspiration for several toymakers .

" bollywood is a big topic here , especially among our adult customers , " said bettina brogsitter , sales representative for the puzzle-maker lupu . some are going in for a more chaste version of india 's ubiquitous images . one german manufacturer of puzzles aims to entice european women who love all things indian by launching a 1,000-piece puzzle , which would take days to solve , depicting ganesha , the hindu god of wisdom with four arms and the head of a one-tusked elephant . other jigsaws on show in nuremberg are more serene , depicting yoga positions and mandalas - designs symbolizing the universe .

" prominent among these were afghan proposals for accelerated afghanization of the national army and police , as well as in the area of economic development , " a statement released by the organizers said . the promise to increase afghan " ownership " appears to be a concession to pleas from the country to be allowed to play a greater role in spending billions of dollars of aid money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanta and steinmeier at the berlin conference afghan foreign minister rangeen dadfar spanta told the conference on tuesday that his government " continues to be bypassed by donor countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 31.01.2007 the rise and fall of germany 's coal mining industry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to close its remaining eight black coal mines by 2018 coal might be germany 's most abundant indigenous energy source , but the death knell finally sounded for the country 's unprofitable coal industry when the government decided to end mining subsidies by 2018 . it once powered the german economy , but now , the coal industry looks set to be consigned to history .
if the last pits are closed by 2018 as planned , it will mark an end to a centuries ' long chapter in german history .
the decision early tuesday by government coalition leaders in berlin to end state subsidies for coal production draws a line under an issue that has long been brewing in german politics .
coal mining did n't just power germany 's industrial revolution in the 19th century , it also helped spawn the country 's oldest party , the center-left social democratic party which has long rejected a complete shutting down of the industry . coal mining also played a leading role in helping to forge germany 's post-second world war economic miracle .
but in fact , the shine came off coal a long time ago .
even though germany ranks seventh worldwide in coal production ; first in the eu and fourth worldwide in coal consumption , germany 's mining sector has been heavily dependent on subsidies ever since the coal crisis of 1958 and clearly could not be supported indefinitely .
the decline the first coal was mined in germany almost 900 years ago , but coal mining only came into its own in the 19th century when industrialization transformed the mining regions of the ruhr valley and the saarland into germany 's industrial heartland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of jobs have been lost by 1900 , germany was a chief producer of coal , after the united states and britain .
but the 1950s saw the industry plunge into crisis , with coal largely replaced in domestic as well as industrial and transportation usage by oil , natural gas or electricity produced from renewable energy sources .
coal 's use went into steady decline as oil-burning and nuclear-powered generating plants became more common .
one by one , the country 's pits were closed down .
from 1960 to 1980 , the number of mines fell from 146 to 39 .
by 2000 , only 12 were still operating , with output down to 20.7 million tons in 2006 from 150 million tons in 1957 - a development which undid the very fabric of post-war germany with its mass lay-offs .
while some 610,000 were employed in the mines in 1977 , the figure was well under 50,000 in recent years .
coal as a political issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dying industry not surprisingly , coal played a key role in shaping germany 's 20th century history , with the emergence of coal miners ' labor unions which maintained close ties to the political left .
its influence on social history aside , the rich coal seams around the ruhr and the saar provided the fuel on which germany 's industrial expansion was based - an expansion that contributed to both world wars .
it was only with the establishment of the european coal and steel community that the tense relationship between germany and france over natural resources finally found a peaceful resolution .
in 1951 , the european coal and steel community -lrb- ecsc -rrb- was founded by france , germany , italy , belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands to pool their steel and coal resources .
this first step towards cross-border co-operation is still seen as a direct catalyst for the eec and the single european market - an agreement which formed the backbone of today 's eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miners were the backbone of german industrialization post reunification , annual production and consumption dropped considerably over the first half of the 1990s , largely due to restructuring that occurred following the integration of former east germany into a unified germany .
the energy question and it now seems that the final straw has come .
while the subsidy issue has been a subject of recurrent debate in past decades , coal mining has also became inextricably linked with environmental and energy issues - such as health , air pollution , and contribution to global warming .
the latest drive to reach a compromise on the industry 's future came against the backdrop of a growing dilemma about germany 's energy needs .
besides the increasing worries about climate change , germany 's growing energy worries have also been fueled by last year 's surge in oil prices along with increasing concerns about the security of supplies in the wake of last year 's so-called gas war - especially after russia 's gazprom 's fight with eastern europe over energy contracts .
now that the coal issue appears to be resolved , the next question for germany 's political and business leaders is what will replace the estimated 20 per cent gap in the nation 's energy mix that will emerge once the nation has dismantled its nuclear energy apparatus around the end of the next decade . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough deal may eliminate german coal subsidies after months of negotiations , politicians and leaders from the coal industry reached a breakthrough sunday night .
government subsidies - not jobs - are to be cut back drastically and may be history as early as 2018 .
-lrb- 29.01.2007 -rrb- germany 's coal industry faces closures and job losses germany 's coal mining industry - already facing the end of government subsidies - was hit by a further blow this weekend when it was revealed that financial discrepencies could lead to mine closures and job losses .
-lrb- 22.01.2007 -rrb- germany debates the future of coal mining some say the german mining industry is squandering too much money and that production should cease as soon as possible , whereas others argue that coal is the energy source of the future .

" based on this guidance , we have made changes to ensure that we 're in compliance with our competition law obligations , " smith said in a statement . according to microsoft , the changes affect vista 's security , search and fixed documents formats functions .
european customers will also be able to buy a vista version that does not include the microsoft media player to comply with a 2004 eu antitrust ruling . ignoring the eu ? prior to altering the system , microsoft had risked a new showdown with eu regulators nearly three years after a landmark antitrust ruling against the us software giant , officials said .

if the last pits are closed by 2018 as planned , it will mark an end to a centuries ' long chapter in german history .
the decision early tuesday by government coalition leaders in berlin to end state subsidies for coal production draws a line under an issue that has long been brewing in german politics .
coal mining did n't just power germany 's industrial revolution in the 19th century , it also helped spawn the country 's oldest party , the center-left social democratic party which has long rejected a complete shutting down of the industry . coal mining also played a leading role in helping to forge germany 's post-second world war economic miracle .
but in fact , the shine came off coal a long time ago .
even though germany ranks seventh worldwide in coal production ; first in the eu and fourth worldwide in coal consumption , germany 's mining sector has been heavily dependent on subsidies ever since the coal crisis of 1958 and clearly could not be supported indefinitely .
the decline the first coal was mined in germany almost 900 years ago , but coal mining only came into its own in the 19th century when industrialization transformed the mining regions of the ruhr valley and the saarland into germany 's industrial heartland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of jobs have been lost by 1900 , germany was a chief producer of coal , after the united states and britain .
but the 1950s saw the industry plunge into crisis , with coal largely replaced in domestic as well as industrial and transportation usage by oil , natural gas or electricity produced from renewable energy sources .
coal 's use went into steady decline as oil-burning and nuclear-powered generating plants became more common .
one by one , the country 's pits were closed down .
from 1960 to 1980 , the number of mines fell from 146 to 39 .
by 2000 , only 12 were still operating , with output down to 20.7 million tons in 2006 from 150 million tons in 1957 - a development which undid the very fabric of post-war germany with its mass lay-offs .
while some 610,000 were employed in the mines in 1977 , the figure was well under 50,000 in recent years .
coal as a political issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dying industry not surprisingly , coal played a key role in shaping germany 's 20th century history , with the emergence of coal miners ' labor unions which maintained close ties to the political left .

it was only with the establishment of the european coal and steel community that the tense relationship between germany and france over natural resources finally found a peaceful resolution .
in 1951 , the european coal and steel community -lrb- ecsc -rrb- was founded by france , germany , italy , belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands to pool their steel and coal resources .

the energy question and it now seems that the final straw has come .
while the subsidy issue has been a subject of recurrent debate in past decades , coal mining has also became inextricably linked with environmental and energy issues - such as health , air pollution , and contribution to global warming .
the latest drive to reach a compromise on the industry 's future came against the backdrop of a growing dilemma about germany 's energy needs .
besides the increasing worries about climate change , germany 's growing energy worries have also been fueled by last year 's surge in oil prices along with increasing concerns about the security of supplies in the wake of last year 's so-called gas war - especially after russia 's gazprom 's fight with eastern europe over energy contracts .
now that the coal issue appears to be resolved , the next question for germany 's political and business leaders is what will replace the estimated 20 per cent gap in the nation 's energy mix that will emerge once the nation has dismantled its nuclear energy apparatus around the end of the next decade . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough deal may eliminate german coal subsidies after months of negotiations , politicians and leaders from the coal industry reached a breakthrough sunday night .

" he has cancelled his trip , we do not have further information , " said a spokeswoman from hanser , the company that publishes pamuk 's books in germany . the cologne daily said pamuk that was concerned for his safety after the assassination of hrant dink , an ethnic armenian journalist , in turkey on jan .
19 .
experts , however , said the 54-year-old author would not be in greater danger in germany than in turkey , but would be putting himself at risk by leaving his home . freedom of speech and armenian issues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hrant dink spoke of " genocide of armenians " during world war i pamuk 's most well known works address clashes between the past and present , east and west and secularism and islamism . dink was among intellectuals , including pamuk , who have been charged under a controversial law that makes it a crime to insult turkey 's identity , state institutions or security forces . pamuk was also tried for insulting " turkishness " for telling a swiss paper for his views on the massacre of armenians by ottoman turks in 1915 .

if the last pits are closed by 2018 as planned , it will mark an end to a centuries ' long chapter in german history .
the decision early tuesday by government coalition leaders in berlin to end state subsidies for coal production draws a line under an issue that has long been brewing in german politics .
coal mining did n't just power germany 's industrial revolution in the 19th century , it also helped spawn the country 's oldest party , the center-left social democratic party which has long rejected a complete shutting down of the industry . coal mining also played a leading role in helping to forge germany 's post-second world war economic miracle .
but in fact , the shine came off coal a long time ago .
even though germany ranks seventh worldwide in coal production ; first in the eu and fourth worldwide in coal consumption , germany 's mining sector has been heavily dependent on subsidies ever since the coal crisis of 1958 and clearly could not be supported indefinitely .
the decline the first coal was mined in germany almost 900 years ago , but coal mining only came into its own in the 19th century when industrialization transformed the mining regions of the ruhr valley and the saarland into germany 's industrial heartland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of jobs have been lost by 1900 , germany was a chief producer of coal , after the united states and britain .
but the 1950s saw the industry plunge into crisis , with coal largely replaced in domestic as well as industrial and transportation usage by oil , natural gas or electricity produced from renewable energy sources .
coal 's use went into steady decline as oil-burning and nuclear-powered generating plants became more common .
one by one , the country 's pits were closed down .
from 1960 to 1980 , the number of mines fell from 146 to 39 .
by 2000 , only 12 were still operating , with output down to 20.7 million tons in 2006 from 150 million tons in 1957 - a development which undid the very fabric of post-war germany with its mass lay-offs .
while some 610,000 were employed in the mines in 1977 , the figure was well under 50,000 in recent years .
coal as a political issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dying industry not surprisingly , coal played a key role in shaping germany 's 20th century history , with the emergence of coal miners ' labor unions which maintained close ties to the political left .
its influence on social history aside , the rich coal seams around the ruhr and the saar provided the fuel on which germany 's industrial expansion was based - an expansion that contributed to both world wars .
it was only with the establishment of the european coal and steel community that the tense relationship between germany and france over natural resources finally found a peaceful resolution .
in 1951 , the european coal and steel community -lrb- ecsc -rrb- was founded by france , germany , italy , belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands to pool their steel and coal resources .
this first step towards cross-border co-operation is still seen as a direct catalyst for the eec and the single european market - an agreement which formed the backbone of today 's eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miners were the backbone of german industrialization post reunification , annual production and consumption dropped considerably over the first half of the 1990s , largely due to restructuring that occurred following the integration of former east germany into a unified germany .
the energy question and it now seems that the final straw has come .
while the subsidy issue has been a subject of recurrent debate in past decades , coal mining has also became inextricably linked with environmental and energy issues - such as health , air pollution , and contribution to global warming .
the latest drive to reach a compromise on the industry 's future came against the backdrop of a growing dilemma about germany 's energy needs .
besides the increasing worries about climate change , germany 's growing energy worries have also been fueled by last year 's surge in oil prices along with increasing concerns about the security of supplies in the wake of last year 's so-called gas war - especially after russia 's gazprom 's fight with eastern europe over energy contracts .
now that the coal issue appears to be resolved , the next question for germany 's political and business leaders is what will replace the estimated 20 per cent gap in the nation 's energy mix that will emerge once the nation has dismantled its nuclear energy apparatus around the end of the next decade . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough deal may eliminate german coal subsidies after months of negotiations , politicians and leaders from the coal industry reached a breakthrough sunday night .
government subsidies - not jobs - are to be cut back drastically and may be history as early as 2018 .
-lrb- 29.01.2007 -rrb- germany 's coal industry faces closures and job losses germany 's coal mining industry - already facing the end of government subsidies - was hit by a further blow this weekend when it was revealed that financial discrepencies could lead to mine closures and job losses .
-lrb- 22.01.2007 -rrb- germany debates the future of coal mining some say the german mining industry is squandering too much money and that production should cease as soon as possible , whereas others argue that coal is the energy source of the future .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 31.01.2007 the rise and fall of germany 's coal mining industry großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to close its remaining eight black coal mines by 2018 coal might be germany 's most abundant indigenous energy source , but the death knell finally sounded for the country 's unprofitable coal industry when the government decided to end mining subsidies by 2018 . it once powered the german economy , but now , the coal industry looks set to be consigned to history .
if the last pits are closed by 2018 as planned , it will mark an end to a centuries ' long chapter in german history .
the decision early tuesday by government coalition leaders in berlin to end state subsidies for coal production draws a line under an issue that has long been brewing in german politics .
coal mining did n't just power germany 's industrial revolution in the 19th century , it also helped spawn the country 's oldest party , the center-left social democratic party which has long rejected a complete shutting down of the industry . coal mining also played a leading role in helping to forge germany 's post-second world war economic miracle .
but in fact , the shine came off coal a long time ago .
even though germany ranks seventh worldwide in coal production ; first in the eu and fourth worldwide in coal consumption , germany 's mining sector has been heavily dependent on subsidies ever since the coal crisis of 1958 and clearly could not be supported indefinitely .
the decline the first coal was mined in germany almost 900 years ago , but coal mining only came into its own in the 19th century when industrialization transformed the mining regions of the ruhr valley and the saarland into germany 's industrial heartland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of jobs have been lost by 1900 , germany was a chief producer of coal , after the united states and britain .
but the 1950s saw the industry plunge into crisis , with coal largely replaced in domestic as well as industrial and transportation usage by oil , natural gas or electricity produced from renewable energy sources .
coal 's use went into steady decline as oil-burning and nuclear-powered generating plants became more common .
one by one , the country 's pits were closed down .
from 1960 to 1980 , the number of mines fell from 146 to 39 .
by 2000 , only 12 were still operating , with output down to 20.7 million tons in 2006 from 150 million tons in 1957 - a development which undid the very fabric of post-war germany with its mass lay-offs .
while some 610,000 were employed in the mines in 1977 , the figure was well under 50,000 in recent years .
coal as a political issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dying industry not surprisingly , coal played a key role in shaping germany 's 20th century history , with the emergence of coal miners ' labor unions which maintained close ties to the political left .
its influence on social history aside , the rich coal seams around the ruhr and the saar provided the fuel on which germany 's industrial expansion was based - an expansion that contributed to both world wars .
it was only with the establishment of the european coal and steel community that the tense relationship between germany and france over natural resources finally found a peaceful resolution .
in 1951 , the european coal and steel community -lrb- ecsc -rrb- was founded by france , germany , italy , belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands to pool their steel and coal resources .
this first step towards cross-border co-operation is still seen as a direct catalyst for the eec and the single european market - an agreement which formed the backbone of today 's eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miners were the backbone of german industrialization post reunification , annual production and consumption dropped considerably over the first half of the 1990s , largely due to restructuring that occurred following the integration of former east germany into a unified germany .
the energy question and it now seems that the final straw has come .
while the subsidy issue has been a subject of recurrent debate in past decades , coal mining has also became inextricably linked with environmental and energy issues - such as health , air pollution , and contribution to global warming .
the latest drive to reach a compromise on the industry 's future came against the backdrop of a growing dilemma about germany 's energy needs .
besides the increasing worries about climate change , germany 's growing energy worries have also been fueled by last year 's surge in oil prices along with increasing concerns about the security of supplies in the wake of last year 's so-called gas war - especially after russia 's gazprom 's fight with eastern europe over energy contracts .
now that the coal issue appears to be resolved , the next question for germany 's political and business leaders is what will replace the estimated 20 per cent gap in the nation 's energy mix that will emerge once the nation has dismantled its nuclear energy apparatus around the end of the next decade . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough deal may eliminate german coal subsidies after months of negotiations , politicians and leaders from the coal industry reached a breakthrough sunday night .
government subsidies - not jobs - are to be cut back drastically and may be history as early as 2018 .
-lrb- 29.01.2007 -rrb- germany 's coal industry faces closures and job losses germany 's coal mining industry - already facing the end of government subsidies - was hit by a further blow this weekend when it was revealed that financial discrepencies could lead to mine closures and job losses .

" based on this guidance , we have made changes to ensure that we 're in compliance with our competition law obligations , " smith said in a statement . according to microsoft , the changes affect vista 's security , search and fixed documents formats functions .
european customers will also be able to buy a vista version that does not include the microsoft media player to comply with a 2004 eu antitrust ruling . ignoring the eu ? prior to altering the system , microsoft had risked a new showdown with eu regulators nearly three years after a landmark antitrust ruling against the us software giant , officials said .

since children are banned entry - the expo is for trade buyers only - anyone under 16 is refused admittance unless they have been hired as a toy demonstrator . the adults-only rule has sparked a whole range of new play products which industry observers say is all part of a trend toward stepping up marketing to " aging children " : people over 40 who play games to relax . and bollywood - india 's most popular cultural export - it seems , is a grown-up 's playground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aishwarya rai is one of bollywood 's hottest actresses the country 's trademark hip-gyrating song-and-dance films with its formulaic mix of indian family values , kitsch and sexual titillation have apparently proved an inspiration for several toymakers .

the club confirmed that former coach ottmar hitzfeld will take over . " we regret this decision , " said bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
" but in our role as managers of the club we have to see real development and take action . " rummenigge said the club 's board was concerned that bayern were currently out of the qualification spots for next season 's champions league .
off to a bad start the split came 24 hours after bayern were held to an embarrassing goalless draw by newly promoted vfl bochum , which left them five points adrift of bundesliga leaders werder bremen .
they could find themselves lagging eight points off the lead if werder beat bayer leverkusen on wednesday . tuesday 's result left magath 's position decidedly shaky given that in three weeks time bayern face real madrid in the champions league last 16 at the bernabeu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two league and cup doubles in consecutive seasons could n't save magath 's job bayern 's year failed to get off to the best of starts when their opening game since the winter break resulted in a 3-2 loss to borussia dortmund . hitzfeld , 58 , led bayern to four german championships and a champions league title in his first spell as manager between 1999 and 2004 , when magath moved to bavaria from vfb stuttgart .
besides his achievements with bayern , hitzfeld also guided borussia dortmund to two german titles and a champions league crown .
rumor mill pinpoints houllier magath , 53 , said he was proud of leading bayern to two league and cup doubles . " obviously this is n't the best news because i 'm proud of the two great years touched with success that i 've had here , " he said .
" but it 's always been clear that my contract could come to an end one day . " it is rumored that current lyon manager and former liverpool boss gerard houllier is being lined up to take the reins at bayern in time for the start of next season . magath was the second bundesliga coach to part company with his club on wednesday after former germany international jupp heynckes quit as coach of relegation-threatened borussia monchengladbach . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen , schalke watch bayern 's grip on title slip bayern munich saw their title hopes dwindle after drawing 0-0 with lowly bochum tuesday .

if the last pits are closed by 2018 as planned , it will mark an end to a centuries ' long chapter in german history .
the decision early tuesday by government coalition leaders in berlin to end state subsidies for coal production draws a line under an issue that has long been brewing in german politics .
coal mining did n't just power germany 's industrial revolution in the 19th century , it also helped spawn the country 's oldest party , the center-left social democratic party which has long rejected a complete shutting down of the industry . coal mining also played a leading role in helping to forge germany 's post-second world war economic miracle .
but in fact , the shine came off coal a long time ago .
even though germany ranks seventh worldwide in coal production ; first in the eu and fourth worldwide in coal consumption , germany 's mining sector has been heavily dependent on subsidies ever since the coal crisis of 1958 and clearly could not be supported indefinitely .
the decline the first coal was mined in germany almost 900 years ago , but coal mining only came into its own in the 19th century when industrialization transformed the mining regions of the ruhr valley and the saarland into germany 's industrial heartland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of jobs have been lost by 1900 , germany was a chief producer of coal , after the united states and britain .
but the 1950s saw the industry plunge into crisis , with coal largely replaced in domestic as well as industrial and transportation usage by oil , natural gas or electricity produced from renewable energy sources .
coal 's use went into steady decline as oil-burning and nuclear-powered generating plants became more common .
one by one , the country 's pits were closed down .
from 1960 to 1980 , the number of mines fell from 146 to 39 .
by 2000 , only 12 were still operating , with output down to 20.7 million tons in 2006 from 150 million tons in 1957 - a development which undid the very fabric of post-war germany with its mass lay-offs .
while some 610,000 were employed in the mines in 1977 , the figure was well under 50,000 in recent years .
coal as a political issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dying industry not surprisingly , coal played a key role in shaping germany 's 20th century history , with the emergence of coal miners ' labor unions which maintained close ties to the political left .
its influence on social history aside , the rich coal seams around the ruhr and the saar provided the fuel on which germany 's industrial expansion was based - an expansion that contributed to both world wars .
it was only with the establishment of the european coal and steel community that the tense relationship between germany and france over natural resources finally found a peaceful resolution .
in 1951 , the european coal and steel community -lrb- ecsc -rrb- was founded by france , germany , italy , belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands to pool their steel and coal resources .
this first step towards cross-border co-operation is still seen as a direct catalyst for the eec and the single european market - an agreement which formed the backbone of today 's eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miners were the backbone of german industrialization post reunification , annual production and consumption dropped considerably over the first half of the 1990s , largely due to restructuring that occurred following the integration of former east germany into a unified germany .
the energy question and it now seems that the final straw has come .
while the subsidy issue has been a subject of recurrent debate in past decades , coal mining has also became inextricably linked with environmental and energy issues - such as health , air pollution , and contribution to global warming .
the latest drive to reach a compromise on the industry 's future came against the backdrop of a growing dilemma about germany 's energy needs .
besides the increasing worries about climate change , germany 's growing energy worries have also been fueled by last year 's surge in oil prices along with increasing concerns about the security of supplies in the wake of last year 's so-called gas war - especially after russia 's gazprom 's fight with eastern europe over energy contracts .
now that the coal issue appears to be resolved , the next question for germany 's political and business leaders is what will replace the estimated 20 per cent gap in the nation 's energy mix that will emerge once the nation has dismantled its nuclear energy apparatus around the end of the next decade . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough deal may eliminate german coal subsidies after months of negotiations , politicians and leaders from the coal industry reached a breakthrough sunday night .
government subsidies - not jobs - are to be cut back drastically and may be history as early as 2018 .
-lrb- 29.01.2007 -rrb- germany 's coal industry faces closures and job losses germany 's coal mining industry - already facing the end of government subsidies - was hit by a further blow this weekend when it was revealed that financial discrepencies could lead to mine closures and job losses .

if the last pits are closed by 2018 as planned , it will mark an end to a centuries ' long chapter in german history .
the decision early tuesday by government coalition leaders in berlin to end state subsidies for coal production draws a line under an issue that has long been brewing in german politics .
coal mining did n't just power germany 's industrial revolution in the 19th century , it also helped spawn the country 's oldest party , the center-left social democratic party which has long rejected a complete shutting down of the industry . coal mining also played a leading role in helping to forge germany 's post-second world war economic miracle .
but in fact , the shine came off coal a long time ago .
even though germany ranks seventh worldwide in coal production ; first in the eu and fourth worldwide in coal consumption , germany 's mining sector has been heavily dependent on subsidies ever since the coal crisis of 1958 and clearly could not be supported indefinitely .
the decline the first coal was mined in germany almost 900 years ago , but coal mining only came into its own in the 19th century when industrialization transformed the mining regions of the ruhr valley and the saarland into germany 's industrial heartland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of jobs have been lost by 1900 , germany was a chief producer of coal , after the united states and britain .
but the 1950s saw the industry plunge into crisis , with coal largely replaced in domestic as well as industrial and transportation usage by oil , natural gas or electricity produced from renewable energy sources .
coal 's use went into steady decline as oil-burning and nuclear-powered generating plants became more common .
one by one , the country 's pits were closed down .
from 1960 to 1980 , the number of mines fell from 146 to 39 .
by 2000 , only 12 were still operating , with output down to 20.7 million tons in 2006 from 150 million tons in 1957 - a development which undid the very fabric of post-war germany with its mass lay-offs .
while some 610,000 were employed in the mines in 1977 , the figure was well under 50,000 in recent years .
coal as a political issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dying industry not surprisingly , coal played a key role in shaping germany 's 20th century history , with the emergence of coal miners ' labor unions which maintained close ties to the political left .
its influence on social history aside , the rich coal seams around the ruhr and the saar provided the fuel on which germany 's industrial expansion was based - an expansion that contributed to both world wars .
it was only with the establishment of the european coal and steel community that the tense relationship between germany and france over natural resources finally found a peaceful resolution .
in 1951 , the european coal and steel community -lrb- ecsc -rrb- was founded by france , germany , italy , belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands to pool their steel and coal resources .
this first step towards cross-border co-operation is still seen as a direct catalyst for the eec and the single european market - an agreement which formed the backbone of today 's eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miners were the backbone of german industrialization post reunification , annual production and consumption dropped considerably over the first half of the 1990s , largely due to restructuring that occurred following the integration of former east germany into a unified germany .
the energy question and it now seems that the final straw has come .
while the subsidy issue has been a subject of recurrent debate in past decades , coal mining has also became inextricably linked with environmental and energy issues - such as health , air pollution , and contribution to global warming .
the latest drive to reach a compromise on the industry 's future came against the backdrop of a growing dilemma about germany 's energy needs .
besides the increasing worries about climate change , germany 's growing energy worries have also been fueled by last year 's surge in oil prices along with increasing concerns about the security of supplies in the wake of last year 's so-called gas war - especially after russia 's gazprom 's fight with eastern europe over energy contracts .
now that the coal issue appears to be resolved , the next question for germany 's political and business leaders is what will replace the estimated 20 per cent gap in the nation 's energy mix that will emerge once the nation has dismantled its nuclear energy apparatus around the end of the next decade . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough deal may eliminate german coal subsidies after months of negotiations , politicians and leaders from the coal industry reached a breakthrough sunday night .

if the last pits are closed by 2018 as planned , it will mark an end to a centuries ' long chapter in german history .
the decision early tuesday by government coalition leaders in berlin to end state subsidies for coal production draws a line under an issue that has long been brewing in german politics .
coal mining did n't just power germany 's industrial revolution in the 19th century , it also helped spawn the country 's oldest party , the center-left social democratic party which has long rejected a complete shutting down of the industry . coal mining also played a leading role in helping to forge germany 's post-second world war economic miracle .
but in fact , the shine came off coal a long time ago .
even though germany ranks seventh worldwide in coal production ; first in the eu and fourth worldwide in coal consumption , germany 's mining sector has been heavily dependent on subsidies ever since the coal crisis of 1958 and clearly could not be supported indefinitely .
the decline the first coal was mined in germany almost 900 years ago , but coal mining only came into its own in the 19th century when industrialization transformed the mining regions of the ruhr valley and the saarland into germany 's industrial heartland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of jobs have been lost by 1900 , germany was a chief producer of coal , after the united states and britain .
but the 1950s saw the industry plunge into crisis , with coal largely replaced in domestic as well as industrial and transportation usage by oil , natural gas or electricity produced from renewable energy sources .
coal 's use went into steady decline as oil-burning and nuclear-powered generating plants became more common .
one by one , the country 's pits were closed down .
from 1960 to 1980 , the number of mines fell from 146 to 39 .
by 2000 , only 12 were still operating , with output down to 20.7 million tons in 2006 from 150 million tons in 1957 - a development which undid the very fabric of post-war germany with its mass lay-offs .
while some 610,000 were employed in the mines in 1977 , the figure was well under 50,000 in recent years .
coal as a political issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dying industry not surprisingly , coal played a key role in shaping germany 's 20th century history , with the emergence of coal miners ' labor unions which maintained close ties to the political left .
its influence on social history aside , the rich coal seams around the ruhr and the saar provided the fuel on which germany 's industrial expansion was based - an expansion that contributed to both world wars .
it was only with the establishment of the european coal and steel community that the tense relationship between germany and france over natural resources finally found a peaceful resolution .
in 1951 , the european coal and steel community -lrb- ecsc -rrb- was founded by france , germany , italy , belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands to pool their steel and coal resources .

the energy question and it now seems that the final straw has come .
while the subsidy issue has been a subject of recurrent debate in past decades , coal mining has also became inextricably linked with environmental and energy issues - such as health , air pollution , and contribution to global warming .
the latest drive to reach a compromise on the industry 's future came against the backdrop of a growing dilemma about germany 's energy needs .
besides the increasing worries about climate change , germany 's growing energy worries have also been fueled by last year 's surge in oil prices along with increasing concerns about the security of supplies in the wake of last year 's so-called gas war - especially after russia 's gazprom 's fight with eastern europe over energy contracts .
now that the coal issue appears to be resolved , the next question for germany 's political and business leaders is what will replace the estimated 20 per cent gap in the nation 's energy mix that will emerge once the nation has dismantled its nuclear energy apparatus around the end of the next decade . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough deal may eliminate german coal subsidies after months of negotiations , politicians and leaders from the coal industry reached a breakthrough sunday night .

if the last pits are closed by 2018 as planned , it will mark an end to a centuries ' long chapter in german history .
the decision early tuesday by government coalition leaders in berlin to end state subsidies for coal production draws a line under an issue that has long been brewing in german politics .
coal mining did n't just power germany 's industrial revolution in the 19th century , it also helped spawn the country 's oldest party , the center-left social democratic party which has long rejected a complete shutting down of the industry . coal mining also played a leading role in helping to forge germany 's post-second world war economic miracle .
but in fact , the shine came off coal a long time ago .
even though germany ranks seventh worldwide in coal production ; first in the eu and fourth worldwide in coal consumption , germany 's mining sector has been heavily dependent on subsidies ever since the coal crisis of 1958 and clearly could not be supported indefinitely .
the decline the first coal was mined in germany almost 900 years ago , but coal mining only came into its own in the 19th century when industrialization transformed the mining regions of the ruhr valley and the saarland into germany 's industrial heartland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of jobs have been lost by 1900 , germany was a chief producer of coal , after the united states and britain .
but the 1950s saw the industry plunge into crisis , with coal largely replaced in domestic as well as industrial and transportation usage by oil , natural gas or electricity produced from renewable energy sources .
coal 's use went into steady decline as oil-burning and nuclear-powered generating plants became more common .
one by one , the country 's pits were closed down .
from 1960 to 1980 , the number of mines fell from 146 to 39 .
by 2000 , only 12 were still operating , with output down to 20.7 million tons in 2006 from 150 million tons in 1957 - a development which undid the very fabric of post-war germany with its mass lay-offs .
while some 610,000 were employed in the mines in 1977 , the figure was well under 50,000 in recent years .
coal as a political issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dying industry not surprisingly , coal played a key role in shaping germany 's 20th century history , with the emergence of coal miners ' labor unions which maintained close ties to the political left .
its influence on social history aside , the rich coal seams around the ruhr and the saar provided the fuel on which germany 's industrial expansion was based - an expansion that contributed to both world wars .
it was only with the establishment of the european coal and steel community that the tense relationship between germany and france over natural resources finally found a peaceful resolution .
in 1951 , the european coal and steel community -lrb- ecsc -rrb- was founded by france , germany , italy , belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands to pool their steel and coal resources .

" further structural reforms are indispensable , " he concluded . the economics minister 's confidence is based on the hope that an increase in domestic demand will be added to germany 's already brilliant export balance . opposition remains wary glos also pointed out that it was n't just the government 's reforms that were responsible for the upswing . " there have been many players who 've made this upswing possible , among them employers and employees with their moderate wage bargaining deals , " he said .

he says he was flown to a prison in afghanistan for interrogation before being released five months later in albania . masri , a 43-year-old unemployed car salesman and father of six , has said he was drugged and tortured while imprisoned . the case raised tensions when us secretary of state condoleezza rice visited germany in december 2005 at the height of a controversy over the cia 's strategy of " rendition " - flying terror suspects through european states to detention in third countries where they risk being tortured . after the meeting with rice , german chancellor angela merkel said masri 's case " was accepted as a mistake by the us government , " although us officials later suggested her remark was the result of a misunderstanding . reports have indicated that us agents confused masri with a terror suspect with a similar name who was linked to the attacks of september 11 , 2001 . help from spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plane in question lifting off from mallorca 's airport the munich prosecutor 's office said it had received in december 2005 from masri 's lawyer a list of names of people on board the plane that took masri to afghanistan .
the list originated from a spanish journalist citing the country 's civil guard . the agents are believed to have taken off from the airport in palma de mallorca , picked up masri in macedonia and taken him to afghanistan .
in 2006 , spanish and italian authorities provided further information about the flights , the prosecutor 's office said . " according to the information we have , the suspects listed in the arrest warrants are believed to be so-called code names of cia agents , " the prosecutor 's office said in a statement .

the club confirmed that former coach ottmar hitzfeld will take over . " we regret this decision , " said bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
" but in our role as managers of the club we have to see real development and take action . " rummenigge said the club 's board was concerned that bayern were currently out of the qualification spots for next season 's champions league .

" but it 's always been clear that my contract could come to an end one day . " it is rumored that current lyon manager and former liverpool boss gerard houllier is being lined up to take the reins at bayern in time for the start of next season . magath was the second bundesliga coach to part company with his club on wednesday after former germany international jupp heynckes quit as coach of relegation-threatened borussia monchengladbach . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen , schalke watch bayern 's grip on title slip bayern munich saw their title hopes dwindle after drawing 0-0 with lowly bochum tuesday .

since children are banned entry - the expo is for trade buyers only - anyone under 16 is refused admittance unless they have been hired as a toy demonstrator . the adults-only rule has sparked a whole range of new play products which industry observers say is all part of a trend toward stepping up marketing to " aging children " : people over 40 who play games to relax . and bollywood - india 's most popular cultural export - it seems , is a grown-up 's playground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aishwarya rai is one of bollywood 's hottest actresses the country 's trademark hip-gyrating song-and-dance films with its formulaic mix of indian family values , kitsch and sexual titillation have apparently proved an inspiration for several toymakers .

parents have been warned to keep their kids from sneaking a peek . " bollywood is a big topic here , especially among our adult customers , " said bettina brogsitter , sales representative for the puzzle-maker lupu . some are going in for a more chaste version of india 's ubiquitous images . one german manufacturer of puzzles aims to entice european women who love all things indian by launching a 1,000-piece puzzle , which would take days to solve , depicting ganesha , the hindu god of wisdom with four arms and the head of a one-tusked elephant . other jigsaws on show in nuremberg are more serene , depicting yoga positions and mandalas - designs symbolizing the universe .

if the last pits are closed by 2018 as planned , it will mark an end to a centuries ' long chapter in german history .
the decision early tuesday by government coalition leaders in berlin to end state subsidies for coal production draws a line under an issue that has long been brewing in german politics .
coal mining did n't just power germany 's industrial revolution in the 19th century , it also helped spawn the country 's oldest party , the center-left social democratic party which has long rejected a complete shutting down of the industry . coal mining also played a leading role in helping to forge germany 's post-second world war economic miracle .
but in fact , the shine came off coal a long time ago .
even though germany ranks seventh worldwide in coal production ; first in the eu and fourth worldwide in coal consumption , germany 's mining sector has been heavily dependent on subsidies ever since the coal crisis of 1958 and clearly could not be supported indefinitely .
the decline the first coal was mined in germany almost 900 years ago , but coal mining only came into its own in the 19th century when industrialization transformed the mining regions of the ruhr valley and the saarland into germany 's industrial heartland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of jobs have been lost by 1900 , germany was a chief producer of coal , after the united states and britain .
but the 1950s saw the industry plunge into crisis , with coal largely replaced in domestic as well as industrial and transportation usage by oil , natural gas or electricity produced from renewable energy sources .
coal 's use went into steady decline as oil-burning and nuclear-powered generating plants became more common .
one by one , the country 's pits were closed down .
from 1960 to 1980 , the number of mines fell from 146 to 39 .
by 2000 , only 12 were still operating , with output down to 20.7 million tons in 2006 from 150 million tons in 1957 - a development which undid the very fabric of post-war germany with its mass lay-offs .
while some 610,000 were employed in the mines in 1977 , the figure was well under 50,000 in recent years .
coal as a political issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dying industry not surprisingly , coal played a key role in shaping germany 's 20th century history , with the emergence of coal miners ' labor unions which maintained close ties to the political left .
its influence on social history aside , the rich coal seams around the ruhr and the saar provided the fuel on which germany 's industrial expansion was based - an expansion that contributed to both world wars .
it was only with the establishment of the european coal and steel community that the tense relationship between germany and france over natural resources finally found a peaceful resolution .
in 1951 , the european coal and steel community -lrb- ecsc -rrb- was founded by france , germany , italy , belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands to pool their steel and coal resources .
this first step towards cross-border co-operation is still seen as a direct catalyst for the eec and the single european market - an agreement which formed the backbone of today 's eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miners were the backbone of german industrialization post reunification , annual production and consumption dropped considerably over the first half of the 1990s , largely due to restructuring that occurred following the integration of former east germany into a unified germany .
the energy question and it now seems that the final straw has come .
while the subsidy issue has been a subject of recurrent debate in past decades , coal mining has also became inextricably linked with environmental and energy issues - such as health , air pollution , and contribution to global warming .
the latest drive to reach a compromise on the industry 's future came against the backdrop of a growing dilemma about germany 's energy needs .
besides the increasing worries about climate change , germany 's growing energy worries have also been fueled by last year 's surge in oil prices along with increasing concerns about the security of supplies in the wake of last year 's so-called gas war - especially after russia 's gazprom 's fight with eastern europe over energy contracts .
now that the coal issue appears to be resolved , the next question for germany 's political and business leaders is what will replace the estimated 20 per cent gap in the nation 's energy mix that will emerge once the nation has dismantled its nuclear energy apparatus around the end of the next decade . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough deal may eliminate german coal subsidies after months of negotiations , politicians and leaders from the coal industry reached a breakthrough sunday night .

if the last pits are closed by 2018 as planned , it will mark an end to a centuries ' long chapter in german history .
the decision early tuesday by government coalition leaders in berlin to end state subsidies for coal production draws a line under an issue that has long been brewing in german politics .
coal mining did n't just power germany 's industrial revolution in the 19th century , it also helped spawn the country 's oldest party , the center-left social democratic party which has long rejected a complete shutting down of the industry . coal mining also played a leading role in helping to forge germany 's post-second world war economic miracle .
but in fact , the shine came off coal a long time ago .
even though germany ranks seventh worldwide in coal production ; first in the eu and fourth worldwide in coal consumption , germany 's mining sector has been heavily dependent on subsidies ever since the coal crisis of 1958 and clearly could not be supported indefinitely .
the decline the first coal was mined in germany almost 900 years ago , but coal mining only came into its own in the 19th century when industrialization transformed the mining regions of the ruhr valley and the saarland into germany 's industrial heartland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of jobs have been lost by 1900 , germany was a chief producer of coal , after the united states and britain .
but the 1950s saw the industry plunge into crisis , with coal largely replaced in domestic as well as industrial and transportation usage by oil , natural gas or electricity produced from renewable energy sources .
coal 's use went into steady decline as oil-burning and nuclear-powered generating plants became more common .
one by one , the country 's pits were closed down .
from 1960 to 1980 , the number of mines fell from 146 to 39 .
by 2000 , only 12 were still operating , with output down to 20.7 million tons in 2006 from 150 million tons in 1957 - a development which undid the very fabric of post-war germany with its mass lay-offs .
while some 610,000 were employed in the mines in 1977 , the figure was well under 50,000 in recent years .
coal as a political issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dying industry not surprisingly , coal played a key role in shaping germany 's 20th century history , with the emergence of coal miners ' labor unions which maintained close ties to the political left .
its influence on social history aside , the rich coal seams around the ruhr and the saar provided the fuel on which germany 's industrial expansion was based - an expansion that contributed to both world wars .
it was only with the establishment of the european coal and steel community that the tense relationship between germany and france over natural resources finally found a peaceful resolution .
in 1951 , the european coal and steel community -lrb- ecsc -rrb- was founded by france , germany , italy , belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands to pool their steel and coal resources .
this first step towards cross-border co-operation is still seen as a direct catalyst for the eec and the single european market - an agreement which formed the backbone of today 's eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miners were the backbone of german industrialization post reunification , annual production and consumption dropped considerably over the first half of the 1990s , largely due to restructuring that occurred following the integration of former east germany into a unified germany .
the energy question and it now seems that the final straw has come .
while the subsidy issue has been a subject of recurrent debate in past decades , coal mining has also became inextricably linked with environmental and energy issues - such as health , air pollution , and contribution to global warming .
the latest drive to reach a compromise on the industry 's future came against the backdrop of a growing dilemma about germany 's energy needs .
besides the increasing worries about climate change , germany 's growing energy worries have also been fueled by last year 's surge in oil prices along with increasing concerns about the security of supplies in the wake of last year 's so-called gas war - especially after russia 's gazprom 's fight with eastern europe over energy contracts .
now that the coal issue appears to be resolved , the next question for germany 's political and business leaders is what will replace the estimated 20 per cent gap in the nation 's energy mix that will emerge once the nation has dismantled its nuclear energy apparatus around the end of the next decade . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough deal may eliminate german coal subsidies after months of negotiations , politicians and leaders from the coal industry reached a breakthrough sunday night .

" based on this guidance , we have made changes to ensure that we 're in compliance with our competition law obligations , " smith said in a statement . according to microsoft , the changes affect vista 's security , search and fixed documents formats functions .
european customers will also be able to buy a vista version that does not include the microsoft media player to comply with a 2004 eu antitrust ruling . ignoring the eu ? prior to altering the system , microsoft had risked a new showdown with eu regulators nearly three years after a landmark antitrust ruling against the us software giant , officials said .
according to news reports , microsoft competitors had complained that the us giant was ignoring that ruling with its new system . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not everyone sees the company in such a gaudy light " with vista , microsoft has clearly chosen to ignore the fundamental principles of the commission 's march 2004 decision , " simon awde , the chairman of the ecis trade association that opposes microsoft in its antitrust troubles , said , according to afp news service . ecis , which includes such tech giants as oracle , ibm and nokia , filed a complaint with eu regulators in february 2006 targeting vista and office and updated their action with details on vista last month . extending market dominance ? ecis members warn that , as with earlier windows versions , vista is designed in a way that makes it difficult for them to build software that is interoperable with it , hampering competition in effect . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is the internet microsoft 's next big thing ?
" vista is the first step in microsoft 's strategy to extend its market dominance to the internet , " awde said . microsoft has long clashed with the commission over the crushing market power of its existing windows operating system and was fined a record 497 million euros -lrb- $ 642 million -rrb- . in addition to fining microsoft , the eu ordered the company to sell a version of its windows operating system without media player software and to divulge the software protocols underpinning windows for makers of rival products . microsoft appeals microsoft challenged the 2004 ruling in the eu 's second-highest court in april and the judges are expected to hand down a decision in the first half of the year . frustrated with microsoft 's defiance of some of its demands , the commission in july slapped daily fines adding up to 280.5 million euros over the six-month period of the penalty for failing to fully respect the 2004 antitrust ruling . microsoft is appealing against the charges . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw widget : the latest news straight to your desktop receive up-to-date news straight to your desktop with the help of the dw widget - even while you 're working .

" i hope the eu will continue to support our needs , " said del ponte , whose mandate ends in september . the chief un prosecutor said she had " some preoccupations " that the eu was preparing to resume negotiations on a new cooperation pact with serbia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carla del ponte does n't want the eu to reopen discussions with serbia " this is my worry ... it would jeopardize what we absolutely need now , " said del ponte , adding that following recent elections in serbia , this was a " crucial time " to step up pressure for the arrest of mladic and others , who have been indicted for alleged war crimes . the un security council has instructed the tribunal to finish its trials by 2008 and conclude the appeals process within another two years , before closing down . belgrade must be told clearly that any reopening of cooperation talks with the eu was conditional on mladic 's transfer to the tribunal , she said . eu delegation in belgrade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former yugoslav dictator milosevic died last year during his trial at the hague del ponte 's warning comes ahead of a visit to belgrade by a high-level eu delegation , including solana , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and eu enlargement chief olli rehn . all 27 eu foreign ministers are expected to review the bloc 's strained ties with serbia at a meeting in brussels on feb.12. the eu froze negotiations on a first-ever stabilization and association agreement with serbia in may last year , demanding that belgrade show " full cooperation " with the un court . kosovo at stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 12:45 kosovo welcomes the future , " reads this poster in reference to un resolution 1244 , which in 1999 set up in effect a un protectorate in kosvo and pledged to establish " substantial autonomy " for the entity .
but several states - including spain , hungary and slovenia - have said in recent weeks that the eu must not isolate serbia , especially since belgrade 's goodwill and cooperation will be crucial in ensuring a peaceful deal on the final status of kosovo , serbia 's breakaway albanian-majority province . the party of outgoing serbian premier vojislav kostunica has meanwhile demanded that the country should cut diplomatic ties with any nation that recognizes an independent kosovo .
officials for the popular coalition party said that this would be a requirement to join the new government . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de un envoy presents draft plan for kosovo nato watches carefully as the un envoy unveils a plan for kosovo that attempts to keep stable the potentially explosive situation in the serbian-controlled province .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 31.01.2007 germany upbeat about economy despite tax hike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things can only go up for germany , if the government is to be believed the expected global economic slowdown and a sharp rise in sales tax will have only a limited impact on the german economy this year when unemployment is expected to fall to a record low , the government said wednesday . in its annual economic report published wednesday , the german government raised its 2007 growth forecast to 1.7 percent in 2007 , instead of the previously forecast 1.4 percent . in 2006 , the german economy notched up growth of 2.5 percent , its fastest rate of growth since the boom of 2000 . and the annual average jobless rate would fall to 9.6 percent this year from 10.8 percent in 2006 , the government predicted . " with a bit of luck " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos is upbeat about germany 's economic prospects indeed , " with a bit of luck " , the annual average jobless total could fall below the key four-million mark , economy minister michael glos told a news conference in berlin on wednesday . in 2006 , the annual average jobless total stood at 4.487 million .
the last time unemployment in germany was less than four million was in 2001 . " the economic engine is running smoothly , " glos said .
and he expressed confidence that any negative economic effects from the sharp rise in value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- that came into on january 1 would be short-lived . " the vat effect will be overcome within a few months and household consumption will pick up again , " glos said . the government raised vat from 16 percent to 19 percent at the beginning of the year in a move which critics claimed would drag on consumer spending and on economic activity as a whole . glos : reforms made it possible glos said it was " particularly pleasing that , in addition to the impulses coming from foreign trade , the domestic economy is contributing increasingly to growth . " he added : " the economy is standing on two legs and is more robust to the global economic challenges facing us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economic engine is humming nicely the government 's recent labor market and social welfare reforms had helped enhance germany 's economic performance , glos said . " the deep and far-reaching reforms have given investors and consumers confidence for the future and set free economic forces , " he asserted . nevertheless , the government must not rest on its laurels and think the current upturn can solve the country 's remaining economic problems , glos continued . " further structural reforms are indispensable , " he concluded . the economics minister 's confidence is based on the hope that an increase in domestic demand will be added to germany 's already brilliant export balance . opposition remains wary glos also pointed out that it was n't just the government 's reforms that were responsible for the upswing . " there have been many players who 've made this upswing possible , among them employers and employees with their moderate wage bargaining deals , " he said .
" they 've added to germany 's increased competitiveness on the global market . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers are still shopping , despite the sales tax increase however opposition leaders have urged the grand coalition of christian and social democrats not to rest on their laurels and push on with the reform course . they criticize that the general economic upswing has not yet resulted in an improvement of the situation for the long-term unemployed .
it seems to be as hard for them to get a proper job now as it was before merkel 's government took office . turning to the state of germany 's public finances , which improved sharply in 2006 , glos said that the government would press ahead with budget consolidation . under eu rules , eurozone countries are not allowed to run up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp , a limit that germany had exceeded every year since 2002 .
but the german deficit ratio fell back within eu limits in 2006 owing to increased tax revenues from the booming economy and lower unemployment payouts . flow of good news the government 's confidence is backed up by the seemingly never-ending flow of positive economic data recently . on wednesday , the latest monthly unemployment data showed that the downward trend is still intact , despite an upward blip in the jobless total in january . retail sales rebounded in december , separate data showed , and inflation picked up only marginally , with the vat hike having a much more limited effect than feared . the federal labor agency in nuremberg calculated that the jobless total rose by 240,000 to 4.247 million in raw or unadjusted terms in january , pushing the jobless rate - which measures the total number of people out of work against the working population as a whole - up to 10.2 percent from 9.6 percent from december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the long lines at the job office are gradually shrinking nevertheless , the increase was not as steep as is usual at this time of year , when the jobless numbers are traditionally boosted by the bad weather and the end of seasonal christmas contracts . after taking such factors into account , unemployment continued to decline this month .
the bundesbank calculated that the seasonally-adjusted number of jobless declined by 106,000 to 3.976 million in january , cutting the adjusted jobless rate to 9.5 percent from 9.8 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : good news for germany 's economy although sales tax increases at the beginning of 2007 are likely to temporarily dampen the german economy , the economic outlook for next year is extremely positive , says dw-radio 's karl zawadzky .
-lrb- 30.12.2006 -rrb- euro rises on positive german business confidence american vacationers at germany 's christmas markets did n't have much to smile about when they exchanged their travelers cheques as the european currency benefited from robust german business confidence figures .
-lrb- 20.12.2006 -rrb- germany 's economic projections bounce back optimism is high in germany after new surveys show an increase in german business confidence after a 13-year low , and forecast greater than expected gdp growth for 2007 .

the club confirmed that former coach ottmar hitzfeld will take over . " we regret this decision , " said bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
" but in our role as managers of the club we have to see real development and take action . " rummenigge said the club 's board was concerned that bayern were currently out of the qualification spots for next season 's champions league .
off to a bad start the split came 24 hours after bayern were held to an embarrassing goalless draw by newly promoted vfl bochum , which left them five points adrift of bundesliga leaders werder bremen .
they could find themselves lagging eight points off the lead if werder beat bayer leverkusen on wednesday . tuesday 's result left magath 's position decidedly shaky given that in three weeks time bayern face real madrid in the champions league last 16 at the bernabeu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two league and cup doubles in consecutive seasons could n't save magath 's job bayern 's year failed to get off to the best of starts when their opening game since the winter break resulted in a 3-2 loss to borussia dortmund . hitzfeld , 58 , led bayern to four german championships and a champions league title in his first spell as manager between 1999 and 2004 , when magath moved to bavaria from vfb stuttgart .
besides his achievements with bayern , hitzfeld also guided borussia dortmund to two german titles and a champions league crown .

" i hope the eu will continue to support our needs , " said del ponte , whose mandate ends in september . the chief un prosecutor said she had " some preoccupations " that the eu was preparing to resume negotiations on a new cooperation pact with serbia . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : carla del ponte does n't want the eu to reopen discussions with serbia " this is my worry ... it would jeopardize what we absolutely need now , " said del ponte , adding that following recent elections in serbia , this was a " crucial time " to step up pressure for the arrest of mladic and others , who have been indicted for alleged war crimes . the un security council has instructed the tribunal to finish its trials by 2008 and conclude the appeals process within another two years , before closing down . belgrade must be told clearly that any reopening of cooperation talks with the eu was conditional on mladic 's transfer to the tribunal , she said . eu delegation in belgrade bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : former yugoslav dictator milosevic died last year during his trial at the hague del ponte 's warning comes ahead of a visit to belgrade by a high-level eu delegation , including solana , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and eu enlargement chief olli rehn . all 27 eu foreign ministers are expected to review the bloc 's strained ties with serbia at a meeting in brussels on feb.12. the eu froze negotiations on a first-ever stabilization and association agreement with serbia in may last year , demanding that belgrade show " full cooperation " with the un court . kosovo at stake bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " 12:45 kosovo welcomes the future , " reads this poster in reference to un resolution 1244 , which in 1999 set up in effect a un protectorate in kosvo and pledged to establish " substantial autonomy " for the entity .
but several states - including spain , hungary and slovenia - have said in recent weeks that the eu must not isolate serbia , especially since belgrade 's goodwill and cooperation will be crucial in ensuring a peaceful deal on the final status of kosovo , serbia 's breakaway albanian-majority province . the party of outgoing serbian premier vojislav kostunica has meanwhile demanded that the country should cut diplomatic ties with any nation that recognizes an independent kosovo .

" prominent among these were afghan proposals for accelerated afghanization of the national army and police , as well as in the area of economic development , " a statement released by the organizers said . the promise to increase afghan " ownership " appears to be a concession to pleas from the country to be allowed to play a greater role in spending billions of dollars of aid money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : spanta and steinmeier at the berlin conference afghan foreign minister rangeen dadfar spanta told the conference on tuesday that his government " continues to be bypassed by donor countries .

he says he was flown to a prison in afghanistan for interrogation before being released five months later in albania . masri , a 43-year-old unemployed car salesman and father of six , has said he was drugged and tortured while imprisoned . the case raised tensions when us secretary of state condoleezza rice visited germany in december 2005 at the height of a controversy over the cia 's strategy of " rendition " - flying terror suspects through european states to detention in third countries where they risk being tortured . after the meeting with rice , german chancellor angela merkel said masri 's case " was accepted as a mistake by the us government , " although us officials later suggested her remark was the result of a misunderstanding . reports have indicated that us agents confused masri with a terror suspect with a similar name who was linked to the attacks of september 11 , 2001 . help from spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plane in question lifting off from mallorca 's airport the munich prosecutor 's office said it had received in december 2005 from masri 's lawyer a list of names of people on board the plane that took masri to afghanistan .
the list originated from a spanish journalist citing the country 's civil guard . the agents are believed to have taken off from the airport in palma de mallorca , picked up masri in macedonia and taken him to afghanistan .
in 2006 , spanish and italian authorities provided further information about the flights , the prosecutor 's office said . " according to the information we have , the suspects listed in the arrest warrants are believed to be so-called code names of cia agents , " the prosecutor 's office said in a statement .
" the investigation will now focus on learning the actual names of the suspects . " these findings , as well as other information uncovered in the probe , led to the strong suspicion that these 13 identifiable people were involved in the abduction of masri , " the office said . masri 's lawyer manfred gnijdic said that although the suspects ' extradition was unlikely , the warrants were a victory for his client . " german authorities have not accepted the criminal behavior of cia employees against a german citizen , " he said . tv report : us cooperation unlikely german public broadcaster ndr had reported earlier that most of the cia employees sought lived in the us state of north carolina .
ndr said spanish authorities had learned the identities of all 13 agents on board and had copies of some of their passports . although all of the names were believed to be aliases , ndr said it was possible , using other data , to learn their real identities .
the report said three of the suspects worked for aero contractors , believed to be the cia 's secret airline . ndr noted that the german arrest warrants were not valid in the united states and that us authorities had refused to cooperate with the investigation .
if the suspects were to travel to the european union , however , they could be arrested . us lawsuit , german investigation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german parliamentary committee has been charged with investigating the case el-masri has also filed a lawsuit in the us , but the complaint was thrown out by a us district court judge last year because of a perceived risk to national security .
the american civil liberties union -lrb- aclu -rrb- is appealing that decision . a german parliamentary committee is also reviewing the case .
members of germany 's former government of social democrats and greens , which was in power at the time , have testified that they knew nothing about the abduction . el-masri is one of the most high-profile cases of a suspected " extraordinary rendition " undertaken as part of us anti-terror efforts .
italy is conducting a similar investigation into the kidnapping of an egyptian cleric in milan . a european parliamentary committee approved a report last week saying that 13 eu countries were involved in renditions to secret detention camps . the arrest warrants come amid a controversy over the german government 's alleged refusal to help a german-born turk , murat kurnaz , who was held at the us lock-up for terror suspects in guantanamo bay , cuba , for four and a half years before being released in august without charge . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ministers deny helping us kidnap terror suspect in front of a parliamentary inquiry , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and his predecessor joschka fischer have denied knowing about the us abduction of a german citizen who says he was tortured by the cia .

if the last pits are closed by 2018 as planned , it will mark an end to a centuries ' long chapter in german history .
the decision early tuesday by government coalition leaders in berlin to end state subsidies for coal production draws a line under an issue that has long been brewing in german politics .
coal mining did n't just power germany 's industrial revolution in the 19th century , it also helped spawn the country 's oldest party , the center-left social democratic party which has long rejected a complete shutting down of the industry . coal mining also played a leading role in helping to forge germany 's post-second world war economic miracle .
but in fact , the shine came off coal a long time ago .
even though germany ranks seventh worldwide in coal production ; first in the eu and fourth worldwide in coal consumption , germany 's mining sector has been heavily dependent on subsidies ever since the coal crisis of 1958 and clearly could not be supported indefinitely .
the decline the first coal was mined in germany almost 900 years ago , but coal mining only came into its own in the 19th century when industrialization transformed the mining regions of the ruhr valley and the saarland into germany 's industrial heartland .

but the 1950s saw the industry plunge into crisis , with coal largely replaced in domestic as well as industrial and transportation usage by oil , natural gas or electricity produced from renewable energy sources .
coal 's use went into steady decline as oil-burning and nuclear-powered generating plants became more common .
one by one , the country 's pits were closed down .
from 1960 to 1980 , the number of mines fell from 146 to 39 .
by 2000 , only 12 were still operating , with output down to 20.7 million tons in 2006 from 150 million tons in 1957 - a development which undid the very fabric of post-war germany with its mass lay-offs .
while some 610,000 were employed in the mines in 1977 , the figure was well under 50,000 in recent years .
coal as a political issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dying industry not surprisingly , coal played a key role in shaping germany 's 20th century history , with the emergence of coal miners ' labor unions which maintained close ties to the political left .

it was only with the establishment of the european coal and steel community that the tense relationship between germany and france over natural resources finally found a peaceful resolution .
in 1951 , the european coal and steel community -lrb- ecsc -rrb- was founded by france , germany , italy , belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands to pool their steel and coal resources .

while the subsidy issue has been a subject of recurrent debate in past decades , coal mining has also became inextricably linked with environmental and energy issues - such as health , air pollution , and contribution to global warming .
the latest drive to reach a compromise on the industry 's future came against the backdrop of a growing dilemma about germany 's energy needs .
besides the increasing worries about climate change , germany 's growing energy worries have also been fueled by last year 's surge in oil prices along with increasing concerns about the security of supplies in the wake of last year 's so-called gas war - especially after russia 's gazprom 's fight with eastern europe over energy contracts .

the decision early tuesday by government coalition leaders in berlin to end state subsidies for coal production draws a line under an issue that has long been brewing in german politics .
coal mining did n't just power germany 's industrial revolution in the 19th century , it also helped spawn the country 's oldest party , the center-left social democratic party which has long rejected a complete shutting down of the industry . coal mining also played a leading role in helping to forge germany 's post-second world war economic miracle .
but in fact , the shine came off coal a long time ago .
even though germany ranks seventh worldwide in coal production ; first in the eu and fourth worldwide in coal consumption , germany 's mining sector has been heavily dependent on subsidies ever since the coal crisis of 1958 and clearly could not be supported indefinitely .
the decline the first coal was mined in germany almost 900 years ago , but coal mining only came into its own in the 19th century when industrialization transformed the mining regions of the ruhr valley and the saarland into germany 's industrial heartland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of jobs have been lost by 1900 , germany was a chief producer of coal , after the united states and britain .
but the 1950s saw the industry plunge into crisis , with coal largely replaced in domestic as well as industrial and transportation usage by oil , natural gas or electricity produced from renewable energy sources .
coal 's use went into steady decline as oil-burning and nuclear-powered generating plants became more common .
one by one , the country 's pits were closed down .
from 1960 to 1980 , the number of mines fell from 146 to 39 .
by 2000 , only 12 were still operating , with output down to 20.7 million tons in 2006 from 150 million tons in 1957 - a development which undid the very fabric of post-war germany with its mass lay-offs .
while some 610,000 were employed in the mines in 1977 , the figure was well under 50,000 in recent years .
coal as a political issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dying industry not surprisingly , coal played a key role in shaping germany 's 20th century history , with the emergence of coal miners ' labor unions which maintained close ties to the political left .
its influence on social history aside , the rich coal seams around the ruhr and the saar provided the fuel on which germany 's industrial expansion was based - an expansion that contributed to both world wars .
it was only with the establishment of the european coal and steel community that the tense relationship between germany and france over natural resources finally found a peaceful resolution .
in 1951 , the european coal and steel community -lrb- ecsc -rrb- was founded by france , germany , italy , belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands to pool their steel and coal resources .
this first step towards cross-border co-operation is still seen as a direct catalyst for the eec and the single european market - an agreement which formed the backbone of today 's eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miners were the backbone of german industrialization post reunification , annual production and consumption dropped considerably over the first half of the 1990s , largely due to restructuring that occurred following the integration of former east germany into a unified germany .
the energy question and it now seems that the final straw has come .
while the subsidy issue has been a subject of recurrent debate in past decades , coal mining has also became inextricably linked with environmental and energy issues - such as health , air pollution , and contribution to global warming .
the latest drive to reach a compromise on the industry 's future came against the backdrop of a growing dilemma about germany 's energy needs .
besides the increasing worries about climate change , germany 's growing energy worries have also been fueled by last year 's surge in oil prices along with increasing concerns about the security of supplies in the wake of last year 's so-called gas war - especially after russia 's gazprom 's fight with eastern europe over energy contracts .
now that the coal issue appears to be resolved , the next question for germany 's political and business leaders is what will replace the estimated 20 per cent gap in the nation 's energy mix that will emerge once the nation has dismantled its nuclear energy apparatus around the end of the next decade . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough deal may eliminate german coal subsidies after months of negotiations , politicians and leaders from the coal industry reached a breakthrough sunday night .

he says he was flown to a prison in afghanistan for interrogation before being released five months later in albania . masri , a 43-year-old unemployed car salesman and father of six , has said he was drugged and tortured while imprisoned . the case raised tensions when us secretary of state condoleezza rice visited germany in december 2005 at the height of a controversy over the cia 's strategy of " rendition " - flying terror suspects through european states to detention in third countries where they risk being tortured . after the meeting with rice , german chancellor angela merkel said masri 's case " was accepted as a mistake by the us government , " although us officials later suggested her remark was the result of a misunderstanding . reports have indicated that us agents confused masri with a terror suspect with a similar name who was linked to the attacks of september 11 , 2001 . help from spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plane in question lifting off from mallorca 's airport the munich prosecutor 's office said it had received in december 2005 from masri 's lawyer a list of names of people on board the plane that took masri to afghanistan .
the list originated from a spanish journalist citing the country 's civil guard . the agents are believed to have taken off from the airport in palma de mallorca , picked up masri in macedonia and taken him to afghanistan .
in 2006 , spanish and italian authorities provided further information about the flights , the prosecutor 's office said . " according to the information we have , the suspects listed in the arrest warrants are believed to be so-called code names of cia agents , " the prosecutor 's office said in a statement .
" the investigation will now focus on learning the actual names of the suspects . " these findings , as well as other information uncovered in the probe , led to the strong suspicion that these 13 identifiable people were involved in the abduction of masri , " the office said . masri 's lawyer manfred gnijdic said that although the suspects ' extradition was unlikely , the warrants were a victory for his client . " german authorities have not accepted the criminal behavior of cia employees against a german citizen , " he said . tv report : us cooperation unlikely german public broadcaster ndr had reported earlier that most of the cia employees sought lived in the us state of north carolina .
ndr said spanish authorities had learned the identities of all 13 agents on board and had copies of some of their passports . although all of the names were believed to be aliases , ndr said it was possible , using other data , to learn their real identities .
the report said three of the suspects worked for aero contractors , believed to be the cia 's secret airline . ndr noted that the german arrest warrants were not valid in the united states and that us authorities had refused to cooperate with the investigation .
if the suspects were to travel to the european union , however , they could be arrested . us lawsuit , german investigation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german parliamentary committee has been charged with investigating the case el-masri has also filed a lawsuit in the us , but the complaint was thrown out by a us district court judge last year because of a perceived risk to national security .
the american civil liberties union -lrb- aclu -rrb- is appealing that decision . a german parliamentary committee is also reviewing the case .
members of germany 's former government of social democrats and greens , which was in power at the time , have testified that they knew nothing about the abduction . el-masri is one of the most high-profile cases of a suspected " extraordinary rendition " undertaken as part of us anti-terror efforts .
italy is conducting a similar investigation into the kidnapping of an egyptian cleric in milan . a european parliamentary committee approved a report last week saying that 13 eu countries were involved in renditions to secret detention camps . the arrest warrants come amid a controversy over the german government 's alleged refusal to help a german-born turk , murat kurnaz , who was held at the us lock-up for terror suspects in guantanamo bay , cuba , for four and a half years before being released in august without charge . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ministers deny helping us kidnap terror suspect in front of a parliamentary inquiry , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and his predecessor joschka fischer have denied knowing about the us abduction of a german citizen who says he was tortured by the cia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 31.01.2007 germany upbeat about economy despite tax hike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things can only go up for germany , if the government is to be believed the expected global economic slowdown and a sharp rise in sales tax will have only a limited impact on the german economy this year when unemployment is expected to fall to a record low , the government said wednesday . in its annual economic report published wednesday , the german government raised its 2007 growth forecast to 1.7 percent in 2007 , instead of the previously forecast 1.4 percent . in 2006 , the german economy notched up growth of 2.5 percent , its fastest rate of growth since the boom of 2000 . and the annual average jobless rate would fall to 9.6 percent this year from 10.8 percent in 2006 , the government predicted . " with a bit of luck " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos is upbeat about germany 's economic prospects indeed , " with a bit of luck " , the annual average jobless total could fall below the key four-million mark , economy minister michael glos told a news conference in berlin on wednesday . in 2006 , the annual average jobless total stood at 4.487 million .
the last time unemployment in germany was less than four million was in 2001 . " the economic engine is running smoothly , " glos said .
and he expressed confidence that any negative economic effects from the sharp rise in value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- that came into on january 1 would be short-lived . " the vat effect will be overcome within a few months and household consumption will pick up again , " glos said . the government raised vat from 16 percent to 19 percent at the beginning of the year in a move which critics claimed would drag on consumer spending and on economic activity as a whole . glos : reforms made it possible glos said it was " particularly pleasing that , in addition to the impulses coming from foreign trade , the domestic economy is contributing increasingly to growth . " he added : " the economy is standing on two legs and is more robust to the global economic challenges facing us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economic engine is humming nicely the government 's recent labor market and social welfare reforms had helped enhance germany 's economic performance , glos said . " the deep and far-reaching reforms have given investors and consumers confidence for the future and set free economic forces , " he asserted . nevertheless , the government must not rest on its laurels and think the current upturn can solve the country 's remaining economic problems , glos continued . " further structural reforms are indispensable , " he concluded . the economics minister 's confidence is based on the hope that an increase in domestic demand will be added to germany 's already brilliant export balance . opposition remains wary glos also pointed out that it was n't just the government 's reforms that were responsible for the upswing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 31.01.2007 germany upbeat about economy despite tax hike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things can only go up for germany , if the government is to be believed the expected global economic slowdown and a sharp rise in sales tax will have only a limited impact on the german economy this year when unemployment is expected to fall to a record low , the government said wednesday . in its annual economic report published wednesday , the german government raised its 2007 growth forecast to 1.7 percent in 2007 , instead of the previously forecast 1.4 percent . in 2006 , the german economy notched up growth of 2.5 percent , its fastest rate of growth since the boom of 2000 . and the annual average jobless rate would fall to 9.6 percent this year from 10.8 percent in 2006 , the government predicted . " with a bit of luck " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos is upbeat about germany 's economic prospects indeed , " with a bit of luck " , the annual average jobless total could fall below the key four-million mark , economy minister michael glos told a news conference in berlin on wednesday . in 2006 , the annual average jobless total stood at 4.487 million .
the last time unemployment in germany was less than four million was in 2001 . " the economic engine is running smoothly , " glos said .
and he expressed confidence that any negative economic effects from the sharp rise in value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- that came into on january 1 would be short-lived . " the vat effect will be overcome within a few months and household consumption will pick up again , " glos said . the government raised vat from 16 percent to 19 percent at the beginning of the year in a move which critics claimed would drag on consumer spending and on economic activity as a whole . glos : reforms made it possible glos said it was " particularly pleasing that , in addition to the impulses coming from foreign trade , the domestic economy is contributing increasingly to growth . " he added : " the economy is standing on two legs and is more robust to the global economic challenges facing us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economic engine is humming nicely the government 's recent labor market and social welfare reforms had helped enhance germany 's economic performance , glos said . " the deep and far-reaching reforms have given investors and consumers confidence for the future and set free economic forces , " he asserted . nevertheless , the government must not rest on its laurels and think the current upturn can solve the country 's remaining economic problems , glos continued . " further structural reforms are indispensable , " he concluded . the economics minister 's confidence is based on the hope that an increase in domestic demand will be added to germany 's already brilliant export balance . opposition remains wary glos also pointed out that it was n't just the government 's reforms that were responsible for the upswing . " there have been many players who 've made this upswing possible , among them employers and employees with their moderate wage bargaining deals , " he said .
" they 've added to germany 's increased competitiveness on the global market . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers are still shopping , despite the sales tax increase however opposition leaders have urged the grand coalition of christian and social democrats not to rest on their laurels and push on with the reform course . they criticize that the general economic upswing has not yet resulted in an improvement of the situation for the long-term unemployed .
it seems to be as hard for them to get a proper job now as it was before merkel 's government took office . turning to the state of germany 's public finances , which improved sharply in 2006 , glos said that the government would press ahead with budget consolidation . under eu rules , eurozone countries are not allowed to run up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp , a limit that germany had exceeded every year since 2002 .
but the german deficit ratio fell back within eu limits in 2006 owing to increased tax revenues from the booming economy and lower unemployment payouts . flow of good news the government 's confidence is backed up by the seemingly never-ending flow of positive economic data recently . on wednesday , the latest monthly unemployment data showed that the downward trend is still intact , despite an upward blip in the jobless total in january . retail sales rebounded in december , separate data showed , and inflation picked up only marginally , with the vat hike having a much more limited effect than feared . the federal labor agency in nuremberg calculated that the jobless total rose by 240,000 to 4.247 million in raw or unadjusted terms in january , pushing the jobless rate - which measures the total number of people out of work against the working population as a whole - up to 10.2 percent from 9.6 percent from december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the long lines at the job office are gradually shrinking nevertheless , the increase was not as steep as is usual at this time of year , when the jobless numbers are traditionally boosted by the bad weather and the end of seasonal christmas contracts . after taking such factors into account , unemployment continued to decline this month .
the bundesbank calculated that the seasonally-adjusted number of jobless declined by 106,000 to 3.976 million in january , cutting the adjusted jobless rate to 9.5 percent from 9.8 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : good news for germany 's economy although sales tax increases at the beginning of 2007 are likely to temporarily dampen the german economy , the economic outlook for next year is extremely positive , says dw-radio 's karl zawadzky .

the club confirmed that former coach ottmar hitzfeld will take over . " we regret this decision , " said bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
" but in our role as managers of the club we have to see real development and take action . " rummenigge said the club 's board was concerned that bayern were currently out of the qualification spots for next season 's champions league .
off to a bad start the split came 24 hours after bayern were held to an embarrassing goalless draw by newly promoted vfl bochum , which left them five points adrift of bundesliga leaders werder bremen .
they could find themselves lagging eight points off the lead if werder beat bayer leverkusen on wednesday . tuesday 's result left magath 's position decidedly shaky given that in three weeks time bayern face real madrid in the champions league last 16 at the bernabeu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two league and cup doubles in consecutive seasons could n't save magath 's job bayern 's year failed to get off to the best of starts when their opening game since the winter break resulted in a 3-2 loss to borussia dortmund . hitzfeld , 58 , led bayern to four german championships and a champions league title in his first spell as manager between 1999 and 2004 , when magath moved to bavaria from vfb stuttgart .
besides his achievements with bayern , hitzfeld also guided borussia dortmund to two german titles and a champions league crown .
rumor mill pinpoints houllier magath , 53 , said he was proud of leading bayern to two league and cup doubles . " obviously this is n't the best news because i 'm proud of the two great years touched with success that i 've had here , " he said .
" but it 's always been clear that my contract could come to an end one day . " it is rumored that current lyon manager and former liverpool boss gerard houllier is being lined up to take the reins at bayern in time for the start of next season . magath was the second bundesliga coach to part company with his club on wednesday after former germany international jupp heynckes quit as coach of relegation-threatened borussia monchengladbach . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen , schalke watch bayern 's grip on title slip bayern munich saw their title hopes dwindle after drawing 0-0 with lowly bochum tuesday .

if the last pits are closed by 2018 as planned , it will mark an end to a centuries ' long chapter in german history .
the decision early tuesday by government coalition leaders in berlin to end state subsidies for coal production draws a line under an issue that has long been brewing in german politics .
coal mining did n't just power germany 's industrial revolution in the 19th century , it also helped spawn the country 's oldest party , the center-left social democratic party which has long rejected a complete shutting down of the industry . coal mining also played a leading role in helping to forge germany 's post-second world war economic miracle .
but in fact , the shine came off coal a long time ago .
even though germany ranks seventh worldwide in coal production ; first in the eu and fourth worldwide in coal consumption , germany 's mining sector has been heavily dependent on subsidies ever since the coal crisis of 1958 and clearly could not be supported indefinitely .
the decline the first coal was mined in germany almost 900 years ago , but coal mining only came into its own in the 19th century when industrialization transformed the mining regions of the ruhr valley and the saarland into germany 's industrial heartland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of jobs have been lost by 1900 , germany was a chief producer of coal , after the united states and britain .
but the 1950s saw the industry plunge into crisis , with coal largely replaced in domestic as well as industrial and transportation usage by oil , natural gas or electricity produced from renewable energy sources .
coal 's use went into steady decline as oil-burning and nuclear-powered generating plants became more common .
one by one , the country 's pits were closed down .
from 1960 to 1980 , the number of mines fell from 146 to 39 .
by 2000 , only 12 were still operating , with output down to 20.7 million tons in 2006 from 150 million tons in 1957 - a development which undid the very fabric of post-war germany with its mass lay-offs .
while some 610,000 were employed in the mines in 1977 , the figure was well under 50,000 in recent years .
coal as a political issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dying industry not surprisingly , coal played a key role in shaping germany 's 20th century history , with the emergence of coal miners ' labor unions which maintained close ties to the political left .
its influence on social history aside , the rich coal seams around the ruhr and the saar provided the fuel on which germany 's industrial expansion was based - an expansion that contributed to both world wars .
it was only with the establishment of the european coal and steel community that the tense relationship between germany and france over natural resources finally found a peaceful resolution .
in 1951 , the european coal and steel community -lrb- ecsc -rrb- was founded by france , germany , italy , belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands to pool their steel and coal resources .
this first step towards cross-border co-operation is still seen as a direct catalyst for the eec and the single european market - an agreement which formed the backbone of today 's eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miners were the backbone of german industrialization post reunification , annual production and consumption dropped considerably over the first half of the 1990s , largely due to restructuring that occurred following the integration of former east germany into a unified germany .
the energy question and it now seems that the final straw has come .
while the subsidy issue has been a subject of recurrent debate in past decades , coal mining has also became inextricably linked with environmental and energy issues - such as health , air pollution , and contribution to global warming .
the latest drive to reach a compromise on the industry 's future came against the backdrop of a growing dilemma about germany 's energy needs .
besides the increasing worries about climate change , germany 's growing energy worries have also been fueled by last year 's surge in oil prices along with increasing concerns about the security of supplies in the wake of last year 's so-called gas war - especially after russia 's gazprom 's fight with eastern europe over energy contracts .
now that the coal issue appears to be resolved , the next question for germany 's political and business leaders is what will replace the estimated 20 per cent gap in the nation 's energy mix that will emerge once the nation has dismantled its nuclear energy apparatus around the end of the next decade . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough deal may eliminate german coal subsidies after months of negotiations , politicians and leaders from the coal industry reached a breakthrough sunday night .

this first step towards cross-border co-operation is still seen as a direct catalyst for the eec and the single european market - an agreement which formed the backbone of today 's eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miners were the backbone of german industrialization post reunification , annual production and consumption dropped considerably over the first half of the 1990s , largely due to restructuring that occurred following the integration of former east germany into a unified germany .
the energy question and it now seems that the final straw has come .
while the subsidy issue has been a subject of recurrent debate in past decades , coal mining has also became inextricably linked with environmental and energy issues - such as health , air pollution , and contribution to global warming .
the latest drive to reach a compromise on the industry 's future came against the backdrop of a growing dilemma about germany 's energy needs .
besides the increasing worries about climate change , germany 's growing energy worries have also been fueled by last year 's surge in oil prices along with increasing concerns about the security of supplies in the wake of last year 's so-called gas war - especially after russia 's gazprom 's fight with eastern europe over energy contracts .
now that the coal issue appears to be resolved , the next question for germany 's political and business leaders is what will replace the estimated 20 per cent gap in the nation 's energy mix that will emerge once the nation has dismantled its nuclear energy apparatus around the end of the next decade . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough deal may eliminate german coal subsidies after months of negotiations , politicians and leaders from the coal industry reached a breakthrough sunday night .
government subsidies - not jobs - are to be cut back drastically and may be history as early as 2018 .
-lrb- 29.01.2007 -rrb- germany 's coal industry faces closures and job losses germany 's coal mining industry - already facing the end of government subsidies - was hit by a further blow this weekend when it was revealed that financial discrepencies could lead to mine closures and job losses .
-lrb- 22.01.2007 -rrb- germany debates the future of coal mining some say the german mining industry is squandering too much money and that production should cease as soon as possible , whereas others argue that coal is the energy source of the future .

he says he was flown to a prison in afghanistan for interrogation before being released five months later in albania . masri , a 43-year-old unemployed car salesman and father of six , has said he was drugged and tortured while imprisoned . the case raised tensions when us secretary of state condoleezza rice visited germany in december 2005 at the height of a controversy over the cia 's strategy of " rendition " - flying terror suspects through european states to detention in third countries where they risk being tortured . after the meeting with rice , german chancellor angela merkel said masri 's case " was accepted as a mistake by the us government , " although us officials later suggested her remark was the result of a misunderstanding . reports have indicated that us agents confused masri with a terror suspect with a similar name who was linked to the attacks of september 11 , 2001 . help from spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plane in question lifting off from mallorca 's airport the munich prosecutor 's office said it had received in december 2005 from masri 's lawyer a list of names of people on board the plane that took masri to afghanistan .
the list originated from a spanish journalist citing the country 's civil guard . the agents are believed to have taken off from the airport in palma de mallorca , picked up masri in macedonia and taken him to afghanistan .
in 2006 , spanish and italian authorities provided further information about the flights , the prosecutor 's office said . " according to the information we have , the suspects listed in the arrest warrants are believed to be so-called code names of cia agents , " the prosecutor 's office said in a statement .
" the investigation will now focus on learning the actual names of the suspects . " these findings , as well as other information uncovered in the probe , led to the strong suspicion that these 13 identifiable people were involved in the abduction of masri , " the office said . masri 's lawyer manfred gnijdic said that although the suspects ' extradition was unlikely , the warrants were a victory for his client . " german authorities have not accepted the criminal behavior of cia employees against a german citizen , " he said . tv report : us cooperation unlikely german public broadcaster ndr had reported earlier that most of the cia employees sought lived in the us state of north carolina .
ndr said spanish authorities had learned the identities of all 13 agents on board and had copies of some of their passports . although all of the names were believed to be aliases , ndr said it was possible , using other data , to learn their real identities .
the report said three of the suspects worked for aero contractors , believed to be the cia 's secret airline . ndr noted that the german arrest warrants were not valid in the united states and that us authorities had refused to cooperate with the investigation .
if the suspects were to travel to the european union , however , they could be arrested . us lawsuit , german investigation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german parliamentary committee has been charged with investigating the case el-masri has also filed a lawsuit in the us , but the complaint was thrown out by a us district court judge last year because of a perceived risk to national security .
the american civil liberties union -lrb- aclu -rrb- is appealing that decision . a german parliamentary committee is also reviewing the case .
members of germany 's former government of social democrats and greens , which was in power at the time , have testified that they knew nothing about the abduction . el-masri is one of the most high-profile cases of a suspected " extraordinary rendition " undertaken as part of us anti-terror efforts .
italy is conducting a similar investigation into the kidnapping of an egyptian cleric in milan . a european parliamentary committee approved a report last week saying that 13 eu countries were involved in renditions to secret detention camps . the arrest warrants come amid a controversy over the german government 's alleged refusal to help a german-born turk , murat kurnaz , who was held at the us lock-up for terror suspects in guantanamo bay , cuba , for four and a half years before being released in august without charge . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ministers deny helping us kidnap terror suspect in front of a parliamentary inquiry , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and his predecessor joschka fischer have denied knowing about the us abduction of a german citizen who says he was tortured by the cia .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de economy -pipe- 31.01.2007 germany upbeat about economy despite tax hike großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : things can only go up for germany , if the government is to be believed the expected global economic slowdown and a sharp rise in sales tax will have only a limited impact on the german economy this year when unemployment is expected to fall to a record low , the government said wednesday . in its annual economic report published wednesday , the german government raised its 2007 growth forecast to 1.7 percent in 2007 , instead of the previously forecast 1.4 percent . in 2006 , the german economy notched up growth of 2.5 percent , its fastest rate of growth since the boom of 2000 . and the annual average jobless rate would fall to 9.6 percent this year from 10.8 percent in 2006 , the government predicted . " with a bit of luck " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : glos is upbeat about germany 's economic prospects indeed , " with a bit of luck " , the annual average jobless total could fall below the key four-million mark , economy minister michael glos told a news conference in berlin on wednesday . in 2006 , the annual average jobless total stood at 4.487 million .
the last time unemployment in germany was less than four million was in 2001 . " the economic engine is running smoothly , " glos said .
and he expressed confidence that any negative economic effects from the sharp rise in value-added or sales tax -lrb- vat -rrb- that came into on january 1 would be short-lived . " the vat effect will be overcome within a few months and household consumption will pick up again , " glos said . the government raised vat from 16 percent to 19 percent at the beginning of the year in a move which critics claimed would drag on consumer spending and on economic activity as a whole . glos : reforms made it possible glos said it was " particularly pleasing that , in addition to the impulses coming from foreign trade , the domestic economy is contributing increasingly to growth . " he added : " the economy is standing on two legs and is more robust to the global economic challenges facing us . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's economic engine is humming nicely the government 's recent labor market and social welfare reforms had helped enhance germany 's economic performance , glos said . " the deep and far-reaching reforms have given investors and consumers confidence for the future and set free economic forces , " he asserted . nevertheless , the government must not rest on its laurels and think the current upturn can solve the country 's remaining economic problems , glos continued . " further structural reforms are indispensable , " he concluded . the economics minister 's confidence is based on the hope that an increase in domestic demand will be added to germany 's already brilliant export balance . opposition remains wary glos also pointed out that it was n't just the government 's reforms that were responsible for the upswing . " there have been many players who 've made this upswing possible , among them employers and employees with their moderate wage bargaining deals , " he said .
" they 've added to germany 's increased competitiveness on the global market . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : consumers are still shopping , despite the sales tax increase however opposition leaders have urged the grand coalition of christian and social democrats not to rest on their laurels and push on with the reform course . they criticize that the general economic upswing has not yet resulted in an improvement of the situation for the long-term unemployed .
it seems to be as hard for them to get a proper job now as it was before merkel 's government took office . turning to the state of germany 's public finances , which improved sharply in 2006 , glos said that the government would press ahead with budget consolidation . under eu rules , eurozone countries are not allowed to run up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp , a limit that germany had exceeded every year since 2002 .
but the german deficit ratio fell back within eu limits in 2006 owing to increased tax revenues from the booming economy and lower unemployment payouts . flow of good news the government 's confidence is backed up by the seemingly never-ending flow of positive economic data recently . on wednesday , the latest monthly unemployment data showed that the downward trend is still intact , despite an upward blip in the jobless total in january . retail sales rebounded in december , separate data showed , and inflation picked up only marginally , with the vat hike having a much more limited effect than feared . the federal labor agency in nuremberg calculated that the jobless total rose by 240,000 to 4.247 million in raw or unadjusted terms in january , pushing the jobless rate - which measures the total number of people out of work against the working population as a whole - up to 10.2 percent from 9.6 percent from december . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the long lines at the job office are gradually shrinking nevertheless , the increase was not as steep as is usual at this time of year , when the jobless numbers are traditionally boosted by the bad weather and the end of seasonal christmas contracts . after taking such factors into account , unemployment continued to decline this month .
the bundesbank calculated that the seasonally-adjusted number of jobless declined by 106,000 to 3.976 million in january , cutting the adjusted jobless rate to 9.5 percent from 9.8 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de opinion : good news for germany 's economy although sales tax increases at the beginning of 2007 are likely to temporarily dampen the german economy , the economic outlook for next year is extremely positive , says dw-radio 's karl zawadzky .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 31.01.2007 german court orders arrest of 13 over cia kidnapping großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el masri claims he was abducted by us agents in 2003 a german court ordered the arrest of 13 people behind the alleged cia-backed kidnapping of a german citizen , believed to be one of the most notorious us " renditions " of a terror suspect , prosecutors said wednesday . the prosecutor 's office in munich , southern germany , said the city 's administrative court had issued the arrest warrants against individuals thought to be cia agents on suspicion of abduction and grievous bodily harm . authorities are probing allegations by khaled el-masri , a lebanese-born german , that he was abducted by us agents in the macedonian capital skopje on new year 's eve 2003 .
he says he was flown to a prison in afghanistan for interrogation before being released five months later in albania . masri , a 43-year-old unemployed car salesman and father of six , has said he was drugged and tortured while imprisoned . the case raised tensions when us secretary of state condoleezza rice visited germany in december 2005 at the height of a controversy over the cia 's strategy of " rendition " - flying terror suspects through european states to detention in third countries where they risk being tortured . after the meeting with rice , german chancellor angela merkel said masri 's case " was accepted as a mistake by the us government , " although us officials later suggested her remark was the result of a misunderstanding . reports have indicated that us agents confused masri with a terror suspect with a similar name who was linked to the attacks of september 11 , 2001 . help from spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plane in question lifting off from mallorca 's airport the munich prosecutor 's office said it had received in december 2005 from masri 's lawyer a list of names of people on board the plane that took masri to afghanistan .
the list originated from a spanish journalist citing the country 's civil guard . the agents are believed to have taken off from the airport in palma de mallorca , picked up masri in macedonia and taken him to afghanistan .
in 2006 , spanish and italian authorities provided further information about the flights , the prosecutor 's office said . " according to the information we have , the suspects listed in the arrest warrants are believed to be so-called code names of cia agents , " the prosecutor 's office said in a statement .
" the investigation will now focus on learning the actual names of the suspects . " these findings , as well as other information uncovered in the probe , led to the strong suspicion that these 13 identifiable people were involved in the abduction of masri , " the office said . masri 's lawyer manfred gnijdic said that although the suspects ' extradition was unlikely , the warrants were a victory for his client . " german authorities have not accepted the criminal behavior of cia employees against a german citizen , " he said . tv report : us cooperation unlikely german public broadcaster ndr had reported earlier that most of the cia employees sought lived in the us state of north carolina .
ndr said spanish authorities had learned the identities of all 13 agents on board and had copies of some of their passports . although all of the names were believed to be aliases , ndr said it was possible , using other data , to learn their real identities .
the report said three of the suspects worked for aero contractors , believed to be the cia 's secret airline . ndr noted that the german arrest warrants were not valid in the united states and that us authorities had refused to cooperate with the investigation .
if the suspects were to travel to the european union , however , they could be arrested . us lawsuit , german investigation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german parliamentary committee has been charged with investigating the case el-masri has also filed a lawsuit in the us , but the complaint was thrown out by a us district court judge last year because of a perceived risk to national security .
the american civil liberties union -lrb- aclu -rrb- is appealing that decision . a german parliamentary committee is also reviewing the case .
members of germany 's former government of social democrats and greens , which was in power at the time , have testified that they knew nothing about the abduction . el-masri is one of the most high-profile cases of a suspected " extraordinary rendition " undertaken as part of us anti-terror efforts .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 31.01.2007 german court orders arrest of 13 over cia kidnapping großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : el masri claims he was abducted by us agents in 2003 a german court ordered the arrest of 13 people behind the alleged cia-backed kidnapping of a german citizen , believed to be one of the most notorious us " renditions " of a terror suspect , prosecutors said wednesday . the prosecutor 's office in munich , southern germany , said the city 's administrative court had issued the arrest warrants against individuals thought to be cia agents on suspicion of abduction and grievous bodily harm . authorities are probing allegations by khaled el-masri , a lebanese-born german , that he was abducted by us agents in the macedonian capital skopje on new year 's eve 2003 .
he says he was flown to a prison in afghanistan for interrogation before being released five months later in albania . masri , a 43-year-old unemployed car salesman and father of six , has said he was drugged and tortured while imprisoned . the case raised tensions when us secretary of state condoleezza rice visited germany in december 2005 at the height of a controversy over the cia 's strategy of " rendition " - flying terror suspects through european states to detention in third countries where they risk being tortured . after the meeting with rice , german chancellor angela merkel said masri 's case " was accepted as a mistake by the us government , " although us officials later suggested her remark was the result of a misunderstanding . reports have indicated that us agents confused masri with a terror suspect with a similar name who was linked to the attacks of september 11 , 2001 . help from spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plane in question lifting off from mallorca 's airport the munich prosecutor 's office said it had received in december 2005 from masri 's lawyer a list of names of people on board the plane that took masri to afghanistan .
the list originated from a spanish journalist citing the country 's civil guard . the agents are believed to have taken off from the airport in palma de mallorca , picked up masri in macedonia and taken him to afghanistan .
in 2006 , spanish and italian authorities provided further information about the flights , the prosecutor 's office said . " according to the information we have , the suspects listed in the arrest warrants are believed to be so-called code names of cia agents , " the prosecutor 's office said in a statement .
" the investigation will now focus on learning the actual names of the suspects . " these findings , as well as other information uncovered in the probe , led to the strong suspicion that these 13 identifiable people were involved in the abduction of masri , " the office said . masri 's lawyer manfred gnijdic said that although the suspects ' extradition was unlikely , the warrants were a victory for his client . " german authorities have not accepted the criminal behavior of cia employees against a german citizen , " he said . tv report : us cooperation unlikely german public broadcaster ndr had reported earlier that most of the cia employees sought lived in the us state of north carolina .
ndr said spanish authorities had learned the identities of all 13 agents on board and had copies of some of their passports . although all of the names were believed to be aliases , ndr said it was possible , using other data , to learn their real identities .
the report said three of the suspects worked for aero contractors , believed to be the cia 's secret airline . ndr noted that the german arrest warrants were not valid in the united states and that us authorities had refused to cooperate with the investigation .
if the suspects were to travel to the european union , however , they could be arrested . us lawsuit , german investigation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german parliamentary committee has been charged with investigating the case el-masri has also filed a lawsuit in the us , but the complaint was thrown out by a us district court judge last year because of a perceived risk to national security .
the american civil liberties union -lrb- aclu -rrb- is appealing that decision . a german parliamentary committee is also reviewing the case .
members of germany 's former government of social democrats and greens , which was in power at the time , have testified that they knew nothing about the abduction . el-masri is one of the most high-profile cases of a suspected " extraordinary rendition " undertaken as part of us anti-terror efforts .
italy is conducting a similar investigation into the kidnapping of an egyptian cleric in milan . a european parliamentary committee approved a report last week saying that 13 eu countries were involved in renditions to secret detention camps . the arrest warrants come amid a controversy over the german government 's alleged refusal to help a german-born turk , murat kurnaz , who was held at the us lock-up for terror suspects in guantanamo bay , cuba , for four and a half years before being released in august without charge . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ministers deny helping us kidnap terror suspect in front of a parliamentary inquiry , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and his predecessor joschka fischer have denied knowing about the us abduction of a german citizen who says he was tortured by the cia .

he says he was flown to a prison in afghanistan for interrogation before being released five months later in albania . masri , a 43-year-old unemployed car salesman and father of six , has said he was drugged and tortured while imprisoned . the case raised tensions when us secretary of state condoleezza rice visited germany in december 2005 at the height of a controversy over the cia 's strategy of " rendition " - flying terror suspects through european states to detention in third countries where they risk being tortured . after the meeting with rice , german chancellor angela merkel said masri 's case " was accepted as a mistake by the us government , " although us officials later suggested her remark was the result of a misunderstanding . reports have indicated that us agents confused masri with a terror suspect with a similar name who was linked to the attacks of september 11 , 2001 . help from spain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the plane in question lifting off from mallorca 's airport the munich prosecutor 's office said it had received in december 2005 from masri 's lawyer a list of names of people on board the plane that took masri to afghanistan .
the list originated from a spanish journalist citing the country 's civil guard . the agents are believed to have taken off from the airport in palma de mallorca , picked up masri in macedonia and taken him to afghanistan .
in 2006 , spanish and italian authorities provided further information about the flights , the prosecutor 's office said . " according to the information we have , the suspects listed in the arrest warrants are believed to be so-called code names of cia agents , " the prosecutor 's office said in a statement .
" the investigation will now focus on learning the actual names of the suspects . " these findings , as well as other information uncovered in the probe , led to the strong suspicion that these 13 identifiable people were involved in the abduction of masri , " the office said . masri 's lawyer manfred gnijdic said that although the suspects ' extradition was unlikely , the warrants were a victory for his client . " german authorities have not accepted the criminal behavior of cia employees against a german citizen , " he said . tv report : us cooperation unlikely german public broadcaster ndr had reported earlier that most of the cia employees sought lived in the us state of north carolina .
ndr said spanish authorities had learned the identities of all 13 agents on board and had copies of some of their passports . although all of the names were believed to be aliases , ndr said it was possible , using other data , to learn their real identities .
the report said three of the suspects worked for aero contractors , believed to be the cia 's secret airline . ndr noted that the german arrest warrants were not valid in the united states and that us authorities had refused to cooperate with the investigation .
if the suspects were to travel to the european union , however , they could be arrested . us lawsuit , german investigation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german parliamentary committee has been charged with investigating the case el-masri has also filed a lawsuit in the us , but the complaint was thrown out by a us district court judge last year because of a perceived risk to national security .
the american civil liberties union -lrb- aclu -rrb- is appealing that decision . a german parliamentary committee is also reviewing the case .
members of germany 's former government of social democrats and greens , which was in power at the time , have testified that they knew nothing about the abduction . el-masri is one of the most high-profile cases of a suspected " extraordinary rendition " undertaken as part of us anti-terror efforts .
italy is conducting a similar investigation into the kidnapping of an egyptian cleric in milan . a european parliamentary committee approved a report last week saying that 13 eu countries were involved in renditions to secret detention camps . the arrest warrants come amid a controversy over the german government 's alleged refusal to help a german-born turk , murat kurnaz , who was held at the us lock-up for terror suspects in guantanamo bay , cuba , for four and a half years before being released in august without charge . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german ministers deny helping us kidnap terror suspect in front of a parliamentary inquiry , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and his predecessor joschka fischer have denied knowing about the us abduction of a german citizen who says he was tortured by the cia .

the club confirmed that former coach ottmar hitzfeld will take over . " we regret this decision , " said bayern chairman karl-heinz rummenigge .
" but in our role as managers of the club we have to see real development and take action . " rummenigge said the club 's board was concerned that bayern were currently out of the qualification spots for next season 's champions league .
off to a bad start the split came 24 hours after bayern were held to an embarrassing goalless draw by newly promoted vfl bochum , which left them five points adrift of bundesliga leaders werder bremen .
they could find themselves lagging eight points off the lead if werder beat bayer leverkusen on wednesday . tuesday 's result left magath 's position decidedly shaky given that in three weeks time bayern face real madrid in the champions league last 16 at the bernabeu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : two league and cup doubles in consecutive seasons could n't save magath 's job bayern 's year failed to get off to the best of starts when their opening game since the winter break resulted in a 3-2 loss to borussia dortmund . hitzfeld , 58 , led bayern to four german championships and a champions league title in his first spell as manager between 1999 and 2004 , when magath moved to bavaria from vfb stuttgart .
besides his achievements with bayern , hitzfeld also guided borussia dortmund to two german titles and a champions league crown .
rumor mill pinpoints houllier magath , 53 , said he was proud of leading bayern to two league and cup doubles . " obviously this is n't the best news because i 'm proud of the two great years touched with success that i 've had here , " he said .
" but it 's always been clear that my contract could come to an end one day . " it is rumored that current lyon manager and former liverpool boss gerard houllier is being lined up to take the reins at bayern in time for the start of next season . magath was the second bundesliga coach to part company with his club on wednesday after former germany international jupp heynckes quit as coach of relegation-threatened borussia monchengladbach . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bremen , schalke watch bayern 's grip on title slip bayern munich saw their title hopes dwindle after drawing 0-0 with lowly bochum tuesday .

if the last pits are closed by 2018 as planned , it will mark an end to a centuries ' long chapter in german history .
the decision early tuesday by government coalition leaders in berlin to end state subsidies for coal production draws a line under an issue that has long been brewing in german politics .
coal mining did n't just power germany 's industrial revolution in the 19th century , it also helped spawn the country 's oldest party , the center-left social democratic party which has long rejected a complete shutting down of the industry . coal mining also played a leading role in helping to forge germany 's post-second world war economic miracle .
but in fact , the shine came off coal a long time ago .
even though germany ranks seventh worldwide in coal production ; first in the eu and fourth worldwide in coal consumption , germany 's mining sector has been heavily dependent on subsidies ever since the coal crisis of 1958 and clearly could not be supported indefinitely .
the decline the first coal was mined in germany almost 900 years ago , but coal mining only came into its own in the 19th century when industrialization transformed the mining regions of the ruhr valley and the saarland into germany 's industrial heartland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of jobs have been lost by 1900 , germany was a chief producer of coal , after the united states and britain .
but the 1950s saw the industry plunge into crisis , with coal largely replaced in domestic as well as industrial and transportation usage by oil , natural gas or electricity produced from renewable energy sources .
coal 's use went into steady decline as oil-burning and nuclear-powered generating plants became more common .
one by one , the country 's pits were closed down .
from 1960 to 1980 , the number of mines fell from 146 to 39 .
by 2000 , only 12 were still operating , with output down to 20.7 million tons in 2006 from 150 million tons in 1957 - a development which undid the very fabric of post-war germany with its mass lay-offs .
while some 610,000 were employed in the mines in 1977 , the figure was well under 50,000 in recent years .
coal as a political issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dying industry not surprisingly , coal played a key role in shaping germany 's 20th century history , with the emergence of coal miners ' labor unions which maintained close ties to the political left .
its influence on social history aside , the rich coal seams around the ruhr and the saar provided the fuel on which germany 's industrial expansion was based - an expansion that contributed to both world wars .
it was only with the establishment of the european coal and steel community that the tense relationship between germany and france over natural resources finally found a peaceful resolution .
in 1951 , the european coal and steel community -lrb- ecsc -rrb- was founded by france , germany , italy , belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands to pool their steel and coal resources .
this first step towards cross-border co-operation is still seen as a direct catalyst for the eec and the single european market - an agreement which formed the backbone of today 's eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miners were the backbone of german industrialization post reunification , annual production and consumption dropped considerably over the first half of the 1990s , largely due to restructuring that occurred following the integration of former east germany into a unified germany .
the energy question and it now seems that the final straw has come .
while the subsidy issue has been a subject of recurrent debate in past decades , coal mining has also became inextricably linked with environmental and energy issues - such as health , air pollution , and contribution to global warming .
the latest drive to reach a compromise on the industry 's future came against the backdrop of a growing dilemma about germany 's energy needs .
besides the increasing worries about climate change , germany 's growing energy worries have also been fueled by last year 's surge in oil prices along with increasing concerns about the security of supplies in the wake of last year 's so-called gas war - especially after russia 's gazprom 's fight with eastern europe over energy contracts .
now that the coal issue appears to be resolved , the next question for germany 's political and business leaders is what will replace the estimated 20 per cent gap in the nation 's energy mix that will emerge once the nation has dismantled its nuclear energy apparatus around the end of the next decade . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough deal may eliminate german coal subsidies after months of negotiations , politicians and leaders from the coal industry reached a breakthrough sunday night .

if the last pits are closed by 2018 as planned , it will mark an end to a centuries ' long chapter in german history .
the decision early tuesday by government coalition leaders in berlin to end state subsidies for coal production draws a line under an issue that has long been brewing in german politics .
coal mining did n't just power germany 's industrial revolution in the 19th century , it also helped spawn the country 's oldest party , the center-left social democratic party which has long rejected a complete shutting down of the industry . coal mining also played a leading role in helping to forge germany 's post-second world war economic miracle .
but in fact , the shine came off coal a long time ago .
even though germany ranks seventh worldwide in coal production ; first in the eu and fourth worldwide in coal consumption , germany 's mining sector has been heavily dependent on subsidies ever since the coal crisis of 1958 and clearly could not be supported indefinitely .
the decline the first coal was mined in germany almost 900 years ago , but coal mining only came into its own in the 19th century when industrialization transformed the mining regions of the ruhr valley and the saarland into germany 's industrial heartland .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thousands of jobs have been lost by 1900 , germany was a chief producer of coal , after the united states and britain .
but the 1950s saw the industry plunge into crisis , with coal largely replaced in domestic as well as industrial and transportation usage by oil , natural gas or electricity produced from renewable energy sources .
coal 's use went into steady decline as oil-burning and nuclear-powered generating plants became more common .
one by one , the country 's pits were closed down .
from 1960 to 1980 , the number of mines fell from 146 to 39 .
by 2000 , only 12 were still operating , with output down to 20.7 million tons in 2006 from 150 million tons in 1957 - a development which undid the very fabric of post-war germany with its mass lay-offs .
while some 610,000 were employed in the mines in 1977 , the figure was well under 50,000 in recent years .
coal as a political issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a dying industry not surprisingly , coal played a key role in shaping germany 's 20th century history , with the emergence of coal miners ' labor unions which maintained close ties to the political left .
its influence on social history aside , the rich coal seams around the ruhr and the saar provided the fuel on which germany 's industrial expansion was based - an expansion that contributed to both world wars .
it was only with the establishment of the european coal and steel community that the tense relationship between germany and france over natural resources finally found a peaceful resolution .
in 1951 , the european coal and steel community -lrb- ecsc -rrb- was founded by france , germany , italy , belgium , luxembourg and the netherlands to pool their steel and coal resources .
this first step towards cross-border co-operation is still seen as a direct catalyst for the eec and the single european market - an agreement which formed the backbone of today 's eu .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : miners were the backbone of german industrialization post reunification , annual production and consumption dropped considerably over the first half of the 1990s , largely due to restructuring that occurred following the integration of former east germany into a unified germany .
the energy question and it now seems that the final straw has come .
while the subsidy issue has been a subject of recurrent debate in past decades , coal mining has also became inextricably linked with environmental and energy issues - such as health , air pollution , and contribution to global warming .
the latest drive to reach a compromise on the industry 's future came against the backdrop of a growing dilemma about germany 's energy needs .
besides the increasing worries about climate change , germany 's growing energy worries have also been fueled by last year 's surge in oil prices along with increasing concerns about the security of supplies in the wake of last year 's so-called gas war - especially after russia 's gazprom 's fight with eastern europe over energy contracts .
now that the coal issue appears to be resolved , the next question for germany 's political and business leaders is what will replace the estimated 20 per cent gap in the nation 's energy mix that will emerge once the nation has dismantled its nuclear energy apparatus around the end of the next decade . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de breakthrough deal may eliminate german coal subsidies after months of negotiations , politicians and leaders from the coal industry reached a breakthrough sunday night .
government subsidies - not jobs - are to be cut back drastically and may be history as early as 2018 .
-lrb- 29.01.2007 -rrb- germany 's coal industry faces closures and job losses germany 's coal mining industry - already facing the end of government subsidies - was hit by a further blow this weekend when it was revealed that financial discrepencies could lead to mine closures and job losses .
-lrb- 22.01.2007 -rrb- germany debates the future of coal mining some say the german mining industry is squandering too much money and that production should cease as soon as possible , whereas others argue that coal is the energy source of the future .

since children are banned entry - the expo is for trade buyers only - anyone under 16 is refused admittance unless they have been hired as a toy demonstrator . the adults-only rule has sparked a whole range of new play products which industry observers say is all part of a trend toward stepping up marketing to " aging children " : people over 40 who play games to relax . and bollywood - india 's most popular cultural export - it seems , is a grown-up 's playground . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : aishwarya rai is one of bollywood 's hottest actresses the country 's trademark hip-gyrating song-and-dance films with its formulaic mix of indian family values , kitsch and sexual titillation have apparently proved an inspiration for several toymakers .
jigsaws and puzzles depicting bollywood scenes are all set to feature large at the toy fair .
parents have been warned to keep their kids from sneaking a peek . " bollywood is a big topic here , especially among our adult customers , " said bettina brogsitter , sales representative for the puzzle-maker lupu . some are going in for a more chaste version of india 's ubiquitous images . one german manufacturer of puzzles aims to entice european women who love all things indian by launching a 1,000-piece puzzle , which would take days to solve , depicting ganesha , the hindu god of wisdom with four arms and the head of a one-tusked elephant . other jigsaws on show in nuremberg are more serene , depicting yoga positions and mandalas - designs symbolizing the universe .

" despite resurgent violence and record opium production levels , the jcmb has been able to oversee quiet but steady progress towards many vital goals , " the statement said . these included the creation of a mechanism to appoint civil servants , increased administrative support to the new national assembly and the introduction of procedures to ensure greater transparency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : königs has been in his current job for a year the un representative to afghanistan , tom königs , said the international community must move forward .

it warns that if residents do not cut water consumption by more than 50 % over the next 20 years , the city will become unsustainable .
the commonwealth scientific and industrial research organisation report also warns that temperatures could rise 5c above the predicted global average .
this would leave the city facing an almost permanent state of drought .
rise in heat-related deaths with its spectacular harbour and beautiful suburban beaches , sydney is often portrayed as one of the most desirable cities to live in .
but this report paints a disturbing picture of how life here could be completely transformed by the year 2070 , if climate change goes unchecked .
it warns of severe droughts nine out of every 10 years , a dramatic rise in the number of bush fires , and freak storm surges which could devastate the coastline .
scientists predict that rainfall will fall by 40 % by 2070 , not only creating a massive water crisis , but producing double the number of bush fires .
heat-related deaths would soar from a current average of 176 a year to 1,300 .
sydney would come to resemble the harsh , dry and inhospitable conditions of remote inland towns .
the government of new south wales , which commissioned the report , has been alarmed by its findings .
the state premier called it a doomsday scenario , but one which the city and country had to confront .
along with america , australia has refused to sign the kyoto protocol , the only two major industrialised nations to do so .

bbc news -pipe- business -pipe- q & a : tata takeover of corus home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk business market data economy companies health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : wednesday , 31 january 2007 , 06:29 gmt e-mail this to a friend printable version q & a : tata takeover of corus indian company tata steel has won the battle to buy its anglo-dutch rival corus .
corus employs about 24,000 people in the uk tata steel 's 608p per share offer , which values corus at £ 5.75bn -lrb- $ 11.3bn -rrb- , beat that of its takeover rival brazilian firm csn .
the deal is the largest indian takeover of a foreign company , and creates the world 's fifth-biggest steel company .
why did tata want corus ?
there is a recognition that for the indian economy to continue its growth , its companies must look to compete on a global scale .
tata is currently just the 56th biggest steel producer globally .
buying corus leapfrogs it to fifth place in the world steel-making rankings .
the takeover also gives it access to corus technology as well as its production sites .
the indian firm says it will be able to make savings on costs , from marketing to buying materials .
why was corus keen to be taken over ?
in order to survive , corus needs to extend its global reach just as much as tata does .
a tie-up with tata gives it , among other things , access to markets in india - one of the fastest-growing economies in the world - as well as access to low-cost materials .
if corus had been bought by csn , the same would have applied regarding brazil .
what impact will this deal have on uk jobs ?
unions have expressed concern over potential job cuts at corus .
of its 47,300 employees worldwide , 24,000 people work in the uk at sites including port talbot , scunthorpe and rotherham .
tata has said there will be no job cuts in the early stages .
what about pensions ?
the corus pension fund has 166,000 members in the uk - including former british steel workers .
it is not badly off at present - with one union official describing it as in surplus and in a " robust " position .
tata has pledged to increase contributions to the british steel fund from 10 % to 12 % by 2009 .
it will also be making a one-off payment of £ 126m to the corus engineering steels pension scheme .
is the purchase of a company from a developing nation a sign of the future ?
there has been growing evidence of a shift in global business power , with foreign investment from developing countries now a major factor in the world economy .
the united nations conference on trade and development -lrb- unctad -rrb- has confirmed the trend - with foreign direct investment from developing countries and transition economies , such as russia and the former soviet union , rising 5 % to $ 133bn -lrb- £ 70bn -rrb- in 2005 .
the tata deal is a further sign that india 's economy is a force to reckoned with .
analysts expect a wave of takeovers by indian firms to ensue around the world .
previous indian deals in europe include the takeover of german group betapharm by pharmaceutical firm dr reddy for $ 570m , as well as energy company sulzon 's acquisition of belgian firm eve holding for $ 526m .
what does the purchase of a big european firm by a small indian steel firm say about uk manufacturing ?
corus chief executive jim leng said that just as british steel and dutch group hoogovens merged in 1999 because they felt they could not simply be national companies , corus now felt it was " no longer sufficient to be european " .
" this is a global industry , " he said .
" we have got to respond with passion , but with commercial passion .
" it 's not about big companies and small companies , it 's a matter of being globally commercial . "

corus employs about 24,000 people in the uk tata steel 's 608p per share offer , which values corus at £ 5.75bn -lrb- $ 11.3bn -rrb- , beat that of its takeover rival brazilian firm csn .
the deal is the largest indian takeover of a foreign company , and creates the world 's fifth-biggest steel company .
why did tata want corus ?
there is a recognition that for the indian economy to continue its growth , its companies must look to compete on a global scale .
tata is currently just the 56th biggest steel producer globally .
buying corus leapfrogs it to fifth place in the world steel-making rankings .
the takeover also gives it access to corus technology as well as its production sites .
the indian firm says it will be able to make savings on costs , from marketing to buying materials .
why was corus keen to be taken over ?
in order to survive , corus needs to extend its global reach just as much as tata does .
a tie-up with tata gives it , among other things , access to markets in india - one of the fastest-growing economies in the world - as well as access to low-cost materials .
if corus had been bought by csn , the same would have applied regarding brazil .
what impact will this deal have on uk jobs ?
unions have expressed concern over potential job cuts at corus .
of its 47,300 employees worldwide , 24,000 people work in the uk at sites including port talbot , scunthorpe and rotherham .
tata has said there will be no job cuts in the early stages .
what about pensions ?
the corus pension fund has 166,000 members in the uk - including former british steel workers .
it is not badly off at present - with one union official describing it as in surplus and in a " robust " position .
tata has pledged to increase contributions to the british steel fund from 10 % to 12 % by 2009 .
it will also be making a one-off payment of £ 126m to the corus engineering steels pension scheme .
is the purchase of a company from a developing nation a sign of the future ?

the mumbles mile , near swansea , was famous for its concentration of seafront bars , but only seven remain .
others are boarded up or have become restaurants and there are now plans to turn one of the largest , the famous bear , which shut last year , into flats .
some locals have welcomed the change , saying the village has now become more of a family resort .
until recently , the mumbles mile consisted of about a dozen pubs stretching along the seafront from the white rose in the village square to the pilot on the approach to mumbles pier .
mumbles mile - pubs still open the white rose the nag 's head the village inn the william hancock the antelope mumbles rugby club salt bar at the george a typical mumbles mile would see visitors having a drink in every pub en route , before ending the evening in one of the resort 's now-closed nightclubs .
author brian davies , who has written about the pubs of mumbles and gower , said that the mumbles mile in its modern form was at its height of popularity in the 1960s , 70s and 80s .
but , he said , the trend for travelling to mumbles had its roots in the temperance movement of the late 19th century .
on sundays pubs were shut across wales , but a loophole in the act allowed travellers who had journeyed more than three miles to have an alcoholic drink .
this would see " many thousands " of people making the five-mile journey from swansea to the many pubs of mumbles .
he said that in the last decade , pub closures had affected the traditional mile .
" it 's quite sad now if you look at a pub like the pilot which is 150 years old and is boarded up , " he said .
" there are still a few decent pubs along there , but it is not the mumbles mile as it once was . "
mumbles councillor joan peters said the village had suffered a reputation as a destination for stag and hen parties and weekends would regularly bring coaches full of revellers .
but she said competing pubs and clubs in swansea - the city 's revamped wind street in particular - had taken much of that trade away .
mumbles mile - pubs closed the pilot the famous bear the prince of wales the mermaid hotel " it 's a double edged sword , " she said .
" while i do feel sorry for the landlords of the pubs that have closed - and there are several others for sale - at the same time it 's made life a great deal more pleasant for people living here .
" if you walk along the front you see many more families and we have some excellent new restaurants . "
but for many it was the pub crawl that put the area on the map - with one group of americans even travelling across the atlantic in 2004 just to visit the pubs .
the nightclub at the pier shut in 2006 to make way for an ice skating rink and one of the village 's two taxi companies closed last month .
as well as stag and hen parties the mumbles mile had proved popular with students from swansea university .
the students ' union said it still publicised the pub crawl to freshers and people moving to the area .
but it said the nightlife in swansea had developed in recent years .
" it is sad to hear mumbles is going through a period of poor trading , " said welfare officer stuart jones .
" it would be great to see it return to a thriving and prosperous village in terms of nightlife . "

mumbles mile - pubs still open the white rose the nag 's head the village inn the william hancock the antelope mumbles rugby club salt bar at the george a typical mumbles mile would see visitors having a drink in every pub en route , before ending the evening in one of the resort 's now-closed nightclubs .
author brian davies , who has written about the pubs of mumbles and gower , said that the mumbles mile in its modern form was at its height of popularity in the 1960s , 70s and 80s .

on sundays pubs were shut across wales , but a loophole in the act allowed travellers who had journeyed more than three miles to have an alcoholic drink .
this would see " many thousands " of people making the five-mile journey from swansea to the many pubs of mumbles .
he said that in the last decade , pub closures had affected the traditional mile .

" there are still a few decent pubs along there , but it is not the mumbles mile as it once was . "
mumbles councillor joan peters said the village had suffered a reputation as a destination for stag and hen parties and weekends would regularly bring coaches full of revellers .

" if you walk along the front you see many more families and we have some excellent new restaurants . "
but for many it was the pub crawl that put the area on the map - with one group of americans even travelling across the atlantic in 2004 just to visit the pubs .
the nightclub at the pier shut in 2006 to make way for an ice skating rink and one of the village 's two taxi companies closed last month .
as well as stag and hen parties the mumbles mile had proved popular with students from swansea university .
the students ' union said it still publicised the pub crawl to freshers and people moving to the area .
but it said the nightlife in swansea had developed in recent years .
" it is sad to hear mumbles is going through a period of poor trading , " said welfare officer stuart jones .

the busts , including claudius , augustus and nero , at powis castle , in welshpool , were bought by the herbert family in italy in the 17th century .
they were taken from the castle 's long gallery in the 1950s amid fears their weight was too much for the wood floor .
the gallery 's floor has been strengthened to take the eight busts .
a team of four national trust " conservators , " a structural engineer , an architect , a team of builders , and a crane are taking three weeks to complete the £ 20,000 project .
the busts each weighing 150kg -lrb- 330lbs -rrb- are being lifted from a courtyard up to the gallery through a window .
floorboards in the long gallery had been reinforced with steel joists and bearer plates to take the extra weight of the busts .
the herbert family , who have lived at powis castle since elizabethan times , bought a total of a dozen busts as souvenirs during their trips to italy .
moving each bust and its pedestal takes about half a day the collecting of such busts became popular in the 18th century for people on a " grand tour " of europe .
italy was one of the main destinations , and marble sculpture was very much sought after by the wealthy art collectors .
margaret gray , the national trust 's house manager at powis castle , said : " the intention is to make this yet another reason to visit powis castle .
" it is not just a matter of restoring a historical scheme , but it will introduce a greater sense of symmetry and rhythm to the gallery , and render it more individual and idiosyncratic given the contrast between the scale of these splendid , heroic-sized sculptures of the caesars and the gallery itself .

they were taken from the castle 's long gallery in the 1950s amid fears their weight was too much for the wood floor .
the gallery 's floor has been strengthened to take the eight busts .
a team of four national trust " conservators , " a structural engineer , an architect , a team of builders , and a crane are taking three weeks to complete the £ 20,000 project .
the busts each weighing 150kg -lrb- 330lbs -rrb- are being lifted from a courtyard up to the gallery through a window .
floorboards in the long gallery had been reinforced with steel joists and bearer plates to take the extra weight of the busts .
the herbert family , who have lived at powis castle since elizabethan times , bought a total of a dozen busts as souvenirs during their trips to italy .
the collecting of such busts became popular in the 18th century for people on a " grand tour " of europe .
italy was one of the main destinations , and marble sculpture was very much sought after by the wealthy art collectors .
margaret gray , the national trust 's house manager at powis castle , said : " the intention is to make this yet another reason to visit powis castle .
" it is not just a matter of restoring a historical scheme , but it will introduce a greater sense of symmetry and rhythm to the gallery , and render it more individual and idiosyncratic given the contrast between the scale of these splendid , heroic-sized sculptures of the caesars and the gallery itself . "
powis castle opens to the public from 17 march .

deputies were discussing the left-wing president 's plan to set up a popular assembly to rewrite the constitution when protesters invaded the building .
police fired teargas at the protesters who wielded sticks and bottles as they briefly managed to get inside congress .
mr correa 's government later expressed regret at his supporters ' actions .
government spokeswoman monica chuji said : " peaceful mobilisations are supported by the government , but we are against violence . "
' kill them ' thousands of mr correa 's supporters had gathered in the capital , quito , to call on the opposition-controlled congress to support the president 's plans for constitutional reform .
as the crowd grew and some fought their way into congress , the authorities decided to evacuate the building .
the new president is promising fundamental change in ecuador " we had to leave the building because the protest was getting out of hand , " federico perez , an opposition congressman , told reuters news agency : " they were yelling : ' kill them all . " '
the demonstrators then clashed with police , who responded with teargas .
congress was considering whether to allow a referendum on forming an assembly to change the constitution , in an effort to curb the powers of traditional parties - one of the president 's major campaign promises .
it would be made up of regional and national representatives who could make laws bypassing congress - a move that , according to opinion polls , enjoys about 70 % popular support .
president correa has accused congress of failing the people and only acting in the interests of the business elite .
his party did not put up any candidates in the last legislative elections , and as a result does not have a single lawmaker .
many in congress say mr correa 's moves are unconstitutional and that he is copying similar radical measures being implemented in venezuela and bolivia .

speaking at the closure , new au chairman john kufuor said several nations had pledged troops - but so far they had only 4,000 out of 8,000 .
the force is due to replace withdrawing ethiopian soldiers , whose intervention swept islamists from power last month .
reports from somalia say there has been a night of unrest in the capital .
unidentified gunmen fired mortars on a military base in the north-east of mogadishu , where ethiopian troops are based , and five heavy explosions were heard in the capital overnight .
no group has said it carried out the attacks , but correspondents say government officials have accused members of the union of islamic court 's militia of masterminding the violence .
last night , the government imposed a curfew on the city of baidoa , in the south-west of the country and is set to also introduce this in mogadishu .
troops at the start of the meeting in addis adaba , 4,000 troops were committed by uganda , nigeria , ghana and malawi .
we appeal to member states to contribute and we are still expecting them to answer au chairman john kufuor mr kufuor , who is president of ghana , said there had been no increase in that number , but he hoped other countries would come forward .
" we appeal to member states to contribute and we are still expecting them to answer , " he said , adding that the deployment would " commence as soon as possible " .
mr kufuor was elected as the new au chairman on monday , bypassing sudan 's president omar al-bashir because of the conflict in darfur .
mr bashir has repeatedly denied backing the janjaweed militias , accused of carrying out widespread atrocities in darfur and says the problems there have been exaggerated .
anarchy fears earlier on tuesday , somalia 's president abdullahi yusuf announced a reconciliation conference - the date still to be confirmed - saying it would give all somalis " a fair chance " to participate in efforts to return to lasting stability .
possible peacekeepers nine battalions proposed - 7,600 troops : uganda : 1,500 troops offered , subject to parliamentary approval malawi : up to 1,000 troops offered nigeria : 1,000 troops offered ghana : reportedly offered troops benin : considering burundi : considering tanzania : considering rwanda : considering south africa : not sending troops he said the conference would include clan and religious leaders but he did not say whether moderates from the ousted union of islamic courts -lrb- uic -rrb- would be invited .
european union development commissioner louis michel said this meant the eu would be able to release 15m euros -lrb- $ 20m -rrb- to fund the peacekeeping force .
the eu , the us and the un have all urged mr yusuf to include moderate islamists in his administration .
the us has offered to provide air support for the peacekeeping force .
in december , thousands of ethiopian soldiers were sent to help the weak somali interim government oust the uic , which controlled much of southern and central somalia for six months .
but ethiopia says it is seeking an early withdrawal from the country and has already begun pulling some of its troops out .
the fear , says the bbc 's adam mynott , is that unless insecurity is contained quickly , somalia will slip back to the anarchic misrule which has prevailed in the country for the past 16 years .
meanwhile , a previously unknown somali group threatened to fight any peacekeepers .
an islamic website posted a message from the " popular resistance movement " that read : " somalia is not a place where you can come to earn a salary - it is a place where you can die . "

unidentified gunmen fired mortars on a military base in the north-east of mogadishu , where ethiopian troops are based , and five heavy explosions were heard in the capital overnight .
no group has said it carried out the attacks , but correspondents say government officials have accused members of the union of islamic court 's militia of masterminding the violence .
last night , the government imposed a curfew on the city of baidoa , in the south-west of the country and is set to also introduce this in mogadishu .
troops at the start of the meeting in addis adaba , 4,000 troops were committed by uganda , nigeria , ghana and malawi .
we appeal to member states to contribute and we are still expecting them to answer au chairman john kufuor mr kufuor , who is president of ghana , said there had been no increase in that number , but he hoped other countries would come forward .
" we appeal to member states to contribute and we are still expecting them to answer , " he said , adding that the deployment would " commence as soon as possible " .
mr kufuor was elected as the new au chairman on monday , bypassing sudan 's president omar al-bashir because of the conflict in darfur .
mr bashir has repeatedly denied backing the janjaweed militias , accused of carrying out widespread atrocities in darfur and says the problems there have been exaggerated .
anarchy fears earlier on tuesday , somalia 's president abdullahi yusuf announced a reconciliation conference - the date still to be confirmed - saying it would give all somalis " a fair chance " to participate in efforts to return to lasting stability .
possible peacekeepers nine battalions proposed - 7,600 troops : uganda : 1,500 troops offered , subject to parliamentary approval malawi : up to 1,000 troops offered nigeria : 1,000 troops offered ghana : reportedly offered troops benin : considering burundi : considering tanzania : considering rwanda : considering south africa : not sending troops he said the conference would include clan and religious leaders but he did not say whether moderates from the ousted union of islamic courts -lrb- uic -rrb- would be invited .
european union development commissioner louis michel said this meant the eu would be able to release 15m euros -lrb- $ 20m -rrb- to fund the peacekeeping force .
the eu , the us and the un have all urged mr yusuf to include moderate islamists in his administration .
the us has offered to provide air support for the peacekeeping force .
in december , thousands of ethiopian soldiers were sent to help the weak somali interim government oust the uic , which controlled much of southern and central somalia for six months .
but ethiopia says it is seeking an early withdrawal from the country and has already begun pulling some of its troops out .
the fear , says the bbc 's adam mynott , is that unless insecurity is contained quickly , somalia will slip back to the anarchic misrule which has prevailed in the country for the past 16 years .
meanwhile , a previously unknown somali group threatened to fight any peacekeepers .
an islamic website posted a message from the " popular resistance movement " that read : " somalia is not a place where you can come to earn a salary - it is a place where you can die . "

bbc news -pipe- south asia -pipe- corus takeover : who is ratan tata ?

by alam srinivas business editor , outlook magazine ratan tata has now emerged as a global player india 's tata steel has won the battle to take over the anglo-dutch steelmaker corus by making a £ 5.75bn -lrb- $ 11.3bn -rrb- bid .
tata chairman ratan tata is not among the forbes ' list of 40 richest indians around the world .
his sprawling business empire is no longer the largest among privately-owned indian groups .
he 's not even considered the most powerful businessman in india .
more importantly , there 's still a lack of clarity about who 'll be his successor after his planned retirement in 2012 .
but he 's one of the most respected corporate chieftains in india .
and when london-based steelmaker corus agreed to his takeover bid in october , he had arrived on the global arena .
aggressive and ambitious that 's a short snapshot of ratan tata , 69 , who controls the $ 22bn tata group , which includes 96 companies manufacturing a range of products from automobiles to watches , steel to fertilisers .
the takeover - the largest by any indian company - marks yet another transformation in the corporate image of ratan tata during his 15 years ' stint as the group chairman .
today , the smooth , suave , and introvert ratan is being seen as an aggressive and ambitious businessman , whose strategic vision has shifted from local to global .
tata defied the critics with the country 's first indigenous car this change started in february 2000 , when tata tea purchased the uk-based tetley for over $ 400m .
in the financial year 2005-06 , the group made 14 acquisitions -lrb- worth nearly $ 1.5bn -rrb- .
in a recent interview to an indian magazine , ratan tata said : " we were very obsessed with ourselves in india .
so , i have felt for some time that we did n't need to be that . "
today , nearly a third of group revenues , some $ 6.7bn , comes from overseas markets .
" i think we 've only just begun .
if we stay in india , we 'll be at a competitive disadvantage , " alan rosling , director , tata sons , which is the group 's holding company , told reuters recently .
this realisation has struck many indian promoters and , after the tata-corus deal , india 's foreign direct investment -lrb- fdi -rrb- outflows will exceed fdi inflows in the first seven months of this financial year .
but it has n't been a smooth ride for ratan tata .
when he became the chairman in 1991 , he was seen as a pushover by the group companies ' ceos , who lorded over their entities .
he had to battle it out with these satraps , who treated their companies as their fiefdoms .
so , the new chairman eased out ceos like rusi mody -lrb- of tata steel -rrb- and ajit kerkar -lrb- indian hotels -rrb- .
revamps in the late 1990s , two of the top firms , tata steel and tata motors went through tumultuous crises and were saddled with huge losses .
tata steel is now one of the lowest-cost producers in the world ratan revamped the operations of tata steel and made it one of the lowest-cost producers in the world .
he made the critics eat their own words , when he launched india 's first indigenous car , indica , which turned around tata motors ' fortunes .
as the group entered the 21st century , ratan tata was obsessed with four critical issues .
the first was to globalise his group 's operations , where he has succeeded to a certain extent .
the second was to safeguard his companies against possible hostile takeovers after the london-based indian , lakshmi mittal , purchased the luxembourg-based arcelor early in 2006 to become the world 's largest steelmaker , and announced his ambitious plans in india .
so , to thwart any threats , tata decided to up his stakes in most of the group companies .
ratan tata 's most important concern , however , was to protect his top lines and bottom lines in the face of ever-increasing competition from domestic and global players .
to achieve this objective , he had no option but to become aggressive , a quality that helped him in other areas .
today , the group , which was seen as risk-averse and cautious , has no qualms about taking on competitors publicly - be it in areas of policy-making , products launched or marketing tactics .
staying on finally , the unmarried ratan tata had to look for a successor .
there were several candidates - including his step-brother , noel - but none of them had an established track record .
some of them did n't have the character to carry on the legacy of a group that 's synonymous with reliability of products , honesty , integrity and public service .
corus employs 24,000 people in the uk when he could n't find a credible contender , tata decided to take the bull by the horns and postponed his retirement .
last year , the retirement age for non-executive directors of tata sons , the holding company , was raised from 70 to 75 years .
thanks to that , tata , a non-executive director , who was to retire in 2007 , got a five-year extension .
now it appears it is time for ratan tata to establish himself on the global map .
the corus buyout makes tata steel the world 's fifth largest steelmaker .
but it needs to play the catch-up game with mittal .
tata has to do the same with mukesh ambani , the promoter of india 's largest private sector firm , reliance industries , which aims to be among the top 100 in the fortune 500 list .
ratan tata has a long way to go before he can bid farewell -lrb- or " tata " to use the hindi word -rrb- to the world of work .

by alam srinivas business editor , outlook magazine ratan tata has now emerged as a global player india 's tata steel has won the battle to take over the anglo-dutch steelmaker corus by making a £ 5.75bn -lrb- $ 11.3bn -rrb- bid .
tata chairman ratan tata is not among the forbes ' list of 40 richest indians around the world .
his sprawling business empire is no longer the largest among privately-owned indian groups .
he 's not even considered the most powerful businessman in india .
more importantly , there 's still a lack of clarity about who 'll be his successor after his planned retirement in 2012 .
but he 's one of the most respected corporate chieftains in india .
and when london-based steelmaker corus agreed to his takeover bid in october , he had arrived on the global arena .
aggressive and ambitious that 's a short snapshot of ratan tata , 69 , who controls the $ 22bn tata group , which includes 96 companies manufacturing a range of products from automobiles to watches , steel to fertilisers .
the takeover - the largest by any indian company - marks yet another transformation in the corporate image of ratan tata during his 15 years ' stint as the group chairman .
today , the smooth , suave , and introvert ratan is being seen as an aggressive and ambitious businessman , whose strategic vision has shifted from local to global .
tata defied the critics with the country 's first indigenous car this change started in february 2000 , when tata tea purchased the uk-based tetley for over $ 400m .
in the financial year 2005-06 , the group made 14 acquisitions -lrb- worth nearly $ 1.5bn -rrb- .
in a recent interview to an indian magazine , ratan tata said : " we were very obsessed with ourselves in india .
so , i have felt for some time that we did n't need to be that . "
today , nearly a third of group revenues , some $ 6.7bn , comes from overseas markets .
" i think we 've only just begun .
if we stay in india , we 'll be at a competitive disadvantage , " alan rosling , director , tata sons , which is the group 's holding company , told reuters recently .
this realisation has struck many indian promoters and , after the tata-corus deal , india 's foreign direct investment -lrb- fdi -rrb- outflows will exceed fdi inflows in the first seven months of this financial year .
but it has n't been a smooth ride for ratan tata .
when he became the chairman in 1991 , he was seen as a pushover by the group companies ' ceos , who lorded over their entities .
he had to battle it out with these satraps , who treated their companies as their fiefdoms .
so , the new chairman eased out ceos like rusi mody -lrb- of tata steel -rrb- and ajit kerkar -lrb- indian hotels -rrb- .
revamps in the late 1990s , two of the top firms , tata steel and tata motors went through tumultuous crises and were saddled with huge losses .
tata steel is now one of the lowest-cost producers in the world ratan revamped the operations of tata steel and made it one of the lowest-cost producers in the world .
he made the critics eat their own words , when he launched india 's first indigenous car , indica , which turned around tata motors ' fortunes .
as the group entered the 21st century , ratan tata was obsessed with four critical issues .
the first was to globalise his group 's operations , where he has succeeded to a certain extent .
the second was to safeguard his companies against possible hostile takeovers after the london-based indian , lakshmi mittal , purchased the luxembourg-based arcelor early in 2006 to become the world 's largest steelmaker , and announced his ambitious plans in india .
so , to thwart any threats , tata decided to up his stakes in most of the group companies .
ratan tata 's most important concern , however , was to protect his top lines and bottom lines in the face of ever-increasing competition from domestic and global players .
to achieve this objective , he had no option but to become aggressive , a quality that helped him in other areas .
today , the group , which was seen as risk-averse and cautious , has no qualms about taking on competitors publicly - be it in areas of policy-making , products launched or marketing tactics .
staying on finally , the unmarried ratan tata had to look for a successor .
there were several candidates - including his step-brother , noel - but none of them had an established track record .
some of them did n't have the character to carry on the legacy of a group that 's synonymous with reliability of products , honesty , integrity and public service .
corus employs 24,000 people in the uk when he could n't find a credible contender , tata decided to take the bull by the horns and postponed his retirement .
last year , the retirement age for non-executive directors of tata sons , the holding company , was raised from 70 to 75 years .
thanks to that , tata , a non-executive director , who was to retire in 2007 , got a five-year extension .
now it appears it is time for ratan tata to establish himself on the global map .
the corus buyout makes tata steel the world 's fifth largest steelmaker .
but it needs to play the catch-up game with mittal .
tata has to do the same with mukesh ambani , the promoter of india 's largest private sector firm , reliance industries , which aims to be among the top 100 in the fortune 500 list .
ratan tata has a long way to go before he can bid farewell -lrb- or " tata " to use the hindi word -rrb- to the world of work .

bbc news -pipe- south asia -pipe- corus takeover : who is ratan tata ?
bbc news / south asia graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- 08:32 gmt , wednesday , 31 january 2007 corus takeover : who is ratan tata ?
by alam srinivas business editor , outlook magazine india 's tata steel has won the battle to take over the anglo-dutch steelmaker corus by making a £ 5.75bn -lrb- $ 11.3bn -rrb- bid .
tata chairman ratan tata is not among the forbes ' list of 40 richest indians around the world .
his sprawling business empire is no longer the largest among privately-owned indian groups .
he 's not even considered the most powerful businessman in india .
more importantly , there 's still a lack of clarity about who 'll be his successor after his planned retirement in 2012 .
but he 's one of the most respected corporate chieftains in india .
and when london-based steelmaker corus agreed to his takeover bid in october , he had arrived on the global arena .
aggressive and ambitious that 's a short snapshot of ratan tata , 69 , who controls the $ 22bn tata group , which includes 96 companies manufacturing a range of products from automobiles to watches , steel to fertilisers .
the takeover - the largest by any indian company - marks yet another transformation in the corporate image of ratan tata during his 15 years ' stint as the group chairman .
today , the smooth , suave , and introvert ratan is being seen as an aggressive and ambitious businessman , whose strategic vision has shifted from local to global .
this change started in february 2000 , when tata tea purchased the uk-based tetley for over $ 400m .
in the financial year 2005-06 , the group made 14 acquisitions -lrb- worth nearly $ 1.5bn -rrb- .
in a recent interview to an indian magazine , ratan tata said : " we were very obsessed with ourselves in india .
so , i have felt for some time that we did n't need to be that . "
today , nearly a third of group revenues , some $ 6.7bn , comes from overseas markets .
" i think we 've only just begun .
if we stay in india , we 'll be at a competitive disadvantage , " alan rosling , director , tata sons , which is the group 's holding company , told reuters recently .
this realisation has struck many indian promoters and , after the tata-corus deal , india 's foreign direct investment -lrb- fdi -rrb- outflows will exceed fdi inflows in the first seven months of this financial year .
but it has n't been a smooth ride for ratan tata .
when he became the chairman in 1991 , he was seen as a pushover by the group companies ' ceos , who lorded over their entities .
he had to battle it out with these satraps , who treated their companies as their fiefdoms .
so , the new chairman eased out ceos like rusi mody -lrb- of tata steel -rrb- and ajit kerkar -lrb- indian hotels -rrb- .
revamps in the late 1990s , two of the top firms , tata steel and tata motors went through tumultuous crises and were saddled with huge losses .
ratan revamped the operations of tata steel and made it one of the lowest-cost producers in the world .
he made the critics eat their own words , when he launched india 's first indigenous car , indica , which turned around tata motors ' fortunes .
as the group entered the 21st century , ratan tata was obsessed with four critical issues .
the first was to globalise his group 's operations , where he has succeeded to a certain extent .
the second was to safeguard his companies against possible hostile takeovers after the london-based indian , lakshmi mittal , purchased the luxembourg-based arcelor early in 2006 to become the world 's largest steelmaker , and announced his ambitious plans in india .
so , to thwart any threats , tata decided to up his stakes in most of the group companies .
ratan tata 's most important concern , however , was to protect his top lines and bottom lines in the face of ever-increasing competition from domestic and global players .
to achieve this objective , he had no option but to become aggressive , a quality that helped him in other areas .
today , the group , which was seen as risk-averse and cautious , has no qualms about taking on competitors publicly - be it in areas of policy-making , products launched or marketing tactics .
staying on finally , the unmarried ratan tata had to look for a successor .
there were several candidates - including his step-brother , noel - but none of them had an established track record .
some of them did n't have the character to carry on the legacy of a group that 's synonymous with reliability of products , honesty , integrity and public service .
when he could n't find a credible contender , tata decided to take the bull by the horns and postponed his retirement .
last year , the retirement age for non-executive directors of tata sons , the holding company , was raised from 70 to 75 years .
thanks to that , tata , a non-executive director , who was to retire in 2007 , got a five-year extension .
now it appears it is time for ratan tata to establish himself on the global map .
the corus buyout makes tata steel the world 's fifth largest steelmaker .
but it needs to play the catch-up game with mittal .
tata has to do the same with mukesh ambani , the promoter of india 's largest private sector firm , reliance industries , which aims to be among the top 100 in the fortune 500 list .
ratan tata has a long way to go before he can bid farewell -lrb- or " tata " to use the hindi word -rrb- to the world of work .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- northern ireland -pipe- plan aims to raise wwii u-boat bbc news / northern ireland graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- uk contents : england -pipe- northern ireland -pipe- scotland -pipe- wales -pipe- uk politics -pipe- education -pipe- magazine wednesday , 31 january 2007 , 08:41 gmt plan aims to raise wwii u-boat there is an ambitious plan to raise a u-boat from the seabed off county donegal .
if it gets the go-ahead the aim is to house the boat in a museum where people can get a glimpse of one of the iconic vessels from wwii .
the british , irish and german authorities could all be asked to help out with the educational project .
a number of u-boats lie 70 metres deep off the coast of donegal in the republic of ireland .
even in the murky depths the outline of the u-boat is quite clear , with divers saying the aerials and periscopes are still intact .
it is estimated there are about 150 of them lying off malin head - all vivid reminders of the battle of the atlantic during wwii .
one of the divers who has been examining the wrecks of hitler 's wolf pack , geoff millar , said he had been surprised they were in such good condition .
" when we first started diving them we expected to see an old rusty stain lying on the bottom , but it 's amazing the condition they 're in , " he said .
" they 're the ones that have n't been shelled or used for target practice .
" there 's more ocean going liners lying off malin head than anywhere else in the world - 99 % of them sunk by u-boats over the two wars . "
the u-boats were the thing that frightened winston churchill most during the second world war " richard doherty military historian " also there 's a ship out there called the empire heritage - it has just rows and rows of sherman tanks on it - there 's a lot of stuff there that should be lifted and raised and put forward for a museum . "
the u-boats were used by the germans to attack the allies in the north atlantic , and were an important part of hitler 's war strategy .
but that eventually floundered and about 60 of the vessels were surrendered at lisahally docks in londonderry in 1945 .
many were later taken to sea and decommissioned .
military historian richard doherty said the losses they cause had posed a real threat to the allied war effort .
" the u-boats were the thing that frightened winston churchill most during the second world war , " he said .
" they were the greatest threat to the survival of britain and therefore the building up of the alliance bases in britain for the invasion of europe .
" the u-boats were the weapon with which germany could have won the war had adolf hitler been a sailor and had more appreciation of maritime strategy . "
so far only two u-boats have been brought up from the seabed and preserved for public display in europe - one in birkenhead in england and another in germany .
it would be a very expensive project , but those behind the project believe it would be worth it to preserve more of those remnants of the battle of the atlantic .
