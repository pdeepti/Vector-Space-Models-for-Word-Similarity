" baghad comes to london , " was the verdict of some commentators who suspect members of al qaeda to be behind the discovery of two foiled car bombs in the british capital on friday .
as long as the perpetrators remain unidentified , speculation will continue to swirl .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp what we know for sure is that britain is in the crosshairs of terrorist groups .
whether it 's britain 's involvement in driving the iraq war , its military presence there , salman rushdie 's knighthood , tony blair 's appointment as the new envoy of the mideast quartet or just simply britain 's colonial past in wide swathes of the muslim world , the united kingdom offers plenty of motives for terrorism .
not to mention the fact that britain is home to an army of discontented muslims from whose ranks the train bombers from two years ago were recruited .
there are indications that the car bombs did n't have an internal british motive but rather that the " network " -lrb- al qaeda -rrb- planned to strike with local help , as always .
the construction of the bombs points towards that theory , and there was also apparently quite a clear warning on the internet that london would be the target of an attack .
the date too was no coincidence - just hours after a change in britain 's leadership from tony blair to gordon brown and days before the second anniversary of the london bombings .
thanks to a coincidence and the prudence of the british , the tragedy was averted .
the exhaustive cctv surveillance in london will also help in getting leads on the perpetrators .
it 's a system that 's strongly opposed by many in germany as if there was no consideration in weighing the protection of privacy against protecting the general public against terrorist attacks .
you could take a page from britain 's book .
video surveillance does not prevent violent acts , but it does deter them and eases the hunt for perpetrators .
at the same time there is no panic-mongering in britain as was the case in germany recently when different official departments warned of a heightened danger of terrorism .
we all live in an age of heightened danger : whether it 's in london , berlin , paris or amsterdam .
as long as crazed people do n't live out their fanatical fantasies , we ca n't foresee their actions .
we can only counter them by remaining alert .
even though victims ca n't be avoided sometimes , if we do n't allow ourselves to be terrorized then the terrorists have already lost the " first round . "
remaining vigilant does n't just mean keeping your nerve and gritting your teeth .
it also means stopping exaggerated preventive measures .
politicians of all stripes - even in germany - tend to propagate complete surveillance to counter terrorism .
video surveillance is necessary , but if we go further and place limits on our free society because of fear of violence then we would be capitulating to the terrorists .

" the sec list , published on the commission 's website under the misleading title " state sponsors of terrorism , " names a number of other european concerns as well as american companies who have dealings with cuba , iran , north korea , sudan and syria .

reacting to the blacklist , siemens spokesperson wolfram trost told germany 's handelsblatt financial daily that while there would be no official comment on the company 's inclusion in the sec report , siemens ' connections with the named states were " low level . "

german finance minister peer steinbrück said the economic boom will allow the federal government to stop accumulating new debt by 2011 .
critics say this is n't ambitious enough . on wednesday , steinbrück , a social democrat , is expected to present his budget proposal for 2008 to his cabinet colleagues for approval before the document heads to parliament .
while the financial plan for the coming year will still include new debt of about 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.5 billion -rrb- , steinbrück said that this is already 40 percent less than originally expected .
the finance minister expects to spend 283.2 billion euros in 2008 , up 12.7 billion euros compared to 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrück is happy about germany 's budgetary outlook by 2011 , germany will be able to do without borrowing more money , according to steinbrück .
he said he plans to use and budget surplus to reduce the country 's debt of 900 billion euros .
currently , germany pays about 40 billion euros per year in interest on its debt .
an increase in interest rates will cost the country an additional 2.8 billion euros in 2008 .
too cautious ?
budget experts of germany 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which forms a grand coalition with steinbrück 's social democratic party , said that the finance minister 's proposals did n't go far enough .
steffen kampeter , the budget expert for the cdu in parliament , said that germany should already be able to borrow significantly less money in 2007 than expected .
he also criticized that steinbrück 's plan aimed to reduce new debt via tax revenue rather than cutting costs .

german finance minister peer steinbrück said the economic boom will allow the federal government to stop accumulating new debt by 2011 .
critics say this is n't ambitious enough . on wednesday , steinbrück , a social democrat , is expected to present his budget proposal for 2008 to his cabinet colleagues for approval before the document heads to parliament .
while the financial plan for the coming year will still include new debt of about 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.5 billion -rrb- , steinbrück said that this is already 40 percent less than originally expected .
the finance minister expects to spend 283.2 billion euros in 2008 , up 12.7 billion euros compared to 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrück is happy about germany 's budgetary outlook by 2011 , germany will be able to do without borrowing more money , according to steinbrück .
he said he plans to use and budget surplus to reduce the country 's debt of 900 billion euros .
currently , germany pays about 40 billion euros per year in interest on its debt .
an increase in interest rates will cost the country an additional 2.8 billion euros in 2008 .
too cautious ?
budget experts of germany 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which forms a grand coalition with steinbrück 's social democratic party , said that the finance minister 's proposals did n't go far enough .
steffen kampeter , the budget expert for the cdu in parliament , said that germany should already be able to borrow significantly less money in 2007 than expected .
he also criticized that steinbrück 's plan aimed to reduce new debt via tax revenue rather than cutting costs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an early balance budget would look good for steinbrück on election day opposition members also attacked steinbrück for not doing enough to save money and said that a balanced budget by 2011 was not ambitious enough .
" for him , the best would be to reach this all of a sudden in 2009 , " otto fricke , the chairman of the parliament 's budget committee , told swr public radio .
" that 's when we 'll have the next election campaign at the latest . "

but demands to cut co2 emissions may see a reversal .
the topic is likely to light up tuesday 's energy summit . german chancellor angela merkel hosts the third federal energy summit in berlin on tuesday with a huge question mark hanging over the source of germany 's future energy supplies and the environmental impact of those sources currently available .
merkel will discuss germany 's future energy needs and how best to conserve energy with business and political leaders from around the country .
however , while the summit is likely to address such issues as reducing co2 output by 40 percent before 2020 , the upgrading of renewable source technology such as solar , wind and biomass energy and the economic impact of the new technology , the main discussion is likely to be on the highly divisive topic of nuclear power .
current german legislation requires all 17 of germany 's existing nuclear power plants to close by 2021 but , using the argument of nuclear power 's ability to help reduce carbon-dioxide emissions , plant operators and center-right politicians have been calling for a reprieve .
however , safety issues surrounding nuclear power have weakened this position , especially after two nuclear power stations went offline last week .
the transformer at the krümmel power station , east of the port city of hamburg , was destroyed by fire last thursday , two hours after a short-circuit had knocked out another nuclear site at brunsbüttel on the far side of the city .
while the brunsbüttel power station was back in service the next day , the krümmel station remained closed pending an investigation .
calls for extended lifespan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch leads cdu voices advocating an extension despite the incidents , a number of politicians from merkel 's christian democratic union party -lrb- cdu -rrb- called on monday for an extension to the nuclear power grid 's lifespan .
powerful hessen state premier roland koch , merkel 's second-in-command in the cdu , told zdf television that the ruling coalition government could still decide on lengthening the lifespan of the power stations which , he claimed , would be the most inexpensive way of protecting germany 's energy supply and reducing co2 output .
both cdu energy expert katherina reiche and the lower saxony prime minister christian wulff agreed with koch 's views in separate statements .
when faced with the question of plant security , koch suggested new power stations could take the place of older plants which are more susceptible to malfunctions over time . " the coalition has a lot of freedom to make this decision , " koch added .
social democrats support decommission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel warns about relying on aging plants environment minister sigmar gabriel of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the cdu 's coalition partner in the federal government , does n't agree .
gabriel is against any extension of nuclear 's lifespan and warned that any attempt to get more use out of aging power plants could be catastrophic . " the longer a power station operates , the more susceptible it is to malfunctions , " he said .
the gradual shutdown of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder and his coalition partners at the time , the greens .
however , in the light of rising energy prices and germany 's dependency on foreign energy , mainly from russia , chancellor merkel wants a broader energy mix .
merkel believes germany should continue to use the edge in nuclear technology it has acquired over the years and members of the cdu are pushing for the chancellor to take advantage of clauses in the " coalition contract " on the shutdown of nuclear power to extend its lifespan to reverse the decision .
effective , yet vilified power source bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel do a u-turn over nuclear power ?
merkel is expected to temper the unease over a potential u-turn on nuclear power at the energy summit of tuesday by advocating a 30 percent increase in renewable energy use which would reduce co2 output by 41 percent .
however , a reprieve for nuclear power would lead to a 45 percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions which would make it the most attractive of the scenarios to reach the desired reduction in co2 output by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but demands to cut co2 emissions may see a reversal .
the topic is likely to light up tuesday 's energy summit . german chancellor angela merkel hosts the third federal energy summit in berlin on tuesday with a huge question mark hanging over the source of germany 's future energy supplies and the environmental impact of those sources currently available .
merkel will discuss germany 's future energy needs and how best to conserve energy with business and political leaders from around the country .
however , while the summit is likely to address such issues as reducing co2 output by 40 percent before 2020 , the upgrading of renewable source technology such as solar , wind and biomass energy and the economic impact of the new technology , the main discussion is likely to be on the highly divisive topic of nuclear power .
current german legislation requires all 17 of germany 's existing nuclear power plants to close by 2021 but , using the argument of nuclear power 's ability to help reduce carbon-dioxide emissions , plant operators and center-right politicians have been calling for a reprieve .
however , safety issues surrounding nuclear power have weakened this position , especially after two nuclear power stations went offline last week .
the transformer at the krümmel power station , east of the port city of hamburg , was destroyed by fire last thursday , two hours after a short-circuit had knocked out another nuclear site at brunsbüttel on the far side of the city .
while the brunsbüttel power station was back in service the next day , the krümmel station remained closed pending an investigation .
calls for extended lifespan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch leads cdu voices advocating an extension despite the incidents , a number of politicians from merkel 's christian democratic union party -lrb- cdu -rrb- called on monday for an extension to the nuclear power grid 's lifespan .
powerful hessen state premier roland koch , merkel 's second-in-command in the cdu , told zdf television that the ruling coalition government could still decide on lengthening the lifespan of the power stations which , he claimed , would be the most inexpensive way of protecting germany 's energy supply and reducing co2 output .
both cdu energy expert katherina reiche and the lower saxony prime minister christian wulff agreed with koch 's views in separate statements .
when faced with the question of plant security , koch suggested new power stations could take the place of older plants which are more susceptible to malfunctions over time . " the coalition has a lot of freedom to make this decision , " koch added .
social democrats support decommission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel warns about relying on aging plants environment minister sigmar gabriel of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the cdu 's coalition partner in the federal government , does n't agree .
gabriel is against any extension of nuclear 's lifespan and warned that any attempt to get more use out of aging power plants could be catastrophic . " the longer a power station operates , the more susceptible it is to malfunctions , " he said .
the gradual shutdown of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder and his coalition partners at the time , the greens .
however , in the light of rising energy prices and germany 's dependency on foreign energy , mainly from russia , chancellor merkel wants a broader energy mix .
merkel believes germany should continue to use the edge in nuclear technology it has acquired over the years and members of the cdu are pushing for the chancellor to take advantage of clauses in the " coalition contract " on the shutdown of nuclear power to extend its lifespan to reverse the decision .
effective , yet vilified power source bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel do a u-turn over nuclear power ?
merkel is expected to temper the unease over a potential u-turn on nuclear power at the energy summit of tuesday by advocating a 30 percent increase in renewable energy use which would reduce co2 output by 41 percent .
however , a reprieve for nuclear power would lead to a 45 percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions which would make it the most attractive of the scenarios to reach the desired reduction in co2 output by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we have to think in a completely different context .

she said the attacks in new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 , which were planned by students living in germany , had led to " a sea change with consequences . "

coalition divided over deployment issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is bound by its postwar mandates conservatives have stepped up calls since the september 11 attacks for the government to have more leeway to send troops to defend against a specific threat to the civilian population .
but the social democrats , partners in germany 's left-right ruling coalition , oppose the move as a violation of the country 's strict postwar separation of the mandates of its security services .
the debate in germany has been revived by the series of thwarted terror attacks in britain .
an interior ministry spokesman said monday that german and british authorities had stepped up their cooperation in recent days .
but he added that there was no indication germany faced a specific threat of imminent attacks .

barroso added that eu legislation on storing data had helped british authorities monitor suspect terrorists before the planned attacks . " the fact we had adopted a directive , according to which data could be stored for longer , played an important role in enabling british police to monitor a number of suspect networks , " he said .

she said that police searches had been carried out at 19 locations across the country .
" our top priority has to be the success of the investigation , " smith told members of parliament in the lower house of commons .
" terrorists are criminals whose victims come from all walks of life , " she said , adding : " it is through our unity that the terrorists will eventually be defeated . "

the racks are spaced far apart so people can maneuver between them easily .
the saleswomen are relaxed , friendly and do n't pressure anyone to buy . " when you look at stores now , they are n't at all set up for older people , " said putzke .
" the whole market needs to adjust , though , given the realities we 're seeing in germany . " gray horizons the country is looking at a grayer future , age-wise .
while about one in five germans is over the age of 60 today , demographic studies show that by 2050 , more than one in three will be in the golden years . already today , the senior consumer group has purchasing power that retailers should n't ignore .
according to the german institute of economic research , it is estimated at around 316 billion euros -lrb- $ 429 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's an array of products geared toward older people " but the big retail players seem to be asleep at the wheel , " said matthias riepen , who is taking over the deliga store and planning a relaunch in september .
" strangely , they do n't seem to be looking at the senior market very much right now although numerous studies have shown it 's the market of the future . " there have been some exceptions , such as the so-called " generation supermarkets " that have opened up that shops featuring wider aisles , large-print price tags , magnifying glasses on shelves and motorized shopping baskets with seats attached . the deliga store has not been without its problems .
opened in 2005 , it filed for insolvency two weeks ago .
not because of the market , said riepen , but because of mistakes in marketing and day-to-day operations .
for his relaunch in september , riepen plans on giving it a more modern name , updating its product assortment , and embarking on a franchising plan that , he hopes , will see up to three new stores opening in germany next year . " it 's a concept that has n't been tried yet with seniors , giving them everything they want under one roof , " he said . attractive for every sector andreas reidl , director of the nuremberg-based agency for generation marketing , a consulting firm specializing on the senior market , said that the silver-haired market for almost every sector is an attractive one , be it tourism , health products , financial services or food . " the winners will be the ones who are successful in reaching this older clientele , " he said . karin bernau , 66 , who had come with the senior bus group and ended up buying two blouses , a portable chair and a bootjack for her husband , was sold on the concept of a shop designed especially for her age group . " i think we need more stores like this , " she said .
" it 's the older people who have the buying power .
they 've got their pensions and can afford to spend a little . " he husband , werner , 72 , also had good words for the shop , but was rather lukewarm on the mature fashion show . " it was fine , " he said .

inside , the women , and one man , are getting ready for the runway .
they 're tying on colorful scarves , adjusting bright skirts and slipping on not stilettos but sensible shoes - a first sign that this is no ordinary fashion show they 're readying for . the arrivals file in and sit at tables laid out with coffee and cake .
a salesperson takes a microphone and introduces the first model , frau schütz , who comes out in a linen jacket and skirt . she 's no beanpole-thin waif . frau schütz is well over 50 and has a figure that might be called rubenesque . but that 's fine with the members of this group , aged from their early 60s to mid 80s .
fickle trends and size zero clothes are n't exactly what they 're in the market for . " older people also want something chic and stylish , and they are n't going to fit into all these super-mini , extra-extra-small things they find in most fashionable stores , " said christa putzke , the head saleswoman at the deliga senior store .
" we offer them clothes that fit this stage of their lives . " products for the golden years besides the clothes on display on the 800 square meters -lrb- 8,611 sq. ft . -rrb- of floor space , the store has a whole range of goods that meet the needs of the over-60 set .
there are talking alarm clocks and telephones with large buttons that make it easier to use for people with poor eyesight and arthritic hands .
there are amplifiers for radios and large magnifying screens for tvs . bildunterschrift : 800 square meters of space a rack with support hose sits next to various kinds of underwear for people with incontinence , while the shoe section features non-slip soles , soft leather and insoles that make walking easier on tired feet . at deliga , everything is on one level ; no stairs block access for those in wheelchairs or using walkers .
the racks are spaced far apart so people can maneuver between them easily .
the saleswomen are relaxed , friendly and do n't pressure anyone to buy . " when you look at stores now , they are n't at all set up for older people , " said putzke .
" the whole market needs to adjust , though , given the realities we 're seeing in germany . " gray horizons the country is looking at a grayer future , age-wise .
while about one in five germans is over the age of 60 today , demographic studies show that by 2050 , more than one in three will be in the golden years . already today , the senior consumer group has purchasing power that retailers should n't ignore .
according to the german institute of economic research , it is estimated at around 316 billion euros -lrb- $ 429 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's an array of products geared toward older people " but the big retail players seem to be asleep at the wheel , " said matthias riepen , who is taking over the deliga store and planning a relaunch in september .
" strangely , they do n't seem to be looking at the senior market very much right now although numerous studies have shown it 's the market of the future . " there have been some exceptions , such as the so-called " generation supermarkets " that have opened up that shops featuring wider aisles , large-print price tags , magnifying glasses on shelves and motorized shopping baskets with seats attached . the deliga store has not been without its problems .
opened in 2005 , it filed for insolvency two weeks ago .
not because of the market , said riepen , but because of mistakes in marketing and day-to-day operations .
for his relaunch in september , riepen plans on giving it a more modern name , updating its product assortment , and embarking on a franchising plan that , he hopes , will see up to three new stores opening in germany next year . " it 's a concept that has n't been tried yet with seniors , giving them everything they want under one roof , " he said . attractive for every sector andreas reidl , director of the nuremberg-based agency for generation marketing , a consulting firm specializing on the senior market , said that the silver-haired market for almost every sector is an attractive one , be it tourism , health products , financial services or food . " the winners will be the ones who are successful in reaching this older clientele , " he said . karin bernau , 66 , who had come with the senior bus group and ended up buying two blouses , a portable chair and a bootjack for her husband , was sold on the concept of a shop designed especially for her age group . " i think we need more stores like this , " she said .
" it 's the older people who have the buying power .
they 've got their pensions and can afford to spend a little . " he husband , werner , 72 , also had good words for the shop , but was rather lukewarm on the mature fashion show . " it was fine , " he said .
" of course , women who are a little thinner are more fun to look at , huh ? " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" baghad comes to london , " was the verdict of some commentators who suspect members of al qaeda to be behind the discovery of two foiled car bombs in the british capital on friday .
as long as the perpetrators remain unidentified , speculation will continue to swirl .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp what we know for sure is that britain is in the crosshairs of terrorist groups .
whether it 's britain 's involvement in driving the iraq war , its military presence there , salman rushdie 's knighthood , tony blair 's appointment as the new envoy of the mideast quartet or just simply britain 's colonial past in wide swathes of the muslim world , the united kingdom offers plenty of motives for terrorism .
not to mention the fact that britain is home to an army of discontented muslims from whose ranks the train bombers from two years ago were recruited .
there are indications that the car bombs did n't have an internal british motive but rather that the " network " -lrb- al qaeda -rrb- planned to strike with local help , as always .
the construction of the bombs points towards that theory , and there was also apparently quite a clear warning on the internet that london would be the target of an attack .
the date too was no coincidence - just hours after a change in britain 's leadership from tony blair to gordon brown and days before the second anniversary of the london bombings .
thanks to a coincidence and the prudence of the british , the tragedy was averted .
the exhaustive cctv surveillance in london will also help in getting leads on the perpetrators .
it 's a system that 's strongly opposed by many in germany as if there was no consideration in weighing the protection of privacy against protecting the general public against terrorist attacks .
you could take a page from britain 's book .
video surveillance does not prevent violent acts , but it does deter them and eases the hunt for perpetrators .
at the same time there is no panic-mongering in britain as was the case in germany recently when different official departments warned of a heightened danger of terrorism .
we all live in an age of heightened danger : whether it 's in london , berlin , paris or amsterdam .
as long as crazed people do n't live out their fanatical fantasies , we ca n't foresee their actions .
we can only counter them by remaining alert .
even though victims ca n't be avoided sometimes , if we do n't allow ourselves to be terrorized then the terrorists have already lost the " first round . "
remaining vigilant does n't just mean keeping your nerve and gritting your teeth .
it also means stopping exaggerated preventive measures .
politicians of all stripes - even in germany - tend to propagate complete surveillance to counter terrorism .
video surveillance is necessary , but if we go further and place limits on our free society because of fear of violence then we would be capitulating to the terrorists .

" the government 's response to the bombers should be proportionate to the threat faced , not to the public outrage .
there is always a temptation for ministers to look tough by awarding themselves new powers instead of using the powers already at their disposal .

it described the pair as " a new prime minister and a rookie home secretary both facing a huge test within hours of taking office and both , it must be said , commendably keeping their nerve .
this time ... there has been no political grandstanding , no promises of ' tough ' new measures .

while blair had the instinct to comfort people after dramatic events such as the death of princess diana or the terror attacks in new york and london , brown appeared more like a us marshal , who is pressuring people into becoming auxiliary sheriffs .

elsewhere in europe , premier gordon brown 's handling of the situation got mixed reviews . " the immediate aftermath of a terrorist atrocity is the worst possible time to legislate , " the right-wing daily telegraph declared in its editorial .
" the government 's response to the bombers should be proportionate to the threat faced , not to the public outrage .
there is always a temptation for ministers to look tough by awarding themselves new powers instead of using the powers already at their disposal . " the independent , a left-wing paper , took a similar line , declaring in its editorial that it " is vital that the prime minister does not rush through new repressive anti-terror laws ... it is vital that our political leaders pause for thought . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown steped out of the way to let police investigate , the daily mail said the daily mail , a right-wing paper that is often critical of the governing labour party , offered tentative praise for new prime minister gordon brown , who only took over from tony blair on wednesday , and new home secretary jacqui smith .
it described the pair as " a new prime minister and a rookie home secretary both facing a huge test within hours of taking office and both , it must be said , commendably keeping their nerve .
this time ... there has been no political grandstanding , no promises of ' tough ' new measures .
instead , gordon brown and jacqui smith concentrate on reassuring the public and letting police and -lrb- domestic intelligence service -rrb- mi5 get on with the job .

" the old separation of domestic security and security abroad is yesterday 's news , " merkel said at the headquarters of her conservative christian democrats during a presentation of their draft party platform .
" we have to think in a completely different context .
only then will freedom and security be kept in balance in light of this new threat . "
she said the attacks in new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 , which were planned by students living in germany , had led to " a sea change with consequences . "
under germany 's basic law adopted after the nazi era , the military may only be deployed in the event of a disaster or to provide medical back-up during major public events .
coalition divided over deployment issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is bound by its postwar mandates conservatives have stepped up calls since the september 11 attacks for the government to have more leeway to send troops to defend against a specific threat to the civilian population .
but the social democrats , partners in germany 's left-right ruling coalition , oppose the move as a violation of the country 's strict postwar separation of the mandates of its security services .
the debate in germany has been revived by the series of thwarted terror attacks in britain .
an interior ministry spokesman said monday that german and british authorities had stepped up their cooperation in recent days .
but he added that there was no indication germany faced a specific threat of imminent attacks .
german authorities announced june 22 they had boosted security measures in response to a greater threat of attacks at home and abroad due to the country 's military involvement in afghanistan .
eu chief urges more collaboration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso talked of a need for the eu to work together in the wake of the failed attacks , european commission president jose manuel barroso said that the european union should step up joint action against terrorist threats .
" the recent attacks , fortunately foiled , in london and glasgow have demonstrated the need for us to work together and complete our agenda in the fight against terrorism , " barroso told a news conference on monday .
barroso added that eu legislation on storing data had helped british authorities monitor suspect terrorists before the planned attacks . " the fact we had adopted a directive , according to which data could be stored for longer , played an important role in enabling british police to monitor a number of suspect networks , " he said .
" terrorists do not respect frontiers ; consequently it makes no sense to fight terrorism purely through inter-governmental mechanisms .
we need supranational instruments if we are to be effective against terrorism . "
britain will not bend , says home secretary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smith had a baptism of fire as home secretary meanwhile , british home secretary jacqui smith said that britain will not be intimidated by terrorism in a statement to parliament monday on the weekend 's failed car bombings in london and glasgow .
smith confirmed that six people were under arrest in connection with the police investigation into the incidents , while a further person in hospital was of interest .
she said that police searches had been carried out at 19 locations across the country .
" our top priority has to be the success of the investigation , " smith told members of parliament in the lower house of commons .
" terrorists are criminals whose victims come from all walks of life , " she said , adding : " it is through our unity that the terrorists will eventually be defeated . "
" my aim as home secretary is to allow the british public to live their lives as they would wish , within the law , " she added .
the " strongest message " needed to go out " to those who wish to destroy our way of life and our freedoms that we will not be intimidated by terror . "

officers were able to defuse the device after being alerted to a " smoldering car " by members of an ambulance crew which happened to be in the central london area , at haymarket , at the time .
hours later , police were able to defuse a second mercedes car bomb in a vehicle which had been parked nearby before being towed to a compound after receiving a ticket for being parked illegally .

" the old separation of domestic security and security abroad is yesterday 's news , " merkel said at the headquarters of her conservative christian democrats during a presentation of their draft party platform .
" we have to think in a completely different context .
only then will freedom and security be kept in balance in light of this new threat . "
she said the attacks in new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 , which were planned by students living in germany , had led to " a sea change with consequences . "
under germany 's basic law adopted after the nazi era , the military may only be deployed in the event of a disaster or to provide medical back-up during major public events .
coalition divided over deployment issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is bound by its postwar mandates conservatives have stepped up calls since the september 11 attacks for the government to have more leeway to send troops to defend against a specific threat to the civilian population .
but the social democrats , partners in germany 's left-right ruling coalition , oppose the move as a violation of the country 's strict postwar separation of the mandates of its security services .
the debate in germany has been revived by the series of thwarted terror attacks in britain .
an interior ministry spokesman said monday that german and british authorities had stepped up their cooperation in recent days .
but he added that there was no indication germany faced a specific threat of imminent attacks .
german authorities announced june 22 they had boosted security measures in response to a greater threat of attacks at home and abroad due to the country 's military involvement in afghanistan .
eu chief urges more collaboration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso talked of a need for the eu to work together in the wake of the failed attacks , european commission president jose manuel barroso said that the european union should step up joint action against terrorist threats .
" the recent attacks , fortunately foiled , in london and glasgow have demonstrated the need for us to work together and complete our agenda in the fight against terrorism , " barroso told a news conference on monday .
barroso added that eu legislation on storing data had helped british authorities monitor suspect terrorists before the planned attacks . " the fact we had adopted a directive , according to which data could be stored for longer , played an important role in enabling british police to monitor a number of suspect networks , " he said .
" terrorists do not respect frontiers ; consequently it makes no sense to fight terrorism purely through inter-governmental mechanisms .
we need supranational instruments if we are to be effective against terrorism . "
britain will not bend , says home secretary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smith had a baptism of fire as home secretary meanwhile , british home secretary jacqui smith said that britain will not be intimidated by terrorism in a statement to parliament monday on the weekend 's failed car bombings in london and glasgow .
smith confirmed that six people were under arrest in connection with the police investigation into the incidents , while a further person in hospital was of interest .
she said that police searches had been carried out at 19 locations across the country .
" our top priority has to be the success of the investigation , " smith told members of parliament in the lower house of commons .
" terrorists are criminals whose victims come from all walks of life , " she said , adding : " it is through our unity that the terrorists will eventually be defeated . "

but demands to cut co2 emissions may see a reversal .
the topic is likely to light up tuesday 's energy summit . german chancellor angela merkel hosts the third federal energy summit in berlin on tuesday with a huge question mark hanging over the source of germany 's future energy supplies and the environmental impact of those sources currently available .
merkel will discuss germany 's future energy needs and how best to conserve energy with business and political leaders from around the country .
however , while the summit is likely to address such issues as reducing co2 output by 40 percent before 2020 , the upgrading of renewable source technology such as solar , wind and biomass energy and the economic impact of the new technology , the main discussion is likely to be on the highly divisive topic of nuclear power .
current german legislation requires all 17 of germany 's existing nuclear power plants to close by 2021 but , using the argument of nuclear power 's ability to help reduce carbon-dioxide emissions , plant operators and center-right politicians have been calling for a reprieve .
however , safety issues surrounding nuclear power have weakened this position , especially after two nuclear power stations went offline last week .
the transformer at the krümmel power station , east of the port city of hamburg , was destroyed by fire last thursday , two hours after a short-circuit had knocked out another nuclear site at brunsbüttel on the far side of the city .
while the brunsbüttel power station was back in service the next day , the krümmel station remained closed pending an investigation .
calls for extended lifespan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch leads cdu voices advocating an extension despite the incidents , a number of politicians from merkel 's christian democratic union party -lrb- cdu -rrb- called on monday for an extension to the nuclear power grid 's lifespan .
powerful hessen state premier roland koch , merkel 's second-in-command in the cdu , told zdf television that the ruling coalition government could still decide on lengthening the lifespan of the power stations which , he claimed , would be the most inexpensive way of protecting germany 's energy supply and reducing co2 output .
both cdu energy expert katherina reiche and the lower saxony prime minister christian wulff agreed with koch 's views in separate statements .
when faced with the question of plant security , koch suggested new power stations could take the place of older plants which are more susceptible to malfunctions over time . " the coalition has a lot of freedom to make this decision , " koch added .
social democrats support decommission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel warns about relying on aging plants environment minister sigmar gabriel of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the cdu 's coalition partner in the federal government , does n't agree .
gabriel is against any extension of nuclear 's lifespan and warned that any attempt to get more use out of aging power plants could be catastrophic . " the longer a power station operates , the more susceptible it is to malfunctions , " he said .
the gradual shutdown of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder and his coalition partners at the time , the greens .
however , in the light of rising energy prices and germany 's dependency on foreign energy , mainly from russia , chancellor merkel wants a broader energy mix .
merkel believes germany should continue to use the edge in nuclear technology it has acquired over the years and members of the cdu are pushing for the chancellor to take advantage of clauses in the " coalition contract " on the shutdown of nuclear power to extend its lifespan to reverse the decision .
effective , yet vilified power source bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel do a u-turn over nuclear power ?
merkel is expected to temper the unease over a potential u-turn on nuclear power at the energy summit of tuesday by advocating a 30 percent increase in renewable energy use which would reduce co2 output by 41 percent .
however , a reprieve for nuclear power would lead to a 45 percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions which would make it the most attractive of the scenarios to reach the desired reduction in co2 output by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but demands to cut co2 emissions may see a reversal .
the topic is likely to light up tuesday 's energy summit . german chancellor angela merkel hosts the third federal energy summit in berlin on tuesday with a huge question mark hanging over the source of germany 's future energy supplies and the environmental impact of those sources currently available .
merkel will discuss germany 's future energy needs and how best to conserve energy with business and political leaders from around the country .
however , while the summit is likely to address such issues as reducing co2 output by 40 percent before 2020 , the upgrading of renewable source technology such as solar , wind and biomass energy and the economic impact of the new technology , the main discussion is likely to be on the highly divisive topic of nuclear power .
current german legislation requires all 17 of germany 's existing nuclear power plants to close by 2021 but , using the argument of nuclear power 's ability to help reduce carbon-dioxide emissions , plant operators and center-right politicians have been calling for a reprieve .
however , safety issues surrounding nuclear power have weakened this position , especially after two nuclear power stations went offline last week .
the transformer at the krümmel power station , east of the port city of hamburg , was destroyed by fire last thursday , two hours after a short-circuit had knocked out another nuclear site at brunsbüttel on the far side of the city .
while the brunsbüttel power station was back in service the next day , the krümmel station remained closed pending an investigation .
calls for extended lifespan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch leads cdu voices advocating an extension despite the incidents , a number of politicians from merkel 's christian democratic union party -lrb- cdu -rrb- called on monday for an extension to the nuclear power grid 's lifespan .
powerful hessen state premier roland koch , merkel 's second-in-command in the cdu , told zdf television that the ruling coalition government could still decide on lengthening the lifespan of the power stations which , he claimed , would be the most inexpensive way of protecting germany 's energy supply and reducing co2 output .
both cdu energy expert katherina reiche and the lower saxony prime minister christian wulff agreed with koch 's views in separate statements .
when faced with the question of plant security , koch suggested new power stations could take the place of older plants which are more susceptible to malfunctions over time . " the coalition has a lot of freedom to make this decision , " koch added .
social democrats support decommission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel warns about relying on aging plants environment minister sigmar gabriel of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the cdu 's coalition partner in the federal government , does n't agree .
gabriel is against any extension of nuclear 's lifespan and warned that any attempt to get more use out of aging power plants could be catastrophic . " the longer a power station operates , the more susceptible it is to malfunctions , " he said .
the gradual shutdown of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder and his coalition partners at the time , the greens .
however , in the light of rising energy prices and germany 's dependency on foreign energy , mainly from russia , chancellor merkel wants a broader energy mix .
merkel believes germany should continue to use the edge in nuclear technology it has acquired over the years and members of the cdu are pushing for the chancellor to take advantage of clauses in the " coalition contract " on the shutdown of nuclear power to extend its lifespan to reverse the decision .
effective , yet vilified power source bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel do a u-turn over nuclear power ?
merkel is expected to temper the unease over a potential u-turn on nuclear power at the energy summit of tuesday by advocating a 30 percent increase in renewable energy use which would reduce co2 output by 41 percent .
however , a reprieve for nuclear power would lead to a 45 percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions which would make it the most attractive of the scenarios to reach the desired reduction in co2 output by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german finance minister peer steinbrück said the economic boom will allow the federal government to stop accumulating new debt by 2011 .
critics say this is n't ambitious enough . on wednesday , steinbrück , a social democrat , is expected to present his budget proposal for 2008 to his cabinet colleagues for approval before the document heads to parliament .
while the financial plan for the coming year will still include new debt of about 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.5 billion -rrb- , steinbrück said that this is already 40 percent less than originally expected .
the finance minister expects to spend 283.2 billion euros in 2008 , up 12.7 billion euros compared to 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrück is happy about germany 's budgetary outlook by 2011 , germany will be able to do without borrowing more money , according to steinbrück .
he said he plans to use and budget surplus to reduce the country 's debt of 900 billion euros .
currently , germany pays about 40 billion euros per year in interest on its debt .
an increase in interest rates will cost the country an additional 2.8 billion euros in 2008 .
too cautious ?
budget experts of germany 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which forms a grand coalition with steinbrück 's social democratic party , said that the finance minister 's proposals did n't go far enough .
steffen kampeter , the budget expert for the cdu in parliament , said that germany should already be able to borrow significantly less money in 2007 than expected .
he also criticized that steinbrück 's plan aimed to reduce new debt via tax revenue rather than cutting costs .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 02.07.2007 nuclear power to dominate debate at german energy summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power 's contribution to reducing co2 levels is at the heart of advocates ' arguments germany 's coalition government has a commitment to decommission the country 's nuclear power stations by 2021 .
but demands to cut co2 emissions may see a reversal .
the topic is likely to light up tuesday 's energy summit . german chancellor angela merkel hosts the third federal energy summit in berlin on tuesday with a huge question mark hanging over the source of germany 's future energy supplies and the environmental impact of those sources currently available .
merkel will discuss germany 's future energy needs and how best to conserve energy with business and political leaders from around the country .
however , while the summit is likely to address such issues as reducing co2 output by 40 percent before 2020 , the upgrading of renewable source technology such as solar , wind and biomass energy and the economic impact of the new technology , the main discussion is likely to be on the highly divisive topic of nuclear power .
current german legislation requires all 17 of germany 's existing nuclear power plants to close by 2021 but , using the argument of nuclear power 's ability to help reduce carbon-dioxide emissions , plant operators and center-right politicians have been calling for a reprieve .
however , safety issues surrounding nuclear power have weakened this position , especially after two nuclear power stations went offline last week .
the transformer at the krümmel power station , east of the port city of hamburg , was destroyed by fire last thursday , two hours after a short-circuit had knocked out another nuclear site at brunsbüttel on the far side of the city .
while the brunsbüttel power station was back in service the next day , the krümmel station remained closed pending an investigation .
calls for extended lifespan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch leads cdu voices advocating an extension despite the incidents , a number of politicians from merkel 's christian democratic union party -lrb- cdu -rrb- called on monday for an extension to the nuclear power grid 's lifespan .
powerful hessen state premier roland koch , merkel 's second-in-command in the cdu , told zdf television that the ruling coalition government could still decide on lengthening the lifespan of the power stations which , he claimed , would be the most inexpensive way of protecting germany 's energy supply and reducing co2 output .
both cdu energy expert katherina reiche and the lower saxony prime minister christian wulff agreed with koch 's views in separate statements .
when faced with the question of plant security , koch suggested new power stations could take the place of older plants which are more susceptible to malfunctions over time . " the coalition has a lot of freedom to make this decision , " koch added .
social democrats support decommission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel warns about relying on aging plants environment minister sigmar gabriel of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the cdu 's coalition partner in the federal government , does n't agree .
gabriel is against any extension of nuclear 's lifespan and warned that any attempt to get more use out of aging power plants could be catastrophic . " the longer a power station operates , the more susceptible it is to malfunctions , " he said .
the gradual shutdown of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder and his coalition partners at the time , the greens .
however , in the light of rising energy prices and germany 's dependency on foreign energy , mainly from russia , chancellor merkel wants a broader energy mix .
merkel believes germany should continue to use the edge in nuclear technology it has acquired over the years and members of the cdu are pushing for the chancellor to take advantage of clauses in the " coalition contract " on the shutdown of nuclear power to extend its lifespan to reverse the decision .
effective , yet vilified power source bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel do a u-turn over nuclear power ?
merkel is expected to temper the unease over a potential u-turn on nuclear power at the energy summit of tuesday by advocating a 30 percent increase in renewable energy use which would reduce co2 output by 41 percent .
however , a reprieve for nuclear power would lead to a 45 percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions which would make it the most attractive of the scenarios to reach the desired reduction in co2 output by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the old separation of domestic security and security abroad is yesterday 's news , " merkel said at the headquarters of her conservative christian democrats during a presentation of their draft party platform .
" we have to think in a completely different context .
only then will freedom and security be kept in balance in light of this new threat . "
she said the attacks in new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 , which were planned by students living in germany , had led to " a sea change with consequences . "
under germany 's basic law adopted after the nazi era , the military may only be deployed in the event of a disaster or to provide medical back-up during major public events .
coalition divided over deployment issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is bound by its postwar mandates conservatives have stepped up calls since the september 11 attacks for the government to have more leeway to send troops to defend against a specific threat to the civilian population .
but the social democrats , partners in germany 's left-right ruling coalition , oppose the move as a violation of the country 's strict postwar separation of the mandates of its security services .
the debate in germany has been revived by the series of thwarted terror attacks in britain .
an interior ministry spokesman said monday that german and british authorities had stepped up their cooperation in recent days .
but he added that there was no indication germany faced a specific threat of imminent attacks .
german authorities announced june 22 they had boosted security measures in response to a greater threat of attacks at home and abroad due to the country 's military involvement in afghanistan .
eu chief urges more collaboration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso talked of a need for the eu to work together in the wake of the failed attacks , european commission president jose manuel barroso said that the european union should step up joint action against terrorist threats .
" the recent attacks , fortunately foiled , in london and glasgow have demonstrated the need for us to work together and complete our agenda in the fight against terrorism , " barroso told a news conference on monday .
barroso added that eu legislation on storing data had helped british authorities monitor suspect terrorists before the planned attacks . " the fact we had adopted a directive , according to which data could be stored for longer , played an important role in enabling british police to monitor a number of suspect networks , " he said .
" terrorists do not respect frontiers ; consequently it makes no sense to fight terrorism purely through inter-governmental mechanisms .
we need supranational instruments if we are to be effective against terrorism . "

smith confirmed that six people were under arrest in connection with the police investigation into the incidents , while a further person in hospital was of interest .
she said that police searches had been carried out at 19 locations across the country .
" our top priority has to be the success of the investigation , " smith told members of parliament in the lower house of commons .
" terrorists are criminals whose victims come from all walks of life , " she said , adding : " it is through our unity that the terrorists will eventually be defeated . "
" my aim as home secretary is to allow the british public to live their lives as they would wish , within the law , " she added .

" the old separation of domestic security and security abroad is yesterday 's news , " merkel said at the headquarters of her conservative christian democrats during a presentation of their draft party platform .
" we have to think in a completely different context .
only then will freedom and security be kept in balance in light of this new threat . "
she said the attacks in new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 , which were planned by students living in germany , had led to " a sea change with consequences . "
under germany 's basic law adopted after the nazi era , the military may only be deployed in the event of a disaster or to provide medical back-up during major public events .
coalition divided over deployment issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is bound by its postwar mandates conservatives have stepped up calls since the september 11 attacks for the government to have more leeway to send troops to defend against a specific threat to the civilian population .
but the social democrats , partners in germany 's left-right ruling coalition , oppose the move as a violation of the country 's strict postwar separation of the mandates of its security services .
the debate in germany has been revived by the series of thwarted terror attacks in britain .
an interior ministry spokesman said monday that german and british authorities had stepped up their cooperation in recent days .
but he added that there was no indication germany faced a specific threat of imminent attacks .
german authorities announced june 22 they had boosted security measures in response to a greater threat of attacks at home and abroad due to the country 's military involvement in afghanistan .
eu chief urges more collaboration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso talked of a need for the eu to work together in the wake of the failed attacks , european commission president jose manuel barroso said that the european union should step up joint action against terrorist threats .
" the recent attacks , fortunately foiled , in london and glasgow have demonstrated the need for us to work together and complete our agenda in the fight against terrorism , " barroso told a news conference on monday .
barroso added that eu legislation on storing data had helped british authorities monitor suspect terrorists before the planned attacks . " the fact we had adopted a directive , according to which data could be stored for longer , played an important role in enabling british police to monitor a number of suspect networks , " he said .
" terrorists do not respect frontiers ; consequently it makes no sense to fight terrorism purely through inter-governmental mechanisms .
we need supranational instruments if we are to be effective against terrorism . "
britain will not bend , says home secretary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smith had a baptism of fire as home secretary meanwhile , british home secretary jacqui smith said that britain will not be intimidated by terrorism in a statement to parliament monday on the weekend 's failed car bombings in london and glasgow .
smith confirmed that six people were under arrest in connection with the police investigation into the incidents , while a further person in hospital was of interest .
she said that police searches had been carried out at 19 locations across the country .
" our top priority has to be the success of the investigation , " smith told members of parliament in the lower house of commons .
" terrorists are criminals whose victims come from all walks of life , " she said , adding : " it is through our unity that the terrorists will eventually be defeated . "
" my aim as home secretary is to allow the british public to live their lives as they would wish , within the law , " she added .
the " strongest message " needed to go out " to those who wish to destroy our way of life and our freedoms that we will not be intimidated by terror . "

officers were able to defuse the device after being alerted to a " smoldering car " by members of an ambulance crew which happened to be in the central london area , at haymarket , at the time .
hours later , police were able to defuse a second mercedes car bomb in a vehicle which had been parked nearby before being towed to a compound after receiving a ticket for being parked illegally .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 02.07.2007 opinion : germany could take a page from britain 's book großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain currently offers plenty of motives for terrorism , but we can also learn something from the country 's prudent response to the foiled car bombs , said dw 's peter philipp . " baghad comes to london , " was the verdict of some commentators who suspect members of al qaeda to be behind the discovery of two foiled car bombs in the british capital on friday .
as long as the perpetrators remain unidentified , speculation will continue to swirl .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp what we know for sure is that britain is in the crosshairs of terrorist groups .
whether it 's britain 's involvement in driving the iraq war , its military presence there , salman rushdie 's knighthood , tony blair 's appointment as the new envoy of the mideast quartet or just simply britain 's colonial past in wide swathes of the muslim world , the united kingdom offers plenty of motives for terrorism .
not to mention the fact that britain is home to an army of discontented muslims from whose ranks the train bombers from two years ago were recruited .
there are indications that the car bombs did n't have an internal british motive but rather that the " network " -lrb- al qaeda -rrb- planned to strike with local help , as always .
the construction of the bombs points towards that theory , and there was also apparently quite a clear warning on the internet that london would be the target of an attack .
the date too was no coincidence - just hours after a change in britain 's leadership from tony blair to gordon brown and days before the second anniversary of the london bombings .
thanks to a coincidence and the prudence of the british , the tragedy was averted .
the exhaustive cctv surveillance in london will also help in getting leads on the perpetrators .
it 's a system that 's strongly opposed by many in germany as if there was no consideration in weighing the protection of privacy against protecting the general public against terrorist attacks .
you could take a page from britain 's book .
video surveillance does not prevent violent acts , but it does deter them and eases the hunt for perpetrators .
at the same time there is no panic-mongering in britain as was the case in germany recently when different official departments warned of a heightened danger of terrorism .
we all live in an age of heightened danger : whether it 's in london , berlin , paris or amsterdam .
as long as crazed people do n't live out their fanatical fantasies , we ca n't foresee their actions .
we can only counter them by remaining alert .
even though victims ca n't be avoided sometimes , if we do n't allow ourselves to be terrorized then the terrorists have already lost the " first round . "
remaining vigilant does n't just mean keeping your nerve and gritting your teeth .
it also means stopping exaggerated preventive measures .
politicians of all stripes - even in germany - tend to propagate complete surveillance to counter terrorism .
video surveillance is necessary , but if we go further and place limits on our free society because of fear of violence then we would be capitulating to the terrorists .

" baghad comes to london , " was the verdict of some commentators who suspect members of al qaeda to be behind the discovery of two foiled car bombs in the british capital on friday .
as long as the perpetrators remain unidentified , speculation will continue to swirl .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp what we know for sure is that britain is in the crosshairs of terrorist groups .
whether it 's britain 's involvement in driving the iraq war , its military presence there , salman rushdie 's knighthood , tony blair 's appointment as the new envoy of the mideast quartet or just simply britain 's colonial past in wide swathes of the muslim world , the united kingdom offers plenty of motives for terrorism .
not to mention the fact that britain is home to an army of discontented muslims from whose ranks the train bombers from two years ago were recruited .
there are indications that the car bombs did n't have an internal british motive but rather that the " network " -lrb- al qaeda -rrb- planned to strike with local help , as always .
the construction of the bombs points towards that theory , and there was also apparently quite a clear warning on the internet that london would be the target of an attack .
the date too was no coincidence - just hours after a change in britain 's leadership from tony blair to gordon brown and days before the second anniversary of the london bombings .
thanks to a coincidence and the prudence of the british , the tragedy was averted .
the exhaustive cctv surveillance in london will also help in getting leads on the perpetrators .
it 's a system that 's strongly opposed by many in germany as if there was no consideration in weighing the protection of privacy against protecting the general public against terrorist attacks .
you could take a page from britain 's book .
video surveillance does not prevent violent acts , but it does deter them and eases the hunt for perpetrators .
at the same time there is no panic-mongering in britain as was the case in germany recently when different official departments warned of a heightened danger of terrorism .
we all live in an age of heightened danger : whether it 's in london , berlin , paris or amsterdam .
as long as crazed people do n't live out their fanatical fantasies , we ca n't foresee their actions .
we can only counter them by remaining alert .
even though victims ca n't be avoided sometimes , if we do n't allow ourselves to be terrorized then the terrorists have already lost the " first round . "
remaining vigilant does n't just mean keeping your nerve and gritting your teeth .
it also means stopping exaggerated preventive measures .
politicians of all stripes - even in germany - tend to propagate complete surveillance to counter terrorism .
video surveillance is necessary , but if we go further and place limits on our free society because of fear of violence then we would be capitulating to the terrorists .

elsewhere in europe , premier gordon brown 's handling of the situation got mixed reviews . " the immediate aftermath of a terrorist atrocity is the worst possible time to legislate , " the right-wing daily telegraph declared in its editorial .
" the government 's response to the bombers should be proportionate to the threat faced , not to the public outrage .
there is always a temptation for ministers to look tough by awarding themselves new powers instead of using the powers already at their disposal . " the independent , a left-wing paper , took a similar line , declaring in its editorial that it " is vital that the prime minister does not rush through new repressive anti-terror laws ... it is vital that our political leaders pause for thought . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown steped out of the way to let police investigate , the daily mail said the daily mail , a right-wing paper that is often critical of the governing labour party , offered tentative praise for new prime minister gordon brown , who only took over from tony blair on wednesday , and new home secretary jacqui smith .
it described the pair as " a new prime minister and a rookie home secretary both facing a huge test within hours of taking office and both , it must be said , commendably keeping their nerve .
this time ... there has been no political grandstanding , no promises of ' tough ' new measures .
instead , gordon brown and jacqui smith concentrate on reassuring the public and letting police and -lrb- domestic intelligence service -rrb- mi5 get on with the job .
and that is surely right . " in germany , the süddeutsche zeitung in munich meanwhile commented on brown 's lack of charisma .
" appearing more wooden than usual and speaking in a weirdly tired voice , he praised the heroic courage of police and other emergency services and offered platitudes about the dangers of international terrorism , " wrote the paper .
" the difference in style was hard to miss .
while blair had the instinct to comfort people after dramatic events such as the death of princess diana or the terror attacks in new york and london , brown appeared more like a us marshal , who is pressuring people into becoming auxiliary sheriffs .
it was hard to keep track of how many times he admonished voters to be vigil . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least one suspect remains at large french daily liberation looked at what lies ahead in the war against terror .
" withdrawing british troops from iraq or afghanistan would not end the homemade terror in britain .
western democracies have to have a three-fold response : there has to be the harshest response on the judicial level without introducing exceptions such as guantanamo that only feed the hatred .
diplomatically , the us and britain have to rethink their policy in iraq and the middle east .
and finally , there needs to be a cultural response .
we have to learn to live with a multicultural population without renouncing our own values .
we have to integrate foreigners in order to isolate the minority that has chosen terror and violence .
if we win this struggle , democracy will emerge with newfound strength . " madrid 's abc was more interested in the immediate response : " it 's obvious that the free world is the target of a massive attack that tries to conquer our society by force , " the paper opined .
" the planned massacres in great britain clearly were meant to coincide with the handover of power to prime minister gordon brown .

elsewhere in europe , premier gordon brown 's handling of the situation got mixed reviews . " the immediate aftermath of a terrorist atrocity is the worst possible time to legislate , " the right-wing daily telegraph declared in its editorial .
" the government 's response to the bombers should be proportionate to the threat faced , not to the public outrage .
there is always a temptation for ministers to look tough by awarding themselves new powers instead of using the powers already at their disposal . " the independent , a left-wing paper , took a similar line , declaring in its editorial that it " is vital that the prime minister does not rush through new repressive anti-terror laws ... it is vital that our political leaders pause for thought . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown steped out of the way to let police investigate , the daily mail said the daily mail , a right-wing paper that is often critical of the governing labour party , offered tentative praise for new prime minister gordon brown , who only took over from tony blair on wednesday , and new home secretary jacqui smith .
it described the pair as " a new prime minister and a rookie home secretary both facing a huge test within hours of taking office and both , it must be said , commendably keeping their nerve .
this time ... there has been no political grandstanding , no promises of ' tough ' new measures .
instead , gordon brown and jacqui smith concentrate on reassuring the public and letting police and -lrb- domestic intelligence service -rrb- mi5 get on with the job .
and that is surely right . " in germany , the süddeutsche zeitung in munich meanwhile commented on brown 's lack of charisma .
" appearing more wooden than usual and speaking in a weirdly tired voice , he praised the heroic courage of police and other emergency services and offered platitudes about the dangers of international terrorism , " wrote the paper .
" the difference in style was hard to miss .
while blair had the instinct to comfort people after dramatic events such as the death of princess diana or the terror attacks in new york and london , brown appeared more like a us marshal , who is pressuring people into becoming auxiliary sheriffs .
it was hard to keep track of how many times he admonished voters to be vigil . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least one suspect remains at large french daily liberation looked at what lies ahead in the war against terror .
" withdrawing british troops from iraq or afghanistan would not end the homemade terror in britain .
western democracies have to have a three-fold response : there has to be the harshest response on the judicial level without introducing exceptions such as guantanamo that only feed the hatred .
diplomatically , the us and britain have to rethink their policy in iraq and the middle east .
and finally , there needs to be a cultural response .
we have to learn to live with a multicultural population without renouncing our own values .
we have to integrate foreigners in order to isolate the minority that has chosen terror and violence .
if we win this struggle , democracy will emerge with newfound strength . " madrid 's abc was more interested in the immediate response : " it 's obvious that the free world is the target of a massive attack that tries to conquer our society by force , " the paper opined .
" the planned massacres in great britain clearly were meant to coincide with the handover of power to prime minister gordon brown .
it 's easy to figure out that the perpetrators wanted to force london to change plans for troops in iraq and other countries .

german finance minister peer steinbrück said the economic boom will allow the federal government to stop accumulating new debt by 2011 .
critics say this is n't ambitious enough . on wednesday , steinbrück , a social democrat , is expected to present his budget proposal for 2008 to his cabinet colleagues for approval before the document heads to parliament .
while the financial plan for the coming year will still include new debt of about 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.5 billion -rrb- , steinbrück said that this is already 40 percent less than originally expected .
the finance minister expects to spend 283.2 billion euros in 2008 , up 12.7 billion euros compared to 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrück is happy about germany 's budgetary outlook by 2011 , germany will be able to do without borrowing more money , according to steinbrück .
he said he plans to use and budget surplus to reduce the country 's debt of 900 billion euros .
currently , germany pays about 40 billion euros per year in interest on its debt .
an increase in interest rates will cost the country an additional 2.8 billion euros in 2008 .
too cautious ?
budget experts of germany 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which forms a grand coalition with steinbrück 's social democratic party , said that the finance minister 's proposals did n't go far enough .
steffen kampeter , the budget expert for the cdu in parliament , said that germany should already be able to borrow significantly less money in 2007 than expected .
he also criticized that steinbrück 's plan aimed to reduce new debt via tax revenue rather than cutting costs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an early balance budget would look good for steinbrück on election day opposition members also attacked steinbrück for not doing enough to save money and said that a balanced budget by 2011 was not ambitious enough .
" for him , the best would be to reach this all of a sudden in 2009 , " otto fricke , the chairman of the parliament 's budget committee , told swr public radio .
" that 's when we 'll have the next election campaign at the latest . "
speaking to the berliner zeitung daily over the weekend , steinbrück did n't exactly deny the allegation .

german finance minister peer steinbrück said the economic boom will allow the federal government to stop accumulating new debt by 2011 .
critics say this is n't ambitious enough . on wednesday , steinbrück , a social democrat , is expected to present his budget proposal for 2008 to his cabinet colleagues for approval before the document heads to parliament .
while the financial plan for the coming year will still include new debt of about 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.5 billion -rrb- , steinbrück said that this is already 40 percent less than originally expected .
the finance minister expects to spend 283.2 billion euros in 2008 , up 12.7 billion euros compared to 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrück is happy about germany 's budgetary outlook by 2011 , germany will be able to do without borrowing more money , according to steinbrück .
he said he plans to use and budget surplus to reduce the country 's debt of 900 billion euros .
currently , germany pays about 40 billion euros per year in interest on its debt .
an increase in interest rates will cost the country an additional 2.8 billion euros in 2008 .
too cautious ?
budget experts of germany 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which forms a grand coalition with steinbrück 's social democratic party , said that the finance minister 's proposals did n't go far enough .
steffen kampeter , the budget expert for the cdu in parliament , said that germany should already be able to borrow significantly less money in 2007 than expected .
he also criticized that steinbrück 's plan aimed to reduce new debt via tax revenue rather than cutting costs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an early balance budget would look good for steinbrück on election day opposition members also attacked steinbrück for not doing enough to save money and said that a balanced budget by 2011 was not ambitious enough .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 02.07.2007 nuclear power to dominate debate at german energy summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power 's contribution to reducing co2 levels is at the heart of advocates ' arguments germany 's coalition government has a commitment to decommission the country 's nuclear power stations by 2021 .
but demands to cut co2 emissions may see a reversal .
the topic is likely to light up tuesday 's energy summit . german chancellor angela merkel hosts the third federal energy summit in berlin on tuesday with a huge question mark hanging over the source of germany 's future energy supplies and the environmental impact of those sources currently available .
merkel will discuss germany 's future energy needs and how best to conserve energy with business and political leaders from around the country .
however , while the summit is likely to address such issues as reducing co2 output by 40 percent before 2020 , the upgrading of renewable source technology such as solar , wind and biomass energy and the economic impact of the new technology , the main discussion is likely to be on the highly divisive topic of nuclear power .
current german legislation requires all 17 of germany 's existing nuclear power plants to close by 2021 but , using the argument of nuclear power 's ability to help reduce carbon-dioxide emissions , plant operators and center-right politicians have been calling for a reprieve .
however , safety issues surrounding nuclear power have weakened this position , especially after two nuclear power stations went offline last week .
the transformer at the krümmel power station , east of the port city of hamburg , was destroyed by fire last thursday , two hours after a short-circuit had knocked out another nuclear site at brunsbüttel on the far side of the city .
while the brunsbüttel power station was back in service the next day , the krümmel station remained closed pending an investigation .
calls for extended lifespan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch leads cdu voices advocating an extension despite the incidents , a number of politicians from merkel 's christian democratic union party -lrb- cdu -rrb- called on monday for an extension to the nuclear power grid 's lifespan .
powerful hessen state premier roland koch , merkel 's second-in-command in the cdu , told zdf television that the ruling coalition government could still decide on lengthening the lifespan of the power stations which , he claimed , would be the most inexpensive way of protecting germany 's energy supply and reducing co2 output .
both cdu energy expert katherina reiche and the lower saxony prime minister christian wulff agreed with koch 's views in separate statements .
when faced with the question of plant security , koch suggested new power stations could take the place of older plants which are more susceptible to malfunctions over time . " the coalition has a lot of freedom to make this decision , " koch added .
social democrats support decommission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel warns about relying on aging plants environment minister sigmar gabriel of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the cdu 's coalition partner in the federal government , does n't agree .
gabriel is against any extension of nuclear 's lifespan and warned that any attempt to get more use out of aging power plants could be catastrophic . " the longer a power station operates , the more susceptible it is to malfunctions , " he said .
the gradual shutdown of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder and his coalition partners at the time , the greens .
however , in the light of rising energy prices and germany 's dependency on foreign energy , mainly from russia , chancellor merkel wants a broader energy mix .
merkel believes germany should continue to use the edge in nuclear technology it has acquired over the years and members of the cdu are pushing for the chancellor to take advantage of clauses in the " coalition contract " on the shutdown of nuclear power to extend its lifespan to reverse the decision .
effective , yet vilified power source bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel do a u-turn over nuclear power ?
merkel is expected to temper the unease over a potential u-turn on nuclear power at the energy summit of tuesday by advocating a 30 percent increase in renewable energy use which would reduce co2 output by 41 percent .
however , a reprieve for nuclear power would lead to a 45 percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions which would make it the most attractive of the scenarios to reach the desired reduction in co2 output by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the transformer at the krümmel power station , east of the port city of hamburg , was destroyed by fire last thursday , two hours after a short-circuit had knocked out another nuclear site at brunsbüttel on the far side of the city .
while the brunsbüttel power station was back in service the next day , the krümmel station remained closed pending an investigation .
calls for extended lifespan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch leads cdu voices advocating an extension despite the incidents , a number of politicians from merkel 's christian democratic union party -lrb- cdu -rrb- called on monday for an extension to the nuclear power grid 's lifespan .
powerful hessen state premier roland koch , merkel 's second-in-command in the cdu , told zdf television that the ruling coalition government could still decide on lengthening the lifespan of the power stations which , he claimed , would be the most inexpensive way of protecting germany 's energy supply and reducing co2 output .
both cdu energy expert katherina reiche and the lower saxony prime minister christian wulff agreed with koch 's views in separate statements .
when faced with the question of plant security , koch suggested new power stations could take the place of older plants which are more susceptible to malfunctions over time . " the coalition has a lot of freedom to make this decision , " koch added .
social democrats support decommission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel warns about relying on aging plants environment minister sigmar gabriel of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the cdu 's coalition partner in the federal government , does n't agree .
gabriel is against any extension of nuclear 's lifespan and warned that any attempt to get more use out of aging power plants could be catastrophic . " the longer a power station operates , the more susceptible it is to malfunctions , " he said .
the gradual shutdown of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder and his coalition partners at the time , the greens .
however , in the light of rising energy prices and germany 's dependency on foreign energy , mainly from russia , chancellor merkel wants a broader energy mix .
merkel believes germany should continue to use the edge in nuclear technology it has acquired over the years and members of the cdu are pushing for the chancellor to take advantage of clauses in the " coalition contract " on the shutdown of nuclear power to extend its lifespan to reverse the decision .
effective , yet vilified power source bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel do a u-turn over nuclear power ?
merkel is expected to temper the unease over a potential u-turn on nuclear power at the energy summit of tuesday by advocating a 30 percent increase in renewable energy use which would reduce co2 output by 41 percent .
however , a reprieve for nuclear power would lead to a 45 percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions which would make it the most attractive of the scenarios to reach the desired reduction in co2 output by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but demands to cut co2 emissions may see a reversal .
the topic is likely to light up tuesday 's energy summit . german chancellor angela merkel hosts the third federal energy summit in berlin on tuesday with a huge question mark hanging over the source of germany 's future energy supplies and the environmental impact of those sources currently available .
merkel will discuss germany 's future energy needs and how best to conserve energy with business and political leaders from around the country .
however , while the summit is likely to address such issues as reducing co2 output by 40 percent before 2020 , the upgrading of renewable source technology such as solar , wind and biomass energy and the economic impact of the new technology , the main discussion is likely to be on the highly divisive topic of nuclear power .
current german legislation requires all 17 of germany 's existing nuclear power plants to close by 2021 but , using the argument of nuclear power 's ability to help reduce carbon-dioxide emissions , plant operators and center-right politicians have been calling for a reprieve .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 02.07.2007 nuclear power to dominate debate at german energy summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power 's contribution to reducing co2 levels is at the heart of advocates ' arguments germany 's coalition government has a commitment to decommission the country 's nuclear power stations by 2021 .
but demands to cut co2 emissions may see a reversal .
the topic is likely to light up tuesday 's energy summit . german chancellor angela merkel hosts the third federal energy summit in berlin on tuesday with a huge question mark hanging over the source of germany 's future energy supplies and the environmental impact of those sources currently available .
merkel will discuss germany 's future energy needs and how best to conserve energy with business and political leaders from around the country .
however , while the summit is likely to address such issues as reducing co2 output by 40 percent before 2020 , the upgrading of renewable source technology such as solar , wind and biomass energy and the economic impact of the new technology , the main discussion is likely to be on the highly divisive topic of nuclear power .
current german legislation requires all 17 of germany 's existing nuclear power plants to close by 2021 but , using the argument of nuclear power 's ability to help reduce carbon-dioxide emissions , plant operators and center-right politicians have been calling for a reprieve .
however , safety issues surrounding nuclear power have weakened this position , especially after two nuclear power stations went offline last week .
the transformer at the krümmel power station , east of the port city of hamburg , was destroyed by fire last thursday , two hours after a short-circuit had knocked out another nuclear site at brunsbüttel on the far side of the city .
while the brunsbüttel power station was back in service the next day , the krümmel station remained closed pending an investigation .
calls for extended lifespan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch leads cdu voices advocating an extension despite the incidents , a number of politicians from merkel 's christian democratic union party -lrb- cdu -rrb- called on monday for an extension to the nuclear power grid 's lifespan .
powerful hessen state premier roland koch , merkel 's second-in-command in the cdu , told zdf television that the ruling coalition government could still decide on lengthening the lifespan of the power stations which , he claimed , would be the most inexpensive way of protecting germany 's energy supply and reducing co2 output .
both cdu energy expert katherina reiche and the lower saxony prime minister christian wulff agreed with koch 's views in separate statements .
when faced with the question of plant security , koch suggested new power stations could take the place of older plants which are more susceptible to malfunctions over time . " the coalition has a lot of freedom to make this decision , " koch added .
social democrats support decommission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel warns about relying on aging plants environment minister sigmar gabriel of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the cdu 's coalition partner in the federal government , does n't agree .
gabriel is against any extension of nuclear 's lifespan and warned that any attempt to get more use out of aging power plants could be catastrophic . " the longer a power station operates , the more susceptible it is to malfunctions , " he said .
the gradual shutdown of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder and his coalition partners at the time , the greens .
however , in the light of rising energy prices and germany 's dependency on foreign energy , mainly from russia , chancellor merkel wants a broader energy mix .
merkel believes germany should continue to use the edge in nuclear technology it has acquired over the years and members of the cdu are pushing for the chancellor to take advantage of clauses in the " coalition contract " on the shutdown of nuclear power to extend its lifespan to reverse the decision .
effective , yet vilified power source bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel do a u-turn over nuclear power ?
merkel is expected to temper the unease over a potential u-turn on nuclear power at the energy summit of tuesday by advocating a 30 percent increase in renewable energy use which would reduce co2 output by 41 percent .
however , a reprieve for nuclear power would lead to a 45 percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions which would make it the most attractive of the scenarios to reach the desired reduction in co2 output by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de retail -pipe- 02.07.2007 in graying germany , specialty stores for seniors are the future großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a model shows off the latest for the mature crowd at the senior fashion show in eastern germany , the country 's first big specialty store aimed at the growing seniors ' market is planning an expansion .
as germany ages , marketing to the gray consumer will likely be a winning business strategy . a coach pulls in to a parking lot of a nondescript building in an industrial park on the outskirts of grossräschen , a small town just over an hour south of berlin .
inside , the women , and one man , are getting ready for the runway .
they 're tying on colorful scarves , adjusting bright skirts and slipping on not stilettos but sensible shoes - a first sign that this is no ordinary fashion show they 're readying for . the arrivals file in and sit at tables laid out with coffee and cake .
a salesperson takes a microphone and introduces the first model , frau schütz , who comes out in a linen jacket and skirt . she 's no beanpole-thin waif . frau schütz is well over 50 and has a figure that might be called rubenesque . but that 's fine with the members of this group , aged from their early 60s to mid 80s .
fickle trends and size zero clothes are n't exactly what they 're in the market for . " older people also want something chic and stylish , and they are n't going to fit into all these super-mini , extra-extra-small things they find in most fashionable stores , " said christa putzke , the head saleswoman at the deliga senior store .
" we offer them clothes that fit this stage of their lives . " products for the golden years besides the clothes on display on the 800 square meters -lrb- 8,611 sq. ft . -rrb- of floor space , the store has a whole range of goods that meet the needs of the over-60 set .
there are talking alarm clocks and telephones with large buttons that make it easier to use for people with poor eyesight and arthritic hands .
there are amplifiers for radios and large magnifying screens for tvs . bildunterschrift : 800 square meters of space a rack with support hose sits next to various kinds of underwear for people with incontinence , while the shoe section features non-slip soles , soft leather and insoles that make walking easier on tired feet . at deliga , everything is on one level ; no stairs block access for those in wheelchairs or using walkers .
the racks are spaced far apart so people can maneuver between them easily .
the saleswomen are relaxed , friendly and do n't pressure anyone to buy . " when you look at stores now , they are n't at all set up for older people , " said putzke .
" the whole market needs to adjust , though , given the realities we 're seeing in germany . " gray horizons the country is looking at a grayer future , age-wise .
while about one in five germans is over the age of 60 today , demographic studies show that by 2050 , more than one in three will be in the golden years . already today , the senior consumer group has purchasing power that retailers should n't ignore .
according to the german institute of economic research , it is estimated at around 316 billion euros -lrb- $ 429 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's an array of products geared toward older people " but the big retail players seem to be asleep at the wheel , " said matthias riepen , who is taking over the deliga store and planning a relaunch in september .
" strangely , they do n't seem to be looking at the senior market very much right now although numerous studies have shown it 's the market of the future . " there have been some exceptions , such as the so-called " generation supermarkets " that have opened up that shops featuring wider aisles , large-print price tags , magnifying glasses on shelves and motorized shopping baskets with seats attached . the deliga store has not been without its problems .
opened in 2005 , it filed for insolvency two weeks ago .
not because of the market , said riepen , but because of mistakes in marketing and day-to-day operations .
for his relaunch in september , riepen plans on giving it a more modern name , updating its product assortment , and embarking on a franchising plan that , he hopes , will see up to three new stores opening in germany next year . " it 's a concept that has n't been tried yet with seniors , giving them everything they want under one roof , " he said . attractive for every sector andreas reidl , director of the nuremberg-based agency for generation marketing , a consulting firm specializing on the senior market , said that the silver-haired market for almost every sector is an attractive one , be it tourism , health products , financial services or food . " the winners will be the ones who are successful in reaching this older clientele , " he said . karin bernau , 66 , who had come with the senior bus group and ended up buying two blouses , a portable chair and a bootjack for her husband , was sold on the concept of a shop designed especially for her age group . " i think we need more stores like this , " she said .
" it 's the older people who have the buying power .
they 've got their pensions and can afford to spend a little . " he husband , werner , 72 , also had good words for the shop , but was rather lukewarm on the mature fashion show . " it was fine , " he said .
" of course , women who are a little thinner are more fun to look at , huh ? " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as germany ages , marketing to the gray consumer will likely be a winning business strategy . a coach pulls in to a parking lot of a nondescript building in an industrial park on the outskirts of grossräschen , a small town just over an hour south of berlin .
inside , the women , and one man , are getting ready for the runway .
they 're tying on colorful scarves , adjusting bright skirts and slipping on not stilettos but sensible shoes - a first sign that this is no ordinary fashion show they 're readying for . the arrivals file in and sit at tables laid out with coffee and cake .
a salesperson takes a microphone and introduces the first model , frau schütz , who comes out in a linen jacket and skirt . she 's no beanpole-thin waif . frau schütz is well over 50 and has a figure that might be called rubenesque . but that 's fine with the members of this group , aged from their early 60s to mid 80s .
fickle trends and size zero clothes are n't exactly what they 're in the market for . " older people also want something chic and stylish , and they are n't going to fit into all these super-mini , extra-extra-small things they find in most fashionable stores , " said christa putzke , the head saleswoman at the deliga senior store .
" we offer them clothes that fit this stage of their lives . " products for the golden years besides the clothes on display on the 800 square meters -lrb- 8,611 sq. ft . -rrb- of floor space , the store has a whole range of goods that meet the needs of the over-60 set .
there are talking alarm clocks and telephones with large buttons that make it easier to use for people with poor eyesight and arthritic hands .
there are amplifiers for radios and large magnifying screens for tvs . bildunterschrift : 800 square meters of space a rack with support hose sits next to various kinds of underwear for people with incontinence , while the shoe section features non-slip soles , soft leather and insoles that make walking easier on tired feet . at deliga , everything is on one level ; no stairs block access for those in wheelchairs or using walkers .
the racks are spaced far apart so people can maneuver between them easily .
the saleswomen are relaxed , friendly and do n't pressure anyone to buy . " when you look at stores now , they are n't at all set up for older people , " said putzke .
" the whole market needs to adjust , though , given the realities we 're seeing in germany . " gray horizons the country is looking at a grayer future , age-wise .
while about one in five germans is over the age of 60 today , demographic studies show that by 2050 , more than one in three will be in the golden years . already today , the senior consumer group has purchasing power that retailers should n't ignore .
according to the german institute of economic research , it is estimated at around 316 billion euros -lrb- $ 429 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's an array of products geared toward older people " but the big retail players seem to be asleep at the wheel , " said matthias riepen , who is taking over the deliga store and planning a relaunch in september .
" strangely , they do n't seem to be looking at the senior market very much right now although numerous studies have shown it 's the market of the future . " there have been some exceptions , such as the so-called " generation supermarkets " that have opened up that shops featuring wider aisles , large-print price tags , magnifying glasses on shelves and motorized shopping baskets with seats attached . the deliga store has not been without its problems .
opened in 2005 , it filed for insolvency two weeks ago .
not because of the market , said riepen , but because of mistakes in marketing and day-to-day operations .
for his relaunch in september , riepen plans on giving it a more modern name , updating its product assortment , and embarking on a franchising plan that , he hopes , will see up to three new stores opening in germany next year . " it 's a concept that has n't been tried yet with seniors , giving them everything they want under one roof , " he said . attractive for every sector andreas reidl , director of the nuremberg-based agency for generation marketing , a consulting firm specializing on the senior market , said that the silver-haired market for almost every sector is an attractive one , be it tourism , health products , financial services or food .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp what we know for sure is that britain is in the crosshairs of terrorist groups .
whether it 's britain 's involvement in driving the iraq war , its military presence there , salman rushdie 's knighthood , tony blair 's appointment as the new envoy of the mideast quartet or just simply britain 's colonial past in wide swathes of the muslim world , the united kingdom offers plenty of motives for terrorism .
not to mention the fact that britain is home to an army of discontented muslims from whose ranks the train bombers from two years ago were recruited .
there are indications that the car bombs did n't have an internal british motive but rather that the " network " -lrb- al qaeda -rrb- planned to strike with local help , as always .
the construction of the bombs points towards that theory , and there was also apparently quite a clear warning on the internet that london would be the target of an attack .

remaining vigilant does n't just mean keeping your nerve and gritting your teeth .

german finance minister peer steinbrück said the economic boom will allow the federal government to stop accumulating new debt by 2011 .
critics say this is n't ambitious enough . on wednesday , steinbrück , a social democrat , is expected to present his budget proposal for 2008 to his cabinet colleagues for approval before the document heads to parliament .
while the financial plan for the coming year will still include new debt of about 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.5 billion -rrb- , steinbrück said that this is already 40 percent less than originally expected .
the finance minister expects to spend 283.2 billion euros in 2008 , up 12.7 billion euros compared to 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrück is happy about germany 's budgetary outlook by 2011 , germany will be able to do without borrowing more money , according to steinbrück .
he said he plans to use and budget surplus to reduce the country 's debt of 900 billion euros .
currently , germany pays about 40 billion euros per year in interest on its debt .
an increase in interest rates will cost the country an additional 2.8 billion euros in 2008 .
too cautious ?
budget experts of germany 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which forms a grand coalition with steinbrück 's social democratic party , said that the finance minister 's proposals did n't go far enough .
steffen kampeter , the budget expert for the cdu in parliament , said that germany should already be able to borrow significantly less money in 2007 than expected .
he also criticized that steinbrück 's plan aimed to reduce new debt via tax revenue rather than cutting costs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an early balance budget would look good for steinbrück on election day opposition members also attacked steinbrück for not doing enough to save money and said that a balanced budget by 2011 was not ambitious enough .
" for him , the best would be to reach this all of a sudden in 2009 , " otto fricke , the chairman of the parliament 's budget committee , told swr public radio .
" that 's when we 'll have the next election campaign at the latest . "
speaking to the berliner zeitung daily over the weekend , steinbrück did n't exactly deny the allegation .

" the old separation of domestic security and security abroad is yesterday 's news , " merkel said at the headquarters of her conservative christian democrats during a presentation of their draft party platform .
" we have to think in a completely different context .
only then will freedom and security be kept in balance in light of this new threat . "
she said the attacks in new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 , which were planned by students living in germany , had led to " a sea change with consequences . "
under germany 's basic law adopted after the nazi era , the military may only be deployed in the event of a disaster or to provide medical back-up during major public events .
coalition divided over deployment issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is bound by its postwar mandates conservatives have stepped up calls since the september 11 attacks for the government to have more leeway to send troops to defend against a specific threat to the civilian population .
but the social democrats , partners in germany 's left-right ruling coalition , oppose the move as a violation of the country 's strict postwar separation of the mandates of its security services .
the debate in germany has been revived by the series of thwarted terror attacks in britain .
an interior ministry spokesman said monday that german and british authorities had stepped up their cooperation in recent days .
but he added that there was no indication germany faced a specific threat of imminent attacks .
german authorities announced june 22 they had boosted security measures in response to a greater threat of attacks at home and abroad due to the country 's military involvement in afghanistan .
eu chief urges more collaboration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso talked of a need for the eu to work together in the wake of the failed attacks , european commission president jose manuel barroso said that the european union should step up joint action against terrorist threats .
" the recent attacks , fortunately foiled , in london and glasgow have demonstrated the need for us to work together and complete our agenda in the fight against terrorism , " barroso told a news conference on monday .
barroso added that eu legislation on storing data had helped british authorities monitor suspect terrorists before the planned attacks . " the fact we had adopted a directive , according to which data could be stored for longer , played an important role in enabling british police to monitor a number of suspect networks , " he said .
" terrorists do not respect frontiers ; consequently it makes no sense to fight terrorism purely through inter-governmental mechanisms .
we need supranational instruments if we are to be effective against terrorism . "
britain will not bend , says home secretary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smith had a baptism of fire as home secretary meanwhile , british home secretary jacqui smith said that britain will not be intimidated by terrorism in a statement to parliament monday on the weekend 's failed car bombings in london and glasgow .
smith confirmed that six people were under arrest in connection with the police investigation into the incidents , while a further person in hospital was of interest .
she said that police searches had been carried out at 19 locations across the country .
" our top priority has to be the success of the investigation , " smith told members of parliament in the lower house of commons .
" terrorists are criminals whose victims come from all walks of life , " she said , adding : " it is through our unity that the terrorists will eventually be defeated . "
" my aim as home secretary is to allow the british public to live their lives as they would wish , within the law , " she added .
the " strongest message " needed to go out " to those who wish to destroy our way of life and our freedoms that we will not be intimidated by terror . "
uk remains on highest terror alert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nationwide manhunt continues after the attacks britain remains on a " critical " state of terror alert , the highest grade possible , after the attempted attacks , which started off with a mercedes car filled with gasoline , gas and nails , parked outside a busy london nightclub in the early hours of last friday .
officers were able to defuse the device after being alerted to a " smoldering car " by members of an ambulance crew which happened to be in the central london area , at haymarket , at the time .
hours later , police were able to defuse a second mercedes car bomb in a vehicle which had been parked nearby before being towed to a compound after receiving a ticket for being parked illegally .
on saturday afternoon , two men drove a blazing jeep into the main airport terminal building at glasgow , scotland , in an attempted attack linked to the events in london a day earlier , police said . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" baghad comes to london , " was the verdict of some commentators who suspect members of al qaeda to be behind the discovery of two foiled car bombs in the british capital on friday .
as long as the perpetrators remain unidentified , speculation will continue to swirl .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp what we know for sure is that britain is in the crosshairs of terrorist groups .
whether it 's britain 's involvement in driving the iraq war , its military presence there , salman rushdie 's knighthood , tony blair 's appointment as the new envoy of the mideast quartet or just simply britain 's colonial past in wide swathes of the muslim world , the united kingdom offers plenty of motives for terrorism .
not to mention the fact that britain is home to an army of discontented muslims from whose ranks the train bombers from two years ago were recruited .
there are indications that the car bombs did n't have an internal british motive but rather that the " network " -lrb- al qaeda -rrb- planned to strike with local help , as always .
the construction of the bombs points towards that theory , and there was also apparently quite a clear warning on the internet that london would be the target of an attack .
the date too was no coincidence - just hours after a change in britain 's leadership from tony blair to gordon brown and days before the second anniversary of the london bombings .
thanks to a coincidence and the prudence of the british , the tragedy was averted .
the exhaustive cctv surveillance in london will also help in getting leads on the perpetrators .

" baghad comes to london , " was the verdict of some commentators who suspect members of al qaeda to be behind the discovery of two foiled car bombs in the british capital on friday .
as long as the perpetrators remain unidentified , speculation will continue to swirl .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp what we know for sure is that britain is in the crosshairs of terrorist groups .
whether it 's britain 's involvement in driving the iraq war , its military presence there , salman rushdie 's knighthood , tony blair 's appointment as the new envoy of the mideast quartet or just simply britain 's colonial past in wide swathes of the muslim world , the united kingdom offers plenty of motives for terrorism .
not to mention the fact that britain is home to an army of discontented muslims from whose ranks the train bombers from two years ago were recruited .
there are indications that the car bombs did n't have an internal british motive but rather that the " network " -lrb- al qaeda -rrb- planned to strike with local help , as always .
the construction of the bombs points towards that theory , and there was also apparently quite a clear warning on the internet that london would be the target of an attack .
the date too was no coincidence - just hours after a change in britain 's leadership from tony blair to gordon brown and days before the second anniversary of the london bombings .
thanks to a coincidence and the prudence of the british , the tragedy was averted .
the exhaustive cctv surveillance in london will also help in getting leads on the perpetrators .
it 's a system that 's strongly opposed by many in germany as if there was no consideration in weighing the protection of privacy against protecting the general public against terrorist attacks .
you could take a page from britain 's book .
video surveillance does not prevent violent acts , but it does deter them and eases the hunt for perpetrators .
at the same time there is no panic-mongering in britain as was the case in germany recently when different official departments warned of a heightened danger of terrorism .
we all live in an age of heightened danger : whether it 's in london , berlin , paris or amsterdam .
as long as crazed people do n't live out their fanatical fantasies , we ca n't foresee their actions .
we can only counter them by remaining alert .
even though victims ca n't be avoided sometimes , if we do n't allow ourselves to be terrorized then the terrorists have already lost the " first round . "
remaining vigilant does n't just mean keeping your nerve and gritting your teeth .
it also means stopping exaggerated preventive measures .
politicians of all stripes - even in germany - tend to propagate complete surveillance to counter terrorism .
video surveillance is necessary , but if we go further and place limits on our free society because of fear of violence then we would be capitulating to the terrorists .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 02.07.2007 merkel issues renewed call for anti-terror military deployment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a constitutional change would be needed to deploy the military domestically chancellor angela merkel renewed a call monday for the right to deploy the military on german soil in the event of an imminent terrorist threat , after the failed car bombings in britain put europe on alert . merkel told reporters that the current threats facing western countries meant germany must rethink its postwar constitutional restrictions on using its troops .
" the old separation of domestic security and security abroad is yesterday 's news , " merkel said at the headquarters of her conservative christian democrats during a presentation of their draft party platform .
" we have to think in a completely different context .
only then will freedom and security be kept in balance in light of this new threat . "
she said the attacks in new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 , which were planned by students living in germany , had led to " a sea change with consequences . "
under germany 's basic law adopted after the nazi era , the military may only be deployed in the event of a disaster or to provide medical back-up during major public events .
coalition divided over deployment issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is bound by its postwar mandates conservatives have stepped up calls since the september 11 attacks for the government to have more leeway to send troops to defend against a specific threat to the civilian population .
but the social democrats , partners in germany 's left-right ruling coalition , oppose the move as a violation of the country 's strict postwar separation of the mandates of its security services .
the debate in germany has been revived by the series of thwarted terror attacks in britain .
an interior ministry spokesman said monday that german and british authorities had stepped up their cooperation in recent days .
but he added that there was no indication germany faced a specific threat of imminent attacks .
german authorities announced june 22 they had boosted security measures in response to a greater threat of attacks at home and abroad due to the country 's military involvement in afghanistan .
eu chief urges more collaboration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso talked of a need for the eu to work together in the wake of the failed attacks , european commission president jose manuel barroso said that the european union should step up joint action against terrorist threats .
" the recent attacks , fortunately foiled , in london and glasgow have demonstrated the need for us to work together and complete our agenda in the fight against terrorism , " barroso told a news conference on monday .
barroso added that eu legislation on storing data had helped british authorities monitor suspect terrorists before the planned attacks . " the fact we had adopted a directive , according to which data could be stored for longer , played an important role in enabling british police to monitor a number of suspect networks , " he said .
" terrorists do not respect frontiers ; consequently it makes no sense to fight terrorism purely through inter-governmental mechanisms .
we need supranational instruments if we are to be effective against terrorism . "
britain will not bend , says home secretary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smith had a baptism of fire as home secretary meanwhile , british home secretary jacqui smith said that britain will not be intimidated by terrorism in a statement to parliament monday on the weekend 's failed car bombings in london and glasgow .
smith confirmed that six people were under arrest in connection with the police investigation into the incidents , while a further person in hospital was of interest .
she said that police searches had been carried out at 19 locations across the country .
" our top priority has to be the success of the investigation , " smith told members of parliament in the lower house of commons .
" terrorists are criminals whose victims come from all walks of life , " she said , adding : " it is through our unity that the terrorists will eventually be defeated . "
" my aim as home secretary is to allow the british public to live their lives as they would wish , within the law , " she added .
the " strongest message " needed to go out " to those who wish to destroy our way of life and our freedoms that we will not be intimidated by terror . "
uk remains on highest terror alert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nationwide manhunt continues after the attacks britain remains on a " critical " state of terror alert , the highest grade possible , after the attempted attacks , which started off with a mercedes car filled with gasoline , gas and nails , parked outside a busy london nightclub in the early hours of last friday .
officers were able to defuse the device after being alerted to a " smoldering car " by members of an ambulance crew which happened to be in the central london area , at haymarket , at the time .
hours later , police were able to defuse a second mercedes car bomb in a vehicle which had been parked nearby before being towed to a compound after receiving a ticket for being parked illegally .
on saturday afternoon , two men drove a blazing jeep into the main airport terminal building at glasgow , scotland , in an attempted attack linked to the events in london a day earlier , police said . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german finance minister peer steinbrück said the economic boom will allow the federal government to stop accumulating new debt by 2011 .
critics say this is n't ambitious enough . on wednesday , steinbrück , a social democrat , is expected to present his budget proposal for 2008 to his cabinet colleagues for approval before the document heads to parliament .
while the financial plan for the coming year will still include new debt of about 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.5 billion -rrb- , steinbrück said that this is already 40 percent less than originally expected .
the finance minister expects to spend 283.2 billion euros in 2008 , up 12.7 billion euros compared to 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrück is happy about germany 's budgetary outlook by 2011 , germany will be able to do without borrowing more money , according to steinbrück .
he said he plans to use and budget surplus to reduce the country 's debt of 900 billion euros .
currently , germany pays about 40 billion euros per year in interest on its debt .
an increase in interest rates will cost the country an additional 2.8 billion euros in 2008 .
too cautious ?
budget experts of germany 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which forms a grand coalition with steinbrück 's social democratic party , said that the finance minister 's proposals did n't go far enough .
steffen kampeter , the budget expert for the cdu in parliament , said that germany should already be able to borrow significantly less money in 2007 than expected .
he also criticized that steinbrück 's plan aimed to reduce new debt via tax revenue rather than cutting costs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an early balance budget would look good for steinbrück on election day opposition members also attacked steinbrück for not doing enough to save money and said that a balanced budget by 2011 was not ambitious enough .

german finance minister peer steinbrück said the economic boom will allow the federal government to stop accumulating new debt by 2011 .
critics say this is n't ambitious enough . on wednesday , steinbrück , a social democrat , is expected to present his budget proposal for 2008 to his cabinet colleagues for approval before the document heads to parliament .
while the financial plan for the coming year will still include new debt of about 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.5 billion -rrb- , steinbrück said that this is already 40 percent less than originally expected .
the finance minister expects to spend 283.2 billion euros in 2008 , up 12.7 billion euros compared to 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrück is happy about germany 's budgetary outlook by 2011 , germany will be able to do without borrowing more money , according to steinbrück .
he said he plans to use and budget surplus to reduce the country 's debt of 900 billion euros .
currently , germany pays about 40 billion euros per year in interest on its debt .
an increase in interest rates will cost the country an additional 2.8 billion euros in 2008 .
too cautious ?
budget experts of germany 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which forms a grand coalition with steinbrück 's social democratic party , said that the finance minister 's proposals did n't go far enough .
steffen kampeter , the budget expert for the cdu in parliament , said that germany should already be able to borrow significantly less money in 2007 than expected .
he also criticized that steinbrück 's plan aimed to reduce new debt via tax revenue rather than cutting costs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an early balance budget would look good for steinbrück on election day opposition members also attacked steinbrück for not doing enough to save money and said that a balanced budget by 2011 was not ambitious enough .
" for him , the best would be to reach this all of a sudden in 2009 , " otto fricke , the chairman of the parliament 's budget committee , told swr public radio .
" that 's when we 'll have the next election campaign at the latest . "
speaking to the berliner zeitung daily over the weekend , steinbrück did n't exactly deny the allegation .

the arrests bring the number of people held over the three attacks to seven .
surveillance needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants more video surveillance britain has some of the most extensive video surveillance in the world , and germany needs to follow suit by installing more video surveillance in large cities , german interior minister schäuble said in a television interview sunday .
" i think that this is fundamentally important , " schäuble said .
surveillance is already being used in places where the federal government has control over security , such as in train stations and airports , he added .
regional police have to decide how far to go with video monitoring in cities , schäuble said in a radio interview monday .
terrorism attacks can only be prevented when terrorists ' intentions are known , schäuble said .
islamist terrorists have germany in their sights , said konrad freiberg , president of germany 's police union .
" we must count on strong attacks on us in the near future , " freiberg said in an article published in the passauer neuen presse newspaper monday .
french officials discuss attacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk remains on high alert france is also on high terror alert after senior officials met sunday to discuss how to best react to the attempts in britain .
" it is obvious that france , like a number of other countries , is a potential target of terrorism , " french interior minister michele alliot-marie told reporters following the meeting .
france kept its terrorist level at its second highest , " red . "
the highest level is " scarlet . "
french president nicolas sarkozy sent a note to british prime minister gordon brown , offering help in the investigation .
" in this implacable fight against terrorism , our countries are not only unfailingly united , but also in close and constant cooperation , " sarkozy said in the note sent saturday .
british investigation continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : home secretary smith briefs media on the attacks in britain , police warned travelers to expect delays at airports and train stations .
controls and searches of cars were being increased amid fears of further attacks .
police said they have found links between two cars filled with gas canisters and nails in london 's entertainment district friday and a jeep which rammed into the glasgow airport saturday .
police anti-terror chief peter clarke told reporters in glasgow that the investigation was " extremely fast-moving " and added that the links between the three attacks in london and one in glasgow were becoming " ever clearer . "
police have said the suspects are not british , with news reports saying one is iranian .
scottish government leader alex salmond said two suspects caught in the attempted jeep bombing of the glasgow airport had " not lived in scotland for long . "
one of the two suspects in the glasgow attack remains in critical conditions with severe burns at a nearby hospital .
he is under armed police guard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators at the glasgow airport british home secretary jacqui smith said it was " speculation " to talk about the nationalities of the suspects .
" we ca n't know , for example , everything about the identities of those who have been arrested , " smith said monday in an interview with sky news .
smith said she was encouraged by the progress made in the investigation .
she was scheduled to update lawmakers on the probe on monday .
us wants more checks on europeans us president george w. bush praised brown 's " very strong response " to the attempted attacks , and us homeland security head michael chertoff said the us takes the threat in britain seriously and added that extra air marshals will be deployed on flights to britain .
additionally , the us wants to further increase checks on people traveling from europe to the states , he said .
" it 's one of the reasons we 've been very focused on increasing our security for people incoming from europe , " he said .

elsewhere in europe , premier gordon brown 's handling of the situation got mixed reviews . " the immediate aftermath of a terrorist atrocity is the worst possible time to legislate , " the right-wing daily telegraph declared in its editorial .
" the government 's response to the bombers should be proportionate to the threat faced , not to the public outrage .
there is always a temptation for ministers to look tough by awarding themselves new powers instead of using the powers already at their disposal . " the independent , a left-wing paper , took a similar line , declaring in its editorial that it " is vital that the prime minister does not rush through new repressive anti-terror laws ... it is vital that our political leaders pause for thought . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown steped out of the way to let police investigate , the daily mail said the daily mail , a right-wing paper that is often critical of the governing labour party , offered tentative praise for new prime minister gordon brown , who only took over from tony blair on wednesday , and new home secretary jacqui smith .
it described the pair as " a new prime minister and a rookie home secretary both facing a huge test within hours of taking office and both , it must be said , commendably keeping their nerve .
this time ... there has been no political grandstanding , no promises of ' tough ' new measures .
instead , gordon brown and jacqui smith concentrate on reassuring the public and letting police and -lrb- domestic intelligence service -rrb- mi5 get on with the job .

" appearing more wooden than usual and speaking in a weirdly tired voice , he praised the heroic courage of police and other emergency services and offered platitudes about the dangers of international terrorism , " wrote the paper .
" the difference in style was hard to miss .
while blair had the instinct to comfort people after dramatic events such as the death of princess diana or the terror attacks in new york and london , brown appeared more like a us marshal , who is pressuring people into becoming auxiliary sheriffs .

" withdrawing british troops from iraq or afghanistan would not end the homemade terror in britain .
western democracies have to have a three-fold response : there has to be the harshest response on the judicial level without introducing exceptions such as guantanamo that only feed the hatred .

and finally , there needs to be a cultural response .
we have to learn to live with a multicultural population without renouncing our own values .

" the old separation of domestic security and security abroad is yesterday 's news , " merkel said at the headquarters of her conservative christian democrats during a presentation of their draft party platform .
" we have to think in a completely different context .
only then will freedom and security be kept in balance in light of this new threat . "
she said the attacks in new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 , which were planned by students living in germany , had led to " a sea change with consequences . "
under germany 's basic law adopted after the nazi era , the military may only be deployed in the event of a disaster or to provide medical back-up during major public events .
coalition divided over deployment issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is bound by its postwar mandates conservatives have stepped up calls since the september 11 attacks for the government to have more leeway to send troops to defend against a specific threat to the civilian population .
but the social democrats , partners in germany 's left-right ruling coalition , oppose the move as a violation of the country 's strict postwar separation of the mandates of its security services .
the debate in germany has been revived by the series of thwarted terror attacks in britain .
an interior ministry spokesman said monday that german and british authorities had stepped up their cooperation in recent days .
but he added that there was no indication germany faced a specific threat of imminent attacks .
german authorities announced june 22 they had boosted security measures in response to a greater threat of attacks at home and abroad due to the country 's military involvement in afghanistan .
eu chief urges more collaboration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso talked of a need for the eu to work together in the wake of the failed attacks , european commission president jose manuel barroso said that the european union should step up joint action against terrorist threats .
" the recent attacks , fortunately foiled , in london and glasgow have demonstrated the need for us to work together and complete our agenda in the fight against terrorism , " barroso told a news conference on monday .
barroso added that eu legislation on storing data had helped british authorities monitor suspect terrorists before the planned attacks . " the fact we had adopted a directive , according to which data could be stored for longer , played an important role in enabling british police to monitor a number of suspect networks , " he said .
" terrorists do not respect frontiers ; consequently it makes no sense to fight terrorism purely through inter-governmental mechanisms .
we need supranational instruments if we are to be effective against terrorism . "
britain will not bend , says home secretary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smith had a baptism of fire as home secretary meanwhile , british home secretary jacqui smith said that britain will not be intimidated by terrorism in a statement to parliament monday on the weekend 's failed car bombings in london and glasgow .
smith confirmed that six people were under arrest in connection with the police investigation into the incidents , while a further person in hospital was of interest .
she said that police searches had been carried out at 19 locations across the country .
" our top priority has to be the success of the investigation , " smith told members of parliament in the lower house of commons .
" terrorists are criminals whose victims come from all walks of life , " she said , adding : " it is through our unity that the terrorists will eventually be defeated . "
" my aim as home secretary is to allow the british public to live their lives as they would wish , within the law , " she added .
the " strongest message " needed to go out " to those who wish to destroy our way of life and our freedoms that we will not be intimidated by terror . "

officers were able to defuse the device after being alerted to a " smoldering car " by members of an ambulance crew which happened to be in the central london area , at haymarket , at the time .
hours later , police were able to defuse a second mercedes car bomb in a vehicle which had been parked nearby before being towed to a compound after receiving a ticket for being parked illegally .

but the social democrats , partners in germany 's left-right ruling coalition , oppose the move as a violation of the country 's strict postwar separation of the mandates of its security services .
the debate in germany has been revived by the series of thwarted terror attacks in britain .
an interior ministry spokesman said monday that german and british authorities had stepped up their cooperation in recent days .

" the old separation of domestic security and security abroad is yesterday 's news , " merkel said at the headquarters of her conservative christian democrats during a presentation of their draft party platform .
" we have to think in a completely different context .
only then will freedom and security be kept in balance in light of this new threat . "
she said the attacks in new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 , which were planned by students living in germany , had led to " a sea change with consequences . "
under germany 's basic law adopted after the nazi era , the military may only be deployed in the event of a disaster or to provide medical back-up during major public events .

but demands to cut co2 emissions may see a reversal .
the topic is likely to light up tuesday 's energy summit . german chancellor angela merkel hosts the third federal energy summit in berlin on tuesday with a huge question mark hanging over the source of germany 's future energy supplies and the environmental impact of those sources currently available .
merkel will discuss germany 's future energy needs and how best to conserve energy with business and political leaders from around the country .
however , while the summit is likely to address such issues as reducing co2 output by 40 percent before 2020 , the upgrading of renewable source technology such as solar , wind and biomass energy and the economic impact of the new technology , the main discussion is likely to be on the highly divisive topic of nuclear power .
current german legislation requires all 17 of germany 's existing nuclear power plants to close by 2021 but , using the argument of nuclear power 's ability to help reduce carbon-dioxide emissions , plant operators and center-right politicians have been calling for a reprieve .
however , safety issues surrounding nuclear power have weakened this position , especially after two nuclear power stations went offline last week .
the transformer at the krümmel power station , east of the port city of hamburg , was destroyed by fire last thursday , two hours after a short-circuit had knocked out another nuclear site at brunsbüttel on the far side of the city .
while the brunsbüttel power station was back in service the next day , the krümmel station remained closed pending an investigation .
calls for extended lifespan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch leads cdu voices advocating an extension despite the incidents , a number of politicians from merkel 's christian democratic union party -lrb- cdu -rrb- called on monday for an extension to the nuclear power grid 's lifespan .
powerful hessen state premier roland koch , merkel 's second-in-command in the cdu , told zdf television that the ruling coalition government could still decide on lengthening the lifespan of the power stations which , he claimed , would be the most inexpensive way of protecting germany 's energy supply and reducing co2 output .
both cdu energy expert katherina reiche and the lower saxony prime minister christian wulff agreed with koch 's views in separate statements .
when faced with the question of plant security , koch suggested new power stations could take the place of older plants which are more susceptible to malfunctions over time . " the coalition has a lot of freedom to make this decision , " koch added .
social democrats support decommission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel warns about relying on aging plants environment minister sigmar gabriel of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the cdu 's coalition partner in the federal government , does n't agree .
gabriel is against any extension of nuclear 's lifespan and warned that any attempt to get more use out of aging power plants could be catastrophic . " the longer a power station operates , the more susceptible it is to malfunctions , " he said .
the gradual shutdown of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder and his coalition partners at the time , the greens .
however , in the light of rising energy prices and germany 's dependency on foreign energy , mainly from russia , chancellor merkel wants a broader energy mix .
merkel believes germany should continue to use the edge in nuclear technology it has acquired over the years and members of the cdu are pushing for the chancellor to take advantage of clauses in the " coalition contract " on the shutdown of nuclear power to extend its lifespan to reverse the decision .
effective , yet vilified power source bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel do a u-turn over nuclear power ?
merkel is expected to temper the unease over a potential u-turn on nuclear power at the energy summit of tuesday by advocating a 30 percent increase in renewable energy use which would reduce co2 output by 41 percent .
however , a reprieve for nuclear power would lead to a 45 percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions which would make it the most attractive of the scenarios to reach the desired reduction in co2 output by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but demands to cut co2 emissions may see a reversal .
the topic is likely to light up tuesday 's energy summit . german chancellor angela merkel hosts the third federal energy summit in berlin on tuesday with a huge question mark hanging over the source of germany 's future energy supplies and the environmental impact of those sources currently available .
merkel will discuss germany 's future energy needs and how best to conserve energy with business and political leaders from around the country .
however , while the summit is likely to address such issues as reducing co2 output by 40 percent before 2020 , the upgrading of renewable source technology such as solar , wind and biomass energy and the economic impact of the new technology , the main discussion is likely to be on the highly divisive topic of nuclear power .
current german legislation requires all 17 of germany 's existing nuclear power plants to close by 2021 but , using the argument of nuclear power 's ability to help reduce carbon-dioxide emissions , plant operators and center-right politicians have been calling for a reprieve .
however , safety issues surrounding nuclear power have weakened this position , especially after two nuclear power stations went offline last week .
the transformer at the krümmel power station , east of the port city of hamburg , was destroyed by fire last thursday , two hours after a short-circuit had knocked out another nuclear site at brunsbüttel on the far side of the city .
while the brunsbüttel power station was back in service the next day , the krümmel station remained closed pending an investigation .
calls for extended lifespan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch leads cdu voices advocating an extension despite the incidents , a number of politicians from merkel 's christian democratic union party -lrb- cdu -rrb- called on monday for an extension to the nuclear power grid 's lifespan .
powerful hessen state premier roland koch , merkel 's second-in-command in the cdu , told zdf television that the ruling coalition government could still decide on lengthening the lifespan of the power stations which , he claimed , would be the most inexpensive way of protecting germany 's energy supply and reducing co2 output .
both cdu energy expert katherina reiche and the lower saxony prime minister christian wulff agreed with koch 's views in separate statements .
when faced with the question of plant security , koch suggested new power stations could take the place of older plants which are more susceptible to malfunctions over time . " the coalition has a lot of freedom to make this decision , " koch added .

" the sec list , published on the commission 's website under the misleading title " state sponsors of terrorism , " names a number of other european concerns as well as american companies who have dealings with cuba , iran , north korea , sudan and syria .
the companies are accused of " indirectly subsidizing a terrorist state . "
reacting to the blacklist , siemens spokesperson wolfram trost told germany 's handelsblatt financial daily that while there would be no official comment on the company 's inclusion in the sec report , siemens ' connections with the named states were " low level . "
the ' naming and shaming ' of siemens in the report comes at a time when the engineering giant is still dealing with the shockwaves of its latest corruption scandal investigations .
siemens connected to all five rogue states the sec list states that siemens has business dealings with all five named " sponsors of terrorism " while basf is linked solely with iran .
deutsche bank has connections with both iran and sudan .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche bank has links with iran and sudan deutsche bank spokesperson ronald weichert confirmed in the same handelsblatt report that the bank 's " commercial relations " with iran and sudan were common knowledge . the naming of companies with business ties with rogue states , he added , was " a habit of the united states " and one that the german companies must accept .
objections to " unclear " list many of the companies listed are objecting to the sec blacklist , stating that the list does not make clear the extent of a company 's business in such states or whether they still have ties .
others claim that they are being punished for their transparency in their international dealings .
todd malan , president of the organization for international investment , which represents 1,200 foreign companies with us listings , issued a statement saying that the blacklist had no threshold for judging whether a company was doing " a material level of business in a country . "
sec takes investor protection stance sec boss christopher cox retaliated by saying : " no investor should be in any doubt whether or not his investment supports - directly or indirectly - a terror state or a state in which genocide takes place . "
cox added that all the enterprises have been obliged for some time to disclose their activities in the " rogue states " and that the list was intended to make public what many in financial circles already knew .
" our task is to protect the investors , " cox was quoted as saying in handelsblatt . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the construction of the bombs points towards that theory , and there was also apparently quite a clear warning on the internet that london would be the target of an attack .

" baghad comes to london , " was the verdict of some commentators who suspect members of al qaeda to be behind the discovery of two foiled car bombs in the british capital on friday .
as long as the perpetrators remain unidentified , speculation will continue to swirl .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp what we know for sure is that britain is in the crosshairs of terrorist groups .
whether it 's britain 's involvement in driving the iraq war , its military presence there , salman rushdie 's knighthood , tony blair 's appointment as the new envoy of the mideast quartet or just simply britain 's colonial past in wide swathes of the muslim world , the united kingdom offers plenty of motives for terrorism .
not to mention the fact that britain is home to an army of discontented muslims from whose ranks the train bombers from two years ago were recruited .
there are indications that the car bombs did n't have an internal british motive but rather that the " network " -lrb- al qaeda -rrb- planned to strike with local help , as always .
the construction of the bombs points towards that theory , and there was also apparently quite a clear warning on the internet that london would be the target of an attack .
the date too was no coincidence - just hours after a change in britain 's leadership from tony blair to gordon brown and days before the second anniversary of the london bombings .
thanks to a coincidence and the prudence of the british , the tragedy was averted .
the exhaustive cctv surveillance in london will also help in getting leads on the perpetrators .
it 's a system that 's strongly opposed by many in germany as if there was no consideration in weighing the protection of privacy against protecting the general public against terrorist attacks .
you could take a page from britain 's book .
video surveillance does not prevent violent acts , but it does deter them and eases the hunt for perpetrators .
at the same time there is no panic-mongering in britain as was the case in germany recently when different official departments warned of a heightened danger of terrorism .
we all live in an age of heightened danger : whether it 's in london , berlin , paris or amsterdam .
as long as crazed people do n't live out their fanatical fantasies , we ca n't foresee their actions .
we can only counter them by remaining alert .
even though victims ca n't be avoided sometimes , if we do n't allow ourselves to be terrorized then the terrorists have already lost the " first round . "
remaining vigilant does n't just mean keeping your nerve and gritting your teeth .
it also means stopping exaggerated preventive measures .
politicians of all stripes - even in germany - tend to propagate complete surveillance to counter terrorism .
video surveillance is necessary , but if we go further and place limits on our free society because of fear of violence then we would be capitulating to the terrorists .

the uk had three attempted car bombings in recent days .
european countries have called for coordination and surveillance . british police arrested two additional men monday afternoon in connection with the failed car bombings in london and glasgow .
police in scotland said two men , aged 28 and 25 , were being held in connection with the attempted car bombing of glasgow airport saturday .
the men are not believed to be of scottish origin .
the arrests were the result of " intensive police operations " in paisley , a small town near glasgow .
the arrests bring the number of people held over the three attacks to seven .
surveillance needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants more video surveillance britain has some of the most extensive video surveillance in the world , and germany needs to follow suit by installing more video surveillance in large cities , german interior minister schäuble said in a television interview sunday .
" i think that this is fundamentally important , " schäuble said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 02.07.2007 european press review : brown 's acid test großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown has had little to smile about in his first few days in office british papers on monday cautioned the new government against overreaction and a rush to introduce new anti-terror legislation .
elsewhere in europe , premier gordon brown 's handling of the situation got mixed reviews . " the immediate aftermath of a terrorist atrocity is the worst possible time to legislate , " the right-wing daily telegraph declared in its editorial .
" the government 's response to the bombers should be proportionate to the threat faced , not to the public outrage .
there is always a temptation for ministers to look tough by awarding themselves new powers instead of using the powers already at their disposal . " the independent , a left-wing paper , took a similar line , declaring in its editorial that it " is vital that the prime minister does not rush through new repressive anti-terror laws ... it is vital that our political leaders pause for thought . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown steped out of the way to let police investigate , the daily mail said the daily mail , a right-wing paper that is often critical of the governing labour party , offered tentative praise for new prime minister gordon brown , who only took over from tony blair on wednesday , and new home secretary jacqui smith .
it described the pair as " a new prime minister and a rookie home secretary both facing a huge test within hours of taking office and both , it must be said , commendably keeping their nerve .
this time ... there has been no political grandstanding , no promises of ' tough ' new measures .
instead , gordon brown and jacqui smith concentrate on reassuring the public and letting police and -lrb- domestic intelligence service -rrb- mi5 get on with the job .
and that is surely right . " in germany , the süddeutsche zeitung in munich meanwhile commented on brown 's lack of charisma .

elsewhere in europe , premier gordon brown 's handling of the situation got mixed reviews . " the immediate aftermath of a terrorist atrocity is the worst possible time to legislate , " the right-wing daily telegraph declared in its editorial .
" the government 's response to the bombers should be proportionate to the threat faced , not to the public outrage .
there is always a temptation for ministers to look tough by awarding themselves new powers instead of using the powers already at their disposal . " the independent , a left-wing paper , took a similar line , declaring in its editorial that it " is vital that the prime minister does not rush through new repressive anti-terror laws ... it is vital that our political leaders pause for thought . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown steped out of the way to let police investigate , the daily mail said the daily mail , a right-wing paper that is often critical of the governing labour party , offered tentative praise for new prime minister gordon brown , who only took over from tony blair on wednesday , and new home secretary jacqui smith .
it described the pair as " a new prime minister and a rookie home secretary both facing a huge test within hours of taking office and both , it must be said , commendably keeping their nerve .
this time ... there has been no political grandstanding , no promises of ' tough ' new measures .
instead , gordon brown and jacqui smith concentrate on reassuring the public and letting police and -lrb- domestic intelligence service -rrb- mi5 get on with the job .
and that is surely right . " in germany , the süddeutsche zeitung in munich meanwhile commented on brown 's lack of charisma .
" appearing more wooden than usual and speaking in a weirdly tired voice , he praised the heroic courage of police and other emergency services and offered platitudes about the dangers of international terrorism , " wrote the paper .
" the difference in style was hard to miss .
while blair had the instinct to comfort people after dramatic events such as the death of princess diana or the terror attacks in new york and london , brown appeared more like a us marshal , who is pressuring people into becoming auxiliary sheriffs .
it was hard to keep track of how many times he admonished voters to be vigil . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least one suspect remains at large french daily liberation looked at what lies ahead in the war against terror .
" withdrawing british troops from iraq or afghanistan would not end the homemade terror in britain .
western democracies have to have a three-fold response : there has to be the harshest response on the judicial level without introducing exceptions such as guantanamo that only feed the hatred .
diplomatically , the us and britain have to rethink their policy in iraq and the middle east .
and finally , there needs to be a cultural response .
we have to learn to live with a multicultural population without renouncing our own values .
we have to integrate foreigners in order to isolate the minority that has chosen terror and violence .
if we win this struggle , democracy will emerge with newfound strength . " madrid 's abc was more interested in the immediate response : " it 's obvious that the free world is the target of a massive attack that tries to conquer our society by force , " the paper opined .
" the planned massacres in great britain clearly were meant to coincide with the handover of power to prime minister gordon brown .
it 's easy to figure out that the perpetrators wanted to force london to change plans for troops in iraq and other countries .
brown 's decisive and rigorous answer is the best one . " compiled by dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the sec list , published on the commission 's website under the misleading title " state sponsors of terrorism , " names a number of other european concerns as well as american companies who have dealings with cuba , iran , north korea , sudan and syria .
the companies are accused of " indirectly subsidizing a terrorist state . "
reacting to the blacklist , siemens spokesperson wolfram trost told germany 's handelsblatt financial daily that while there would be no official comment on the company 's inclusion in the sec report , siemens ' connections with the named states were " low level . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 02.07.2007 opinion : germany could take a page from britain 's book großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain currently offers plenty of motives for terrorism , but we can also learn something from the country 's prudent response to the foiled car bombs , said dw 's peter philipp . " baghad comes to london , " was the verdict of some commentators who suspect members of al qaeda to be behind the discovery of two foiled car bombs in the british capital on friday .
as long as the perpetrators remain unidentified , speculation will continue to swirl .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp what we know for sure is that britain is in the crosshairs of terrorist groups .
whether it 's britain 's involvement in driving the iraq war , its military presence there , salman rushdie 's knighthood , tony blair 's appointment as the new envoy of the mideast quartet or just simply britain 's colonial past in wide swathes of the muslim world , the united kingdom offers plenty of motives for terrorism .
not to mention the fact that britain is home to an army of discontented muslims from whose ranks the train bombers from two years ago were recruited .
there are indications that the car bombs did n't have an internal british motive but rather that the " network " -lrb- al qaeda -rrb- planned to strike with local help , as always .
the construction of the bombs points towards that theory , and there was also apparently quite a clear warning on the internet that london would be the target of an attack .
the date too was no coincidence - just hours after a change in britain 's leadership from tony blair to gordon brown and days before the second anniversary of the london bombings .
thanks to a coincidence and the prudence of the british , the tragedy was averted .
the exhaustive cctv surveillance in london will also help in getting leads on the perpetrators .
it 's a system that 's strongly opposed by many in germany as if there was no consideration in weighing the protection of privacy against protecting the general public against terrorist attacks .
you could take a page from britain 's book .
video surveillance does not prevent violent acts , but it does deter them and eases the hunt for perpetrators .
at the same time there is no panic-mongering in britain as was the case in germany recently when different official departments warned of a heightened danger of terrorism .
we all live in an age of heightened danger : whether it 's in london , berlin , paris or amsterdam .
as long as crazed people do n't live out their fanatical fantasies , we ca n't foresee their actions .
we can only counter them by remaining alert .
even though victims ca n't be avoided sometimes , if we do n't allow ourselves to be terrorized then the terrorists have already lost the " first round . "
remaining vigilant does n't just mean keeping your nerve and gritting your teeth .
it also means stopping exaggerated preventive measures .
politicians of all stripes - even in germany - tend to propagate complete surveillance to counter terrorism .
video surveillance is necessary , but if we go further and place limits on our free society because of fear of violence then we would be capitulating to the terrorists .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 02.07.2007 opinion : germany could take a page from britain 's book großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain currently offers plenty of motives for terrorism , but we can also learn something from the country 's prudent response to the foiled car bombs , said dw 's peter philipp . " baghad comes to london , " was the verdict of some commentators who suspect members of al qaeda to be behind the discovery of two foiled car bombs in the british capital on friday .
as long as the perpetrators remain unidentified , speculation will continue to swirl .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp what we know for sure is that britain is in the crosshairs of terrorist groups .
whether it 's britain 's involvement in driving the iraq war , its military presence there , salman rushdie 's knighthood , tony blair 's appointment as the new envoy of the mideast quartet or just simply britain 's colonial past in wide swathes of the muslim world , the united kingdom offers plenty of motives for terrorism .
not to mention the fact that britain is home to an army of discontented muslims from whose ranks the train bombers from two years ago were recruited .
there are indications that the car bombs did n't have an internal british motive but rather that the " network " -lrb- al qaeda -rrb- planned to strike with local help , as always .
the construction of the bombs points towards that theory , and there was also apparently quite a clear warning on the internet that london would be the target of an attack .
the date too was no coincidence - just hours after a change in britain 's leadership from tony blair to gordon brown and days before the second anniversary of the london bombings .
thanks to a coincidence and the prudence of the british , the tragedy was averted .

german finance minister peer steinbrück said the economic boom will allow the federal government to stop accumulating new debt by 2011 .
critics say this is n't ambitious enough . on wednesday , steinbrück , a social democrat , is expected to present his budget proposal for 2008 to his cabinet colleagues for approval before the document heads to parliament .
while the financial plan for the coming year will still include new debt of about 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.5 billion -rrb- , steinbrück said that this is already 40 percent less than originally expected .
the finance minister expects to spend 283.2 billion euros in 2008 , up 12.7 billion euros compared to 2007 .

he said he plans to use and budget surplus to reduce the country 's debt of 900 billion euros .
currently , germany pays about 40 billion euros per year in interest on its debt .
an increase in interest rates will cost the country an additional 2.8 billion euros in 2008 .
too cautious ?
budget experts of germany 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which forms a grand coalition with steinbrück 's social democratic party , said that the finance minister 's proposals did n't go far enough .

german finance minister peer steinbrück said the economic boom will allow the federal government to stop accumulating new debt by 2011 .
critics say this is n't ambitious enough . on wednesday , steinbrück , a social democrat , is expected to present his budget proposal for 2008 to his cabinet colleagues for approval before the document heads to parliament .
while the financial plan for the coming year will still include new debt of about 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.5 billion -rrb- , steinbrück said that this is already 40 percent less than originally expected .
the finance minister expects to spend 283.2 billion euros in 2008 , up 12.7 billion euros compared to 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrück is happy about germany 's budgetary outlook by 2011 , germany will be able to do without borrowing more money , according to steinbrück .
he said he plans to use and budget surplus to reduce the country 's debt of 900 billion euros .
currently , germany pays about 40 billion euros per year in interest on its debt .
an increase in interest rates will cost the country an additional 2.8 billion euros in 2008 .
too cautious ?
budget experts of germany 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which forms a grand coalition with steinbrück 's social democratic party , said that the finance minister 's proposals did n't go far enough .
steffen kampeter , the budget expert for the cdu in parliament , said that germany should already be able to borrow significantly less money in 2007 than expected .
he also criticized that steinbrück 's plan aimed to reduce new debt via tax revenue rather than cutting costs .

as germany ages , marketing to the gray consumer will likely be a winning business strategy . a coach pulls in to a parking lot of a nondescript building in an industrial park on the outskirts of grossräschen , a small town just over an hour south of berlin .
inside , the women , and one man , are getting ready for the runway .
they 're tying on colorful scarves , adjusting bright skirts and slipping on not stilettos but sensible shoes - a first sign that this is no ordinary fashion show they 're readying for . the arrivals file in and sit at tables laid out with coffee and cake .
a salesperson takes a microphone and introduces the first model , frau schütz , who comes out in a linen jacket and skirt . she 's no beanpole-thin waif . frau schütz is well over 50 and has a figure that might be called rubenesque . but that 's fine with the members of this group , aged from their early 60s to mid 80s .
fickle trends and size zero clothes are n't exactly what they 're in the market for . " older people also want something chic and stylish , and they are n't going to fit into all these super-mini , extra-extra-small things they find in most fashionable stores , " said christa putzke , the head saleswoman at the deliga senior store .
" we offer them clothes that fit this stage of their lives . " products for the golden years besides the clothes on display on the 800 square meters -lrb- 8,611 sq. ft . -rrb- of floor space , the store has a whole range of goods that meet the needs of the over-60 set .
there are talking alarm clocks and telephones with large buttons that make it easier to use for people with poor eyesight and arthritic hands .
there are amplifiers for radios and large magnifying screens for tvs . bildunterschrift : 800 square meters of space a rack with support hose sits next to various kinds of underwear for people with incontinence , while the shoe section features non-slip soles , soft leather and insoles that make walking easier on tired feet . at deliga , everything is on one level ; no stairs block access for those in wheelchairs or using walkers .
the racks are spaced far apart so people can maneuver between them easily .
the saleswomen are relaxed , friendly and do n't pressure anyone to buy . " when you look at stores now , they are n't at all set up for older people , " said putzke .
" the whole market needs to adjust , though , given the realities we 're seeing in germany . " gray horizons the country is looking at a grayer future , age-wise .
while about one in five germans is over the age of 60 today , demographic studies show that by 2050 , more than one in three will be in the golden years . already today , the senior consumer group has purchasing power that retailers should n't ignore .
according to the german institute of economic research , it is estimated at around 316 billion euros -lrb- $ 429 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's an array of products geared toward older people " but the big retail players seem to be asleep at the wheel , " said matthias riepen , who is taking over the deliga store and planning a relaunch in september .
" strangely , they do n't seem to be looking at the senior market very much right now although numerous studies have shown it 's the market of the future . " there have been some exceptions , such as the so-called " generation supermarkets " that have opened up that shops featuring wider aisles , large-print price tags , magnifying glasses on shelves and motorized shopping baskets with seats attached . the deliga store has not been without its problems .
opened in 2005 , it filed for insolvency two weeks ago .
not because of the market , said riepen , but because of mistakes in marketing and day-to-day operations .
for his relaunch in september , riepen plans on giving it a more modern name , updating its product assortment , and embarking on a franchising plan that , he hopes , will see up to three new stores opening in germany next year . " it 's a concept that has n't been tried yet with seniors , giving them everything they want under one roof , " he said . attractive for every sector andreas reidl , director of the nuremberg-based agency for generation marketing , a consulting firm specializing on the senior market , said that the silver-haired market for almost every sector is an attractive one , be it tourism , health products , financial services or food . " the winners will be the ones who are successful in reaching this older clientele , " he said . karin bernau , 66 , who had come with the senior bus group and ended up buying two blouses , a portable chair and a bootjack for her husband , was sold on the concept of a shop designed especially for her age group . " i think we need more stores like this , " she said .
" it 's the older people who have the buying power .
they 've got their pensions and can afford to spend a little . " he husband , werner , 72 , also had good words for the shop , but was rather lukewarm on the mature fashion show . " it was fine , " he said .
" of course , women who are a little thinner are more fun to look at , huh ? " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as germany ages , marketing to the gray consumer will likely be a winning business strategy . a coach pulls in to a parking lot of a nondescript building in an industrial park on the outskirts of grossräschen , a small town just over an hour south of berlin .
inside , the women , and one man , are getting ready for the runway .
they 're tying on colorful scarves , adjusting bright skirts and slipping on not stilettos but sensible shoes - a first sign that this is no ordinary fashion show they 're readying for . the arrivals file in and sit at tables laid out with coffee and cake .
a salesperson takes a microphone and introduces the first model , frau schütz , who comes out in a linen jacket and skirt . she 's no beanpole-thin waif . frau schütz is well over 50 and has a figure that might be called rubenesque . but that 's fine with the members of this group , aged from their early 60s to mid 80s .
fickle trends and size zero clothes are n't exactly what they 're in the market for . " older people also want something chic and stylish , and they are n't going to fit into all these super-mini , extra-extra-small things they find in most fashionable stores , " said christa putzke , the head saleswoman at the deliga senior store .
" we offer them clothes that fit this stage of their lives . " products for the golden years besides the clothes on display on the 800 square meters -lrb- 8,611 sq. ft . -rrb- of floor space , the store has a whole range of goods that meet the needs of the over-60 set .
there are talking alarm clocks and telephones with large buttons that make it easier to use for people with poor eyesight and arthritic hands .
there are amplifiers for radios and large magnifying screens for tvs . bildunterschrift : 800 square meters of space a rack with support hose sits next to various kinds of underwear for people with incontinence , while the shoe section features non-slip soles , soft leather and insoles that make walking easier on tired feet . at deliga , everything is on one level ; no stairs block access for those in wheelchairs or using walkers .
the racks are spaced far apart so people can maneuver between them easily .
the saleswomen are relaxed , friendly and do n't pressure anyone to buy . " when you look at stores now , they are n't at all set up for older people , " said putzke .
" the whole market needs to adjust , though , given the realities we 're seeing in germany . " gray horizons the country is looking at a grayer future , age-wise .
while about one in five germans is over the age of 60 today , demographic studies show that by 2050 , more than one in three will be in the golden years . already today , the senior consumer group has purchasing power that retailers should n't ignore .
according to the german institute of economic research , it is estimated at around 316 billion euros -lrb- $ 429 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's an array of products geared toward older people " but the big retail players seem to be asleep at the wheel , " said matthias riepen , who is taking over the deliga store and planning a relaunch in september .
" strangely , they do n't seem to be looking at the senior market very much right now although numerous studies have shown it 's the market of the future . " there have been some exceptions , such as the so-called " generation supermarkets " that have opened up that shops featuring wider aisles , large-print price tags , magnifying glasses on shelves and motorized shopping baskets with seats attached . the deliga store has not been without its problems .
opened in 2005 , it filed for insolvency two weeks ago .
not because of the market , said riepen , but because of mistakes in marketing and day-to-day operations .
for his relaunch in september , riepen plans on giving it a more modern name , updating its product assortment , and embarking on a franchising plan that , he hopes , will see up to three new stores opening in germany next year . " it 's a concept that has n't been tried yet with seniors , giving them everything they want under one roof , " he said . attractive for every sector andreas reidl , director of the nuremberg-based agency for generation marketing , a consulting firm specializing on the senior market , said that the silver-haired market for almost every sector is an attractive one , be it tourism , health products , financial services or food . " the winners will be the ones who are successful in reaching this older clientele , " he said . karin bernau , 66 , who had come with the senior bus group and ended up buying two blouses , a portable chair and a bootjack for her husband , was sold on the concept of a shop designed especially for her age group . " i think we need more stores like this , " she said .
" it 's the older people who have the buying power .
they 've got their pensions and can afford to spend a little . " he husband , werner , 72 , also had good words for the shop , but was rather lukewarm on the mature fashion show . " it was fine , " he said .
" of course , women who are a little thinner are more fun to look at , huh ? " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german finance minister peer steinbrück said the economic boom will allow the federal government to stop accumulating new debt by 2011 .
critics say this is n't ambitious enough . on wednesday , steinbrück , a social democrat , is expected to present his budget proposal for 2008 to his cabinet colleagues for approval before the document heads to parliament .
while the financial plan for the coming year will still include new debt of about 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.5 billion -rrb- , steinbrück said that this is already 40 percent less than originally expected .
the finance minister expects to spend 283.2 billion euros in 2008 , up 12.7 billion euros compared to 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrück is happy about germany 's budgetary outlook by 2011 , germany will be able to do without borrowing more money , according to steinbrück .
he said he plans to use and budget surplus to reduce the country 's debt of 900 billion euros .
currently , germany pays about 40 billion euros per year in interest on its debt .
an increase in interest rates will cost the country an additional 2.8 billion euros in 2008 .
too cautious ?
budget experts of germany 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which forms a grand coalition with steinbrück 's social democratic party , said that the finance minister 's proposals did n't go far enough .
steffen kampeter , the budget expert for the cdu in parliament , said that germany should already be able to borrow significantly less money in 2007 than expected .
he also criticized that steinbrück 's plan aimed to reduce new debt via tax revenue rather than cutting costs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an early balance budget would look good for steinbrück on election day opposition members also attacked steinbrück for not doing enough to save money and said that a balanced budget by 2011 was not ambitious enough .
" for him , the best would be to reach this all of a sudden in 2009 , " otto fricke , the chairman of the parliament 's budget committee , told swr public radio .
" that 's when we 'll have the next election campaign at the latest . "
speaking to the berliner zeitung daily over the weekend , steinbrück did n't exactly deny the allegation .
" what that be such a bad thing for the republic ? " he asked . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

elsewhere in europe , premier gordon brown 's handling of the situation got mixed reviews . " the immediate aftermath of a terrorist atrocity is the worst possible time to legislate , " the right-wing daily telegraph declared in its editorial .
" the government 's response to the bombers should be proportionate to the threat faced , not to the public outrage .
there is always a temptation for ministers to look tough by awarding themselves new powers instead of using the powers already at their disposal . " the independent , a left-wing paper , took a similar line , declaring in its editorial that it " is vital that the prime minister does not rush through new repressive anti-terror laws ... it is vital that our political leaders pause for thought . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brown steped out of the way to let police investigate , the daily mail said the daily mail , a right-wing paper that is often critical of the governing labour party , offered tentative praise for new prime minister gordon brown , who only took over from tony blair on wednesday , and new home secretary jacqui smith .
it described the pair as " a new prime minister and a rookie home secretary both facing a huge test within hours of taking office and both , it must be said , commendably keeping their nerve .
this time ... there has been no political grandstanding , no promises of ' tough ' new measures .
instead , gordon brown and jacqui smith concentrate on reassuring the public and letting police and -lrb- domestic intelligence service -rrb- mi5 get on with the job .
and that is surely right . " in germany , the süddeutsche zeitung in munich meanwhile commented on brown 's lack of charisma .
" appearing more wooden than usual and speaking in a weirdly tired voice , he praised the heroic courage of police and other emergency services and offered platitudes about the dangers of international terrorism , " wrote the paper .
" the difference in style was hard to miss .
while blair had the instinct to comfort people after dramatic events such as the death of princess diana or the terror attacks in new york and london , brown appeared more like a us marshal , who is pressuring people into becoming auxiliary sheriffs .
it was hard to keep track of how many times he admonished voters to be vigil . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at least one suspect remains at large french daily liberation looked at what lies ahead in the war against terror .
" withdrawing british troops from iraq or afghanistan would not end the homemade terror in britain .
western democracies have to have a three-fold response : there has to be the harshest response on the judicial level without introducing exceptions such as guantanamo that only feed the hatred .

and finally , there needs to be a cultural response .
we have to learn to live with a multicultural population without renouncing our own values .

" the government 's response to the bombers should be proportionate to the threat faced , not to the public outrage .
there is always a temptation for ministers to look tough by awarding themselves new powers instead of using the powers already at their disposal .

it described the pair as " a new prime minister and a rookie home secretary both facing a huge test within hours of taking office and both , it must be said , commendably keeping their nerve .
this time ... there has been no political grandstanding , no promises of ' tough ' new measures .

" appearing more wooden than usual and speaking in a weirdly tired voice , he praised the heroic courage of police and other emergency services and offered platitudes about the dangers of international terrorism , " wrote the paper .
" the difference in style was hard to miss .
while blair had the instinct to comfort people after dramatic events such as the death of princess diana or the terror attacks in new york and london , brown appeared more like a us marshal , who is pressuring people into becoming auxiliary sheriffs .

western democracies have to have a three-fold response : there has to be the harshest response on the judicial level without introducing exceptions such as guantanamo that only feed the hatred .

and finally , there needs to be a cultural response .
we have to learn to live with a multicultural population without renouncing our own values .

the uk had three attempted car bombings in recent days .
european countries have called for coordination and surveillance . british police arrested two additional men monday afternoon in connection with the failed car bombings in london and glasgow .
police in scotland said two men , aged 28 and 25 , were being held in connection with the attempted car bombing of glasgow airport saturday .
the men are not believed to be of scottish origin .
the arrests were the result of " intensive police operations " in paisley , a small town near glasgow .
the arrests bring the number of people held over the three attacks to seven .
surveillance needed bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble wants more video surveillance britain has some of the most extensive video surveillance in the world , and germany needs to follow suit by installing more video surveillance in large cities , german interior minister schäuble said in a television interview sunday .
" i think that this is fundamentally important , " schäuble said .
surveillance is already being used in places where the federal government has control over security , such as in train stations and airports , he added .
regional police have to decide how far to go with video monitoring in cities , schäuble said in a radio interview monday .
terrorism attacks can only be prevented when terrorists ' intentions are known , schäuble said .
islamist terrorists have germany in their sights , said konrad freiberg , president of germany 's police union .
" we must count on strong attacks on us in the near future , " freiberg said in an article published in the passauer neuen presse newspaper monday .
french officials discuss attacks bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the uk remains on high alert france is also on high terror alert after senior officials met sunday to discuss how to best react to the attempts in britain .
" it is obvious that france , like a number of other countries , is a potential target of terrorism , " french interior minister michele alliot-marie told reporters following the meeting .
france kept its terrorist level at its second highest , " red . "
the highest level is " scarlet . "
french president nicolas sarkozy sent a note to british prime minister gordon brown , offering help in the investigation .
" in this implacable fight against terrorism , our countries are not only unfailingly united , but also in close and constant cooperation , " sarkozy said in the note sent saturday .
british investigation continues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : home secretary smith briefs media on the attacks in britain , police warned travelers to expect delays at airports and train stations .
controls and searches of cars were being increased amid fears of further attacks .
police said they have found links between two cars filled with gas canisters and nails in london 's entertainment district friday and a jeep which rammed into the glasgow airport saturday .
police anti-terror chief peter clarke told reporters in glasgow that the investigation was " extremely fast-moving " and added that the links between the three attacks in london and one in glasgow were becoming " ever clearer . "
police have said the suspects are not british , with news reports saying one is iranian .
scottish government leader alex salmond said two suspects caught in the attempted jeep bombing of the glasgow airport had " not lived in scotland for long . "
one of the two suspects in the glasgow attack remains in critical conditions with severe burns at a nearby hospital .
he is under armed police guard . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : investigators at the glasgow airport british home secretary jacqui smith said it was " speculation " to talk about the nationalities of the suspects .
" we ca n't know , for example , everything about the identities of those who have been arrested , " smith said monday in an interview with sky news .
smith said she was encouraged by the progress made in the investigation .
she was scheduled to update lawmakers on the probe on monday .
us wants more checks on europeans us president george w. bush praised brown 's " very strong response " to the attempted attacks , and us homeland security head michael chertoff said the us takes the threat in britain seriously and added that extra air marshals will be deployed on flights to britain .
additionally , the us wants to further increase checks on people traveling from europe to the states , he said .
" it 's one of the reasons we 've been very focused on increasing our security for people incoming from europe , " he said .

as germany ages , marketing to the gray consumer will likely be a winning business strategy . a coach pulls in to a parking lot of a nondescript building in an industrial park on the outskirts of grossräschen , a small town just over an hour south of berlin .
inside , the women , and one man , are getting ready for the runway .
they 're tying on colorful scarves , adjusting bright skirts and slipping on not stilettos but sensible shoes - a first sign that this is no ordinary fashion show they 're readying for . the arrivals file in and sit at tables laid out with coffee and cake .
a salesperson takes a microphone and introduces the first model , frau schütz , who comes out in a linen jacket and skirt . she 's no beanpole-thin waif . frau schütz is well over 50 and has a figure that might be called rubenesque . but that 's fine with the members of this group , aged from their early 60s to mid 80s .
fickle trends and size zero clothes are n't exactly what they 're in the market for . " older people also want something chic and stylish , and they are n't going to fit into all these super-mini , extra-extra-small things they find in most fashionable stores , " said christa putzke , the head saleswoman at the deliga senior store .
" we offer them clothes that fit this stage of their lives . " products for the golden years besides the clothes on display on the 800 square meters -lrb- 8,611 sq. ft . -rrb- of floor space , the store has a whole range of goods that meet the needs of the over-60 set .
there are talking alarm clocks and telephones with large buttons that make it easier to use for people with poor eyesight and arthritic hands .
there are amplifiers for radios and large magnifying screens for tvs . bildunterschrift : 800 square meters of space a rack with support hose sits next to various kinds of underwear for people with incontinence , while the shoe section features non-slip soles , soft leather and insoles that make walking easier on tired feet . at deliga , everything is on one level ; no stairs block access for those in wheelchairs or using walkers .
the racks are spaced far apart so people can maneuver between them easily .
the saleswomen are relaxed , friendly and do n't pressure anyone to buy . " when you look at stores now , they are n't at all set up for older people , " said putzke .
" the whole market needs to adjust , though , given the realities we 're seeing in germany . " gray horizons the country is looking at a grayer future , age-wise .
while about one in five germans is over the age of 60 today , demographic studies show that by 2050 , more than one in three will be in the golden years . already today , the senior consumer group has purchasing power that retailers should n't ignore .
according to the german institute of economic research , it is estimated at around 316 billion euros -lrb- $ 429 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's an array of products geared toward older people " but the big retail players seem to be asleep at the wheel , " said matthias riepen , who is taking over the deliga store and planning a relaunch in september .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 02.07.2007 nuclear power to dominate debate at german energy summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power 's contribution to reducing co2 levels is at the heart of advocates ' arguments germany 's coalition government has a commitment to decommission the country 's nuclear power stations by 2021 .
but demands to cut co2 emissions may see a reversal .
the topic is likely to light up tuesday 's energy summit . german chancellor angela merkel hosts the third federal energy summit in berlin on tuesday with a huge question mark hanging over the source of germany 's future energy supplies and the environmental impact of those sources currently available .
merkel will discuss germany 's future energy needs and how best to conserve energy with business and political leaders from around the country .
however , while the summit is likely to address such issues as reducing co2 output by 40 percent before 2020 , the upgrading of renewable source technology such as solar , wind and biomass energy and the economic impact of the new technology , the main discussion is likely to be on the highly divisive topic of nuclear power .
current german legislation requires all 17 of germany 's existing nuclear power plants to close by 2021 but , using the argument of nuclear power 's ability to help reduce carbon-dioxide emissions , plant operators and center-right politicians have been calling for a reprieve .
however , safety issues surrounding nuclear power have weakened this position , especially after two nuclear power stations went offline last week .
the transformer at the krümmel power station , east of the port city of hamburg , was destroyed by fire last thursday , two hours after a short-circuit had knocked out another nuclear site at brunsbüttel on the far side of the city .
while the brunsbüttel power station was back in service the next day , the krümmel station remained closed pending an investigation .
calls for extended lifespan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch leads cdu voices advocating an extension despite the incidents , a number of politicians from merkel 's christian democratic union party -lrb- cdu -rrb- called on monday for an extension to the nuclear power grid 's lifespan .
powerful hessen state premier roland koch , merkel 's second-in-command in the cdu , told zdf television that the ruling coalition government could still decide on lengthening the lifespan of the power stations which , he claimed , would be the most inexpensive way of protecting germany 's energy supply and reducing co2 output .
both cdu energy expert katherina reiche and the lower saxony prime minister christian wulff agreed with koch 's views in separate statements .
when faced with the question of plant security , koch suggested new power stations could take the place of older plants which are more susceptible to malfunctions over time . " the coalition has a lot of freedom to make this decision , " koch added .
social democrats support decommission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel warns about relying on aging plants environment minister sigmar gabriel of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the cdu 's coalition partner in the federal government , does n't agree .
gabriel is against any extension of nuclear 's lifespan and warned that any attempt to get more use out of aging power plants could be catastrophic . " the longer a power station operates , the more susceptible it is to malfunctions , " he said .
the gradual shutdown of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder and his coalition partners at the time , the greens .
however , in the light of rising energy prices and germany 's dependency on foreign energy , mainly from russia , chancellor merkel wants a broader energy mix .
merkel believes germany should continue to use the edge in nuclear technology it has acquired over the years and members of the cdu are pushing for the chancellor to take advantage of clauses in the " coalition contract " on the shutdown of nuclear power to extend its lifespan to reverse the decision .
effective , yet vilified power source bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel do a u-turn over nuclear power ?
merkel is expected to temper the unease over a potential u-turn on nuclear power at the energy summit of tuesday by advocating a 30 percent increase in renewable energy use which would reduce co2 output by 41 percent .
however , a reprieve for nuclear power would lead to a 45 percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions which would make it the most attractive of the scenarios to reach the desired reduction in co2 output by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the old separation of domestic security and security abroad is yesterday 's news , " merkel said at the headquarters of her conservative christian democrats during a presentation of their draft party platform .
" we have to think in a completely different context .
only then will freedom and security be kept in balance in light of this new threat . "
she said the attacks in new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 , which were planned by students living in germany , had led to " a sea change with consequences . "
under germany 's basic law adopted after the nazi era , the military may only be deployed in the event of a disaster or to provide medical back-up during major public events .
coalition divided over deployment issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is bound by its postwar mandates conservatives have stepped up calls since the september 11 attacks for the government to have more leeway to send troops to defend against a specific threat to the civilian population .
but the social democrats , partners in germany 's left-right ruling coalition , oppose the move as a violation of the country 's strict postwar separation of the mandates of its security services .
the debate in germany has been revived by the series of thwarted terror attacks in britain .
an interior ministry spokesman said monday that german and british authorities had stepped up their cooperation in recent days .
but he added that there was no indication germany faced a specific threat of imminent attacks .
german authorities announced june 22 they had boosted security measures in response to a greater threat of attacks at home and abroad due to the country 's military involvement in afghanistan .
eu chief urges more collaboration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso talked of a need for the eu to work together in the wake of the failed attacks , european commission president jose manuel barroso said that the european union should step up joint action against terrorist threats .
" the recent attacks , fortunately foiled , in london and glasgow have demonstrated the need for us to work together and complete our agenda in the fight against terrorism , " barroso told a news conference on monday .
barroso added that eu legislation on storing data had helped british authorities monitor suspect terrorists before the planned attacks . " the fact we had adopted a directive , according to which data could be stored for longer , played an important role in enabling british police to monitor a number of suspect networks , " he said .
" terrorists do not respect frontiers ; consequently it makes no sense to fight terrorism purely through inter-governmental mechanisms .
we need supranational instruments if we are to be effective against terrorism . "
britain will not bend , says home secretary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smith had a baptism of fire as home secretary meanwhile , british home secretary jacqui smith said that britain will not be intimidated by terrorism in a statement to parliament monday on the weekend 's failed car bombings in london and glasgow .
smith confirmed that six people were under arrest in connection with the police investigation into the incidents , while a further person in hospital was of interest .
she said that police searches had been carried out at 19 locations across the country .
" our top priority has to be the success of the investigation , " smith told members of parliament in the lower house of commons .
" terrorists are criminals whose victims come from all walks of life , " she said , adding : " it is through our unity that the terrorists will eventually be defeated . "
" my aim as home secretary is to allow the british public to live their lives as they would wish , within the law , " she added .
the " strongest message " needed to go out " to those who wish to destroy our way of life and our freedoms that we will not be intimidated by terror . "
uk remains on highest terror alert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nationwide manhunt continues after the attacks britain remains on a " critical " state of terror alert , the highest grade possible , after the attempted attacks , which started off with a mercedes car filled with gasoline , gas and nails , parked outside a busy london nightclub in the early hours of last friday .
officers were able to defuse the device after being alerted to a " smoldering car " by members of an ambulance crew which happened to be in the central london area , at haymarket , at the time .
hours later , police were able to defuse a second mercedes car bomb in a vehicle which had been parked nearby before being towed to a compound after receiving a ticket for being parked illegally .

as germany ages , marketing to the gray consumer will likely be a winning business strategy . a coach pulls in to a parking lot of a nondescript building in an industrial park on the outskirts of grossräschen , a small town just over an hour south of berlin .
inside , the women , and one man , are getting ready for the runway .
they 're tying on colorful scarves , adjusting bright skirts and slipping on not stilettos but sensible shoes - a first sign that this is no ordinary fashion show they 're readying for . the arrivals file in and sit at tables laid out with coffee and cake .
a salesperson takes a microphone and introduces the first model , frau schütz , who comes out in a linen jacket and skirt . she 's no beanpole-thin waif . frau schütz is well over 50 and has a figure that might be called rubenesque . but that 's fine with the members of this group , aged from their early 60s to mid 80s .
fickle trends and size zero clothes are n't exactly what they 're in the market for . " older people also want something chic and stylish , and they are n't going to fit into all these super-mini , extra-extra-small things they find in most fashionable stores , " said christa putzke , the head saleswoman at the deliga senior store .
" we offer them clothes that fit this stage of their lives . " products for the golden years besides the clothes on display on the 800 square meters -lrb- 8,611 sq. ft . -rrb- of floor space , the store has a whole range of goods that meet the needs of the over-60 set .
there are talking alarm clocks and telephones with large buttons that make it easier to use for people with poor eyesight and arthritic hands .
there are amplifiers for radios and large magnifying screens for tvs . bildunterschrift : 800 square meters of space a rack with support hose sits next to various kinds of underwear for people with incontinence , while the shoe section features non-slip soles , soft leather and insoles that make walking easier on tired feet . at deliga , everything is on one level ; no stairs block access for those in wheelchairs or using walkers .
the racks are spaced far apart so people can maneuver between them easily .
the saleswomen are relaxed , friendly and do n't pressure anyone to buy . " when you look at stores now , they are n't at all set up for older people , " said putzke .
" the whole market needs to adjust , though , given the realities we 're seeing in germany . " gray horizons the country is looking at a grayer future , age-wise .
while about one in five germans is over the age of 60 today , demographic studies show that by 2050 , more than one in three will be in the golden years . already today , the senior consumer group has purchasing power that retailers should n't ignore .
according to the german institute of economic research , it is estimated at around 316 billion euros -lrb- $ 429 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's an array of products geared toward older people " but the big retail players seem to be asleep at the wheel , " said matthias riepen , who is taking over the deliga store and planning a relaunch in september .
" strangely , they do n't seem to be looking at the senior market very much right now although numerous studies have shown it 's the market of the future . " there have been some exceptions , such as the so-called " generation supermarkets " that have opened up that shops featuring wider aisles , large-print price tags , magnifying glasses on shelves and motorized shopping baskets with seats attached . the deliga store has not been without its problems .
opened in 2005 , it filed for insolvency two weeks ago .
not because of the market , said riepen , but because of mistakes in marketing and day-to-day operations .
for his relaunch in september , riepen plans on giving it a more modern name , updating its product assortment , and embarking on a franchising plan that , he hopes , will see up to three new stores opening in germany next year . " it 's a concept that has n't been tried yet with seniors , giving them everything they want under one roof , " he said . attractive for every sector andreas reidl , director of the nuremberg-based agency for generation marketing , a consulting firm specializing on the senior market , said that the silver-haired market for almost every sector is an attractive one , be it tourism , health products , financial services or food . " the winners will be the ones who are successful in reaching this older clientele , " he said . karin bernau , 66 , who had come with the senior bus group and ended up buying two blouses , a portable chair and a bootjack for her husband , was sold on the concept of a shop designed especially for her age group . " i think we need more stores like this , " she said .
" it 's the older people who have the buying power .
they 've got their pensions and can afford to spend a little . " he husband , werner , 72 , also had good words for the shop , but was rather lukewarm on the mature fashion show . " it was fine , " he said .

" the old separation of domestic security and security abroad is yesterday 's news , " merkel said at the headquarters of her conservative christian democrats during a presentation of their draft party platform .
" we have to think in a completely different context .
only then will freedom and security be kept in balance in light of this new threat . "
she said the attacks in new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 , which were planned by students living in germany , had led to " a sea change with consequences . "
under germany 's basic law adopted after the nazi era , the military may only be deployed in the event of a disaster or to provide medical back-up during major public events .
coalition divided over deployment issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is bound by its postwar mandates conservatives have stepped up calls since the september 11 attacks for the government to have more leeway to send troops to defend against a specific threat to the civilian population .
but the social democrats , partners in germany 's left-right ruling coalition , oppose the move as a violation of the country 's strict postwar separation of the mandates of its security services .
the debate in germany has been revived by the series of thwarted terror attacks in britain .
an interior ministry spokesman said monday that german and british authorities had stepped up their cooperation in recent days .
but he added that there was no indication germany faced a specific threat of imminent attacks .
german authorities announced june 22 they had boosted security measures in response to a greater threat of attacks at home and abroad due to the country 's military involvement in afghanistan .
eu chief urges more collaboration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso talked of a need for the eu to work together in the wake of the failed attacks , european commission president jose manuel barroso said that the european union should step up joint action against terrorist threats .

" the old separation of domestic security and security abroad is yesterday 's news , " merkel said at the headquarters of her conservative christian democrats during a presentation of their draft party platform .
" we have to think in a completely different context .
only then will freedom and security be kept in balance in light of this new threat . "
she said the attacks in new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 , which were planned by students living in germany , had led to " a sea change with consequences . "
under germany 's basic law adopted after the nazi era , the military may only be deployed in the event of a disaster or to provide medical back-up during major public events .
coalition divided over deployment issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is bound by its postwar mandates conservatives have stepped up calls since the september 11 attacks for the government to have more leeway to send troops to defend against a specific threat to the civilian population .
but the social democrats , partners in germany 's left-right ruling coalition , oppose the move as a violation of the country 's strict postwar separation of the mandates of its security services .
the debate in germany has been revived by the series of thwarted terror attacks in britain .
an interior ministry spokesman said monday that german and british authorities had stepped up their cooperation in recent days .
but he added that there was no indication germany faced a specific threat of imminent attacks .
german authorities announced june 22 they had boosted security measures in response to a greater threat of attacks at home and abroad due to the country 's military involvement in afghanistan .

but demands to cut co2 emissions may see a reversal .
the topic is likely to light up tuesday 's energy summit . german chancellor angela merkel hosts the third federal energy summit in berlin on tuesday with a huge question mark hanging over the source of germany 's future energy supplies and the environmental impact of those sources currently available .
merkel will discuss germany 's future energy needs and how best to conserve energy with business and political leaders from around the country .
however , while the summit is likely to address such issues as reducing co2 output by 40 percent before 2020 , the upgrading of renewable source technology such as solar , wind and biomass energy and the economic impact of the new technology , the main discussion is likely to be on the highly divisive topic of nuclear power .
current german legislation requires all 17 of germany 's existing nuclear power plants to close by 2021 but , using the argument of nuclear power 's ability to help reduce carbon-dioxide emissions , plant operators and center-right politicians have been calling for a reprieve .
however , safety issues surrounding nuclear power have weakened this position , especially after two nuclear power stations went offline last week .
the transformer at the krümmel power station , east of the port city of hamburg , was destroyed by fire last thursday , two hours after a short-circuit had knocked out another nuclear site at brunsbüttel on the far side of the city .
while the brunsbüttel power station was back in service the next day , the krümmel station remained closed pending an investigation .
calls for extended lifespan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch leads cdu voices advocating an extension despite the incidents , a number of politicians from merkel 's christian democratic union party -lrb- cdu -rrb- called on monday for an extension to the nuclear power grid 's lifespan .
powerful hessen state premier roland koch , merkel 's second-in-command in the cdu , told zdf television that the ruling coalition government could still decide on lengthening the lifespan of the power stations which , he claimed , would be the most inexpensive way of protecting germany 's energy supply and reducing co2 output .
both cdu energy expert katherina reiche and the lower saxony prime minister christian wulff agreed with koch 's views in separate statements .
when faced with the question of plant security , koch suggested new power stations could take the place of older plants which are more susceptible to malfunctions over time . " the coalition has a lot of freedom to make this decision , " koch added .
social democrats support decommission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel warns about relying on aging plants environment minister sigmar gabriel of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the cdu 's coalition partner in the federal government , does n't agree .
gabriel is against any extension of nuclear 's lifespan and warned that any attempt to get more use out of aging power plants could be catastrophic . " the longer a power station operates , the more susceptible it is to malfunctions , " he said .
the gradual shutdown of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder and his coalition partners at the time , the greens .
however , in the light of rising energy prices and germany 's dependency on foreign energy , mainly from russia , chancellor merkel wants a broader energy mix .
merkel believes germany should continue to use the edge in nuclear technology it has acquired over the years and members of the cdu are pushing for the chancellor to take advantage of clauses in the " coalition contract " on the shutdown of nuclear power to extend its lifespan to reverse the decision .
effective , yet vilified power source bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel do a u-turn over nuclear power ?
merkel is expected to temper the unease over a potential u-turn on nuclear power at the energy summit of tuesday by advocating a 30 percent increase in renewable energy use which would reduce co2 output by 41 percent .
however , a reprieve for nuclear power would lead to a 45 percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions which would make it the most attractive of the scenarios to reach the desired reduction in co2 output by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

however , a reprieve for nuclear power would lead to a 45 percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions which would make it the most attractive of the scenarios to reach the desired reduction in co2 output by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the old separation of domestic security and security abroad is yesterday 's news , " merkel said at the headquarters of her conservative christian democrats during a presentation of their draft party platform .
" we have to think in a completely different context .
only then will freedom and security be kept in balance in light of this new threat . "
she said the attacks in new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 , which were planned by students living in germany , had led to " a sea change with consequences . "
under germany 's basic law adopted after the nazi era , the military may only be deployed in the event of a disaster or to provide medical back-up during major public events .
coalition divided over deployment issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is bound by its postwar mandates conservatives have stepped up calls since the september 11 attacks for the government to have more leeway to send troops to defend against a specific threat to the civilian population .
but the social democrats , partners in germany 's left-right ruling coalition , oppose the move as a violation of the country 's strict postwar separation of the mandates of its security services .
the debate in germany has been revived by the series of thwarted terror attacks in britain .
an interior ministry spokesman said monday that german and british authorities had stepped up their cooperation in recent days .
but he added that there was no indication germany faced a specific threat of imminent attacks .
german authorities announced june 22 they had boosted security measures in response to a greater threat of attacks at home and abroad due to the country 's military involvement in afghanistan .
eu chief urges more collaboration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso talked of a need for the eu to work together in the wake of the failed attacks , european commission president jose manuel barroso said that the european union should step up joint action against terrorist threats .
" the recent attacks , fortunately foiled , in london and glasgow have demonstrated the need for us to work together and complete our agenda in the fight against terrorism , " barroso told a news conference on monday .
barroso added that eu legislation on storing data had helped british authorities monitor suspect terrorists before the planned attacks . " the fact we had adopted a directive , according to which data could be stored for longer , played an important role in enabling british police to monitor a number of suspect networks , " he said .
" terrorists do not respect frontiers ; consequently it makes no sense to fight terrorism purely through inter-governmental mechanisms .
we need supranational instruments if we are to be effective against terrorism . "
britain will not bend , says home secretary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smith had a baptism of fire as home secretary meanwhile , british home secretary jacqui smith said that britain will not be intimidated by terrorism in a statement to parliament monday on the weekend 's failed car bombings in london and glasgow .
smith confirmed that six people were under arrest in connection with the police investigation into the incidents , while a further person in hospital was of interest .
she said that police searches had been carried out at 19 locations across the country .
" our top priority has to be the success of the investigation , " smith told members of parliament in the lower house of commons .
" terrorists are criminals whose victims come from all walks of life , " she said , adding : " it is through our unity that the terrorists will eventually be defeated . "
" my aim as home secretary is to allow the british public to live their lives as they would wish , within the law , " she added .
the " strongest message " needed to go out " to those who wish to destroy our way of life and our freedoms that we will not be intimidated by terror . "
uk remains on highest terror alert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nationwide manhunt continues after the attacks britain remains on a " critical " state of terror alert , the highest grade possible , after the attempted attacks , which started off with a mercedes car filled with gasoline , gas and nails , parked outside a busy london nightclub in the early hours of last friday .
officers were able to defuse the device after being alerted to a " smoldering car " by members of an ambulance crew which happened to be in the central london area , at haymarket , at the time .
hours later , police were able to defuse a second mercedes car bomb in a vehicle which had been parked nearby before being towed to a compound after receiving a ticket for being parked illegally .
on saturday afternoon , two men drove a blazing jeep into the main airport terminal building at glasgow , scotland , in an attempted attack linked to the events in london a day earlier , police said . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

whether it 's britain 's involvement in driving the iraq war , its military presence there , salman rushdie 's knighthood , tony blair 's appointment as the new envoy of the mideast quartet or just simply britain 's colonial past in wide swathes of the muslim world , the united kingdom offers plenty of motives for terrorism .
not to mention the fact that britain is home to an army of discontented muslims from whose ranks the train bombers from two years ago were recruited .
there are indications that the car bombs did n't have an internal british motive but rather that the " network " -lrb- al qaeda -rrb- planned to strike with local help , as always .
the construction of the bombs points towards that theory , and there was also apparently quite a clear warning on the internet that london would be the target of an attack .

we all live in an age of heightened danger : whether it 's in london , berlin , paris or amsterdam .
as long as crazed people do n't live out their fanatical fantasies , we ca n't foresee their actions .
we can only counter them by remaining alert .
even though victims ca n't be avoided sometimes , if we do n't allow ourselves to be terrorized then the terrorists have already lost the " first round . "
remaining vigilant does n't just mean keeping your nerve and gritting your teeth .
it also means stopping exaggerated preventive measures .
politicians of all stripes - even in germany - tend to propagate complete surveillance to counter terrorism .
video surveillance is necessary , but if we go further and place limits on our free society because of fear of violence then we would be capitulating to the terrorists .

german finance minister peer steinbrück said the economic boom will allow the federal government to stop accumulating new debt by 2011 .
critics say this is n't ambitious enough . on wednesday , steinbrück , a social democrat , is expected to present his budget proposal for 2008 to his cabinet colleagues for approval before the document heads to parliament .
while the financial plan for the coming year will still include new debt of about 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.5 billion -rrb- , steinbrück said that this is already 40 percent less than originally expected .
the finance minister expects to spend 283.2 billion euros in 2008 , up 12.7 billion euros compared to 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrück is happy about germany 's budgetary outlook by 2011 , germany will be able to do without borrowing more money , according to steinbrück .
he said he plans to use and budget surplus to reduce the country 's debt of 900 billion euros .
currently , germany pays about 40 billion euros per year in interest on its debt .
an increase in interest rates will cost the country an additional 2.8 billion euros in 2008 .
too cautious ?
budget experts of germany 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which forms a grand coalition with steinbrück 's social democratic party , said that the finance minister 's proposals did n't go far enough .
steffen kampeter , the budget expert for the cdu in parliament , said that germany should already be able to borrow significantly less money in 2007 than expected .
he also criticized that steinbrück 's plan aimed to reduce new debt via tax revenue rather than cutting costs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an early balance budget would look good for steinbrück on election day opposition members also attacked steinbrück for not doing enough to save money and said that a balanced budget by 2011 was not ambitious enough .

but demands to cut co2 emissions may see a reversal .
the topic is likely to light up tuesday 's energy summit . german chancellor angela merkel hosts the third federal energy summit in berlin on tuesday with a huge question mark hanging over the source of germany 's future energy supplies and the environmental impact of those sources currently available .
merkel will discuss germany 's future energy needs and how best to conserve energy with business and political leaders from around the country .
however , while the summit is likely to address such issues as reducing co2 output by 40 percent before 2020 , the upgrading of renewable source technology such as solar , wind and biomass energy and the economic impact of the new technology , the main discussion is likely to be on the highly divisive topic of nuclear power .
current german legislation requires all 17 of germany 's existing nuclear power plants to close by 2021 but , using the argument of nuclear power 's ability to help reduce carbon-dioxide emissions , plant operators and center-right politicians have been calling for a reprieve .
however , safety issues surrounding nuclear power have weakened this position , especially after two nuclear power stations went offline last week .
the transformer at the krümmel power station , east of the port city of hamburg , was destroyed by fire last thursday , two hours after a short-circuit had knocked out another nuclear site at brunsbüttel on the far side of the city .
while the brunsbüttel power station was back in service the next day , the krümmel station remained closed pending an investigation .
calls for extended lifespan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch leads cdu voices advocating an extension despite the incidents , a number of politicians from merkel 's christian democratic union party -lrb- cdu -rrb- called on monday for an extension to the nuclear power grid 's lifespan .
powerful hessen state premier roland koch , merkel 's second-in-command in the cdu , told zdf television that the ruling coalition government could still decide on lengthening the lifespan of the power stations which , he claimed , would be the most inexpensive way of protecting germany 's energy supply and reducing co2 output .
both cdu energy expert katherina reiche and the lower saxony prime minister christian wulff agreed with koch 's views in separate statements .
when faced with the question of plant security , koch suggested new power stations could take the place of older plants which are more susceptible to malfunctions over time . " the coalition has a lot of freedom to make this decision , " koch added .
social democrats support decommission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel warns about relying on aging plants environment minister sigmar gabriel of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the cdu 's coalition partner in the federal government , does n't agree .
gabriel is against any extension of nuclear 's lifespan and warned that any attempt to get more use out of aging power plants could be catastrophic . " the longer a power station operates , the more susceptible it is to malfunctions , " he said .
the gradual shutdown of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder and his coalition partners at the time , the greens .
however , in the light of rising energy prices and germany 's dependency on foreign energy , mainly from russia , chancellor merkel wants a broader energy mix .
merkel believes germany should continue to use the edge in nuclear technology it has acquired over the years and members of the cdu are pushing for the chancellor to take advantage of clauses in the " coalition contract " on the shutdown of nuclear power to extend its lifespan to reverse the decision .
effective , yet vilified power source bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel do a u-turn over nuclear power ?
merkel is expected to temper the unease over a potential u-turn on nuclear power at the energy summit of tuesday by advocating a 30 percent increase in renewable energy use which would reduce co2 output by 41 percent .
however , a reprieve for nuclear power would lead to a 45 percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions which would make it the most attractive of the scenarios to reach the desired reduction in co2 output by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but demands to cut co2 emissions may see a reversal .
the topic is likely to light up tuesday 's energy summit . german chancellor angela merkel hosts the third federal energy summit in berlin on tuesday with a huge question mark hanging over the source of germany 's future energy supplies and the environmental impact of those sources currently available .
merkel will discuss germany 's future energy needs and how best to conserve energy with business and political leaders from around the country .
however , while the summit is likely to address such issues as reducing co2 output by 40 percent before 2020 , the upgrading of renewable source technology such as solar , wind and biomass energy and the economic impact of the new technology , the main discussion is likely to be on the highly divisive topic of nuclear power .
current german legislation requires all 17 of germany 's existing nuclear power plants to close by 2021 but , using the argument of nuclear power 's ability to help reduce carbon-dioxide emissions , plant operators and center-right politicians have been calling for a reprieve .
however , safety issues surrounding nuclear power have weakened this position , especially after two nuclear power stations went offline last week .
the transformer at the krümmel power station , east of the port city of hamburg , was destroyed by fire last thursday , two hours after a short-circuit had knocked out another nuclear site at brunsbüttel on the far side of the city .
while the brunsbüttel power station was back in service the next day , the krümmel station remained closed pending an investigation .
calls for extended lifespan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch leads cdu voices advocating an extension despite the incidents , a number of politicians from merkel 's christian democratic union party -lrb- cdu -rrb- called on monday for an extension to the nuclear power grid 's lifespan .
powerful hessen state premier roland koch , merkel 's second-in-command in the cdu , told zdf television that the ruling coalition government could still decide on lengthening the lifespan of the power stations which , he claimed , would be the most inexpensive way of protecting germany 's energy supply and reducing co2 output .
both cdu energy expert katherina reiche and the lower saxony prime minister christian wulff agreed with koch 's views in separate statements .
when faced with the question of plant security , koch suggested new power stations could take the place of older plants which are more susceptible to malfunctions over time . " the coalition has a lot of freedom to make this decision , " koch added .
social democrats support decommission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel warns about relying on aging plants environment minister sigmar gabriel of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the cdu 's coalition partner in the federal government , does n't agree .
gabriel is against any extension of nuclear 's lifespan and warned that any attempt to get more use out of aging power plants could be catastrophic . " the longer a power station operates , the more susceptible it is to malfunctions , " he said .
the gradual shutdown of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder and his coalition partners at the time , the greens .
however , in the light of rising energy prices and germany 's dependency on foreign energy , mainly from russia , chancellor merkel wants a broader energy mix .
merkel believes germany should continue to use the edge in nuclear technology it has acquired over the years and members of the cdu are pushing for the chancellor to take advantage of clauses in the " coalition contract " on the shutdown of nuclear power to extend its lifespan to reverse the decision .
effective , yet vilified power source bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel do a u-turn over nuclear power ?
merkel is expected to temper the unease over a potential u-turn on nuclear power at the energy summit of tuesday by advocating a 30 percent increase in renewable energy use which would reduce co2 output by 41 percent .
however , a reprieve for nuclear power would lead to a 45 percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions which would make it the most attractive of the scenarios to reach the desired reduction in co2 output by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 02.07.2007 opinion : germany could take a page from britain 's book großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain currently offers plenty of motives for terrorism , but we can also learn something from the country 's prudent response to the foiled car bombs , said dw 's peter philipp . " baghad comes to london , " was the verdict of some commentators who suspect members of al qaeda to be behind the discovery of two foiled car bombs in the british capital on friday .
as long as the perpetrators remain unidentified , speculation will continue to swirl .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp what we know for sure is that britain is in the crosshairs of terrorist groups .
whether it 's britain 's involvement in driving the iraq war , its military presence there , salman rushdie 's knighthood , tony blair 's appointment as the new envoy of the mideast quartet or just simply britain 's colonial past in wide swathes of the muslim world , the united kingdom offers plenty of motives for terrorism .
not to mention the fact that britain is home to an army of discontented muslims from whose ranks the train bombers from two years ago were recruited .
there are indications that the car bombs did n't have an internal british motive but rather that the " network " -lrb- al qaeda -rrb- planned to strike with local help , as always .
the construction of the bombs points towards that theory , and there was also apparently quite a clear warning on the internet that london would be the target of an attack .
the date too was no coincidence - just hours after a change in britain 's leadership from tony blair to gordon brown and days before the second anniversary of the london bombings .
thanks to a coincidence and the prudence of the british , the tragedy was averted .
the exhaustive cctv surveillance in london will also help in getting leads on the perpetrators .
it 's a system that 's strongly opposed by many in germany as if there was no consideration in weighing the protection of privacy against protecting the general public against terrorist attacks .
you could take a page from britain 's book .
video surveillance does not prevent violent acts , but it does deter them and eases the hunt for perpetrators .
at the same time there is no panic-mongering in britain as was the case in germany recently when different official departments warned of a heightened danger of terrorism .
we all live in an age of heightened danger : whether it 's in london , berlin , paris or amsterdam .
as long as crazed people do n't live out their fanatical fantasies , we ca n't foresee their actions .
we can only counter them by remaining alert .
even though victims ca n't be avoided sometimes , if we do n't allow ourselves to be terrorized then the terrorists have already lost the " first round . "
remaining vigilant does n't just mean keeping your nerve and gritting your teeth .
it also means stopping exaggerated preventive measures .
politicians of all stripes - even in germany - tend to propagate complete surveillance to counter terrorism .
video surveillance is necessary , but if we go further and place limits on our free society because of fear of violence then we would be capitulating to the terrorists .

as germany ages , marketing to the gray consumer will likely be a winning business strategy . a coach pulls in to a parking lot of a nondescript building in an industrial park on the outskirts of grossräschen , a small town just over an hour south of berlin .
inside , the women , and one man , are getting ready for the runway .
they 're tying on colorful scarves , adjusting bright skirts and slipping on not stilettos but sensible shoes - a first sign that this is no ordinary fashion show they 're readying for . the arrivals file in and sit at tables laid out with coffee and cake .
a salesperson takes a microphone and introduces the first model , frau schütz , who comes out in a linen jacket and skirt . she 's no beanpole-thin waif . frau schütz is well over 50 and has a figure that might be called rubenesque . but that 's fine with the members of this group , aged from their early 60s to mid 80s .
fickle trends and size zero clothes are n't exactly what they 're in the market for . " older people also want something chic and stylish , and they are n't going to fit into all these super-mini , extra-extra-small things they find in most fashionable stores , " said christa putzke , the head saleswoman at the deliga senior store .
" we offer them clothes that fit this stage of their lives . " products for the golden years besides the clothes on display on the 800 square meters -lrb- 8,611 sq. ft . -rrb- of floor space , the store has a whole range of goods that meet the needs of the over-60 set .
there are talking alarm clocks and telephones with large buttons that make it easier to use for people with poor eyesight and arthritic hands .
there are amplifiers for radios and large magnifying screens for tvs . bildunterschrift : 800 square meters of space a rack with support hose sits next to various kinds of underwear for people with incontinence , while the shoe section features non-slip soles , soft leather and insoles that make walking easier on tired feet . at deliga , everything is on one level ; no stairs block access for those in wheelchairs or using walkers .
the racks are spaced far apart so people can maneuver between them easily .
the saleswomen are relaxed , friendly and do n't pressure anyone to buy . " when you look at stores now , they are n't at all set up for older people , " said putzke .
" the whole market needs to adjust , though , given the realities we 're seeing in germany . " gray horizons the country is looking at a grayer future , age-wise .
while about one in five germans is over the age of 60 today , demographic studies show that by 2050 , more than one in three will be in the golden years . already today , the senior consumer group has purchasing power that retailers should n't ignore .
according to the german institute of economic research , it is estimated at around 316 billion euros -lrb- $ 429 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's an array of products geared toward older people " but the big retail players seem to be asleep at the wheel , " said matthias riepen , who is taking over the deliga store and planning a relaunch in september .
" strangely , they do n't seem to be looking at the senior market very much right now although numerous studies have shown it 's the market of the future . " there have been some exceptions , such as the so-called " generation supermarkets " that have opened up that shops featuring wider aisles , large-print price tags , magnifying glasses on shelves and motorized shopping baskets with seats attached . the deliga store has not been without its problems .
opened in 2005 , it filed for insolvency two weeks ago .
not because of the market , said riepen , but because of mistakes in marketing and day-to-day operations .
for his relaunch in september , riepen plans on giving it a more modern name , updating its product assortment , and embarking on a franchising plan that , he hopes , will see up to three new stores opening in germany next year . " it 's a concept that has n't been tried yet with seniors , giving them everything they want under one roof , " he said . attractive for every sector andreas reidl , director of the nuremberg-based agency for generation marketing , a consulting firm specializing on the senior market , said that the silver-haired market for almost every sector is an attractive one , be it tourism , health products , financial services or food . " the winners will be the ones who are successful in reaching this older clientele , " he said . karin bernau , 66 , who had come with the senior bus group and ended up buying two blouses , a portable chair and a bootjack for her husband , was sold on the concept of a shop designed especially for her age group . " i think we need more stores like this , " she said .
" it 's the older people who have the buying power .
they 've got their pensions and can afford to spend a little . " he husband , werner , 72 , also had good words for the shop , but was rather lukewarm on the mature fashion show . " it was fine , " he said .
" of course , women who are a little thinner are more fun to look at , huh ? " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

no agreements are expected on these contentious issues . the initial tone of the meeting at the bush family vacation home on the maine coast was outwardly very friendly .
but when the two leaders get down to business monday , sharp disagreements are expected . russia has not stopped its criticism of us efforts to station a missile defense system in eastern europe , even though the us government insists the system is intended to protect europe against " rogue states " such as iran and is not meant to threaten russia . missile defense and kosovo question bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the future of kosovo remains a contentious issue " if the us is deploying radar in the czech republic , this radar will be aimed against us , because there wo n't be any other targets , " kremlin spokesman dmitry peskov said friday .
peskov dismissed suggestions the two countries are heading toward a new cold war , calling it an invention of the media .
russia is also opposed to having serbia 's breakaway province kosovo become independent .
the united states agrees with a united nations proposal to allow kosovo to remain separate from serbia , but under international supervision .
un secretary general ban ki-moon said russia 's support is crucial to the plan .
russia has threatened to veto the decision .
" i hope sincerely that this summit meeting … between president putin and president bush will find a good solution to this issue , " ban said monday . friendly dialogue ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and putin went for a speedboat ride and ate lobster sunday while neither side expected formal agreements to come out of the meeting , both leaders seemed determined to put on a friendly face .
bush and putin have been taking speedboat rides and eating lobster at the bush family retreat in kennebunkport , maine .
" i hope that the dialog with this person with whom i 've formed good , i would say friendly relations , will take place in exactly that spirit , " putin reportedly said before he left moscow .

german finance minister peer steinbrück said the economic boom will allow the federal government to stop accumulating new debt by 2011 .
critics say this is n't ambitious enough . on wednesday , steinbrück , a social democrat , is expected to present his budget proposal for 2008 to his cabinet colleagues for approval before the document heads to parliament .
while the financial plan for the coming year will still include new debt of about 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.5 billion -rrb- , steinbrück said that this is already 40 percent less than originally expected .
the finance minister expects to spend 283.2 billion euros in 2008 , up 12.7 billion euros compared to 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrück is happy about germany 's budgetary outlook by 2011 , germany will be able to do without borrowing more money , according to steinbrück .
he said he plans to use and budget surplus to reduce the country 's debt of 900 billion euros .
currently , germany pays about 40 billion euros per year in interest on its debt .
an increase in interest rates will cost the country an additional 2.8 billion euros in 2008 .
too cautious ?
budget experts of germany 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which forms a grand coalition with steinbrück 's social democratic party , said that the finance minister 's proposals did n't go far enough .
steffen kampeter , the budget expert for the cdu in parliament , said that germany should already be able to borrow significantly less money in 2007 than expected .

german finance minister peer steinbrück said the economic boom will allow the federal government to stop accumulating new debt by 2011 .
critics say this is n't ambitious enough . on wednesday , steinbrück , a social democrat , is expected to present his budget proposal for 2008 to his cabinet colleagues for approval before the document heads to parliament .
while the financial plan for the coming year will still include new debt of about 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.5 billion -rrb- , steinbrück said that this is already 40 percent less than originally expected .
the finance minister expects to spend 283.2 billion euros in 2008 , up 12.7 billion euros compared to 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrück is happy about germany 's budgetary outlook by 2011 , germany will be able to do without borrowing more money , according to steinbrück .
he said he plans to use and budget surplus to reduce the country 's debt of 900 billion euros .
currently , germany pays about 40 billion euros per year in interest on its debt .
an increase in interest rates will cost the country an additional 2.8 billion euros in 2008 .
too cautious ?
budget experts of germany 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which forms a grand coalition with steinbrück 's social democratic party , said that the finance minister 's proposals did n't go far enough .
steffen kampeter , the budget expert for the cdu in parliament , said that germany should already be able to borrow significantly less money in 2007 than expected .
he also criticized that steinbrück 's plan aimed to reduce new debt via tax revenue rather than cutting costs .

" baghad comes to london , " was the verdict of some commentators who suspect members of al qaeda to be behind the discovery of two foiled car bombs in the british capital on friday .
as long as the perpetrators remain unidentified , speculation will continue to swirl .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp what we know for sure is that britain is in the crosshairs of terrorist groups .
whether it 's britain 's involvement in driving the iraq war , its military presence there , salman rushdie 's knighthood , tony blair 's appointment as the new envoy of the mideast quartet or just simply britain 's colonial past in wide swathes of the muslim world , the united kingdom offers plenty of motives for terrorism .
not to mention the fact that britain is home to an army of discontented muslims from whose ranks the train bombers from two years ago were recruited .
there are indications that the car bombs did n't have an internal british motive but rather that the " network " -lrb- al qaeda -rrb- planned to strike with local help , as always .
the construction of the bombs points towards that theory , and there was also apparently quite a clear warning on the internet that london would be the target of an attack .
the date too was no coincidence - just hours after a change in britain 's leadership from tony blair to gordon brown and days before the second anniversary of the london bombings .
thanks to a coincidence and the prudence of the british , the tragedy was averted .
the exhaustive cctv surveillance in london will also help in getting leads on the perpetrators .
it 's a system that 's strongly opposed by many in germany as if there was no consideration in weighing the protection of privacy against protecting the general public against terrorist attacks .
you could take a page from britain 's book .
video surveillance does not prevent violent acts , but it does deter them and eases the hunt for perpetrators .
at the same time there is no panic-mongering in britain as was the case in germany recently when different official departments warned of a heightened danger of terrorism .
we all live in an age of heightened danger : whether it 's in london , berlin , paris or amsterdam .
as long as crazed people do n't live out their fanatical fantasies , we ca n't foresee their actions .
we can only counter them by remaining alert .
even though victims ca n't be avoided sometimes , if we do n't allow ourselves to be terrorized then the terrorists have already lost the " first round . "
remaining vigilant does n't just mean keeping your nerve and gritting your teeth .
it also means stopping exaggerated preventive measures .
politicians of all stripes - even in germany - tend to propagate complete surveillance to counter terrorism .
video surveillance is necessary , but if we go further and place limits on our free society because of fear of violence then we would be capitulating to the terrorists .

but demands to cut co2 emissions may see a reversal .
the topic is likely to light up tuesday 's energy summit . german chancellor angela merkel hosts the third federal energy summit in berlin on tuesday with a huge question mark hanging over the source of germany 's future energy supplies and the environmental impact of those sources currently available .
merkel will discuss germany 's future energy needs and how best to conserve energy with business and political leaders from around the country .
however , while the summit is likely to address such issues as reducing co2 output by 40 percent before 2020 , the upgrading of renewable source technology such as solar , wind and biomass energy and the economic impact of the new technology , the main discussion is likely to be on the highly divisive topic of nuclear power .
current german legislation requires all 17 of germany 's existing nuclear power plants to close by 2021 but , using the argument of nuclear power 's ability to help reduce carbon-dioxide emissions , plant operators and center-right politicians have been calling for a reprieve .
however , safety issues surrounding nuclear power have weakened this position , especially after two nuclear power stations went offline last week .
the transformer at the krümmel power station , east of the port city of hamburg , was destroyed by fire last thursday , two hours after a short-circuit had knocked out another nuclear site at brunsbüttel on the far side of the city .
while the brunsbüttel power station was back in service the next day , the krümmel station remained closed pending an investigation .
calls for extended lifespan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : koch leads cdu voices advocating an extension despite the incidents , a number of politicians from merkel 's christian democratic union party -lrb- cdu -rrb- called on monday for an extension to the nuclear power grid 's lifespan .
powerful hessen state premier roland koch , merkel 's second-in-command in the cdu , told zdf television that the ruling coalition government could still decide on lengthening the lifespan of the power stations which , he claimed , would be the most inexpensive way of protecting germany 's energy supply and reducing co2 output .
both cdu energy expert katherina reiche and the lower saxony prime minister christian wulff agreed with koch 's views in separate statements .
when faced with the question of plant security , koch suggested new power stations could take the place of older plants which are more susceptible to malfunctions over time . " the coalition has a lot of freedom to make this decision , " koch added .
social democrats support decommission bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel warns about relying on aging plants environment minister sigmar gabriel of the social democrats -lrb- spd -rrb- , the cdu 's coalition partner in the federal government , does n't agree .
gabriel is against any extension of nuclear 's lifespan and warned that any attempt to get more use out of aging power plants could be catastrophic . " the longer a power station operates , the more susceptible it is to malfunctions , " he said .
the gradual shutdown of all germany 's nuclear power plants was agreed upon in 2000 by the government of former social democratic chancellor gerhard schröder and his coalition partners at the time , the greens .
however , in the light of rising energy prices and germany 's dependency on foreign energy , mainly from russia , chancellor merkel wants a broader energy mix .
merkel believes germany should continue to use the edge in nuclear technology it has acquired over the years and members of the cdu are pushing for the chancellor to take advantage of clauses in the " coalition contract " on the shutdown of nuclear power to extend its lifespan to reverse the decision .
effective , yet vilified power source bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel do a u-turn over nuclear power ?
merkel is expected to temper the unease over a potential u-turn on nuclear power at the energy summit of tuesday by advocating a 30 percent increase in renewable energy use which would reduce co2 output by 41 percent .
however , a reprieve for nuclear power would lead to a 45 percent reduction of carbon dioxide emissions which would make it the most attractive of the scenarios to reach the desired reduction in co2 output by 2020 . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 02.07.2007 opinion : germany could take a page from britain 's book großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : britain currently offers plenty of motives for terrorism , but we can also learn something from the country 's prudent response to the foiled car bombs , said dw 's peter philipp . " baghad comes to london , " was the verdict of some commentators who suspect members of al qaeda to be behind the discovery of two foiled car bombs in the british capital on friday .
as long as the perpetrators remain unidentified , speculation will continue to swirl .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peter philipp what we know for sure is that britain is in the crosshairs of terrorist groups .
whether it 's britain 's involvement in driving the iraq war , its military presence there , salman rushdie 's knighthood , tony blair 's appointment as the new envoy of the mideast quartet or just simply britain 's colonial past in wide swathes of the muslim world , the united kingdom offers plenty of motives for terrorism .
not to mention the fact that britain is home to an army of discontented muslims from whose ranks the train bombers from two years ago were recruited .
there are indications that the car bombs did n't have an internal british motive but rather that the " network " -lrb- al qaeda -rrb- planned to strike with local help , as always .
the construction of the bombs points towards that theory , and there was also apparently quite a clear warning on the internet that london would be the target of an attack .
the date too was no coincidence - just hours after a change in britain 's leadership from tony blair to gordon brown and days before the second anniversary of the london bombings .
thanks to a coincidence and the prudence of the british , the tragedy was averted .
the exhaustive cctv surveillance in london will also help in getting leads on the perpetrators .
it 's a system that 's strongly opposed by many in germany as if there was no consideration in weighing the protection of privacy against protecting the general public against terrorist attacks .
you could take a page from britain 's book .
video surveillance does not prevent violent acts , but it does deter them and eases the hunt for perpetrators .
at the same time there is no panic-mongering in britain as was the case in germany recently when different official departments warned of a heightened danger of terrorism .
we all live in an age of heightened danger : whether it 's in london , berlin , paris or amsterdam .
as long as crazed people do n't live out their fanatical fantasies , we ca n't foresee their actions .
we can only counter them by remaining alert .
even though victims ca n't be avoided sometimes , if we do n't allow ourselves to be terrorized then the terrorists have already lost the " first round . "
remaining vigilant does n't just mean keeping your nerve and gritting your teeth .
it also means stopping exaggerated preventive measures .
politicians of all stripes - even in germany - tend to propagate complete surveillance to counter terrorism .
video surveillance is necessary , but if we go further and place limits on our free society because of fear of violence then we would be capitulating to the terrorists .

" the old separation of domestic security and security abroad is yesterday 's news , " merkel said at the headquarters of her conservative christian democrats during a presentation of their draft party platform .
" we have to think in a completely different context .
only then will freedom and security be kept in balance in light of this new threat . "
she said the attacks in new york and washington on september 11 , 2001 , which were planned by students living in germany , had led to " a sea change with consequences . "
under germany 's basic law adopted after the nazi era , the military may only be deployed in the event of a disaster or to provide medical back-up during major public events .
coalition divided over deployment issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is bound by its postwar mandates conservatives have stepped up calls since the september 11 attacks for the government to have more leeway to send troops to defend against a specific threat to the civilian population .
but the social democrats , partners in germany 's left-right ruling coalition , oppose the move as a violation of the country 's strict postwar separation of the mandates of its security services .
the debate in germany has been revived by the series of thwarted terror attacks in britain .
an interior ministry spokesman said monday that german and british authorities had stepped up their cooperation in recent days .
but he added that there was no indication germany faced a specific threat of imminent attacks .
german authorities announced june 22 they had boosted security measures in response to a greater threat of attacks at home and abroad due to the country 's military involvement in afghanistan .
eu chief urges more collaboration bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso talked of a need for the eu to work together in the wake of the failed attacks , european commission president jose manuel barroso said that the european union should step up joint action against terrorist threats .
" the recent attacks , fortunately foiled , in london and glasgow have demonstrated the need for us to work together and complete our agenda in the fight against terrorism , " barroso told a news conference on monday .
barroso added that eu legislation on storing data had helped british authorities monitor suspect terrorists before the planned attacks . " the fact we had adopted a directive , according to which data could be stored for longer , played an important role in enabling british police to monitor a number of suspect networks , " he said .
" terrorists do not respect frontiers ; consequently it makes no sense to fight terrorism purely through inter-governmental mechanisms .
we need supranational instruments if we are to be effective against terrorism . "
britain will not bend , says home secretary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : smith had a baptism of fire as home secretary meanwhile , british home secretary jacqui smith said that britain will not be intimidated by terrorism in a statement to parliament monday on the weekend 's failed car bombings in london and glasgow .
smith confirmed that six people were under arrest in connection with the police investigation into the incidents , while a further person in hospital was of interest .
she said that police searches had been carried out at 19 locations across the country .
" our top priority has to be the success of the investigation , " smith told members of parliament in the lower house of commons .
" terrorists are criminals whose victims come from all walks of life , " she said , adding : " it is through our unity that the terrorists will eventually be defeated . "
" my aim as home secretary is to allow the british public to live their lives as they would wish , within the law , " she added .
the " strongest message " needed to go out " to those who wish to destroy our way of life and our freedoms that we will not be intimidated by terror . "
uk remains on highest terror alert bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the nationwide manhunt continues after the attacks britain remains on a " critical " state of terror alert , the highest grade possible , after the attempted attacks , which started off with a mercedes car filled with gasoline , gas and nails , parked outside a busy london nightclub in the early hours of last friday .
officers were able to defuse the device after being alerted to a " smoldering car " by members of an ambulance crew which happened to be in the central london area , at haymarket , at the time .
hours later , police were able to defuse a second mercedes car bomb in a vehicle which had been parked nearby before being towed to a compound after receiving a ticket for being parked illegally .

german finance minister peer steinbrück said the economic boom will allow the federal government to stop accumulating new debt by 2011 .
critics say this is n't ambitious enough . on wednesday , steinbrück , a social democrat , is expected to present his budget proposal for 2008 to his cabinet colleagues for approval before the document heads to parliament .
while the financial plan for the coming year will still include new debt of about 13 billion euros -lrb- $ 17.5 billion -rrb- , steinbrück said that this is already 40 percent less than originally expected .
the finance minister expects to spend 283.2 billion euros in 2008 , up 12.7 billion euros compared to 2007 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : peer steinbrück is happy about germany 's budgetary outlook by 2011 , germany will be able to do without borrowing more money , according to steinbrück .
he said he plans to use and budget surplus to reduce the country 's debt of 900 billion euros .
currently , germany pays about 40 billion euros per year in interest on its debt .
an increase in interest rates will cost the country an additional 2.8 billion euros in 2008 .
too cautious ?
budget experts of germany 's conservative christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- , which forms a grand coalition with steinbrück 's social democratic party , said that the finance minister 's proposals did n't go far enough .
steffen kampeter , the budget expert for the cdu in parliament , said that germany should already be able to borrow significantly less money in 2007 than expected .
he also criticized that steinbrück 's plan aimed to reduce new debt via tax revenue rather than cutting costs .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an early balance budget would look good for steinbrück on election day opposition members also attacked steinbrück for not doing enough to save money and said that a balanced budget by 2011 was not ambitious enough .
" for him , the best would be to reach this all of a sudden in 2009 , " otto fricke , the chairman of the parliament 's budget committee , told swr public radio .
" that 's when we 'll have the next election campaign at the latest . "
speaking to the berliner zeitung daily over the weekend , steinbrück did n't exactly deny the allegation .

as germany ages , marketing to the gray consumer will likely be a winning business strategy . a coach pulls in to a parking lot of a nondescript building in an industrial park on the outskirts of grossräschen , a small town just over an hour south of berlin .
inside , the women , and one man , are getting ready for the runway .
they 're tying on colorful scarves , adjusting bright skirts and slipping on not stilettos but sensible shoes - a first sign that this is no ordinary fashion show they 're readying for . the arrivals file in and sit at tables laid out with coffee and cake .
a salesperson takes a microphone and introduces the first model , frau schütz , who comes out in a linen jacket and skirt . she 's no beanpole-thin waif . frau schütz is well over 50 and has a figure that might be called rubenesque . but that 's fine with the members of this group , aged from their early 60s to mid 80s .
fickle trends and size zero clothes are n't exactly what they 're in the market for . " older people also want something chic and stylish , and they are n't going to fit into all these super-mini , extra-extra-small things they find in most fashionable stores , " said christa putzke , the head saleswoman at the deliga senior store .
" we offer them clothes that fit this stage of their lives . " products for the golden years besides the clothes on display on the 800 square meters -lrb- 8,611 sq. ft . -rrb- of floor space , the store has a whole range of goods that meet the needs of the over-60 set .
there are talking alarm clocks and telephones with large buttons that make it easier to use for people with poor eyesight and arthritic hands .
there are amplifiers for radios and large magnifying screens for tvs . bildunterschrift : 800 square meters of space a rack with support hose sits next to various kinds of underwear for people with incontinence , while the shoe section features non-slip soles , soft leather and insoles that make walking easier on tired feet . at deliga , everything is on one level ; no stairs block access for those in wheelchairs or using walkers .
the racks are spaced far apart so people can maneuver between them easily .
the saleswomen are relaxed , friendly and do n't pressure anyone to buy . " when you look at stores now , they are n't at all set up for older people , " said putzke .
" the whole market needs to adjust , though , given the realities we 're seeing in germany . " gray horizons the country is looking at a grayer future , age-wise .
while about one in five germans is over the age of 60 today , demographic studies show that by 2050 , more than one in three will be in the golden years . already today , the senior consumer group has purchasing power that retailers should n't ignore .
according to the german institute of economic research , it is estimated at around 316 billion euros -lrb- $ 429 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's an array of products geared toward older people " but the big retail players seem to be asleep at the wheel , " said matthias riepen , who is taking over the deliga store and planning a relaunch in september .
" strangely , they do n't seem to be looking at the senior market very much right now although numerous studies have shown it 's the market of the future . " there have been some exceptions , such as the so-called " generation supermarkets " that have opened up that shops featuring wider aisles , large-print price tags , magnifying glasses on shelves and motorized shopping baskets with seats attached . the deliga store has not been without its problems .
opened in 2005 , it filed for insolvency two weeks ago .
not because of the market , said riepen , but because of mistakes in marketing and day-to-day operations .
for his relaunch in september , riepen plans on giving it a more modern name , updating its product assortment , and embarking on a franchising plan that , he hopes , will see up to three new stores opening in germany next year . " it 's a concept that has n't been tried yet with seniors , giving them everything they want under one roof , " he said . attractive for every sector andreas reidl , director of the nuremberg-based agency for generation marketing , a consulting firm specializing on the senior market , said that the silver-haired market for almost every sector is an attractive one , be it tourism , health products , financial services or food . " the winners will be the ones who are successful in reaching this older clientele , " he said . karin bernau , 66 , who had come with the senior bus group and ended up buying two blouses , a portable chair and a bootjack for her husband , was sold on the concept of a shop designed especially for her age group . " i think we need more stores like this , " she said .
" it 's the older people who have the buying power .
they 've got their pensions and can afford to spend a little . " he husband , werner , 72 , also had good words for the shop , but was rather lukewarm on the mature fashion show . " it was fine , " he said .
" of course , women who are a little thinner are more fun to look at , huh ? " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as germany ages , marketing to the gray consumer will likely be a winning business strategy . a coach pulls in to a parking lot of a nondescript building in an industrial park on the outskirts of grossräschen , a small town just over an hour south of berlin .
inside , the women , and one man , are getting ready for the runway .
they 're tying on colorful scarves , adjusting bright skirts and slipping on not stilettos but sensible shoes - a first sign that this is no ordinary fashion show they 're readying for . the arrivals file in and sit at tables laid out with coffee and cake .
a salesperson takes a microphone and introduces the first model , frau schütz , who comes out in a linen jacket and skirt . she 's no beanpole-thin waif . frau schütz is well over 50 and has a figure that might be called rubenesque . but that 's fine with the members of this group , aged from their early 60s to mid 80s .
fickle trends and size zero clothes are n't exactly what they 're in the market for . " older people also want something chic and stylish , and they are n't going to fit into all these super-mini , extra-extra-small things they find in most fashionable stores , " said christa putzke , the head saleswoman at the deliga senior store .
" we offer them clothes that fit this stage of their lives . " products for the golden years besides the clothes on display on the 800 square meters -lrb- 8,611 sq. ft . -rrb- of floor space , the store has a whole range of goods that meet the needs of the over-60 set .
there are talking alarm clocks and telephones with large buttons that make it easier to use for people with poor eyesight and arthritic hands .
there are amplifiers for radios and large magnifying screens for tvs . bildunterschrift : 800 square meters of space a rack with support hose sits next to various kinds of underwear for people with incontinence , while the shoe section features non-slip soles , soft leather and insoles that make walking easier on tired feet . at deliga , everything is on one level ; no stairs block access for those in wheelchairs or using walkers .
the racks are spaced far apart so people can maneuver between them easily .
the saleswomen are relaxed , friendly and do n't pressure anyone to buy . " when you look at stores now , they are n't at all set up for older people , " said putzke .
" the whole market needs to adjust , though , given the realities we 're seeing in germany . " gray horizons the country is looking at a grayer future , age-wise .
while about one in five germans is over the age of 60 today , demographic studies show that by 2050 , more than one in three will be in the golden years . already today , the senior consumer group has purchasing power that retailers should n't ignore .
according to the german institute of economic research , it is estimated at around 316 billion euros -lrb- $ 429 billion -rrb- . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there 's an array of products geared toward older people " but the big retail players seem to be asleep at the wheel , " said matthias riepen , who is taking over the deliga store and planning a relaunch in september .
" strangely , they do n't seem to be looking at the senior market very much right now although numerous studies have shown it 's the market of the future . " there have been some exceptions , such as the so-called " generation supermarkets " that have opened up that shops featuring wider aisles , large-print price tags , magnifying glasses on shelves and motorized shopping baskets with seats attached . the deliga store has not been without its problems .
opened in 2005 , it filed for insolvency two weeks ago .
not because of the market , said riepen , but because of mistakes in marketing and day-to-day operations .
for his relaunch in september , riepen plans on giving it a more modern name , updating its product assortment , and embarking on a franchising plan that , he hopes , will see up to three new stores opening in germany next year . " it 's a concept that has n't been tried yet with seniors , giving them everything they want under one roof , " he said . attractive for every sector andreas reidl , director of the nuremberg-based agency for generation marketing , a consulting firm specializing on the senior market , said that the silver-haired market for almost every sector is an attractive one , be it tourism , health products , financial services or food . " the winners will be the ones who are successful in reaching this older clientele , " he said . karin bernau , 66 , who had come with the senior bus group and ended up buying two blouses , a portable chair and a bootjack for her husband , was sold on the concept of a shop designed especially for her age group . " i think we need more stores like this , " she said .
" it 's the older people who have the buying power .
they 've got their pensions and can afford to spend a little . " he husband , werner , 72 , also had good words for the shop , but was rather lukewarm on the mature fashion show . " it was fine , " he said .
" of course , women who are a little thinner are more fun to look at , huh ? " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

proposals for a ban on smacking , a ban on plastic carrier bags and a new body to co-ordinate search and rescue organisations have been selected .
the winning entry chosen by the if i ruled wales project will be passed on to ams for consideration .
under new legislation , anyone in wales is entitled to put forward their ideas directly to the assembly .
around 350 ideas were sent in for the project , and the three finalists were selected by an expert panel including baroness finlay of llandaff , constitutional expert david lambert , golwg managing editor dylan iorwerth and glyn matthias from the electoral commission .
baroness finlay said she felt " really strongly about protecting children from being hit " .
" the children 's act had the opportunity of incorporating the un convention on children and it did n't happen and it should have happened , " she said .
" if you take children who are very little , they are very , very vulnerable and yet we let people hit them .
" and as they grow up and become teenagers and they can fend for themselves , you ca n't lay a finger on them - it does n't make sense at all . "
mr iorwerth and mr matthias felt the idea of a group to organise emergency services was worth pursuing .
" if there is n't a body to co-ordinate all the different forms of emergency service , there should be , and a body with statutory powers under the remit of the assembly to do that , i think would be highly sensible , " said mr matthias .
both mr iorwerth and mr matthias agreed the ban on plastic bags was " a strong contender " but needed defining .
some of the suggestions which did not make it past the panel included making st david 's day a bank holiday and " making every day the first day of spring " .
' many ways ' if your ideas have not made the final three chosen by the panel , you can still put your ideas directly to the assembly .
the assembly 's extended powers under the government of wales act mean anyone in wales is entitled to put forward their idea on how those powers should be into law .
the ideas can come from anyone , of any age , as long as 10 people back the proposal .
" there are many ways in which you can make sure that your idea for legislation can go forward as a proposal in this chamber , " said non gwilym from the assembly .
" it 's not just a public petition , you can go to an assembly member who can act as a champion for your cause or you can go to a committee as well - they all have the right to actually propose ideas for legislation . "

under new legislation , anyone in wales is entitled to put forward their ideas directly to the assembly .
around 350 ideas were sent in for the project , and the three finalists were selected by an expert panel including baroness finlay of llandaff , constitutional expert david lambert , golwg managing editor dylan iorwerth and glyn matthias from the electoral commission .
baroness finlay said she felt " really strongly about protecting children from being hit " .
new legislation allows assembly measures , or welsh laws , to be created " the children 's act had the opportunity of incorporating the un convention on children and it did n't happen and it should have happened , " she said .
" if you take children who are very little , they are very , very vulnerable and yet we let people hit them .
" and as they grow up and become teenagers and they can fend for themselves , you ca n't lay a finger on them - it does n't make sense at all . "
mr iorwerth and mr matthias felt the idea of a group to organise emergency services was worth pursuing .
" if there is n't a body to co-ordinate all the different forms of emergency service , there should be , and a body with statutory powers under the remit of the assembly to do that , i think would be highly sensible , " said mr matthias .
both mr iorwerth and mr matthias agreed the ban on plastic bags was " a strong contender " but needed defining .
some of the suggestions which did not make it past the panel included making st david 's day a bank holiday and " making every day the first day of spring " .
' many ways ' if your ideas have not made the final three chosen by the panel , you can still put your ideas directly to the assembly .
the assembly 's extended powers under the government of wales act mean anyone in wales is entitled to put forward their idea on how those powers should be into law .
the ideas can come from anyone , of any age , as long as 10 people back the proposal .
" there are many ways in which you can make sure that your idea for legislation can go forward as a proposal in this chamber , " said non gwilym from the assembly .
" it 's not just a public petition , you can go to an assembly member who can act as a champion for your cause or you can go to a committee as well - they all have the right to actually propose ideas for legislation . "

mr lajcak has said his first task will be to help end the country 's political deadlock and revive the economy - 12 years after the end of the bosnian war .
the planned handover of power to local lawmakers in june 2007 has been put back as bosnia is still deeply divided along ethnic lines .
mr lajcak is replacing christian schwarz-schilling , a german diplomat .
mr schwarz-schilling bosnia 's international administrator since early 2006 , but critics say he has failed to make politicians from rival ethnic groups work together to agree core reforms .
this was partly due to the lack of reform but also because of fears that any western recognition of independence for ethnic albanians in kosovo could trigger a reaction among bosnian serbs .
ethnic divisions the high representative - a post set up under the 1995 dayton peace agreement that ended the bosnian war - has the power to dismiss bosnia 's top politicians and officials .
mr schwarz-schilling has served since january 2006 mr lajcak has said that his first challenge will be " stabilisation of the atmosphere " .
he has said that his priority will be unifying the various ethnic police forces and constitutional reform that would strengthen the central government - issues on which lawmakers are deadlocked .
when mr schwarz-schilling took office , he said that his goal was to hand power back to bosnian politicians .
but ethnic divisions have continued to dominate politics , with leaders of bosnia 's serbs , muslims and croats failing to agree on key reforms required for bosnia 's entry in the european union .
" certain key political leaders ... have been irresponsible in their actions , putting their own ambitions ahead of the well-being of all the citizens of bosnia-hercegovina , " mr schwarz-schilling said at a press conference in sarajevo on thursday .
but , says the bbc 's nicholas walton in sarajevo , many bosnians also blame the high representative for being too weak and ineffectual to force these reforms through .

the labour-plaid coalition , which was agreed in principle , has said it would bring in a law to allow people to receive services bilingually .
but an icm poll for bbc wales found 63 % of those questioned thought the law should not be changed .
a total of 24 % said they thought all private business should be bilingual .
the current welsh language act came into force in 1993 and put welsh on an equal footing with english with regard to the public sector in wales .
ten per cent of people questioned in the icm survey thought that only the largest private businesses should provide services in welsh and english .
researchers for the poll carried out telephone interviews across wales with more than 1,000 people between 19-21 june .

weeks of wet weather cleared on cue over the new stadium , allowing the sunshine to set the perfect scene for a party .
introducing lily allen , hollywood veteran dennis hopper summed up the early spirit : " this is a party .
this is a celebration , and you 're going to love it . "
and love it they did .
the strength of the new stadium was tested as 63,000 people jumped to their feet for allen 's cheery rendition of ldn .
rod stewart performed a number of his best known hits some danced , all cheered , and somewhere near the stage two giant inflatable daffodils bobbed in time to the music .
allen was one of many younger performers who were still at school when princess diana died in a car crash in 1997 .
' screaming fans ' while acts like rod stewart , duran duran and roger hodgson of supertramp were some of the princess 's personal favourites , allen was among her son 's choices .
she joined p diddy , pharrell williams , orson , james morrison , joss stone , kanye west , nelly furtado , will young and natasha bedingfield on an eclectic bill .
the result was a mix of music to suit all tastes - rappers , rockers and pop-lovers alike .
there were hands in the air for rod stewart 's sailing , the inevitable screams for take that and dancing for rapper west .
many of the day 's stars dedicated songs to the late princess , including duran duran , black eyed peas singer fergie and p diddy , who sang his 1998 hit missing you in her memory .
a huge cheer went up for 24 actor kiefer sutherland , who was among many famous faces who introduced the artists .
" we get to celebrate diana through the music she loved by the musicians she admired , " he said .
p diddy added an international flavour to the party sutherland introduced the feeling , who opened their lively set with fill my little world .
a glimpse of prince harry dancing along to i love it when you call had the crowd craning their necks away from the stage and up to the royal seating area .
status quo brought echoes of their iconic live aid performance of 1985 to the new wembley after the interval with rockin ' all over the world .
and joe perry of aerosmith joined a sky-blue suited and booted sir tom jones on stage for a rendition of kiss .
the welsh legend proved to be one of the day 's highlights , and drove the two inflatable daffodils crazy by belting out ai n't that a lot of love and the arctic monkeys ' i bet you look good on the dancefloor .
energetic as the sky over wembley began to darken , rod stewart lit up the concert with some of his best-known hits - maggie may , baby jane and sailing .
in honour of diana 's love of dance and musical theatre , there was a performance of an act from swan lake by the english national ballet , and songs by andrew lloyd webber .
tv presenter cat deeley introduced a medley of songs from some of lord lloyd-webber 's hit musicals .
how do you solve a problem like maria ? winner connie fisher sang memory from cats , while italian tenor andrea bocelli and sarah brightman also took to the stage .
the audience provided the " ah-ahs " as donny osmond , then jason donovan , and finally lee mead , dressed in his technicolor dreamcoat , performed any dream will do .

take that , one of princess diana 's favourite bands , opened their eagerly anticipated set with an energetic version of shine , followed by patience and a crowd sing-a-long to back for good .
lee mead belted out any dream will do from the joseph musical it was left to sir elton john to bring the music to an end with hits like saturday night 's alright for fighting and tiny dancer .
but , after a video tribute by nelson mandela , it was diana herself who brought the evening to a poignant close .
never-seen-before home movie footage of her as a child was shown on the giant screens that flanked the main stage .
the audience , many in tears , watched images of diana 's christening and her first birthday party , to a soundtrack of freddie mercury singing those were the days -lrb- of our lives -rrb- .
it was a memorable end to a memorable day for an unforgettable icon .

"
he and prince william organised the event to celebrate the life of their mother , princess diana , on what would have been her 46th birthday .
weeks of wet weather cleared on cue over the new stadium , allowing the sunshine to set the perfect scene for a party .
introducing lily allen , hollywood veteran dennis hopper summed up the early spirit : " this is a party .
this is a celebration , and you 're going to love it . "
and love it they did .
the strength of the new stadium was tested as 63,000 people jumped to their feet for allen 's cheery rendition of ldn .
rod stewart performed a number of his best known hits some danced , all cheered , and somewhere near the stage two giant inflatable daffodils bobbed in time to the music .
allen was one of many younger performers who were still at school when princess diana died in a car crash in 1997 .
' screaming fans ' while acts like rod stewart , duran duran and roger hodgson of supertramp were some of the princess 's personal favourites , allen was among her son 's choices .
she joined p diddy , pharrell williams , orson , james morrison , joss stone , kanye west , nelly furtado , will young and natasha bedingfield on an eclectic bill .
the result was a mix of music to suit all tastes - rappers , rockers and pop-lovers alike .
there were hands in the air for rod stewart 's sailing , the inevitable screams for take that and dancing for rapper west .
many of the day 's stars dedicated songs to the late princess , including duran duran , black eyed peas singer fergie and p diddy , who sang his 1998 hit missing you in her memory .
a huge cheer went up for 24 actor kiefer sutherland , who was among many famous faces who introduced the artists .
" we get to celebrate diana through the music she loved by the musicians she admired , " he said .
p diddy added an international flavour to the party sutherland introduced the feeling , who opened their lively set with fill my little world .
a glimpse of prince harry dancing along to i love it when you call had the crowd craning their necks away from the stage and up to the royal seating area .
status quo brought echoes of their iconic live aid performance of 1985 to the new wembley after the interval with rockin ' all over the world .
and joe perry of aerosmith joined a sky-blue suited and booted sir tom jones on stage for a rendition of kiss .
the welsh legend proved to be one of the day 's highlights , and drove the two inflatable daffodils crazy by belting out ai n't that a lot of love and the arctic monkeys ' i bet you look good on the dancefloor .
energetic as the sky over wembley began to darken , rod stewart lit up the concert with some of his best-known hits - maggie may , baby jane and sailing .
in honour of diana 's love of dance and musical theatre , there was a performance of an act from swan lake by the english national ballet , and songs by andrew lloyd webber .
tv presenter cat deeley introduced a medley of songs from some of lord lloyd-webber 's hit musicals .
how do you solve a problem like maria ? winner connie fisher sang memory from cats , while italian tenor andrea bocelli and sarah brightman also took to the stage .
the audience provided the " ah-ahs " as donny osmond , then jason donovan , and finally lee mead , dressed in his technicolor dreamcoat , performed any dream will do .
osmond and donovan have famously played joseph on stage , and mead is to do so in the west end in a few weeks , having won bbc one talent show any dream will do .
take that , one of princess diana 's favourite bands , opened their eagerly anticipated set with an energetic version of shine , followed by patience and a crowd sing-a-long to back for good .
lee mead belted out any dream will do from the joseph musical it was left to sir elton john to bring the music to an end with hits like saturday night 's alright for fighting and tiny dancer .
but , after a video tribute by nelson mandela , it was diana herself who brought the evening to a poignant close .
never-seen-before home movie footage of her as a child was shown on the giant screens that flanked the main stage .
the audience , many in tears , watched images of diana 's christening and her first birthday party , to a soundtrack of freddie mercury singing those were the days -lrb- of our lives -rrb- .
it was a memorable end to a memorable day for an unforgettable icon .

alex salmond said the " spectacular achievement " was symbolic of the desire the country had to return to normality .
he added that scotland should be proud of its muslim community , which he said contributed greatly to society .
and he denied the country had been complacent about the risk posed by terrorism .
the airport was fully operational on monday morning despite a jeep cherokee which had been loaded with gas cylinders crashing into its main terminal building on saturday .
just about the only people who are not working today are the folk who are flying out on holiday from glasgow and other airports alex salmond first minister speaking of the response to the attack on bbc radio 's good morning scotland , mr salmond said : " i think it has been much better than adequate , it has been exceptional , particularly from our emergency services .
" think of it .
only two days afterwards , less than that , one-and-a-half days after a major terrorist incident at glasgow airport , the airport is up and running and functioning normally .
" that 's a spectacular achievement and i think it is symbolic of the attitude of the rest of the country .
" today it has been back to work as normal .
indeed , just about the only people who are not working today are the folk who are flying out on holiday from glasgow and other airports . "
mr salmond said that the information he had received from the police indicated that community relations had not been damaged by the attacks .
' stand united ' he said scottish muslims had been reassured by revelations that those responsible for the attack , and the attempted car bombings in london , had not been present in the country for long .
mr salmond added : " we should be exceptionally proud of our muslim community in scotland .
they contribute enormously to the vitality of scottish life and indeed to our economy and i do n't think this incident any more than any other we have seen in recent years is going to divide our community .
" the correct response to criminals who commit outrages is to stand united and that 's exactly what we intend to do . "
the first minister said the effectiveness of the emergency response was testament to the procedures and planning that had been put in place , and denied press comments that scotland had been " shaken out of its complacency " .
" scotland has never been complacent , " mr salmond said .
" our emergency procedures , the emergency communications sub-committee of the cabinet , which meets the police committees , the functioning of the airport , the liaison between airport staff and the police and fire service , all of these things have been practiced many times over and that 's why they 've worked so effectively over the last two days .

work has started to replace worn-out tracks on the metrolink line between altrincham and old trafford .
twenty miles of track , some of which is more than 50 years old , is being replaced as part of the £ 100m upgrade .
replacement bus services will run on the affected metrolink route and extra train carriages will run in rush-hour between altrincham and manchester .
trams will continue to run between old trafford and manchester until the end of july before the whole of the line from altrincham to cornbrook closes for most of august .
passengers who travel from the altrincham , navigation road or timperley metrolink stops will also be able to use their tickets on train services from hale , altrincham or navigation road to reach manchester city centre .
a spokesperson from greater manchester passenger transport executive -lrb- gmpte -rrb- said the work was necessary because of the age of some of the track .
