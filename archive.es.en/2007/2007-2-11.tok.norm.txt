gates said the world today is different and more complex than during the cold war era , and partnerships with other countries , including russia , were needed to face common problems and a new challenge from islamic extremism . he said he had accepted an invitation from putin and russian defense minister sergei ivanov to visit russia .
' rumsfeld 's " old europe " belongs to the past ' the new us defense secretary also made a passing but pointed reference to his predecessor , donald rumsfeld , who antagonized european powers by dividing the nato alliance into countries that supported the us invasion in iraq and those who did not .

ahmadinejad said , referring to the sensitive nuclear process the west wants iran to halt as proof it is not seeking nuclear weapons .
" if we suspend our activities then what are we going to talk about ?
why , if your nuclear plants are working 24 hours a day , why must iran be pressured to shut them down ?

expectations were high that ahmadinejad would announce in his speech a breakthrough towards an industrial-scale enrichment of uranium , a process that can be used both in nuclear power stations and atomic bombs . speculation had been that iran would announce the installation of some of the 3,000 uranium-enriching centrifuges it wants to put in place at an underground nuclear facility in the city of natanz in the next months .
no plan to quit non-proliferation treaty instead , ahmadinejad promised that announcements would follow by april 9 - the day designated by iran as a holiday celebrating its achievements in nuclear technology .

" if you are willing to negotiate , why do you insist on a suspension -lrb- of nuclear enrichment -rrb- ? "
ahmadinejad said , referring to the sensitive nuclear process the west wants iran to halt as proof it is not seeking nuclear weapons .
" if we suspend our activities then what are we going to talk about ?
why , if your nuclear plants are working 24 hours a day , why must iran be pressured to shut them down ? " " we are ready to negotiate but under fair and even conditions , " he told the faithful massed at azadi -lrb- freedom -rrb- square in tehran . hundreds of thousands of iranians massed around the country in their annual show of support for the revolution , with slogans like " death to america " mixing with the now familiar " nuclear energy is our natural right . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad spoke on the occasion of the 28th anniversary of the 1979 islamic revolution ahmadinejad 's defiance comes despite the un security council 's decision to impose sanctions against iran in december and its deadline for iran to halt uranium enrichment by feb .
21 or face further action . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said any idea of holding talks while iran carried out uranium enrichment was " totally unacceptable . "
steinmeier : world stands at crossroads german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , attending the annual security conference in munich , said that resolving the nuclear conflict with iran was of central importance to international security in the 21st century .
he said that the world stood at a crossroads .
" either we succeed in preventing iran and other states away from toying with the nuclear option over the next few years , or we 'll experience a new nuclear arms race with unforeseeable consequences for global security , " steinmeier said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said the world stands at a crossroads also at the conference , iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani said that iran wanted to achieve a " negotiated settlement of the case . " " we do n't want to aggravate the situation in the region , " larijani said . larijani said he had sent a letter to mohamed elbaradei , the chief of the vienna-based international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , offering to work out outstanding issues " within three weeks . " " i have written to mr elbaradei to say we are ready within three weeks to have the modality to solve all the outstanding issues with you . "
expectations were high that ahmadinejad would announce in his speech a breakthrough towards an industrial-scale enrichment of uranium , a process that can be used both in nuclear power stations and atomic bombs . speculation had been that iran would announce the installation of some of the 3,000 uranium-enriching centrifuges it wants to put in place at an underground nuclear facility in the city of natanz in the next months .
no plan to quit non-proliferation treaty instead , ahmadinejad promised that announcements would follow by april 9 - the day designated by iran as a holiday celebrating its achievements in nuclear technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani said he had notified the iaea that iran weas ready to talk " from now until april 9 you will hear frequently about the great progress of the iranian people and unique developments in the domains of industry , agriculture , and especially nuclear energy , " ahmadinejad said . striking a conciliatory tone with the un nuclear watchdog , ahmadinejad said that his government had no intention of quitting the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , despite previous threats . " we are willing to follow the regulations , " he said , referring to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty of which iran is a signatory .
" despite the authority of the parliament for the government to reduce its cooperation with the agency or even quit the npt , the government , with the coordination of parliament , has not used this .
it is willing to defend the people 's rights within the framework of the law . " there was a festive spirit at the mass rally in tehran , with children clutching balloons emblazoned with pro-nuclear slogans and the revolution motto : " freedom , independence and islamic republic . " the united states accuses iran of seeking a nuclear weapon , a charge denied by tehran which insists its atomic program is peaceful in nature . although the united states has said it wants the nuclear standoff resolved through diplomacy , washington has never ruled out military action to thwart iran 's atomic drive . dw staff / afpe -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel says iran must meet all demands over nuclear program german chancellor angela merkel on saturday called on iran to conform with the demands of the international community over its nuclear program " without ifs and buts and without tricks .

but goalie jens lehmann still sees room for improvement . jens lehmann believes the german national soccer team has improved vastly compared to early 2006 and wants to qualify swiftly for euro 2008 . the germany goalkeeper also told kicker , a german sports magazine , this week that that young german soccer stars need a better education and the clubs a more professional management . " we are at least one class better than 12 months ago , " the arsenal goalkeeper said .
" the most important thing is that the players know exactly what they are supposed to do on the pitch .
of course we want to make sure that we qualify for the euro 2008 tournament . " germany won their first match of the year , a non-surprising 3-1 victory in a friendly against switzerland on wednesday .
the next euro 2008 qualifier is on march 24 away to a much stronger team , the czech republic . germany started poorly in 2006 but then rose to the world cup occasion in the summer by finishing third under coach jürgen klinsmann .
germany are now unbeaten in the seven games since joachim löw took over as coach after the world cup . bundesliga mainly animosity and sackings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann says the bickering mentality is counter-productive looking at the state of soccer in germany , lehmann called for improvement . " you get the impression that the attraction of the bundesliga mainly consists of who is at odds with whom and which coach is sacked next , " he said .
" soccer aspects are rarely mentioned , like whether a team is playing well . " in order to raise the standard - also manifested in mediocre showings in europe - lehmann called for a better soccer education and more professionalism in general . " werder bremen probably have a philosophy and maybe schalke 04 are building one , but everything else looks like patchwork , " he added .
" whenever i talk with presidents or general managers i get the impression that they know they must find a new coach sometime , but not by which criteria they need to choose him . " the bundesliga needs more quality in the positions of president , general manager and coach , " lehmann said . development in germany lagging behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rooney has been nurtured to stardom at man united development of young players also needs to get more attention , the germany no.1 said , pointing out that current english premiership leaders manchester united have done a good job in raising wayne rooney and cristiano ronaldo to the status of star players - with rooney far ahead of german lukas podolski , who is mainly benched at bayern munich . " rooney was n't good at first , " lehmann said .
" but manchester formed him ; he is getting better and better , the same with cristiano ronaldo .
i see the same at arsenal , the way young players are built up .

but new figures from the german office of foreign trade show that china will assume the export throne in 2008 . the news that china , with its booming economy , is about to become the world 's number one export nation has been met with caution not only by german business leaders , but managers and economists around the world . " the fact that china exports so much is n't really the issue , " said eva schwinghammer from the german chamber of commerce in shanghai .
" the real problem is that china exports much more than it imports .
there 's no balance , and that poses a risk to world market stability . " export ball well in china 's court bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's export industry far outstrips its imports the balance of trade is clearly in china 's favor . the goods china exports to germany are worth 19 billion euros more than everything it imports from germany .
textiles and electronics , like dvd players and computers , are the main drivers of china 's trade success - along with the fact that its currency , the yuan , is n't freely tradable . but the head of the german office of foreign trade , gert herx , pointed out that just because business is booming in china , it does n't mean the chinese are the ones profiting . " about 60 percent of chinese exports are funded by foreign investors , " he says .
" the products come from foreign companies that have built production facilities on chinese soil , or set up joint ventures with chinese companies .
german companies in china are n't just serving the chinese market ; they 're exporting back home and elsewhere .
it 's just a sign of globalization . " back at the chamber of commerce in shanghai , eva schwinghammer said it was only a matter of time before the forces of the world economy are felt in china . chinese firms stepping on european toes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : made in china , sold in the eu " look at labor costs , " she said .
" wages are rising rapidly in china .
it 's common for skilled labor wages to double in a few years - annual increases of 25 to 30 percent are the norm in shanghai .
sooner or later the pressure will become too great .
and china wo n't be considered a cheap location for companies looking to produce high quality goods , particularly in the heavy machinery sector , for example . " that 's why the government in beijing is encouraging chinese businesses to shift from labor-intensive activities to technology-based areas . it has created a program to boost research and development so they can compete in sectors normally dominated by european and us firms .
it is also in the process of reassessing how the presence of foreign firms in china benefits the national economy .

but goalie jens lehmann still sees room for improvement . jens lehmann believes the german national soccer team has improved vastly compared to early 2006 and wants to qualify swiftly for euro 2008 . the germany goalkeeper also told kicker , a german sports magazine , this week that that young german soccer stars need a better education and the clubs a more professional management . " we are at least one class better than 12 months ago , " the arsenal goalkeeper said .
" the most important thing is that the players know exactly what they are supposed to do on the pitch .
of course we want to make sure that we qualify for the euro 2008 tournament . " germany won their first match of the year , a non-surprising 3-1 victory in a friendly against switzerland on wednesday .
the next euro 2008 qualifier is on march 24 away to a much stronger team , the czech republic . germany started poorly in 2006 but then rose to the world cup occasion in the summer by finishing third under coach jürgen klinsmann .
germany are now unbeaten in the seven games since joachim löw took over as coach after the world cup . bundesliga mainly animosity and sackings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann says the bickering mentality is counter-productive looking at the state of soccer in germany , lehmann called for improvement . " you get the impression that the attraction of the bundesliga mainly consists of who is at odds with whom and which coach is sacked next , " he said .
" soccer aspects are rarely mentioned , like whether a team is playing well . " in order to raise the standard - also manifested in mediocre showings in europe - lehmann called for a better soccer education and more professionalism in general . " werder bremen probably have a philosophy and maybe schalke 04 are building one , but everything else looks like patchwork , " he added .
" whenever i talk with presidents or general managers i get the impression that they know they must find a new coach sometime , but not by which criteria they need to choose him . " the bundesliga needs more quality in the positions of president , general manager and coach , " lehmann said . development in germany lagging behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rooney has been nurtured to stardom at man united development of young players also needs to get more attention , the germany no.1 said , pointing out that current english premiership leaders manchester united have done a good job in raising wayne rooney and cristiano ronaldo to the status of star players - with rooney far ahead of german lukas podolski , who is mainly benched at bayern munich . " rooney was n't good at first , " lehmann said .
" but manchester formed him ; he is getting better and better , the same with cristiano ronaldo .
i see the same at arsenal , the way young players are built up .

textiles and electronics , like dvd players and computers , are the main drivers of china 's trade success - along with the fact that its currency , the yuan , is n't freely tradable . but the head of the german office of foreign trade , gert herx , pointed out that just because business is booming in china , it does n't mean the chinese are the ones profiting . " about 60 percent of chinese exports are funded by foreign investors , " he says .
" the products come from foreign companies that have built production facilities on chinese soil , or set up joint ventures with chinese companies .
german companies in china are n't just serving the chinese market ; they 're exporting back home and elsewhere .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 11.02.2007 opinion : eu quest for central asian oil and democracy is risky großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants a new foreign policy to build closer ties between the eu and the countries of central asia .
but dealing with dictatorships in the region poses major challenges , writes journalist marcus bensmann in baku . central asia , located between the pamir mountains and the caspian sea , forms a strategic land link between china and europe , and this year , germany intends to use its eu council presidency to introduce a new central asia strategy that will forge closer ties between the region and europe .
as part of this initiative , in late 2006 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier visited all five former soviet republics in central asia : kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan , tajikistan , turkmenistan and uzbekistan .
the reasons behind this strategy are clear .
under the steppes and deep beneath the caspian sea lie enormous reserves of oil and gas that could help secure europe 's long-term energy needs .
so far , the soviet-era pipeline network has had a virtual monopoly on the transport of oil and gas deposits .
the newly completed oil pipeline that runs from baku to the turkish mediterranean coast and the gas pipeline that follows this route up to the turkish-georgian border represent a challenge to russia 's pipeline dominance over central asia 's natural resources .
however , russia 's gasprom continues to rule the market in central asia .
in addition to russia , the us , and europe , china has emerged as a major competitor for these rich natural resources .
beijing is considering investing billions of dollars to develop the exploitation of energy reserves and build pipelines .
china and russia have secured their influence on the region through the shanghai cooperation organization , an intergovernmental body that includes all central asian countries except turkmenistan .
ruthless dictatorships central asia represents a crucial zone on the frontlines of the troubled european and american mission in afghanistan .
germany has established an airbase to supply its armed forces in afghanistan in the uzbek provincial capital of termez .
however , berlin and brussels face some uneasy conflicts in the region .
particularly in countries like uzbekistan and turkmenistan , rich natural resources have fallen into the hands of the ruling dictatorships , and citizens of these countries live under autocratic regimes .
until his death in december , turkmenistan president saparmurat niyazov imposed a bizarre personality cult on the country .
repressive rule helped him to fill his foreign bank accounts , but people were left with severe food shortages .
andijan massacre and sanctions in may 2005 , uzbek president islam karimov ordered government forces to open fire on tens of thousands of democracy protestors in the city of andijan .
estimates of those killed in the hail of bullets range from hundreds to thousands .
karimov and his government justified the brutal crackdown as a necessary measure to put down an alleged islamic coup - and opposed eu and us calls for an international inquiry into the killings .
as a result , the eu has imposed sanctions against uzbekistan since october 2005 , issued an arms embargo and refused to allow high-ranking members of the uzbek government to enter their territory .
it is not clear what exactly happened in andijan , but there remains no doubt that the uprising was sparked by protests against the despotic rule of the state .
the external threat of islamism helps karimov to retain his hold on power , yet it is also his despotic rule that has laid the foundations for extremist groups making extravagant promises .
dialogue with dictators germany 's policy on central asia aims to promote change through dialogue with dictators and the government is working to ease or drop eu sanctions against uzbekistan .
nevertheless , in november , the eu voted to extend the measures for another three months .
the eu would be well advised to take a differentiated approach to the countries in central asia .
kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev keeps an iron grip on power with doubtful elections and repressive measures , yet in contrast to uzbekistan , he has allowed the population to benefit from the wealth generated by the country 's rapidly growing economy .
kazakhstan even has a minor political opposition and a free press that is slowly beginning to flourish .
an economic perspective take a walk through the kazakh economic boomtown almaty and the uzbek capital , tashkent , and the difference is immediately obvious .
tashkent is shrouded in an atmosphere of dejection and lethargy , whereas almaty is full of bustling activity .
in the economically backward country of kyrgyzstan , a confident public is challenging the ruling elite .
since the overthrow of president askar akayev in march 2005 , the political process in the country has fumbled from crisis to crisis .
in contrast to the other countries of the region , however , kyrgyz citizens have relatively little to fear when confronting representatives of the state .
promoting development the eu should pursue a strategy that focuses on these countries and promotes their development , and above all , gives kyrgyzstan 's impoverished economy a helping hand .
the death of niyazov opens up a window of opportunity to encourage the unsettled turkmen leaders to institute reforms .
friendly handshakes and smiles , however , will do little to convince karimov to initiate reforms .
the uzbek president interprets every concession as a sign of weakness .
that is a lesson that the americans learned the hard way after they established a military base in uzbekistan in 2001 .
four years later , the andijan massacre cooled relations between the two countries , and the us had to abandon the base .
german foreign policymakers seem to be making the same mistake by openly flirting with the dictator in tashkent .
however , if europe is resolute in isolating karimov and works instead to promote prospering countries along the border with uzbekistan , the uzbek political leadership may in turn out pressure on karimov to introduce reforms , forcing him to soften his attitude .
uzbekistan and even turkmenistan need a bridge to the west even more than the west needs them .
without europe , they would be forced to enter into a reluctant dependency on china and russia .
this is an opportunity that european foreign policy should take full advantage of .

but dealing with dictatorships in the region poses major challenges , writes journalist marcus bensmann in baku . central asia , located between the pamir mountains and the caspian sea , forms a strategic land link between china and europe , and this year , germany intends to use its eu council presidency to introduce a new central asia strategy that will forge closer ties between the region and europe .
as part of this initiative , in late 2006 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier visited all five former soviet republics in central asia : kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan , tajikistan , turkmenistan and uzbekistan .
the reasons behind this strategy are clear .
under the steppes and deep beneath the caspian sea lie enormous reserves of oil and gas that could help secure europe 's long-term energy needs .
so far , the soviet-era pipeline network has had a virtual monopoly on the transport of oil and gas deposits .
the newly completed oil pipeline that runs from baku to the turkish mediterranean coast and the gas pipeline that follows this route up to the turkish-georgian border represent a challenge to russia 's pipeline dominance over central asia 's natural resources .
however , russia 's gasprom continues to rule the market in central asia .
in addition to russia , the us , and europe , china has emerged as a major competitor for these rich natural resources .
beijing is considering investing billions of dollars to develop the exploitation of energy reserves and build pipelines .
china and russia have secured their influence on the region through the shanghai cooperation organization , an intergovernmental body that includes all central asian countries except turkmenistan .
ruthless dictatorships central asia represents a crucial zone on the frontlines of the troubled european and american mission in afghanistan .
germany has established an airbase to supply its armed forces in afghanistan in the uzbek provincial capital of termez .
however , berlin and brussels face some uneasy conflicts in the region .
particularly in countries like uzbekistan and turkmenistan , rich natural resources have fallen into the hands of the ruling dictatorships , and citizens of these countries live under autocratic regimes .
until his death in december , turkmenistan president saparmurat niyazov imposed a bizarre personality cult on the country .
repressive rule helped him to fill his foreign bank accounts , but people were left with severe food shortages .
andijan massacre and sanctions in may 2005 , uzbek president islam karimov ordered government forces to open fire on tens of thousands of democracy protestors in the city of andijan .
estimates of those killed in the hail of bullets range from hundreds to thousands .
karimov and his government justified the brutal crackdown as a necessary measure to put down an alleged islamic coup - and opposed eu and us calls for an international inquiry into the killings .
as a result , the eu has imposed sanctions against uzbekistan since october 2005 , issued an arms embargo and refused to allow high-ranking members of the uzbek government to enter their territory .
it is not clear what exactly happened in andijan , but there remains no doubt that the uprising was sparked by protests against the despotic rule of the state .
the external threat of islamism helps karimov to retain his hold on power , yet it is also his despotic rule that has laid the foundations for extremist groups making extravagant promises .
dialogue with dictators germany 's policy on central asia aims to promote change through dialogue with dictators and the government is working to ease or drop eu sanctions against uzbekistan .
nevertheless , in november , the eu voted to extend the measures for another three months .
the eu would be well advised to take a differentiated approach to the countries in central asia .
kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev keeps an iron grip on power with doubtful elections and repressive measures , yet in contrast to uzbekistan , he has allowed the population to benefit from the wealth generated by the country 's rapidly growing economy .
kazakhstan even has a minor political opposition and a free press that is slowly beginning to flourish .
an economic perspective take a walk through the kazakh economic boomtown almaty and the uzbek capital , tashkent , and the difference is immediately obvious .
tashkent is shrouded in an atmosphere of dejection and lethargy , whereas almaty is full of bustling activity .
in the economically backward country of kyrgyzstan , a confident public is challenging the ruling elite .
since the overthrow of president askar akayev in march 2005 , the political process in the country has fumbled from crisis to crisis .
in contrast to the other countries of the region , however , kyrgyz citizens have relatively little to fear when confronting representatives of the state .
promoting development the eu should pursue a strategy that focuses on these countries and promotes their development , and above all , gives kyrgyzstan 's impoverished economy a helping hand .
the death of niyazov opens up a window of opportunity to encourage the unsettled turkmen leaders to institute reforms .
friendly handshakes and smiles , however , will do little to convince karimov to initiate reforms .
the uzbek president interprets every concession as a sign of weakness .
that is a lesson that the americans learned the hard way after they established a military base in uzbekistan in 2001 .
four years later , the andijan massacre cooled relations between the two countries , and the us had to abandon the base .
german foreign policymakers seem to be making the same mistake by openly flirting with the dictator in tashkent .
however , if europe is resolute in isolating karimov and works instead to promote prospering countries along the border with uzbekistan , the uzbek political leadership may in turn out pressure on karimov to introduce reforms , forcing him to soften his attitude .
uzbekistan and even turkmenistan need a bridge to the west even more than the west needs them .
without europe , they would be forced to enter into a reluctant dependency on china and russia .
this is an opportunity that european foreign policy should take full advantage of .

that is a lesson that the americans learned the hard way after they established a military base in uzbekistan in 2001 .
four years later , the andijan massacre cooled relations between the two countries , and the us had to abandon the base .
german foreign policymakers seem to be making the same mistake by openly flirting with the dictator in tashkent .
however , if europe is resolute in isolating karimov and works instead to promote prospering countries along the border with uzbekistan , the uzbek political leadership may in turn out pressure on karimov to introduce reforms , forcing him to soften his attitude .
uzbekistan and even turkmenistan need a bridge to the west even more than the west needs them .
without europe , they would be forced to enter into a reluctant dependency on china and russia .
this is an opportunity that european foreign policy should take full advantage of .

gates said the world today is different and more complex than during the cold war era , and partnerships with other countries , including russia , were needed to face common problems and a new challenge from islamic extremism . he said he had accepted an invitation from putin and russian defense minister sergei ivanov to visit russia .
' rumsfeld 's " old europe " belongs to the past ' the new us defense secretary also made a passing but pointed reference to his predecessor , donald rumsfeld , who antagonized european powers by dividing the nato alliance into countries that supported the us invasion in iraq and those who did not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin surprised the conference by lashing out at the united states saturday " over the years , people have tried to put the nations of europe and of the alliance into different categories - the ' free world ' versus ' those behind the iron curtain ' , ' north ' versus ' south ' , ' east ' versus ' west , " ' he said .

" looking back , it seems clear that totalitarianism was defeated as much by ideas the west championed - now and then - as by icbms -lrb- intercontinental ballistic missiles -rrb- , tanks and warships that the west deployed , " he said .
" our most effective weapon , then and now , has been europe and north america 's shared belief in political and economic freedom , religious toleration , human rights and representative government and the rule of law , " he said .

" those attacks - and other threats that have since emerged - revealed even more starkly the need to reorient the atlantic alliance to be able to export security beyond the borders of nato , " he said . he stressed the importance of not allowing success in afghanistan to slip away . other challenges he cited included sectarian conflicts and jihadist movements radiating out from central asia and the middle east ; an iran " with hegemonic ambitions seeking nuclear power ; " and the struggle over the future of iraq . he also said china was at a " strategic crossroads . " " all of us seek a constructive relationship with china , but we also wonder about strategic choices china may make , " he said .

" gates , a former cia director who witnessed the collapse of the soviet union , responded with wry humor and a history lesson to putin who portrayed the united states in a speech here saturday as a dangerous , destabilizing world power . " speaking of issues going back many years , as an old cold warrior , one of yesterday 's speakers almost filled me with nostalgia for a less complex time .
almost , " gates said in a speech to the same international security conference . " i have , like your second speaker yesterday , a starkly different background - a career in the spy business .
and i guess old spies have a habit of blunt speaking , " he said . re-education for a cold warrior but in his debut speech as us defense chief , gates said he had gone to " re-education camp " as a university president where he learned in dealing with academic faculties that it is either " be nice " or " be gone . "
gates said the world today is different and more complex than during the cold war era , and partnerships with other countries , including russia , were needed to face common problems and a new challenge from islamic extremism . he said he had accepted an invitation from putin and russian defense minister sergei ivanov to visit russia .
' rumsfeld 's " old europe " belongs to the past ' the new us defense secretary also made a passing but pointed reference to his predecessor , donald rumsfeld , who antagonized european powers by dividing the nato alliance into countries that supported the us invasion in iraq and those who did not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin surprised the conference by lashing out at the united states saturday " over the years , people have tried to put the nations of europe and of the alliance into different categories - the ' free world ' versus ' those behind the iron curtain ' , ' north ' versus ' south ' , ' east ' versus ' west , " ' he said .
" and i am told that some have even spoken in terms of ' old ' europe versus ' new . " ' " all of these characterizations belong to the past , " he said . " looking back , it seems clear that totalitarianism was defeated as much by ideas the west championed - now and then - as by icbms -lrb- intercontinental ballistic missiles -rrb- , tanks and warships that the west deployed , " he said .
" our most effective weapon , then and now , has been europe and north america 's shared belief in political and economic freedom , religious toleration , human rights and representative government and the rule of law , " he said . " today they are under threat by another virulent ideological adversary and are confronted by a range of other looming geopolitical challenges , " he said .
energy for political coercion putin on saturday stunned top officials and academics gathered in munich with a vehement attack on us leadership in the world .
a former kgb spy , putin charged that united states has " overstepped its borders in all spheres , " creating a dangerous " uni-polar " world that had brought war , ruin and insecurity . he questioned the intentions behind nato expansion eastward into countries that once formed part of the soviet union , and us plans for missile defense systems in poland and the czech republic , former soviet bloc states . gates in contrast said russia was " a partner in endeavors . " " but we wonder , too , about some russian policies that seem to work against international stability , such as its arms transfers and its temptation to use energy resources for political coercion , " he said . russia " need not fear law-based democracies on its border , " he added .

but dealing with dictatorships in the region poses major challenges , writes journalist marcus bensmann in baku . central asia , located between the pamir mountains and the caspian sea , forms a strategic land link between china and europe , and this year , germany intends to use its eu council presidency to introduce a new central asia strategy that will forge closer ties between the region and europe .
as part of this initiative , in late 2006 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier visited all five former soviet republics in central asia : kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan , tajikistan , turkmenistan and uzbekistan .
the reasons behind this strategy are clear .
under the steppes and deep beneath the caspian sea lie enormous reserves of oil and gas that could help secure europe 's long-term energy needs .
so far , the soviet-era pipeline network has had a virtual monopoly on the transport of oil and gas deposits .
the newly completed oil pipeline that runs from baku to the turkish mediterranean coast and the gas pipeline that follows this route up to the turkish-georgian border represent a challenge to russia 's pipeline dominance over central asia 's natural resources .
however , russia 's gasprom continues to rule the market in central asia .
in addition to russia , the us , and europe , china has emerged as a major competitor for these rich natural resources .
beijing is considering investing billions of dollars to develop the exploitation of energy reserves and build pipelines .
china and russia have secured their influence on the region through the shanghai cooperation organization , an intergovernmental body that includes all central asian countries except turkmenistan .
ruthless dictatorships central asia represents a crucial zone on the frontlines of the troubled european and american mission in afghanistan .
germany has established an airbase to supply its armed forces in afghanistan in the uzbek provincial capital of termez .
however , berlin and brussels face some uneasy conflicts in the region .
particularly in countries like uzbekistan and turkmenistan , rich natural resources have fallen into the hands of the ruling dictatorships , and citizens of these countries live under autocratic regimes .
until his death in december , turkmenistan president saparmurat niyazov imposed a bizarre personality cult on the country .
repressive rule helped him to fill his foreign bank accounts , but people were left with severe food shortages .
andijan massacre and sanctions in may 2005 , uzbek president islam karimov ordered government forces to open fire on tens of thousands of democracy protestors in the city of andijan .
estimates of those killed in the hail of bullets range from hundreds to thousands .
karimov and his government justified the brutal crackdown as a necessary measure to put down an alleged islamic coup - and opposed eu and us calls for an international inquiry into the killings .
as a result , the eu has imposed sanctions against uzbekistan since october 2005 , issued an arms embargo and refused to allow high-ranking members of the uzbek government to enter their territory .
it is not clear what exactly happened in andijan , but there remains no doubt that the uprising was sparked by protests against the despotic rule of the state .
the external threat of islamism helps karimov to retain his hold on power , yet it is also his despotic rule that has laid the foundations for extremist groups making extravagant promises .
dialogue with dictators germany 's policy on central asia aims to promote change through dialogue with dictators and the government is working to ease or drop eu sanctions against uzbekistan .
nevertheless , in november , the eu voted to extend the measures for another three months .
the eu would be well advised to take a differentiated approach to the countries in central asia .
kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev keeps an iron grip on power with doubtful elections and repressive measures , yet in contrast to uzbekistan , he has allowed the population to benefit from the wealth generated by the country 's rapidly growing economy .
kazakhstan even has a minor political opposition and a free press that is slowly beginning to flourish .
an economic perspective take a walk through the kazakh economic boomtown almaty and the uzbek capital , tashkent , and the difference is immediately obvious .
tashkent is shrouded in an atmosphere of dejection and lethargy , whereas almaty is full of bustling activity .
in the economically backward country of kyrgyzstan , a confident public is challenging the ruling elite .
since the overthrow of president askar akayev in march 2005 , the political process in the country has fumbled from crisis to crisis .
in contrast to the other countries of the region , however , kyrgyz citizens have relatively little to fear when confronting representatives of the state .
promoting development the eu should pursue a strategy that focuses on these countries and promotes their development , and above all , gives kyrgyzstan 's impoverished economy a helping hand .
the death of niyazov opens up a window of opportunity to encourage the unsettled turkmen leaders to institute reforms .
friendly handshakes and smiles , however , will do little to convince karimov to initiate reforms .
the uzbek president interprets every concession as a sign of weakness .
that is a lesson that the americans learned the hard way after they established a military base in uzbekistan in 2001 .
four years later , the andijan massacre cooled relations between the two countries , and the us had to abandon the base .
german foreign policymakers seem to be making the same mistake by openly flirting with the dictator in tashkent .
however , if europe is resolute in isolating karimov and works instead to promote prospering countries along the border with uzbekistan , the uzbek political leadership may in turn out pressure on karimov to introduce reforms , forcing him to soften his attitude .
uzbekistan and even turkmenistan need a bridge to the west even more than the west needs them .
without europe , they would be forced to enter into a reluctant dependency on china and russia .
this is an opportunity that european foreign policy should take full advantage of .

particularly in countries like uzbekistan and turkmenistan , rich natural resources have fallen into the hands of the ruling dictatorships , and citizens of these countries live under autocratic regimes .
until his death in december , turkmenistan president saparmurat niyazov imposed a bizarre personality cult on the country .
repressive rule helped him to fill his foreign bank accounts , but people were left with severe food shortages .
andijan massacre and sanctions in may 2005 , uzbek president islam karimov ordered government forces to open fire on tens of thousands of democracy protestors in the city of andijan .
estimates of those killed in the hail of bullets range from hundreds to thousands .
karimov and his government justified the brutal crackdown as a necessary measure to put down an alleged islamic coup - and opposed eu and us calls for an international inquiry into the killings .
as a result , the eu has imposed sanctions against uzbekistan since october 2005 , issued an arms embargo and refused to allow high-ranking members of the uzbek government to enter their territory .
it is not clear what exactly happened in andijan , but there remains no doubt that the uprising was sparked by protests against the despotic rule of the state .
the external threat of islamism helps karimov to retain his hold on power , yet it is also his despotic rule that has laid the foundations for extremist groups making extravagant promises .
dialogue with dictators germany 's policy on central asia aims to promote change through dialogue with dictators and the government is working to ease or drop eu sanctions against uzbekistan .
nevertheless , in november , the eu voted to extend the measures for another three months .
the eu would be well advised to take a differentiated approach to the countries in central asia .
kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev keeps an iron grip on power with doubtful elections and repressive measures , yet in contrast to uzbekistan , he has allowed the population to benefit from the wealth generated by the country 's rapidly growing economy .
kazakhstan even has a minor political opposition and a free press that is slowly beginning to flourish .
an economic perspective take a walk through the kazakh economic boomtown almaty and the uzbek capital , tashkent , and the difference is immediately obvious .
tashkent is shrouded in an atmosphere of dejection and lethargy , whereas almaty is full of bustling activity .
in the economically backward country of kyrgyzstan , a confident public is challenging the ruling elite .
since the overthrow of president askar akayev in march 2005 , the political process in the country has fumbled from crisis to crisis .
in contrast to the other countries of the region , however , kyrgyz citizens have relatively little to fear when confronting representatives of the state .
promoting development the eu should pursue a strategy that focuses on these countries and promotes their development , and above all , gives kyrgyzstan 's impoverished economy a helping hand .
the death of niyazov opens up a window of opportunity to encourage the unsettled turkmen leaders to institute reforms .
friendly handshakes and smiles , however , will do little to convince karimov to initiate reforms .
the uzbek president interprets every concession as a sign of weakness .
that is a lesson that the americans learned the hard way after they established a military base in uzbekistan in 2001 .
four years later , the andijan massacre cooled relations between the two countries , and the us had to abandon the base .
german foreign policymakers seem to be making the same mistake by openly flirting with the dictator in tashkent .
however , if europe is resolute in isolating karimov and works instead to promote prospering countries along the border with uzbekistan , the uzbek political leadership may in turn out pressure on karimov to introduce reforms , forcing him to soften his attitude .
uzbekistan and even turkmenistan need a bridge to the west even more than the west needs them .
without europe , they would be forced to enter into a reluctant dependency on china and russia .
this is an opportunity that european foreign policy should take full advantage of .

but dealing with dictatorships in the region poses major challenges , writes journalist marcus bensmann in baku . central asia , located between the pamir mountains and the caspian sea , forms a strategic land link between china and europe , and this year , germany intends to use its eu council presidency to introduce a new central asia strategy that will forge closer ties between the region and europe .
as part of this initiative , in late 2006 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier visited all five former soviet republics in central asia : kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan , tajikistan , turkmenistan and uzbekistan .
the reasons behind this strategy are clear .
under the steppes and deep beneath the caspian sea lie enormous reserves of oil and gas that could help secure europe 's long-term energy needs .
so far , the soviet-era pipeline network has had a virtual monopoly on the transport of oil and gas deposits .
the newly completed oil pipeline that runs from baku to the turkish mediterranean coast and the gas pipeline that follows this route up to the turkish-georgian border represent a challenge to russia 's pipeline dominance over central asia 's natural resources .
however , russia 's gasprom continues to rule the market in central asia .
in addition to russia , the us , and europe , china has emerged as a major competitor for these rich natural resources .
beijing is considering investing billions of dollars to develop the exploitation of energy reserves and build pipelines .
china and russia have secured their influence on the region through the shanghai cooperation organization , an intergovernmental body that includes all central asian countries except turkmenistan .
ruthless dictatorships central asia represents a crucial zone on the frontlines of the troubled european and american mission in afghanistan .
germany has established an airbase to supply its armed forces in afghanistan in the uzbek provincial capital of termez .
however , berlin and brussels face some uneasy conflicts in the region .
particularly in countries like uzbekistan and turkmenistan , rich natural resources have fallen into the hands of the ruling dictatorships , and citizens of these countries live under autocratic regimes .

" gates , a former cia director who witnessed the collapse of the soviet union , responded with wry humor and a history lesson to putin who portrayed the united states in a speech here saturday as a dangerous , destabilizing world power . " speaking of issues going back many years , as an old cold warrior , one of yesterday 's speakers almost filled me with nostalgia for a less complex time .
almost , " gates said in a speech to the same international security conference . " i have , like your second speaker yesterday , a starkly different background - a career in the spy business .
and i guess old spies have a habit of blunt speaking , " he said . re-education for a cold warrior but in his debut speech as us defense chief , gates said he had gone to " re-education camp " as a university president where he learned in dealing with academic faculties that it is either " be nice " or " be gone . "
gates said the world today is different and more complex than during the cold war era , and partnerships with other countries , including russia , were needed to face common problems and a new challenge from islamic extremism . he said he had accepted an invitation from putin and russian defense minister sergei ivanov to visit russia .
' rumsfeld 's " old europe " belongs to the past ' the new us defense secretary also made a passing but pointed reference to his predecessor , donald rumsfeld , who antagonized european powers by dividing the nato alliance into countries that supported the us invasion in iraq and those who did not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin surprised the conference by lashing out at the united states saturday " over the years , people have tried to put the nations of europe and of the alliance into different categories - the ' free world ' versus ' those behind the iron curtain ' , ' north ' versus ' south ' , ' east ' versus ' west , " ' he said .
" and i am told that some have even spoken in terms of ' old ' europe versus ' new . " ' " all of these characterizations belong to the past , " he said . " looking back , it seems clear that totalitarianism was defeated as much by ideas the west championed - now and then - as by icbms -lrb- intercontinental ballistic missiles -rrb- , tanks and warships that the west deployed , " he said .
" our most effective weapon , then and now , has been europe and north america 's shared belief in political and economic freedom , religious toleration , human rights and representative government and the rule of law , " he said . " today they are under threat by another virulent ideological adversary and are confronted by a range of other looming geopolitical challenges , " he said .
energy for political coercion putin on saturday stunned top officials and academics gathered in munich with a vehement attack on us leadership in the world .
a former kgb spy , putin charged that united states has " overstepped its borders in all spheres , " creating a dangerous " uni-polar " world that had brought war , ruin and insecurity . he questioned the intentions behind nato expansion eastward into countries that once formed part of the soviet union , and us plans for missile defense systems in poland and the czech republic , former soviet bloc states . gates in contrast said russia was " a partner in endeavors . " " but we wonder , too , about some russian policies that seem to work against international stability , such as its arms transfers and its temptation to use energy resources for political coercion , " he said . russia " need not fear law-based democracies on its border , " he added .
exporting security gates identified violent extremism " grounded in a profound alienation from the foundations of the modern world " as a challenge " unlike anything the west has faced in many generations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security was tight in munich for the conference " no fewer than 18 terrorist organizations , many linked with al-qaeda , have pulled off bloody attacks throughout the world , " he said .
" those attacks - and other threats that have since emerged - revealed even more starkly the need to reorient the atlantic alliance to be able to export security beyond the borders of nato , " he said . he stressed the importance of not allowing success in afghanistan to slip away . other challenges he cited included sectarian conflicts and jihadist movements radiating out from central asia and the middle east ; an iran " with hegemonic ambitions seeking nuclear power ; " and the struggle over the future of iraq . he also said china was at a " strategic crossroads . " " all of us seek a constructive relationship with china , but we also wonder about strategic choices china may make , " he said .

" gates , a former cia director who witnessed the collapse of the soviet union , responded with wry humor and a history lesson to putin who portrayed the united states in a speech here saturday as a dangerous , destabilizing world power . " speaking of issues going back many years , as an old cold warrior , one of yesterday 's speakers almost filled me with nostalgia for a less complex time .
almost , " gates said in a speech to the same international security conference . " i have , like your second speaker yesterday , a starkly different background - a career in the spy business .
and i guess old spies have a habit of blunt speaking , " he said . re-education for a cold warrior but in his debut speech as us defense chief , gates said he had gone to " re-education camp " as a university president where he learned in dealing with academic faculties that it is either " be nice " or " be gone . "
gates said the world today is different and more complex than during the cold war era , and partnerships with other countries , including russia , were needed to face common problems and a new challenge from islamic extremism . he said he had accepted an invitation from putin and russian defense minister sergei ivanov to visit russia .
' rumsfeld 's " old europe " belongs to the past ' the new us defense secretary also made a passing but pointed reference to his predecessor , donald rumsfeld , who antagonized european powers by dividing the nato alliance into countries that supported the us invasion in iraq and those who did not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin surprised the conference by lashing out at the united states saturday " over the years , people have tried to put the nations of europe and of the alliance into different categories - the ' free world ' versus ' those behind the iron curtain ' , ' north ' versus ' south ' , ' east ' versus ' west , " ' he said .
" and i am told that some have even spoken in terms of ' old ' europe versus ' new . " ' " all of these characterizations belong to the past , " he said . " looking back , it seems clear that totalitarianism was defeated as much by ideas the west championed - now and then - as by icbms -lrb- intercontinental ballistic missiles -rrb- , tanks and warships that the west deployed , " he said .
" our most effective weapon , then and now , has been europe and north america 's shared belief in political and economic freedom , religious toleration , human rights and representative government and the rule of law , " he said . " today they are under threat by another virulent ideological adversary and are confronted by a range of other looming geopolitical challenges , " he said .
energy for political coercion putin on saturday stunned top officials and academics gathered in munich with a vehement attack on us leadership in the world .
a former kgb spy , putin charged that united states has " overstepped its borders in all spheres , " creating a dangerous " uni-polar " world that had brought war , ruin and insecurity . he questioned the intentions behind nato expansion eastward into countries that once formed part of the soviet union , and us plans for missile defense systems in poland and the czech republic , former soviet bloc states . gates in contrast said russia was " a partner in endeavors . " " but we wonder , too , about some russian policies that seem to work against international stability , such as its arms transfers and its temptation to use energy resources for political coercion , " he said . russia " need not fear law-based democracies on its border , " he added .
exporting security gates identified violent extremism " grounded in a profound alienation from the foundations of the modern world " as a challenge " unlike anything the west has faced in many generations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security was tight in munich for the conference " no fewer than 18 terrorist organizations , many linked with al-qaeda , have pulled off bloody attacks throughout the world , " he said .
" those attacks - and other threats that have since emerged - revealed even more starkly the need to reorient the atlantic alliance to be able to export security beyond the borders of nato , " he said . he stressed the importance of not allowing success in afghanistan to slip away . other challenges he cited included sectarian conflicts and jihadist movements radiating out from central asia and the middle east ; an iran " with hegemonic ambitions seeking nuclear power ; " and the struggle over the future of iraq . he also said china was at a " strategic crossroads .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 11.02.2007 opinion : eu quest for central asian oil and democracy is risky großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants a new foreign policy to build closer ties between the eu and the countries of central asia .
but dealing with dictatorships in the region poses major challenges , writes journalist marcus bensmann in baku . central asia , located between the pamir mountains and the caspian sea , forms a strategic land link between china and europe , and this year , germany intends to use its eu council presidency to introduce a new central asia strategy that will forge closer ties between the region and europe .
as part of this initiative , in late 2006 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier visited all five former soviet republics in central asia : kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan , tajikistan , turkmenistan and uzbekistan .
the reasons behind this strategy are clear .
under the steppes and deep beneath the caspian sea lie enormous reserves of oil and gas that could help secure europe 's long-term energy needs .
so far , the soviet-era pipeline network has had a virtual monopoly on the transport of oil and gas deposits .
the newly completed oil pipeline that runs from baku to the turkish mediterranean coast and the gas pipeline that follows this route up to the turkish-georgian border represent a challenge to russia 's pipeline dominance over central asia 's natural resources .
however , russia 's gasprom continues to rule the market in central asia .
in addition to russia , the us , and europe , china has emerged as a major competitor for these rich natural resources .
beijing is considering investing billions of dollars to develop the exploitation of energy reserves and build pipelines .
china and russia have secured their influence on the region through the shanghai cooperation organization , an intergovernmental body that includes all central asian countries except turkmenistan .
ruthless dictatorships central asia represents a crucial zone on the frontlines of the troubled european and american mission in afghanistan .
germany has established an airbase to supply its armed forces in afghanistan in the uzbek provincial capital of termez .
however , berlin and brussels face some uneasy conflicts in the region .
particularly in countries like uzbekistan and turkmenistan , rich natural resources have fallen into the hands of the ruling dictatorships , and citizens of these countries live under autocratic regimes .
until his death in december , turkmenistan president saparmurat niyazov imposed a bizarre personality cult on the country .
repressive rule helped him to fill his foreign bank accounts , but people were left with severe food shortages .
andijan massacre and sanctions in may 2005 , uzbek president islam karimov ordered government forces to open fire on tens of thousands of democracy protestors in the city of andijan .
estimates of those killed in the hail of bullets range from hundreds to thousands .
karimov and his government justified the brutal crackdown as a necessary measure to put down an alleged islamic coup - and opposed eu and us calls for an international inquiry into the killings .
as a result , the eu has imposed sanctions against uzbekistan since october 2005 , issued an arms embargo and refused to allow high-ranking members of the uzbek government to enter their territory .
it is not clear what exactly happened in andijan , but there remains no doubt that the uprising was sparked by protests against the despotic rule of the state .
the external threat of islamism helps karimov to retain his hold on power , yet it is also his despotic rule that has laid the foundations for extremist groups making extravagant promises .
dialogue with dictators germany 's policy on central asia aims to promote change through dialogue with dictators and the government is working to ease or drop eu sanctions against uzbekistan .
nevertheless , in november , the eu voted to extend the measures for another three months .
the eu would be well advised to take a differentiated approach to the countries in central asia .
kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev keeps an iron grip on power with doubtful elections and repressive measures , yet in contrast to uzbekistan , he has allowed the population to benefit from the wealth generated by the country 's rapidly growing economy .
kazakhstan even has a minor political opposition and a free press that is slowly beginning to flourish .
an economic perspective take a walk through the kazakh economic boomtown almaty and the uzbek capital , tashkent , and the difference is immediately obvious .
tashkent is shrouded in an atmosphere of dejection and lethargy , whereas almaty is full of bustling activity .
in the economically backward country of kyrgyzstan , a confident public is challenging the ruling elite .
since the overthrow of president askar akayev in march 2005 , the political process in the country has fumbled from crisis to crisis .
in contrast to the other countries of the region , however , kyrgyz citizens have relatively little to fear when confronting representatives of the state .
promoting development the eu should pursue a strategy that focuses on these countries and promotes their development , and above all , gives kyrgyzstan 's impoverished economy a helping hand .
the death of niyazov opens up a window of opportunity to encourage the unsettled turkmen leaders to institute reforms .
friendly handshakes and smiles , however , will do little to convince karimov to initiate reforms .
the uzbek president interprets every concession as a sign of weakness .
that is a lesson that the americans learned the hard way after they established a military base in uzbekistan in 2001 .
four years later , the andijan massacre cooled relations between the two countries , and the us had to abandon the base .
german foreign policymakers seem to be making the same mistake by openly flirting with the dictator in tashkent .
however , if europe is resolute in isolating karimov and works instead to promote prospering countries along the border with uzbekistan , the uzbek political leadership may in turn out pressure on karimov to introduce reforms , forcing him to soften his attitude .
uzbekistan and even turkmenistan need a bridge to the west even more than the west needs them .
without europe , they would be forced to enter into a reluctant dependency on china and russia .
this is an opportunity that european foreign policy should take full advantage of .

but goalie jens lehmann still sees room for improvement . jens lehmann believes the german national soccer team has improved vastly compared to early 2006 and wants to qualify swiftly for euro 2008 . the germany goalkeeper also told kicker , a german sports magazine , this week that that young german soccer stars need a better education and the clubs a more professional management . " we are at least one class better than 12 months ago , " the arsenal goalkeeper said .
" the most important thing is that the players know exactly what they are supposed to do on the pitch .
of course we want to make sure that we qualify for the euro 2008 tournament . " germany won their first match of the year , a non-surprising 3-1 victory in a friendly against switzerland on wednesday .
the next euro 2008 qualifier is on march 24 away to a much stronger team , the czech republic . germany started poorly in 2006 but then rose to the world cup occasion in the summer by finishing third under coach jürgen klinsmann .
germany are now unbeaten in the seven games since joachim löw took over as coach after the world cup . bundesliga mainly animosity and sackings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann says the bickering mentality is counter-productive looking at the state of soccer in germany , lehmann called for improvement . " you get the impression that the attraction of the bundesliga mainly consists of who is at odds with whom and which coach is sacked next , " he said .
" soccer aspects are rarely mentioned , like whether a team is playing well . " in order to raise the standard - also manifested in mediocre showings in europe - lehmann called for a better soccer education and more professionalism in general . " werder bremen probably have a philosophy and maybe schalke 04 are building one , but everything else looks like patchwork , " he added .
" whenever i talk with presidents or general managers i get the impression that they know they must find a new coach sometime , but not by which criteria they need to choose him . " the bundesliga needs more quality in the positions of president , general manager and coach , " lehmann said . development in germany lagging behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rooney has been nurtured to stardom at man united development of young players also needs to get more attention , the germany no.1 said , pointing out that current english premiership leaders manchester united have done a good job in raising wayne rooney and cristiano ronaldo to the status of star players - with rooney far ahead of german lukas podolski , who is mainly benched at bayern munich . " rooney was n't good at first , " lehmann said .
" but manchester formed him ; he is getting better and better , the same with cristiano ronaldo .
i see the same at arsenal , the way young players are built up .

" if you are willing to negotiate , why do you insist on a suspension -lrb- of nuclear enrichment -rrb- ? "
ahmadinejad said , referring to the sensitive nuclear process the west wants iran to halt as proof it is not seeking nuclear weapons .
" if we suspend our activities then what are we going to talk about ?
why , if your nuclear plants are working 24 hours a day , why must iran be pressured to shut them down ? " " we are ready to negotiate but under fair and even conditions , " he told the faithful massed at azadi -lrb- freedom -rrb- square in tehran . hundreds of thousands of iranians massed around the country in their annual show of support for the revolution , with slogans like " death to america " mixing with the now familiar " nuclear energy is our natural right . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad spoke on the occasion of the 28th anniversary of the 1979 islamic revolution ahmadinejad 's defiance comes despite the un security council 's decision to impose sanctions against iran in december and its deadline for iran to halt uranium enrichment by feb .
21 or face further action . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said any idea of holding talks while iran carried out uranium enrichment was " totally unacceptable . "
steinmeier : world stands at crossroads german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , attending the annual security conference in munich , said that resolving the nuclear conflict with iran was of central importance to international security in the 21st century .
he said that the world stood at a crossroads .
" either we succeed in preventing iran and other states away from toying with the nuclear option over the next few years , or we 'll experience a new nuclear arms race with unforeseeable consequences for global security , " steinmeier said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said the world stands at a crossroads also at the conference , iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani said that iran wanted to achieve a " negotiated settlement of the case . " " we do n't want to aggravate the situation in the region , " larijani said . larijani said he had sent a letter to mohamed elbaradei , the chief of the vienna-based international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , offering to work out outstanding issues " within three weeks . " " i have written to mr elbaradei to say we are ready within three weeks to have the modality to solve all the outstanding issues with you . "
expectations were high that ahmadinejad would announce in his speech a breakthrough towards an industrial-scale enrichment of uranium , a process that can be used both in nuclear power stations and atomic bombs . speculation had been that iran would announce the installation of some of the 3,000 uranium-enriching centrifuges it wants to put in place at an underground nuclear facility in the city of natanz in the next months .
no plan to quit non-proliferation treaty instead , ahmadinejad promised that announcements would follow by april 9 - the day designated by iran as a holiday celebrating its achievements in nuclear technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani said he had notified the iaea that iran weas ready to talk " from now until april 9 you will hear frequently about the great progress of the iranian people and unique developments in the domains of industry , agriculture , and especially nuclear energy , " ahmadinejad said . striking a conciliatory tone with the un nuclear watchdog , ahmadinejad said that his government had no intention of quitting the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , despite previous threats . " we are willing to follow the regulations , " he said , referring to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty of which iran is a signatory .
" despite the authority of the parliament for the government to reduce its cooperation with the agency or even quit the npt , the government , with the coordination of parliament , has not used this .
it is willing to defend the people 's rights within the framework of the law . " there was a festive spirit at the mass rally in tehran , with children clutching balloons emblazoned with pro-nuclear slogans and the revolution motto : " freedom , independence and islamic republic . " the united states accuses iran of seeking a nuclear weapon , a charge denied by tehran which insists its atomic program is peaceful in nature . although the united states has said it wants the nuclear standoff resolved through diplomacy , washington has never ruled out military action to thwart iran 's atomic drive . dw staff / afpe -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel says iran must meet all demands over nuclear program german chancellor angela merkel on saturday called on iran to conform with the demands of the international community over its nuclear program " without ifs and buts and without tricks .

" gates , a former cia director who witnessed the collapse of the soviet union , responded with wry humor and a history lesson to putin who portrayed the united states in a speech here saturday as a dangerous , destabilizing world power . " speaking of issues going back many years , as an old cold warrior , one of yesterday 's speakers almost filled me with nostalgia for a less complex time .
almost , " gates said in a speech to the same international security conference . " i have , like your second speaker yesterday , a starkly different background - a career in the spy business .
and i guess old spies have a habit of blunt speaking , " he said . re-education for a cold warrior but in his debut speech as us defense chief , gates said he had gone to " re-education camp " as a university president where he learned in dealing with academic faculties that it is either " be nice " or " be gone . "
gates said the world today is different and more complex than during the cold war era , and partnerships with other countries , including russia , were needed to face common problems and a new challenge from islamic extremism . he said he had accepted an invitation from putin and russian defense minister sergei ivanov to visit russia .
' rumsfeld 's " old europe " belongs to the past ' the new us defense secretary also made a passing but pointed reference to his predecessor , donald rumsfeld , who antagonized european powers by dividing the nato alliance into countries that supported the us invasion in iraq and those who did not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin surprised the conference by lashing out at the united states saturday " over the years , people have tried to put the nations of europe and of the alliance into different categories - the ' free world ' versus ' those behind the iron curtain ' , ' north ' versus ' south ' , ' east ' versus ' west , " ' he said .
" and i am told that some have even spoken in terms of ' old ' europe versus ' new . " ' " all of these characterizations belong to the past , " he said . " looking back , it seems clear that totalitarianism was defeated as much by ideas the west championed - now and then - as by icbms -lrb- intercontinental ballistic missiles -rrb- , tanks and warships that the west deployed , " he said .
" our most effective weapon , then and now , has been europe and north america 's shared belief in political and economic freedom , religious toleration , human rights and representative government and the rule of law , " he said . " today they are under threat by another virulent ideological adversary and are confronted by a range of other looming geopolitical challenges , " he said .
energy for political coercion putin on saturday stunned top officials and academics gathered in munich with a vehement attack on us leadership in the world .
a former kgb spy , putin charged that united states has " overstepped its borders in all spheres , " creating a dangerous " uni-polar " world that had brought war , ruin and insecurity . he questioned the intentions behind nato expansion eastward into countries that once formed part of the soviet union , and us plans for missile defense systems in poland and the czech republic , former soviet bloc states . gates in contrast said russia was " a partner in endeavors . " " but we wonder , too , about some russian policies that seem to work against international stability , such as its arms transfers and its temptation to use energy resources for political coercion , " he said . russia " need not fear law-based democracies on its border , " he added .
exporting security gates identified violent extremism " grounded in a profound alienation from the foundations of the modern world " as a challenge " unlike anything the west has faced in many generations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security was tight in munich for the conference " no fewer than 18 terrorist organizations , many linked with al-qaeda , have pulled off bloody attacks throughout the world , " he said .
" those attacks - and other threats that have since emerged - revealed even more starkly the need to reorient the atlantic alliance to be able to export security beyond the borders of nato , " he said . he stressed the importance of not allowing success in afghanistan to slip away . other challenges he cited included sectarian conflicts and jihadist movements radiating out from central asia and the middle east ; an iran " with hegemonic ambitions seeking nuclear power ; " and the struggle over the future of iraq . he also said china was at a " strategic crossroads . " " all of us seek a constructive relationship with china , but we also wonder about strategic choices china may make , " he said .

but dealing with dictatorships in the region poses major challenges , writes journalist marcus bensmann in baku . central asia , located between the pamir mountains and the caspian sea , forms a strategic land link between china and europe , and this year , germany intends to use its eu council presidency to introduce a new central asia strategy that will forge closer ties between the region and europe .
as part of this initiative , in late 2006 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier visited all five former soviet republics in central asia : kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan , tajikistan , turkmenistan and uzbekistan .
the reasons behind this strategy are clear .
under the steppes and deep beneath the caspian sea lie enormous reserves of oil and gas that could help secure europe 's long-term energy needs .
so far , the soviet-era pipeline network has had a virtual monopoly on the transport of oil and gas deposits .
the newly completed oil pipeline that runs from baku to the turkish mediterranean coast and the gas pipeline that follows this route up to the turkish-georgian border represent a challenge to russia 's pipeline dominance over central asia 's natural resources .
however , russia 's gasprom continues to rule the market in central asia .
in addition to russia , the us , and europe , china has emerged as a major competitor for these rich natural resources .
beijing is considering investing billions of dollars to develop the exploitation of energy reserves and build pipelines .
china and russia have secured their influence on the region through the shanghai cooperation organization , an intergovernmental body that includes all central asian countries except turkmenistan .
ruthless dictatorships central asia represents a crucial zone on the frontlines of the troubled european and american mission in afghanistan .
germany has established an airbase to supply its armed forces in afghanistan in the uzbek provincial capital of termez .
however , berlin and brussels face some uneasy conflicts in the region .
particularly in countries like uzbekistan and turkmenistan , rich natural resources have fallen into the hands of the ruling dictatorships , and citizens of these countries live under autocratic regimes .
until his death in december , turkmenistan president saparmurat niyazov imposed a bizarre personality cult on the country .
repressive rule helped him to fill his foreign bank accounts , but people were left with severe food shortages .
andijan massacre and sanctions in may 2005 , uzbek president islam karimov ordered government forces to open fire on tens of thousands of democracy protestors in the city of andijan .
estimates of those killed in the hail of bullets range from hundreds to thousands .
karimov and his government justified the brutal crackdown as a necessary measure to put down an alleged islamic coup - and opposed eu and us calls for an international inquiry into the killings .
as a result , the eu has imposed sanctions against uzbekistan since october 2005 , issued an arms embargo and refused to allow high-ranking members of the uzbek government to enter their territory .
it is not clear what exactly happened in andijan , but there remains no doubt that the uprising was sparked by protests against the despotic rule of the state .
the external threat of islamism helps karimov to retain his hold on power , yet it is also his despotic rule that has laid the foundations for extremist groups making extravagant promises .
dialogue with dictators germany 's policy on central asia aims to promote change through dialogue with dictators and the government is working to ease or drop eu sanctions against uzbekistan .
nevertheless , in november , the eu voted to extend the measures for another three months .
the eu would be well advised to take a differentiated approach to the countries in central asia .
kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev keeps an iron grip on power with doubtful elections and repressive measures , yet in contrast to uzbekistan , he has allowed the population to benefit from the wealth generated by the country 's rapidly growing economy .
kazakhstan even has a minor political opposition and a free press that is slowly beginning to flourish .
an economic perspective take a walk through the kazakh economic boomtown almaty and the uzbek capital , tashkent , and the difference is immediately obvious .
tashkent is shrouded in an atmosphere of dejection and lethargy , whereas almaty is full of bustling activity .
in the economically backward country of kyrgyzstan , a confident public is challenging the ruling elite .
since the overthrow of president askar akayev in march 2005 , the political process in the country has fumbled from crisis to crisis .
in contrast to the other countries of the region , however , kyrgyz citizens have relatively little to fear when confronting representatives of the state .
promoting development the eu should pursue a strategy that focuses on these countries and promotes their development , and above all , gives kyrgyzstan 's impoverished economy a helping hand .
the death of niyazov opens up a window of opportunity to encourage the unsettled turkmen leaders to institute reforms .
friendly handshakes and smiles , however , will do little to convince karimov to initiate reforms .
the uzbek president interprets every concession as a sign of weakness .
that is a lesson that the americans learned the hard way after they established a military base in uzbekistan in 2001 .
four years later , the andijan massacre cooled relations between the two countries , and the us had to abandon the base .
german foreign policymakers seem to be making the same mistake by openly flirting with the dictator in tashkent .
however , if europe is resolute in isolating karimov and works instead to promote prospering countries along the border with uzbekistan , the uzbek political leadership may in turn out pressure on karimov to introduce reforms , forcing him to soften his attitude .
uzbekistan and even turkmenistan need a bridge to the west even more than the west needs them .
without europe , they would be forced to enter into a reluctant dependency on china and russia .
this is an opportunity that european foreign policy should take full advantage of .

but dealing with dictatorships in the region poses major challenges , writes journalist marcus bensmann in baku . central asia , located between the pamir mountains and the caspian sea , forms a strategic land link between china and europe , and this year , germany intends to use its eu council presidency to introduce a new central asia strategy that will forge closer ties between the region and europe .
as part of this initiative , in late 2006 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier visited all five former soviet republics in central asia : kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan , tajikistan , turkmenistan and uzbekistan .
the reasons behind this strategy are clear .
under the steppes and deep beneath the caspian sea lie enormous reserves of oil and gas that could help secure europe 's long-term energy needs .
so far , the soviet-era pipeline network has had a virtual monopoly on the transport of oil and gas deposits .
the newly completed oil pipeline that runs from baku to the turkish mediterranean coast and the gas pipeline that follows this route up to the turkish-georgian border represent a challenge to russia 's pipeline dominance over central asia 's natural resources .
however , russia 's gasprom continues to rule the market in central asia .
in addition to russia , the us , and europe , china has emerged as a major competitor for these rich natural resources .
beijing is considering investing billions of dollars to develop the exploitation of energy reserves and build pipelines .
china and russia have secured their influence on the region through the shanghai cooperation organization , an intergovernmental body that includes all central asian countries except turkmenistan .
ruthless dictatorships central asia represents a crucial zone on the frontlines of the troubled european and american mission in afghanistan .
germany has established an airbase to supply its armed forces in afghanistan in the uzbek provincial capital of termez .
however , berlin and brussels face some uneasy conflicts in the region .
particularly in countries like uzbekistan and turkmenistan , rich natural resources have fallen into the hands of the ruling dictatorships , and citizens of these countries live under autocratic regimes .
until his death in december , turkmenistan president saparmurat niyazov imposed a bizarre personality cult on the country .
repressive rule helped him to fill his foreign bank accounts , but people were left with severe food shortages .
andijan massacre and sanctions in may 2005 , uzbek president islam karimov ordered government forces to open fire on tens of thousands of democracy protestors in the city of andijan .
estimates of those killed in the hail of bullets range from hundreds to thousands .
karimov and his government justified the brutal crackdown as a necessary measure to put down an alleged islamic coup - and opposed eu and us calls for an international inquiry into the killings .
as a result , the eu has imposed sanctions against uzbekistan since october 2005 , issued an arms embargo and refused to allow high-ranking members of the uzbek government to enter their territory .
it is not clear what exactly happened in andijan , but there remains no doubt that the uprising was sparked by protests against the despotic rule of the state .
the external threat of islamism helps karimov to retain his hold on power , yet it is also his despotic rule that has laid the foundations for extremist groups making extravagant promises .
dialogue with dictators germany 's policy on central asia aims to promote change through dialogue with dictators and the government is working to ease or drop eu sanctions against uzbekistan .
nevertheless , in november , the eu voted to extend the measures for another three months .
the eu would be well advised to take a differentiated approach to the countries in central asia .
kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev keeps an iron grip on power with doubtful elections and repressive measures , yet in contrast to uzbekistan , he has allowed the population to benefit from the wealth generated by the country 's rapidly growing economy .
kazakhstan even has a minor political opposition and a free press that is slowly beginning to flourish .
an economic perspective take a walk through the kazakh economic boomtown almaty and the uzbek capital , tashkent , and the difference is immediately obvious .
tashkent is shrouded in an atmosphere of dejection and lethargy , whereas almaty is full of bustling activity .
in the economically backward country of kyrgyzstan , a confident public is challenging the ruling elite .
since the overthrow of president askar akayev in march 2005 , the political process in the country has fumbled from crisis to crisis .
in contrast to the other countries of the region , however , kyrgyz citizens have relatively little to fear when confronting representatives of the state .
promoting development the eu should pursue a strategy that focuses on these countries and promotes their development , and above all , gives kyrgyzstan 's impoverished economy a helping hand .

" gates , a former cia director who witnessed the collapse of the soviet union , responded with wry humor and a history lesson to putin who portrayed the united states in a speech here saturday as a dangerous , destabilizing world power . " speaking of issues going back many years , as an old cold warrior , one of yesterday 's speakers almost filled me with nostalgia for a less complex time .
almost , " gates said in a speech to the same international security conference . " i have , like your second speaker yesterday , a starkly different background - a career in the spy business .
and i guess old spies have a habit of blunt speaking , " he said . re-education for a cold warrior but in his debut speech as us defense chief , gates said he had gone to " re-education camp " as a university president where he learned in dealing with academic faculties that it is either " be nice " or " be gone . "
gates said the world today is different and more complex than during the cold war era , and partnerships with other countries , including russia , were needed to face common problems and a new challenge from islamic extremism . he said he had accepted an invitation from putin and russian defense minister sergei ivanov to visit russia .
' rumsfeld 's " old europe " belongs to the past ' the new us defense secretary also made a passing but pointed reference to his predecessor , donald rumsfeld , who antagonized european powers by dividing the nato alliance into countries that supported the us invasion in iraq and those who did not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin surprised the conference by lashing out at the united states saturday " over the years , people have tried to put the nations of europe and of the alliance into different categories - the ' free world ' versus ' those behind the iron curtain ' , ' north ' versus ' south ' , ' east ' versus ' west , " ' he said .
" and i am told that some have even spoken in terms of ' old ' europe versus ' new . " ' " all of these characterizations belong to the past , " he said . " looking back , it seems clear that totalitarianism was defeated as much by ideas the west championed - now and then - as by icbms -lrb- intercontinental ballistic missiles -rrb- , tanks and warships that the west deployed , " he said .

" if you are willing to negotiate , why do you insist on a suspension -lrb- of nuclear enrichment -rrb- ? "
ahmadinejad said , referring to the sensitive nuclear process the west wants iran to halt as proof it is not seeking nuclear weapons .
" if we suspend our activities then what are we going to talk about ?
why , if your nuclear plants are working 24 hours a day , why must iran be pressured to shut them down ? " " we are ready to negotiate but under fair and even conditions , " he told the faithful massed at azadi -lrb- freedom -rrb- square in tehran . hundreds of thousands of iranians massed around the country in their annual show of support for the revolution , with slogans like " death to america " mixing with the now familiar " nuclear energy is our natural right .

" " i have written to mr elbaradei to say we are ready within three weeks to have the modality to solve all the outstanding issues with you . "
expectations were high that ahmadinejad would announce in his speech a breakthrough towards an industrial-scale enrichment of uranium , a process that can be used both in nuclear power stations and atomic bombs . speculation had been that iran would announce the installation of some of the 3,000 uranium-enriching centrifuges it wants to put in place at an underground nuclear facility in the city of natanz in the next months .
no plan to quit non-proliferation treaty instead , ahmadinejad promised that announcements would follow by april 9 - the day designated by iran as a holiday celebrating its achievements in nuclear technology .

but goalie jens lehmann still sees room for improvement . jens lehmann believes the german national soccer team has improved vastly compared to early 2006 and wants to qualify swiftly for euro 2008 . the germany goalkeeper also told kicker , a german sports magazine , this week that that young german soccer stars need a better education and the clubs a more professional management . " we are at least one class better than 12 months ago , " the arsenal goalkeeper said .
" the most important thing is that the players know exactly what they are supposed to do on the pitch .
of course we want to make sure that we qualify for the euro 2008 tournament . " germany won their first match of the year , a non-surprising 3-1 victory in a friendly against switzerland on wednesday .
the next euro 2008 qualifier is on march 24 away to a much stronger team , the czech republic . germany started poorly in 2006 but then rose to the world cup occasion in the summer by finishing third under coach jürgen klinsmann .
germany are now unbeaten in the seven games since joachim löw took over as coach after the world cup . bundesliga mainly animosity and sackings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann says the bickering mentality is counter-productive looking at the state of soccer in germany , lehmann called for improvement . " you get the impression that the attraction of the bundesliga mainly consists of who is at odds with whom and which coach is sacked next , " he said .
" soccer aspects are rarely mentioned , like whether a team is playing well . " in order to raise the standard - also manifested in mediocre showings in europe - lehmann called for a better soccer education and more professionalism in general . " werder bremen probably have a philosophy and maybe schalke 04 are building one , but everything else looks like patchwork , " he added .
" whenever i talk with presidents or general managers i get the impression that they know they must find a new coach sometime , but not by which criteria they need to choose him . " the bundesliga needs more quality in the positions of president , general manager and coach , " lehmann said . development in germany lagging behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rooney has been nurtured to stardom at man united development of young players also needs to get more attention , the germany no.1 said , pointing out that current english premiership leaders manchester united have done a good job in raising wayne rooney and cristiano ronaldo to the status of star players - with rooney far ahead of german lukas podolski , who is mainly benched at bayern munich . " rooney was n't good at first , " lehmann said .

" if you are willing to negotiate , why do you insist on a suspension -lrb- of nuclear enrichment -rrb- ? "
ahmadinejad said , referring to the sensitive nuclear process the west wants iran to halt as proof it is not seeking nuclear weapons .
" if we suspend our activities then what are we going to talk about ?
why , if your nuclear plants are working 24 hours a day , why must iran be pressured to shut them down ? " " we are ready to negotiate but under fair and even conditions , " he told the faithful massed at azadi -lrb- freedom -rrb- square in tehran . hundreds of thousands of iranians massed around the country in their annual show of support for the revolution , with slogans like " death to america " mixing with the now familiar " nuclear energy is our natural right . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad spoke on the occasion of the 28th anniversary of the 1979 islamic revolution ahmadinejad 's defiance comes despite the un security council 's decision to impose sanctions against iran in december and its deadline for iran to halt uranium enrichment by feb .
21 or face further action . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said any idea of holding talks while iran carried out uranium enrichment was " totally unacceptable . "
steinmeier : world stands at crossroads german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , attending the annual security conference in munich , said that resolving the nuclear conflict with iran was of central importance to international security in the 21st century .
he said that the world stood at a crossroads .
" either we succeed in preventing iran and other states away from toying with the nuclear option over the next few years , or we 'll experience a new nuclear arms race with unforeseeable consequences for global security , " steinmeier said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said the world stands at a crossroads also at the conference , iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani said that iran wanted to achieve a " negotiated settlement of the case .

" " i have written to mr elbaradei to say we are ready within three weeks to have the modality to solve all the outstanding issues with you . "
expectations were high that ahmadinejad would announce in his speech a breakthrough towards an industrial-scale enrichment of uranium , a process that can be used both in nuclear power stations and atomic bombs . speculation had been that iran would announce the installation of some of the 3,000 uranium-enriching centrifuges it wants to put in place at an underground nuclear facility in the city of natanz in the next months .
no plan to quit non-proliferation treaty instead , ahmadinejad promised that announcements would follow by april 9 - the day designated by iran as a holiday celebrating its achievements in nuclear technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani said he had notified the iaea that iran weas ready to talk " from now until april 9 you will hear frequently about the great progress of the iranian people and unique developments in the domains of industry , agriculture , and especially nuclear energy , " ahmadinejad said . striking a conciliatory tone with the un nuclear watchdog , ahmadinejad said that his government had no intention of quitting the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , despite previous threats . " we are willing to follow the regulations , " he said , referring to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty of which iran is a signatory .

but goalie jens lehmann still sees room for improvement . jens lehmann believes the german national soccer team has improved vastly compared to early 2006 and wants to qualify swiftly for euro 2008 . the germany goalkeeper also told kicker , a german sports magazine , this week that that young german soccer stars need a better education and the clubs a more professional management . " we are at least one class better than 12 months ago , " the arsenal goalkeeper said .
" the most important thing is that the players know exactly what they are supposed to do on the pitch .
of course we want to make sure that we qualify for the euro 2008 tournament . " germany won their first match of the year , a non-surprising 3-1 victory in a friendly against switzerland on wednesday .
the next euro 2008 qualifier is on march 24 away to a much stronger team , the czech republic . germany started poorly in 2006 but then rose to the world cup occasion in the summer by finishing third under coach jürgen klinsmann .
germany are now unbeaten in the seven games since joachim löw took over as coach after the world cup . bundesliga mainly animosity and sackings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann says the bickering mentality is counter-productive looking at the state of soccer in germany , lehmann called for improvement . " you get the impression that the attraction of the bundesliga mainly consists of who is at odds with whom and which coach is sacked next , " he said .
" soccer aspects are rarely mentioned , like whether a team is playing well . " in order to raise the standard - also manifested in mediocre showings in europe - lehmann called for a better soccer education and more professionalism in general . " werder bremen probably have a philosophy and maybe schalke 04 are building one , but everything else looks like patchwork , " he added .
" whenever i talk with presidents or general managers i get the impression that they know they must find a new coach sometime , but not by which criteria they need to choose him . " the bundesliga needs more quality in the positions of president , general manager and coach , " lehmann said . development in germany lagging behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rooney has been nurtured to stardom at man united development of young players also needs to get more attention , the germany no.1 said , pointing out that current english premiership leaders manchester united have done a good job in raising wayne rooney and cristiano ronaldo to the status of star players - with rooney far ahead of german lukas podolski , who is mainly benched at bayern munich . " rooney was n't good at first , " lehmann said .
" but manchester formed him ; he is getting better and better , the same with cristiano ronaldo .
i see the same at arsenal , the way young players are built up .
you do n't see that very often in germany .

but new figures from the german office of foreign trade show that china will assume the export throne in 2008 . the news that china , with its booming economy , is about to become the world 's number one export nation has been met with caution not only by german business leaders , but managers and economists around the world . " the fact that china exports so much is n't really the issue , " said eva schwinghammer from the german chamber of commerce in shanghai .
" the real problem is that china exports much more than it imports .
there 's no balance , and that poses a risk to world market stability . " export ball well in china 's court bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china 's export industry far outstrips its imports the balance of trade is clearly in china 's favor . the goods china exports to germany are worth 19 billion euros more than everything it imports from germany .
textiles and electronics , like dvd players and computers , are the main drivers of china 's trade success - along with the fact that its currency , the yuan , is n't freely tradable . but the head of the german office of foreign trade , gert herx , pointed out that just because business is booming in china , it does n't mean the chinese are the ones profiting . " about 60 percent of chinese exports are funded by foreign investors , " he says .
" the products come from foreign companies that have built production facilities on chinese soil , or set up joint ventures with chinese companies .
german companies in china are n't just serving the chinese market ; they 're exporting back home and elsewhere .
it 's just a sign of globalization . " back at the chamber of commerce in shanghai , eva schwinghammer said it was only a matter of time before the forces of the world economy are felt in china . chinese firms stepping on european toes bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : made in china , sold in the eu " look at labor costs , " she said .
" wages are rising rapidly in china .
it 's common for skilled labor wages to double in a few years - annual increases of 25 to 30 percent are the norm in shanghai .
sooner or later the pressure will become too great .
and china wo n't be considered a cheap location for companies looking to produce high quality goods , particularly in the heavy machinery sector , for example . " that 's why the government in beijing is encouraging chinese businesses to shift from labor-intensive activities to technology-based areas . it has created a program to boost research and development so they can compete in sectors normally dominated by european and us firms .
it is also in the process of reassessing how the presence of foreign firms in china benefits the national economy .

" if you are willing to negotiate , why do you insist on a suspension -lrb- of nuclear enrichment -rrb- ? "
ahmadinejad said , referring to the sensitive nuclear process the west wants iran to halt as proof it is not seeking nuclear weapons .
" if we suspend our activities then what are we going to talk about ?
why , if your nuclear plants are working 24 hours a day , why must iran be pressured to shut them down ? " " we are ready to negotiate but under fair and even conditions , " he told the faithful massed at azadi -lrb- freedom -rrb- square in tehran . hundreds of thousands of iranians massed around the country in their annual show of support for the revolution , with slogans like " death to america " mixing with the now familiar " nuclear energy is our natural right . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad spoke on the occasion of the 28th anniversary of the 1979 islamic revolution ahmadinejad 's defiance comes despite the un security council 's decision to impose sanctions against iran in december and its deadline for iran to halt uranium enrichment by feb .
21 or face further action . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said any idea of holding talks while iran carried out uranium enrichment was " totally unacceptable . "
steinmeier : world stands at crossroads german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , attending the annual security conference in munich , said that resolving the nuclear conflict with iran was of central importance to international security in the 21st century .
he said that the world stood at a crossroads .
" either we succeed in preventing iran and other states away from toying with the nuclear option over the next few years , or we 'll experience a new nuclear arms race with unforeseeable consequences for global security , " steinmeier said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said the world stands at a crossroads also at the conference , iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani said that iran wanted to achieve a " negotiated settlement of the case . " " we do n't want to aggravate the situation in the region , " larijani said . larijani said he had sent a letter to mohamed elbaradei , the chief of the vienna-based international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , offering to work out outstanding issues " within three weeks . " " i have written to mr elbaradei to say we are ready within three weeks to have the modality to solve all the outstanding issues with you . "
expectations were high that ahmadinejad would announce in his speech a breakthrough towards an industrial-scale enrichment of uranium , a process that can be used both in nuclear power stations and atomic bombs . speculation had been that iran would announce the installation of some of the 3,000 uranium-enriching centrifuges it wants to put in place at an underground nuclear facility in the city of natanz in the next months .
no plan to quit non-proliferation treaty instead , ahmadinejad promised that announcements would follow by april 9 - the day designated by iran as a holiday celebrating its achievements in nuclear technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani said he had notified the iaea that iran weas ready to talk " from now until april 9 you will hear frequently about the great progress of the iranian people and unique developments in the domains of industry , agriculture , and especially nuclear energy , " ahmadinejad said . striking a conciliatory tone with the un nuclear watchdog , ahmadinejad said that his government had no intention of quitting the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , despite previous threats . " we are willing to follow the regulations , " he said , referring to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty of which iran is a signatory .
" despite the authority of the parliament for the government to reduce its cooperation with the agency or even quit the npt , the government , with the coordination of parliament , has not used this .
it is willing to defend the people 's rights within the framework of the law . " there was a festive spirit at the mass rally in tehran , with children clutching balloons emblazoned with pro-nuclear slogans and the revolution motto : " freedom , independence and islamic republic . " the united states accuses iran of seeking a nuclear weapon , a charge denied by tehran which insists its atomic program is peaceful in nature . although the united states has said it wants the nuclear standoff resolved through diplomacy , washington has never ruled out military action to thwart iran 's atomic drive . dw staff / afpe -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel says iran must meet all demands over nuclear program german chancellor angela merkel on saturday called on iran to conform with the demands of the international community over its nuclear program " without ifs and buts and without tricks .

" if you are willing to negotiate , why do you insist on a suspension -lrb- of nuclear enrichment -rrb- ? "
ahmadinejad said , referring to the sensitive nuclear process the west wants iran to halt as proof it is not seeking nuclear weapons .
" if we suspend our activities then what are we going to talk about ?
why , if your nuclear plants are working 24 hours a day , why must iran be pressured to shut them down ? " " we are ready to negotiate but under fair and even conditions , " he told the faithful massed at azadi -lrb- freedom -rrb- square in tehran . hundreds of thousands of iranians massed around the country in their annual show of support for the revolution , with slogans like " death to america " mixing with the now familiar " nuclear energy is our natural right . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad spoke on the occasion of the 28th anniversary of the 1979 islamic revolution ahmadinejad 's defiance comes despite the un security council 's decision to impose sanctions against iran in december and its deadline for iran to halt uranium enrichment by feb .
21 or face further action . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said any idea of holding talks while iran carried out uranium enrichment was " totally unacceptable . "
steinmeier : world stands at crossroads german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , attending the annual security conference in munich , said that resolving the nuclear conflict with iran was of central importance to international security in the 21st century .
he said that the world stood at a crossroads .
" either we succeed in preventing iran and other states away from toying with the nuclear option over the next few years , or we 'll experience a new nuclear arms race with unforeseeable consequences for global security , " steinmeier said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said the world stands at a crossroads also at the conference , iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani said that iran wanted to achieve a " negotiated settlement of the case . " " we do n't want to aggravate the situation in the region , " larijani said . larijani said he had sent a letter to mohamed elbaradei , the chief of the vienna-based international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , offering to work out outstanding issues " within three weeks . " " i have written to mr elbaradei to say we are ready within three weeks to have the modality to solve all the outstanding issues with you . "
expectations were high that ahmadinejad would announce in his speech a breakthrough towards an industrial-scale enrichment of uranium , a process that can be used both in nuclear power stations and atomic bombs . speculation had been that iran would announce the installation of some of the 3,000 uranium-enriching centrifuges it wants to put in place at an underground nuclear facility in the city of natanz in the next months .
no plan to quit non-proliferation treaty instead , ahmadinejad promised that announcements would follow by april 9 - the day designated by iran as a holiday celebrating its achievements in nuclear technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani said he had notified the iaea that iran weas ready to talk " from now until april 9 you will hear frequently about the great progress of the iranian people and unique developments in the domains of industry , agriculture , and especially nuclear energy , " ahmadinejad said . striking a conciliatory tone with the un nuclear watchdog , ahmadinejad said that his government had no intention of quitting the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , despite previous threats . " we are willing to follow the regulations , " he said , referring to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty of which iran is a signatory .
" despite the authority of the parliament for the government to reduce its cooperation with the agency or even quit the npt , the government , with the coordination of parliament , has not used this .
it is willing to defend the people 's rights within the framework of the law . " there was a festive spirit at the mass rally in tehran , with children clutching balloons emblazoned with pro-nuclear slogans and the revolution motto : " freedom , independence and islamic republic . " the united states accuses iran of seeking a nuclear weapon , a charge denied by tehran which insists its atomic program is peaceful in nature . although the united states has said it wants the nuclear standoff resolved through diplomacy , washington has never ruled out military action to thwart iran 's atomic drive . dw staff / afpe -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel says iran must meet all demands over nuclear program german chancellor angela merkel on saturday called on iran to conform with the demands of the international community over its nuclear program " without ifs and buts and without tricks .

"
gates said the world today is different and more complex than during the cold war era , and partnerships with other countries , including russia , were needed to face common problems and a new challenge from islamic extremism . he said he had accepted an invitation from putin and russian defense minister sergei ivanov to visit russia .
' rumsfeld 's " old europe " belongs to the past ' the new us defense secretary also made a passing but pointed reference to his predecessor , donald rumsfeld , who antagonized european powers by dividing the nato alliance into countries that supported the us invasion in iraq and those who did not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin surprised the conference by lashing out at the united states saturday " over the years , people have tried to put the nations of europe and of the alliance into different categories - the ' free world ' versus ' those behind the iron curtain ' , ' north ' versus ' south ' , ' east ' versus ' west , " ' he said .
" and i am told that some have even spoken in terms of ' old ' europe versus ' new . " ' " all of these characterizations belong to the past , " he said . " looking back , it seems clear that totalitarianism was defeated as much by ideas the west championed - now and then - as by icbms -lrb- intercontinental ballistic missiles -rrb- , tanks and warships that the west deployed , " he said .
" our most effective weapon , then and now , has been europe and north america 's shared belief in political and economic freedom , religious toleration , human rights and representative government and the rule of law , " he said . " today they are under threat by another virulent ideological adversary and are confronted by a range of other looming geopolitical challenges , " he said .
energy for political coercion putin on saturday stunned top officials and academics gathered in munich with a vehement attack on us leadership in the world .
a former kgb spy , putin charged that united states has " overstepped its borders in all spheres , " creating a dangerous " uni-polar " world that had brought war , ruin and insecurity . he questioned the intentions behind nato expansion eastward into countries that once formed part of the soviet union , and us plans for missile defense systems in poland and the czech republic , former soviet bloc states . gates in contrast said russia was " a partner in endeavors . " " but we wonder , too , about some russian policies that seem to work against international stability , such as its arms transfers and its temptation to use energy resources for political coercion , " he said . russia " need not fear law-based democracies on its border , " he added .
exporting security gates identified violent extremism " grounded in a profound alienation from the foundations of the modern world " as a challenge " unlike anything the west has faced in many generations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security was tight in munich for the conference " no fewer than 18 terrorist organizations , many linked with al-qaeda , have pulled off bloody attacks throughout the world , " he said .
" those attacks - and other threats that have since emerged - revealed even more starkly the need to reorient the atlantic alliance to be able to export security beyond the borders of nato , " he said . he stressed the importance of not allowing success in afghanistan to slip away . other challenges he cited included sectarian conflicts and jihadist movements radiating out from central asia and the middle east ; an iran " with hegemonic ambitions seeking nuclear power ; " and the struggle over the future of iraq . he also said china was at a " strategic crossroads . " " all of us seek a constructive relationship with china , but we also wonder about strategic choices china may make , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 11.02.2007 opinion : eu quest for central asian oil and democracy is risky großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants a new foreign policy to build closer ties between the eu and the countries of central asia .
but dealing with dictatorships in the region poses major challenges , writes journalist marcus bensmann in baku . central asia , located between the pamir mountains and the caspian sea , forms a strategic land link between china and europe , and this year , germany intends to use its eu council presidency to introduce a new central asia strategy that will forge closer ties between the region and europe .
as part of this initiative , in late 2006 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier visited all five former soviet republics in central asia : kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan , tajikistan , turkmenistan and uzbekistan .
the reasons behind this strategy are clear .
under the steppes and deep beneath the caspian sea lie enormous reserves of oil and gas that could help secure europe 's long-term energy needs .
so far , the soviet-era pipeline network has had a virtual monopoly on the transport of oil and gas deposits .
the newly completed oil pipeline that runs from baku to the turkish mediterranean coast and the gas pipeline that follows this route up to the turkish-georgian border represent a challenge to russia 's pipeline dominance over central asia 's natural resources .
however , russia 's gasprom continues to rule the market in central asia .
in addition to russia , the us , and europe , china has emerged as a major competitor for these rich natural resources .
beijing is considering investing billions of dollars to develop the exploitation of energy reserves and build pipelines .
china and russia have secured their influence on the region through the shanghai cooperation organization , an intergovernmental body that includes all central asian countries except turkmenistan .
ruthless dictatorships central asia represents a crucial zone on the frontlines of the troubled european and american mission in afghanistan .
germany has established an airbase to supply its armed forces in afghanistan in the uzbek provincial capital of termez .
however , berlin and brussels face some uneasy conflicts in the region .
particularly in countries like uzbekistan and turkmenistan , rich natural resources have fallen into the hands of the ruling dictatorships , and citizens of these countries live under autocratic regimes .
until his death in december , turkmenistan president saparmurat niyazov imposed a bizarre personality cult on the country .
repressive rule helped him to fill his foreign bank accounts , but people were left with severe food shortages .
andijan massacre and sanctions in may 2005 , uzbek president islam karimov ordered government forces to open fire on tens of thousands of democracy protestors in the city of andijan .
estimates of those killed in the hail of bullets range from hundreds to thousands .
karimov and his government justified the brutal crackdown as a necessary measure to put down an alleged islamic coup - and opposed eu and us calls for an international inquiry into the killings .
as a result , the eu has imposed sanctions against uzbekistan since october 2005 , issued an arms embargo and refused to allow high-ranking members of the uzbek government to enter their territory .
it is not clear what exactly happened in andijan , but there remains no doubt that the uprising was sparked by protests against the despotic rule of the state .
the external threat of islamism helps karimov to retain his hold on power , yet it is also his despotic rule that has laid the foundations for extremist groups making extravagant promises .
dialogue with dictators germany 's policy on central asia aims to promote change through dialogue with dictators and the government is working to ease or drop eu sanctions against uzbekistan .
nevertheless , in november , the eu voted to extend the measures for another three months .
the eu would be well advised to take a differentiated approach to the countries in central asia .
kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev keeps an iron grip on power with doubtful elections and repressive measures , yet in contrast to uzbekistan , he has allowed the population to benefit from the wealth generated by the country 's rapidly growing economy .
kazakhstan even has a minor political opposition and a free press that is slowly beginning to flourish .
an economic perspective take a walk through the kazakh economic boomtown almaty and the uzbek capital , tashkent , and the difference is immediately obvious .
tashkent is shrouded in an atmosphere of dejection and lethargy , whereas almaty is full of bustling activity .
in the economically backward country of kyrgyzstan , a confident public is challenging the ruling elite .
since the overthrow of president askar akayev in march 2005 , the political process in the country has fumbled from crisis to crisis .
in contrast to the other countries of the region , however , kyrgyz citizens have relatively little to fear when confronting representatives of the state .
promoting development the eu should pursue a strategy that focuses on these countries and promotes their development , and above all , gives kyrgyzstan 's impoverished economy a helping hand .
the death of niyazov opens up a window of opportunity to encourage the unsettled turkmen leaders to institute reforms .
friendly handshakes and smiles , however , will do little to convince karimov to initiate reforms .
the uzbek president interprets every concession as a sign of weakness .
that is a lesson that the americans learned the hard way after they established a military base in uzbekistan in 2001 .

but dealing with dictatorships in the region poses major challenges , writes journalist marcus bensmann in baku . central asia , located between the pamir mountains and the caspian sea , forms a strategic land link between china and europe , and this year , germany intends to use its eu council presidency to introduce a new central asia strategy that will forge closer ties between the region and europe .
as part of this initiative , in late 2006 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier visited all five former soviet republics in central asia : kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan , tajikistan , turkmenistan and uzbekistan .
the reasons behind this strategy are clear .
under the steppes and deep beneath the caspian sea lie enormous reserves of oil and gas that could help secure europe 's long-term energy needs .
so far , the soviet-era pipeline network has had a virtual monopoly on the transport of oil and gas deposits .
the newly completed oil pipeline that runs from baku to the turkish mediterranean coast and the gas pipeline that follows this route up to the turkish-georgian border represent a challenge to russia 's pipeline dominance over central asia 's natural resources .
however , russia 's gasprom continues to rule the market in central asia .
in addition to russia , the us , and europe , china has emerged as a major competitor for these rich natural resources .
beijing is considering investing billions of dollars to develop the exploitation of energy reserves and build pipelines .
china and russia have secured their influence on the region through the shanghai cooperation organization , an intergovernmental body that includes all central asian countries except turkmenistan .
ruthless dictatorships central asia represents a crucial zone on the frontlines of the troubled european and american mission in afghanistan .
germany has established an airbase to supply its armed forces in afghanistan in the uzbek provincial capital of termez .
however , berlin and brussels face some uneasy conflicts in the region .
particularly in countries like uzbekistan and turkmenistan , rich natural resources have fallen into the hands of the ruling dictatorships , and citizens of these countries live under autocratic regimes .
until his death in december , turkmenistan president saparmurat niyazov imposed a bizarre personality cult on the country .
repressive rule helped him to fill his foreign bank accounts , but people were left with severe food shortages .
andijan massacre and sanctions in may 2005 , uzbek president islam karimov ordered government forces to open fire on tens of thousands of democracy protestors in the city of andijan .
estimates of those killed in the hail of bullets range from hundreds to thousands .
karimov and his government justified the brutal crackdown as a necessary measure to put down an alleged islamic coup - and opposed eu and us calls for an international inquiry into the killings .
as a result , the eu has imposed sanctions against uzbekistan since october 2005 , issued an arms embargo and refused to allow high-ranking members of the uzbek government to enter their territory .
it is not clear what exactly happened in andijan , but there remains no doubt that the uprising was sparked by protests against the despotic rule of the state .
the external threat of islamism helps karimov to retain his hold on power , yet it is also his despotic rule that has laid the foundations for extremist groups making extravagant promises .
dialogue with dictators germany 's policy on central asia aims to promote change through dialogue with dictators and the government is working to ease or drop eu sanctions against uzbekistan .
nevertheless , in november , the eu voted to extend the measures for another three months .
the eu would be well advised to take a differentiated approach to the countries in central asia .
kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev keeps an iron grip on power with doubtful elections and repressive measures , yet in contrast to uzbekistan , he has allowed the population to benefit from the wealth generated by the country 's rapidly growing economy .
kazakhstan even has a minor political opposition and a free press that is slowly beginning to flourish .
an economic perspective take a walk through the kazakh economic boomtown almaty and the uzbek capital , tashkent , and the difference is immediately obvious .
tashkent is shrouded in an atmosphere of dejection and lethargy , whereas almaty is full of bustling activity .
in the economically backward country of kyrgyzstan , a confident public is challenging the ruling elite .
since the overthrow of president askar akayev in march 2005 , the political process in the country has fumbled from crisis to crisis .
in contrast to the other countries of the region , however , kyrgyz citizens have relatively little to fear when confronting representatives of the state .
promoting development the eu should pursue a strategy that focuses on these countries and promotes their development , and above all , gives kyrgyzstan 's impoverished economy a helping hand .
the death of niyazov opens up a window of opportunity to encourage the unsettled turkmen leaders to institute reforms .
friendly handshakes and smiles , however , will do little to convince karimov to initiate reforms .
the uzbek president interprets every concession as a sign of weakness .
that is a lesson that the americans learned the hard way after they established a military base in uzbekistan in 2001 .

" if you are willing to negotiate , why do you insist on a suspension -lrb- of nuclear enrichment -rrb- ? "
ahmadinejad said , referring to the sensitive nuclear process the west wants iran to halt as proof it is not seeking nuclear weapons .
" if we suspend our activities then what are we going to talk about ?
why , if your nuclear plants are working 24 hours a day , why must iran be pressured to shut them down ? " " we are ready to negotiate but under fair and even conditions , " he told the faithful massed at azadi -lrb- freedom -rrb- square in tehran . hundreds of thousands of iranians massed around the country in their annual show of support for the revolution , with slogans like " death to america " mixing with the now familiar " nuclear energy is our natural right .

" " i have written to mr elbaradei to say we are ready within three weeks to have the modality to solve all the outstanding issues with you . "
expectations were high that ahmadinejad would announce in his speech a breakthrough towards an industrial-scale enrichment of uranium , a process that can be used both in nuclear power stations and atomic bombs . speculation had been that iran would announce the installation of some of the 3,000 uranium-enriching centrifuges it wants to put in place at an underground nuclear facility in the city of natanz in the next months .
no plan to quit non-proliferation treaty instead , ahmadinejad promised that announcements would follow by april 9 - the day designated by iran as a holiday celebrating its achievements in nuclear technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani said he had notified the iaea that iran weas ready to talk " from now until april 9 you will hear frequently about the great progress of the iranian people and unique developments in the domains of industry , agriculture , and especially nuclear energy , " ahmadinejad said . striking a conciliatory tone with the un nuclear watchdog , ahmadinejad said that his government had no intention of quitting the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , despite previous threats . " we are willing to follow the regulations , " he said , referring to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty of which iran is a signatory .
" despite the authority of the parliament for the government to reduce its cooperation with the agency or even quit the npt , the government , with the coordination of parliament , has not used this .
it is willing to defend the people 's rights within the framework of the law . " there was a festive spirit at the mass rally in tehran , with children clutching balloons emblazoned with pro-nuclear slogans and the revolution motto : " freedom , independence and islamic republic . " the united states accuses iran of seeking a nuclear weapon , a charge denied by tehran which insists its atomic program is peaceful in nature . although the united states has said it wants the nuclear standoff resolved through diplomacy , washington has never ruled out military action to thwart iran 's atomic drive . dw staff / afpe -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel says iran must meet all demands over nuclear program german chancellor angela merkel on saturday called on iran to conform with the demands of the international community over its nuclear program " without ifs and buts and without tricks .

but dealing with dictatorships in the region poses major challenges , writes journalist marcus bensmann in baku . central asia , located between the pamir mountains and the caspian sea , forms a strategic land link between china and europe , and this year , germany intends to use its eu council presidency to introduce a new central asia strategy that will forge closer ties between the region and europe .
as part of this initiative , in late 2006 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier visited all five former soviet republics in central asia : kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan , tajikistan , turkmenistan and uzbekistan .
the reasons behind this strategy are clear .
under the steppes and deep beneath the caspian sea lie enormous reserves of oil and gas that could help secure europe 's long-term energy needs .
so far , the soviet-era pipeline network has had a virtual monopoly on the transport of oil and gas deposits .
the newly completed oil pipeline that runs from baku to the turkish mediterranean coast and the gas pipeline that follows this route up to the turkish-georgian border represent a challenge to russia 's pipeline dominance over central asia 's natural resources .
however , russia 's gasprom continues to rule the market in central asia .
in addition to russia , the us , and europe , china has emerged as a major competitor for these rich natural resources .
beijing is considering investing billions of dollars to develop the exploitation of energy reserves and build pipelines .
china and russia have secured their influence on the region through the shanghai cooperation organization , an intergovernmental body that includes all central asian countries except turkmenistan .
ruthless dictatorships central asia represents a crucial zone on the frontlines of the troubled european and american mission in afghanistan .
germany has established an airbase to supply its armed forces in afghanistan in the uzbek provincial capital of termez .
however , berlin and brussels face some uneasy conflicts in the region .
particularly in countries like uzbekistan and turkmenistan , rich natural resources have fallen into the hands of the ruling dictatorships , and citizens of these countries live under autocratic regimes .
until his death in december , turkmenistan president saparmurat niyazov imposed a bizarre personality cult on the country .
repressive rule helped him to fill his foreign bank accounts , but people were left with severe food shortages .
andijan massacre and sanctions in may 2005 , uzbek president islam karimov ordered government forces to open fire on tens of thousands of democracy protestors in the city of andijan .
estimates of those killed in the hail of bullets range from hundreds to thousands .
karimov and his government justified the brutal crackdown as a necessary measure to put down an alleged islamic coup - and opposed eu and us calls for an international inquiry into the killings .
as a result , the eu has imposed sanctions against uzbekistan since october 2005 , issued an arms embargo and refused to allow high-ranking members of the uzbek government to enter their territory .
it is not clear what exactly happened in andijan , but there remains no doubt that the uprising was sparked by protests against the despotic rule of the state .
the external threat of islamism helps karimov to retain his hold on power , yet it is also his despotic rule that has laid the foundations for extremist groups making extravagant promises .
dialogue with dictators germany 's policy on central asia aims to promote change through dialogue with dictators and the government is working to ease or drop eu sanctions against uzbekistan .
nevertheless , in november , the eu voted to extend the measures for another three months .
the eu would be well advised to take a differentiated approach to the countries in central asia .
kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev keeps an iron grip on power with doubtful elections and repressive measures , yet in contrast to uzbekistan , he has allowed the population to benefit from the wealth generated by the country 's rapidly growing economy .
kazakhstan even has a minor political opposition and a free press that is slowly beginning to flourish .
an economic perspective take a walk through the kazakh economic boomtown almaty and the uzbek capital , tashkent , and the difference is immediately obvious .
tashkent is shrouded in an atmosphere of dejection and lethargy , whereas almaty is full of bustling activity .
in the economically backward country of kyrgyzstan , a confident public is challenging the ruling elite .
since the overthrow of president askar akayev in march 2005 , the political process in the country has fumbled from crisis to crisis .
in contrast to the other countries of the region , however , kyrgyz citizens have relatively little to fear when confronting representatives of the state .
promoting development the eu should pursue a strategy that focuses on these countries and promotes their development , and above all , gives kyrgyzstan 's impoverished economy a helping hand .
the death of niyazov opens up a window of opportunity to encourage the unsettled turkmen leaders to institute reforms .
friendly handshakes and smiles , however , will do little to convince karimov to initiate reforms .
the uzbek president interprets every concession as a sign of weakness .
that is a lesson that the americans learned the hard way after they established a military base in uzbekistan in 2001 .
four years later , the andijan massacre cooled relations between the two countries , and the us had to abandon the base .
german foreign policymakers seem to be making the same mistake by openly flirting with the dictator in tashkent .
however , if europe is resolute in isolating karimov and works instead to promote prospering countries along the border with uzbekistan , the uzbek political leadership may in turn out pressure on karimov to introduce reforms , forcing him to soften his attitude .
uzbekistan and even turkmenistan need a bridge to the west even more than the west needs them .
without europe , they would be forced to enter into a reluctant dependency on china and russia .

china and russia have secured their influence on the region through the shanghai cooperation organization , an intergovernmental body that includes all central asian countries except turkmenistan .
ruthless dictatorships central asia represents a crucial zone on the frontlines of the troubled european and american mission in afghanistan .
germany has established an airbase to supply its armed forces in afghanistan in the uzbek provincial capital of termez .
however , berlin and brussels face some uneasy conflicts in the region .
particularly in countries like uzbekistan and turkmenistan , rich natural resources have fallen into the hands of the ruling dictatorships , and citizens of these countries live under autocratic regimes .
until his death in december , turkmenistan president saparmurat niyazov imposed a bizarre personality cult on the country .
repressive rule helped him to fill his foreign bank accounts , but people were left with severe food shortages .
andijan massacre and sanctions in may 2005 , uzbek president islam karimov ordered government forces to open fire on tens of thousands of democracy protestors in the city of andijan .
estimates of those killed in the hail of bullets range from hundreds to thousands .
karimov and his government justified the brutal crackdown as a necessary measure to put down an alleged islamic coup - and opposed eu and us calls for an international inquiry into the killings .
as a result , the eu has imposed sanctions against uzbekistan since october 2005 , issued an arms embargo and refused to allow high-ranking members of the uzbek government to enter their territory .
it is not clear what exactly happened in andijan , but there remains no doubt that the uprising was sparked by protests against the despotic rule of the state .
the external threat of islamism helps karimov to retain his hold on power , yet it is also his despotic rule that has laid the foundations for extremist groups making extravagant promises .
dialogue with dictators germany 's policy on central asia aims to promote change through dialogue with dictators and the government is working to ease or drop eu sanctions against uzbekistan .
nevertheless , in november , the eu voted to extend the measures for another three months .
the eu would be well advised to take a differentiated approach to the countries in central asia .
kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev keeps an iron grip on power with doubtful elections and repressive measures , yet in contrast to uzbekistan , he has allowed the population to benefit from the wealth generated by the country 's rapidly growing economy .
kazakhstan even has a minor political opposition and a free press that is slowly beginning to flourish .
an economic perspective take a walk through the kazakh economic boomtown almaty and the uzbek capital , tashkent , and the difference is immediately obvious .
tashkent is shrouded in an atmosphere of dejection and lethargy , whereas almaty is full of bustling activity .
in the economically backward country of kyrgyzstan , a confident public is challenging the ruling elite .
since the overthrow of president askar akayev in march 2005 , the political process in the country has fumbled from crisis to crisis .
in contrast to the other countries of the region , however , kyrgyz citizens have relatively little to fear when confronting representatives of the state .
promoting development the eu should pursue a strategy that focuses on these countries and promotes their development , and above all , gives kyrgyzstan 's impoverished economy a helping hand .
the death of niyazov opens up a window of opportunity to encourage the unsettled turkmen leaders to institute reforms .
friendly handshakes and smiles , however , will do little to convince karimov to initiate reforms .
the uzbek president interprets every concession as a sign of weakness .
that is a lesson that the americans learned the hard way after they established a military base in uzbekistan in 2001 .
four years later , the andijan massacre cooled relations between the two countries , and the us had to abandon the base .
german foreign policymakers seem to be making the same mistake by openly flirting with the dictator in tashkent .
however , if europe is resolute in isolating karimov and works instead to promote prospering countries along the border with uzbekistan , the uzbek political leadership may in turn out pressure on karimov to introduce reforms , forcing him to soften his attitude .
uzbekistan and even turkmenistan need a bridge to the west even more than the west needs them .
without europe , they would be forced to enter into a reluctant dependency on china and russia .
this is an opportunity that european foreign policy should take full advantage of .

" if you are willing to negotiate , why do you insist on a suspension -lrb- of nuclear enrichment -rrb- ? "
ahmadinejad said , referring to the sensitive nuclear process the west wants iran to halt as proof it is not seeking nuclear weapons .
" if we suspend our activities then what are we going to talk about ?
why , if your nuclear plants are working 24 hours a day , why must iran be pressured to shut them down ? " " we are ready to negotiate but under fair and even conditions , " he told the faithful massed at azadi -lrb- freedom -rrb- square in tehran . hundreds of thousands of iranians massed around the country in their annual show of support for the revolution , with slogans like " death to america " mixing with the now familiar " nuclear energy is our natural right . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad spoke on the occasion of the 28th anniversary of the 1979 islamic revolution ahmadinejad 's defiance comes despite the un security council 's decision to impose sanctions against iran in december and its deadline for iran to halt uranium enrichment by feb .
21 or face further action . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said any idea of holding talks while iran carried out uranium enrichment was " totally unacceptable . "
steinmeier : world stands at crossroads german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , attending the annual security conference in munich , said that resolving the nuclear conflict with iran was of central importance to international security in the 21st century .
he said that the world stood at a crossroads .
" either we succeed in preventing iran and other states away from toying with the nuclear option over the next few years , or we 'll experience a new nuclear arms race with unforeseeable consequences for global security , " steinmeier said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said the world stands at a crossroads also at the conference , iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani said that iran wanted to achieve a " negotiated settlement of the case . " " we do n't want to aggravate the situation in the region , " larijani said . larijani said he had sent a letter to mohamed elbaradei , the chief of the vienna-based international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , offering to work out outstanding issues " within three weeks . " " i have written to mr elbaradei to say we are ready within three weeks to have the modality to solve all the outstanding issues with you . "
expectations were high that ahmadinejad would announce in his speech a breakthrough towards an industrial-scale enrichment of uranium , a process that can be used both in nuclear power stations and atomic bombs . speculation had been that iran would announce the installation of some of the 3,000 uranium-enriching centrifuges it wants to put in place at an underground nuclear facility in the city of natanz in the next months .
no plan to quit non-proliferation treaty instead , ahmadinejad promised that announcements would follow by april 9 - the day designated by iran as a holiday celebrating its achievements in nuclear technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani said he had notified the iaea that iran weas ready to talk " from now until april 9 you will hear frequently about the great progress of the iranian people and unique developments in the domains of industry , agriculture , and especially nuclear energy , " ahmadinejad said . striking a conciliatory tone with the un nuclear watchdog , ahmadinejad said that his government had no intention of quitting the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , despite previous threats . " we are willing to follow the regulations , " he said , referring to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty of which iran is a signatory .
" despite the authority of the parliament for the government to reduce its cooperation with the agency or even quit the npt , the government , with the coordination of parliament , has not used this .
it is willing to defend the people 's rights within the framework of the law . " there was a festive spirit at the mass rally in tehran , with children clutching balloons emblazoned with pro-nuclear slogans and the revolution motto : " freedom , independence and islamic republic . " the united states accuses iran of seeking a nuclear weapon , a charge denied by tehran which insists its atomic program is peaceful in nature . although the united states has said it wants the nuclear standoff resolved through diplomacy , washington has never ruled out military action to thwart iran 's atomic drive . dw staff / afpe -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel says iran must meet all demands over nuclear program german chancellor angela merkel on saturday called on iran to conform with the demands of the international community over its nuclear program " without ifs and buts and without tricks .

" gates , a former cia director who witnessed the collapse of the soviet union , responded with wry humor and a history lesson to putin who portrayed the united states in a speech here saturday as a dangerous , destabilizing world power . " speaking of issues going back many years , as an old cold warrior , one of yesterday 's speakers almost filled me with nostalgia for a less complex time .
almost , " gates said in a speech to the same international security conference . " i have , like your second speaker yesterday , a starkly different background - a career in the spy business .
and i guess old spies have a habit of blunt speaking , " he said . re-education for a cold warrior but in his debut speech as us defense chief , gates said he had gone to " re-education camp " as a university president where he learned in dealing with academic faculties that it is either " be nice " or " be gone . "
gates said the world today is different and more complex than during the cold war era , and partnerships with other countries , including russia , were needed to face common problems and a new challenge from islamic extremism . he said he had accepted an invitation from putin and russian defense minister sergei ivanov to visit russia .
' rumsfeld 's " old europe " belongs to the past ' the new us defense secretary also made a passing but pointed reference to his predecessor , donald rumsfeld , who antagonized european powers by dividing the nato alliance into countries that supported the us invasion in iraq and those who did not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin surprised the conference by lashing out at the united states saturday " over the years , people have tried to put the nations of europe and of the alliance into different categories - the ' free world ' versus ' those behind the iron curtain ' , ' north ' versus ' south ' , ' east ' versus ' west , " ' he said .
" and i am told that some have even spoken in terms of ' old ' europe versus ' new . " ' " all of these characterizations belong to the past , " he said . " looking back , it seems clear that totalitarianism was defeated as much by ideas the west championed - now and then - as by icbms -lrb- intercontinental ballistic missiles -rrb- , tanks and warships that the west deployed , " he said .
" our most effective weapon , then and now , has been europe and north america 's shared belief in political and economic freedom , religious toleration , human rights and representative government and the rule of law , " he said . " today they are under threat by another virulent ideological adversary and are confronted by a range of other looming geopolitical challenges , " he said .
energy for political coercion putin on saturday stunned top officials and academics gathered in munich with a vehement attack on us leadership in the world .
a former kgb spy , putin charged that united states has " overstepped its borders in all spheres , " creating a dangerous " uni-polar " world that had brought war , ruin and insecurity . he questioned the intentions behind nato expansion eastward into countries that once formed part of the soviet union , and us plans for missile defense systems in poland and the czech republic , former soviet bloc states . gates in contrast said russia was " a partner in endeavors . " " but we wonder , too , about some russian policies that seem to work against international stability , such as its arms transfers and its temptation to use energy resources for political coercion , " he said . russia " need not fear law-based democracies on its border , " he added .
exporting security gates identified violent extremism " grounded in a profound alienation from the foundations of the modern world " as a challenge " unlike anything the west has faced in many generations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security was tight in munich for the conference " no fewer than 18 terrorist organizations , many linked with al-qaeda , have pulled off bloody attacks throughout the world , " he said .
" those attacks - and other threats that have since emerged - revealed even more starkly the need to reorient the atlantic alliance to be able to export security beyond the borders of nato , " he said . he stressed the importance of not allowing success in afghanistan to slip away . other challenges he cited included sectarian conflicts and jihadist movements radiating out from central asia and the middle east ; an iran " with hegemonic ambitions seeking nuclear power ; " and the struggle over the future of iraq . he also said china was at a " strategic crossroads . " " all of us seek a constructive relationship with china , but we also wonder about strategic choices china may make , " he said .

but new figures from the german office of foreign trade show that china will assume the export throne in 2008 . the news that china , with its booming economy , is about to become the world 's number one export nation has been met with caution not only by german business leaders , but managers and economists around the world . " the fact that china exports so much is n't really the issue , " said eva schwinghammer from the german chamber of commerce in shanghai .

" gates , a former cia director who witnessed the collapse of the soviet union , responded with wry humor and a history lesson to putin who portrayed the united states in a speech here saturday as a dangerous , destabilizing world power . " speaking of issues going back many years , as an old cold warrior , one of yesterday 's speakers almost filled me with nostalgia for a less complex time .
almost , " gates said in a speech to the same international security conference . " i have , like your second speaker yesterday , a starkly different background - a career in the spy business .
and i guess old spies have a habit of blunt speaking , " he said . re-education for a cold warrior but in his debut speech as us defense chief , gates said he had gone to " re-education camp " as a university president where he learned in dealing with academic faculties that it is either " be nice " or " be gone . "
gates said the world today is different and more complex than during the cold war era , and partnerships with other countries , including russia , were needed to face common problems and a new challenge from islamic extremism . he said he had accepted an invitation from putin and russian defense minister sergei ivanov to visit russia .
' rumsfeld 's " old europe " belongs to the past ' the new us defense secretary also made a passing but pointed reference to his predecessor , donald rumsfeld , who antagonized european powers by dividing the nato alliance into countries that supported the us invasion in iraq and those who did not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin surprised the conference by lashing out at the united states saturday " over the years , people have tried to put the nations of europe and of the alliance into different categories - the ' free world ' versus ' those behind the iron curtain ' , ' north ' versus ' south ' , ' east ' versus ' west , " ' he said .
" and i am told that some have even spoken in terms of ' old ' europe versus ' new . " ' " all of these characterizations belong to the past , " he said . " looking back , it seems clear that totalitarianism was defeated as much by ideas the west championed - now and then - as by icbms -lrb- intercontinental ballistic missiles -rrb- , tanks and warships that the west deployed , " he said .
" our most effective weapon , then and now , has been europe and north america 's shared belief in political and economic freedom , religious toleration , human rights and representative government and the rule of law , " he said . " today they are under threat by another virulent ideological adversary and are confronted by a range of other looming geopolitical challenges , " he said .
energy for political coercion putin on saturday stunned top officials and academics gathered in munich with a vehement attack on us leadership in the world .
a former kgb spy , putin charged that united states has " overstepped its borders in all spheres , " creating a dangerous " uni-polar " world that had brought war , ruin and insecurity . he questioned the intentions behind nato expansion eastward into countries that once formed part of the soviet union , and us plans for missile defense systems in poland and the czech republic , former soviet bloc states . gates in contrast said russia was " a partner in endeavors . " " but we wonder , too , about some russian policies that seem to work against international stability , such as its arms transfers and its temptation to use energy resources for political coercion , " he said . russia " need not fear law-based democracies on its border , " he added .
exporting security gates identified violent extremism " grounded in a profound alienation from the foundations of the modern world " as a challenge " unlike anything the west has faced in many generations . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security was tight in munich for the conference " no fewer than 18 terrorist organizations , many linked with al-qaeda , have pulled off bloody attacks throughout the world , " he said .
" those attacks - and other threats that have since emerged - revealed even more starkly the need to reorient the atlantic alliance to be able to export security beyond the borders of nato , " he said . he stressed the importance of not allowing success in afghanistan to slip away . other challenges he cited included sectarian conflicts and jihadist movements radiating out from central asia and the middle east ; an iran " with hegemonic ambitions seeking nuclear power ; " and the struggle over the future of iraq . he also said china was at a " strategic crossroads . " " all of us seek a constructive relationship with china , but we also wonder about strategic choices china may make , " he said .

" if you are willing to negotiate , why do you insist on a suspension -lrb- of nuclear enrichment -rrb- ? "
ahmadinejad said , referring to the sensitive nuclear process the west wants iran to halt as proof it is not seeking nuclear weapons .
" if we suspend our activities then what are we going to talk about ?
why , if your nuclear plants are working 24 hours a day , why must iran be pressured to shut them down ? " " we are ready to negotiate but under fair and even conditions , " he told the faithful massed at azadi -lrb- freedom -rrb- square in tehran . hundreds of thousands of iranians massed around the country in their annual show of support for the revolution , with slogans like " death to america " mixing with the now familiar " nuclear energy is our natural right . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad spoke on the occasion of the 28th anniversary of the 1979 islamic revolution ahmadinejad 's defiance comes despite the un security council 's decision to impose sanctions against iran in december and its deadline for iran to halt uranium enrichment by feb .
21 or face further action . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said any idea of holding talks while iran carried out uranium enrichment was " totally unacceptable . "
steinmeier : world stands at crossroads german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , attending the annual security conference in munich , said that resolving the nuclear conflict with iran was of central importance to international security in the 21st century .
he said that the world stood at a crossroads .
" either we succeed in preventing iran and other states away from toying with the nuclear option over the next few years , or we 'll experience a new nuclear arms race with unforeseeable consequences for global security , " steinmeier said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said the world stands at a crossroads also at the conference , iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani said that iran wanted to achieve a " negotiated settlement of the case . " " we do n't want to aggravate the situation in the region , " larijani said . larijani said he had sent a letter to mohamed elbaradei , the chief of the vienna-based international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , offering to work out outstanding issues " within three weeks . " " i have written to mr elbaradei to say we are ready within three weeks to have the modality to solve all the outstanding issues with you . "
expectations were high that ahmadinejad would announce in his speech a breakthrough towards an industrial-scale enrichment of uranium , a process that can be used both in nuclear power stations and atomic bombs . speculation had been that iran would announce the installation of some of the 3,000 uranium-enriching centrifuges it wants to put in place at an underground nuclear facility in the city of natanz in the next months .
no plan to quit non-proliferation treaty instead , ahmadinejad promised that announcements would follow by april 9 - the day designated by iran as a holiday celebrating its achievements in nuclear technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani said he had notified the iaea that iran weas ready to talk " from now until april 9 you will hear frequently about the great progress of the iranian people and unique developments in the domains of industry , agriculture , and especially nuclear energy , " ahmadinejad said . striking a conciliatory tone with the un nuclear watchdog , ahmadinejad said that his government had no intention of quitting the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , despite previous threats . " we are willing to follow the regulations , " he said , referring to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty of which iran is a signatory .
" despite the authority of the parliament for the government to reduce its cooperation with the agency or even quit the npt , the government , with the coordination of parliament , has not used this .
it is willing to defend the people 's rights within the framework of the law . " there was a festive spirit at the mass rally in tehran , with children clutching balloons emblazoned with pro-nuclear slogans and the revolution motto : " freedom , independence and islamic republic . " the united states accuses iran of seeking a nuclear weapon , a charge denied by tehran which insists its atomic program is peaceful in nature . although the united states has said it wants the nuclear standoff resolved through diplomacy , washington has never ruled out military action to thwart iran 's atomic drive . dw staff / afpe -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel says iran must meet all demands over nuclear program german chancellor angela merkel on saturday called on iran to conform with the demands of the international community over its nuclear program " without ifs and buts and without tricks .

but dealing with dictatorships in the region poses major challenges , writes journalist marcus bensmann in baku . central asia , located between the pamir mountains and the caspian sea , forms a strategic land link between china and europe , and this year , germany intends to use its eu council presidency to introduce a new central asia strategy that will forge closer ties between the region and europe .
as part of this initiative , in late 2006 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier visited all five former soviet republics in central asia : kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan , tajikistan , turkmenistan and uzbekistan .
the reasons behind this strategy are clear .
under the steppes and deep beneath the caspian sea lie enormous reserves of oil and gas that could help secure europe 's long-term energy needs .
so far , the soviet-era pipeline network has had a virtual monopoly on the transport of oil and gas deposits .
the newly completed oil pipeline that runs from baku to the turkish mediterranean coast and the gas pipeline that follows this route up to the turkish-georgian border represent a challenge to russia 's pipeline dominance over central asia 's natural resources .
however , russia 's gasprom continues to rule the market in central asia .
in addition to russia , the us , and europe , china has emerged as a major competitor for these rich natural resources .
beijing is considering investing billions of dollars to develop the exploitation of energy reserves and build pipelines .
china and russia have secured their influence on the region through the shanghai cooperation organization , an intergovernmental body that includes all central asian countries except turkmenistan .
ruthless dictatorships central asia represents a crucial zone on the frontlines of the troubled european and american mission in afghanistan .
germany has established an airbase to supply its armed forces in afghanistan in the uzbek provincial capital of termez .
however , berlin and brussels face some uneasy conflicts in the region .
particularly in countries like uzbekistan and turkmenistan , rich natural resources have fallen into the hands of the ruling dictatorships , and citizens of these countries live under autocratic regimes .
until his death in december , turkmenistan president saparmurat niyazov imposed a bizarre personality cult on the country .
repressive rule helped him to fill his foreign bank accounts , but people were left with severe food shortages .
andijan massacre and sanctions in may 2005 , uzbek president islam karimov ordered government forces to open fire on tens of thousands of democracy protestors in the city of andijan .
estimates of those killed in the hail of bullets range from hundreds to thousands .
karimov and his government justified the brutal crackdown as a necessary measure to put down an alleged islamic coup - and opposed eu and us calls for an international inquiry into the killings .
as a result , the eu has imposed sanctions against uzbekistan since october 2005 , issued an arms embargo and refused to allow high-ranking members of the uzbek government to enter their territory .
it is not clear what exactly happened in andijan , but there remains no doubt that the uprising was sparked by protests against the despotic rule of the state .
the external threat of islamism helps karimov to retain his hold on power , yet it is also his despotic rule that has laid the foundations for extremist groups making extravagant promises .
dialogue with dictators germany 's policy on central asia aims to promote change through dialogue with dictators and the government is working to ease or drop eu sanctions against uzbekistan .
nevertheless , in november , the eu voted to extend the measures for another three months .
the eu would be well advised to take a differentiated approach to the countries in central asia .
kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev keeps an iron grip on power with doubtful elections and repressive measures , yet in contrast to uzbekistan , he has allowed the population to benefit from the wealth generated by the country 's rapidly growing economy .
kazakhstan even has a minor political opposition and a free press that is slowly beginning to flourish .
an economic perspective take a walk through the kazakh economic boomtown almaty and the uzbek capital , tashkent , and the difference is immediately obvious .
tashkent is shrouded in an atmosphere of dejection and lethargy , whereas almaty is full of bustling activity .
in the economically backward country of kyrgyzstan , a confident public is challenging the ruling elite .
since the overthrow of president askar akayev in march 2005 , the political process in the country has fumbled from crisis to crisis .
in contrast to the other countries of the region , however , kyrgyz citizens have relatively little to fear when confronting representatives of the state .
promoting development the eu should pursue a strategy that focuses on these countries and promotes their development , and above all , gives kyrgyzstan 's impoverished economy a helping hand .
the death of niyazov opens up a window of opportunity to encourage the unsettled turkmen leaders to institute reforms .
friendly handshakes and smiles , however , will do little to convince karimov to initiate reforms .
the uzbek president interprets every concession as a sign of weakness .
that is a lesson that the americans learned the hard way after they established a military base in uzbekistan in 2001 .
four years later , the andijan massacre cooled relations between the two countries , and the us had to abandon the base .
german foreign policymakers seem to be making the same mistake by openly flirting with the dictator in tashkent .
however , if europe is resolute in isolating karimov and works instead to promote prospering countries along the border with uzbekistan , the uzbek political leadership may in turn out pressure on karimov to introduce reforms , forcing him to soften his attitude .
uzbekistan and even turkmenistan need a bridge to the west even more than the west needs them .
without europe , they would be forced to enter into a reluctant dependency on china and russia .
this is an opportunity that european foreign policy should take full advantage of .

andijan massacre and sanctions in may 2005 , uzbek president islam karimov ordered government forces to open fire on tens of thousands of democracy protestors in the city of andijan .
estimates of those killed in the hail of bullets range from hundreds to thousands .
karimov and his government justified the brutal crackdown as a necessary measure to put down an alleged islamic coup - and opposed eu and us calls for an international inquiry into the killings .
as a result , the eu has imposed sanctions against uzbekistan since october 2005 , issued an arms embargo and refused to allow high-ranking members of the uzbek government to enter their territory .
it is not clear what exactly happened in andijan , but there remains no doubt that the uprising was sparked by protests against the despotic rule of the state .
the external threat of islamism helps karimov to retain his hold on power , yet it is also his despotic rule that has laid the foundations for extremist groups making extravagant promises .
dialogue with dictators germany 's policy on central asia aims to promote change through dialogue with dictators and the government is working to ease or drop eu sanctions against uzbekistan .
nevertheless , in november , the eu voted to extend the measures for another three months .
the eu would be well advised to take a differentiated approach to the countries in central asia .
kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev keeps an iron grip on power with doubtful elections and repressive measures , yet in contrast to uzbekistan , he has allowed the population to benefit from the wealth generated by the country 's rapidly growing economy .
kazakhstan even has a minor political opposition and a free press that is slowly beginning to flourish .
an economic perspective take a walk through the kazakh economic boomtown almaty and the uzbek capital , tashkent , and the difference is immediately obvious .
tashkent is shrouded in an atmosphere of dejection and lethargy , whereas almaty is full of bustling activity .
in the economically backward country of kyrgyzstan , a confident public is challenging the ruling elite .
since the overthrow of president askar akayev in march 2005 , the political process in the country has fumbled from crisis to crisis .
in contrast to the other countries of the region , however , kyrgyz citizens have relatively little to fear when confronting representatives of the state .
promoting development the eu should pursue a strategy that focuses on these countries and promotes their development , and above all , gives kyrgyzstan 's impoverished economy a helping hand .
the death of niyazov opens up a window of opportunity to encourage the unsettled turkmen leaders to institute reforms .
friendly handshakes and smiles , however , will do little to convince karimov to initiate reforms .
the uzbek president interprets every concession as a sign of weakness .
that is a lesson that the americans learned the hard way after they established a military base in uzbekistan in 2001 .
four years later , the andijan massacre cooled relations between the two countries , and the us had to abandon the base .
german foreign policymakers seem to be making the same mistake by openly flirting with the dictator in tashkent .
however , if europe is resolute in isolating karimov and works instead to promote prospering countries along the border with uzbekistan , the uzbek political leadership may in turn out pressure on karimov to introduce reforms , forcing him to soften his attitude .
uzbekistan and even turkmenistan need a bridge to the west even more than the west needs them .
without europe , they would be forced to enter into a reluctant dependency on china and russia .
this is an opportunity that european foreign policy should take full advantage of .

but dealing with dictatorships in the region poses major challenges , writes journalist marcus bensmann in baku . central asia , located between the pamir mountains and the caspian sea , forms a strategic land link between china and europe , and this year , germany intends to use its eu council presidency to introduce a new central asia strategy that will forge closer ties between the region and europe .
as part of this initiative , in late 2006 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier visited all five former soviet republics in central asia : kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan , tajikistan , turkmenistan and uzbekistan .
the reasons behind this strategy are clear .
under the steppes and deep beneath the caspian sea lie enormous reserves of oil and gas that could help secure europe 's long-term energy needs .
so far , the soviet-era pipeline network has had a virtual monopoly on the transport of oil and gas deposits .
the newly completed oil pipeline that runs from baku to the turkish mediterranean coast and the gas pipeline that follows this route up to the turkish-georgian border represent a challenge to russia 's pipeline dominance over central asia 's natural resources .
however , russia 's gasprom continues to rule the market in central asia .
in addition to russia , the us , and europe , china has emerged as a major competitor for these rich natural resources .
beijing is considering investing billions of dollars to develop the exploitation of energy reserves and build pipelines .
china and russia have secured their influence on the region through the shanghai cooperation organization , an intergovernmental body that includes all central asian countries except turkmenistan .
ruthless dictatorships central asia represents a crucial zone on the frontlines of the troubled european and american mission in afghanistan .
germany has established an airbase to supply its armed forces in afghanistan in the uzbek provincial capital of termez .
however , berlin and brussels face some uneasy conflicts in the region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 11.02.2007 opinion : eu quest for central asian oil and democracy is risky großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany wants a new foreign policy to build closer ties between the eu and the countries of central asia .
but dealing with dictatorships in the region poses major challenges , writes journalist marcus bensmann in baku . central asia , located between the pamir mountains and the caspian sea , forms a strategic land link between china and europe , and this year , germany intends to use its eu council presidency to introduce a new central asia strategy that will forge closer ties between the region and europe .
as part of this initiative , in late 2006 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier visited all five former soviet republics in central asia : kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan , tajikistan , turkmenistan and uzbekistan .
the reasons behind this strategy are clear .
under the steppes and deep beneath the caspian sea lie enormous reserves of oil and gas that could help secure europe 's long-term energy needs .
so far , the soviet-era pipeline network has had a virtual monopoly on the transport of oil and gas deposits .
the newly completed oil pipeline that runs from baku to the turkish mediterranean coast and the gas pipeline that follows this route up to the turkish-georgian border represent a challenge to russia 's pipeline dominance over central asia 's natural resources .
however , russia 's gasprom continues to rule the market in central asia .
in addition to russia , the us , and europe , china has emerged as a major competitor for these rich natural resources .
beijing is considering investing billions of dollars to develop the exploitation of energy reserves and build pipelines .
china and russia have secured their influence on the region through the shanghai cooperation organization , an intergovernmental body that includes all central asian countries except turkmenistan .
ruthless dictatorships central asia represents a crucial zone on the frontlines of the troubled european and american mission in afghanistan .
germany has established an airbase to supply its armed forces in afghanistan in the uzbek provincial capital of termez .
however , berlin and brussels face some uneasy conflicts in the region .
particularly in countries like uzbekistan and turkmenistan , rich natural resources have fallen into the hands of the ruling dictatorships , and citizens of these countries live under autocratic regimes .
until his death in december , turkmenistan president saparmurat niyazov imposed a bizarre personality cult on the country .
repressive rule helped him to fill his foreign bank accounts , but people were left with severe food shortages .
andijan massacre and sanctions in may 2005 , uzbek president islam karimov ordered government forces to open fire on tens of thousands of democracy protestors in the city of andijan .
estimates of those killed in the hail of bullets range from hundreds to thousands .
karimov and his government justified the brutal crackdown as a necessary measure to put down an alleged islamic coup - and opposed eu and us calls for an international inquiry into the killings .
as a result , the eu has imposed sanctions against uzbekistan since october 2005 , issued an arms embargo and refused to allow high-ranking members of the uzbek government to enter their territory .
it is not clear what exactly happened in andijan , but there remains no doubt that the uprising was sparked by protests against the despotic rule of the state .
the external threat of islamism helps karimov to retain his hold on power , yet it is also his despotic rule that has laid the foundations for extremist groups making extravagant promises .
dialogue with dictators germany 's policy on central asia aims to promote change through dialogue with dictators and the government is working to ease or drop eu sanctions against uzbekistan .
nevertheless , in november , the eu voted to extend the measures for another three months .
the eu would be well advised to take a differentiated approach to the countries in central asia .
kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev keeps an iron grip on power with doubtful elections and repressive measures , yet in contrast to uzbekistan , he has allowed the population to benefit from the wealth generated by the country 's rapidly growing economy .
kazakhstan even has a minor political opposition and a free press that is slowly beginning to flourish .
an economic perspective take a walk through the kazakh economic boomtown almaty and the uzbek capital , tashkent , and the difference is immediately obvious .
tashkent is shrouded in an atmosphere of dejection and lethargy , whereas almaty is full of bustling activity .
in the economically backward country of kyrgyzstan , a confident public is challenging the ruling elite .
since the overthrow of president askar akayev in march 2005 , the political process in the country has fumbled from crisis to crisis .
in contrast to the other countries of the region , however , kyrgyz citizens have relatively little to fear when confronting representatives of the state .
promoting development the eu should pursue a strategy that focuses on these countries and promotes their development , and above all , gives kyrgyzstan 's impoverished economy a helping hand .
the death of niyazov opens up a window of opportunity to encourage the unsettled turkmen leaders to institute reforms .
friendly handshakes and smiles , however , will do little to convince karimov to initiate reforms .
the uzbek president interprets every concession as a sign of weakness .
that is a lesson that the americans learned the hard way after they established a military base in uzbekistan in 2001 .
four years later , the andijan massacre cooled relations between the two countries , and the us had to abandon the base .
german foreign policymakers seem to be making the same mistake by openly flirting with the dictator in tashkent .
however , if europe is resolute in isolating karimov and works instead to promote prospering countries along the border with uzbekistan , the uzbek political leadership may in turn out pressure on karimov to introduce reforms , forcing him to soften his attitude .
uzbekistan and even turkmenistan need a bridge to the west even more than the west needs them .
without europe , they would be forced to enter into a reluctant dependency on china and russia .
this is an opportunity that european foreign policy should take full advantage of .

" if you are willing to negotiate , why do you insist on a suspension -lrb- of nuclear enrichment -rrb- ? "
ahmadinejad said , referring to the sensitive nuclear process the west wants iran to halt as proof it is not seeking nuclear weapons .
" if we suspend our activities then what are we going to talk about ?
why , if your nuclear plants are working 24 hours a day , why must iran be pressured to shut them down ? " " we are ready to negotiate but under fair and even conditions , " he told the faithful massed at azadi -lrb- freedom -rrb- square in tehran . hundreds of thousands of iranians massed around the country in their annual show of support for the revolution , with slogans like " death to america " mixing with the now familiar " nuclear energy is our natural right . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad spoke on the occasion of the 28th anniversary of the 1979 islamic revolution ahmadinejad 's defiance comes despite the un security council 's decision to impose sanctions against iran in december and its deadline for iran to halt uranium enrichment by feb .
21 or face further action . french foreign minister philippe douste-blazy said any idea of holding talks while iran carried out uranium enrichment was " totally unacceptable . "
steinmeier : world stands at crossroads german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , attending the annual security conference in munich , said that resolving the nuclear conflict with iran was of central importance to international security in the 21st century .
he said that the world stood at a crossroads .
" either we succeed in preventing iran and other states away from toying with the nuclear option over the next few years , or we 'll experience a new nuclear arms race with unforeseeable consequences for global security , " steinmeier said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier said the world stands at a crossroads also at the conference , iran 's chief nuclear negotiator ali larijani said that iran wanted to achieve a " negotiated settlement of the case . " " we do n't want to aggravate the situation in the region , " larijani said . larijani said he had sent a letter to mohamed elbaradei , the chief of the vienna-based international atomic energy agency -lrb- iaea -rrb- , offering to work out outstanding issues " within three weeks . " " i have written to mr elbaradei to say we are ready within three weeks to have the modality to solve all the outstanding issues with you . "
expectations were high that ahmadinejad would announce in his speech a breakthrough towards an industrial-scale enrichment of uranium , a process that can be used both in nuclear power stations and atomic bombs . speculation had been that iran would announce the installation of some of the 3,000 uranium-enriching centrifuges it wants to put in place at an underground nuclear facility in the city of natanz in the next months .
no plan to quit non-proliferation treaty instead , ahmadinejad promised that announcements would follow by april 9 - the day designated by iran as a holiday celebrating its achievements in nuclear technology .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : larijani said he had notified the iaea that iran weas ready to talk " from now until april 9 you will hear frequently about the great progress of the iranian people and unique developments in the domains of industry , agriculture , and especially nuclear energy , " ahmadinejad said . striking a conciliatory tone with the un nuclear watchdog , ahmadinejad said that his government had no intention of quitting the nuclear non-proliferation treaty -lrb- npt -rrb- , despite previous threats . " we are willing to follow the regulations , " he said , referring to the nuclear non-proliferation treaty of which iran is a signatory .
" despite the authority of the parliament for the government to reduce its cooperation with the agency or even quit the npt , the government , with the coordination of parliament , has not used this .
it is willing to defend the people 's rights within the framework of the law . " there was a festive spirit at the mass rally in tehran , with children clutching balloons emblazoned with pro-nuclear slogans and the revolution motto : " freedom , independence and islamic republic . " the united states accuses iran of seeking a nuclear weapon , a charge denied by tehran which insists its atomic program is peaceful in nature . although the united states has said it wants the nuclear standoff resolved through diplomacy , washington has never ruled out military action to thwart iran 's atomic drive . dw staff / afpe -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel says iran must meet all demands over nuclear program german chancellor angela merkel on saturday called on iran to conform with the demands of the international community over its nuclear program " without ifs and buts and without tricks .

but goalie jens lehmann still sees room for improvement . jens lehmann believes the german national soccer team has improved vastly compared to early 2006 and wants to qualify swiftly for euro 2008 . the germany goalkeeper also told kicker , a german sports magazine , this week that that young german soccer stars need a better education and the clubs a more professional management . " we are at least one class better than 12 months ago , " the arsenal goalkeeper said .
" the most important thing is that the players know exactly what they are supposed to do on the pitch .
of course we want to make sure that we qualify for the euro 2008 tournament . " germany won their first match of the year , a non-surprising 3-1 victory in a friendly against switzerland on wednesday .
the next euro 2008 qualifier is on march 24 away to a much stronger team , the czech republic . germany started poorly in 2006 but then rose to the world cup occasion in the summer by finishing third under coach jürgen klinsmann .
germany are now unbeaten in the seven games since joachim löw took over as coach after the world cup . bundesliga mainly animosity and sackings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann says the bickering mentality is counter-productive looking at the state of soccer in germany , lehmann called for improvement . " you get the impression that the attraction of the bundesliga mainly consists of who is at odds with whom and which coach is sacked next , " he said .
" soccer aspects are rarely mentioned , like whether a team is playing well . " in order to raise the standard - also manifested in mediocre showings in europe - lehmann called for a better soccer education and more professionalism in general . " werder bremen probably have a philosophy and maybe schalke 04 are building one , but everything else looks like patchwork , " he added .
" whenever i talk with presidents or general managers i get the impression that they know they must find a new coach sometime , but not by which criteria they need to choose him . " the bundesliga needs more quality in the positions of president , general manager and coach , " lehmann said . development in germany lagging behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rooney has been nurtured to stardom at man united development of young players also needs to get more attention , the germany no.1 said , pointing out that current english premiership leaders manchester united have done a good job in raising wayne rooney and cristiano ronaldo to the status of star players - with rooney far ahead of german lukas podolski , who is mainly benched at bayern munich . " rooney was n't good at first , " lehmann said .
" but manchester formed him ; he is getting better and better , the same with cristiano ronaldo .
i see the same at arsenal , the way young players are built up .

but goalie jens lehmann still sees room for improvement . jens lehmann believes the german national soccer team has improved vastly compared to early 2006 and wants to qualify swiftly for euro 2008 . the germany goalkeeper also told kicker , a german sports magazine , this week that that young german soccer stars need a better education and the clubs a more professional management . " we are at least one class better than 12 months ago , " the arsenal goalkeeper said .
" the most important thing is that the players know exactly what they are supposed to do on the pitch .
of course we want to make sure that we qualify for the euro 2008 tournament . " germany won their first match of the year , a non-surprising 3-1 victory in a friendly against switzerland on wednesday .
the next euro 2008 qualifier is on march 24 away to a much stronger team , the czech republic . germany started poorly in 2006 but then rose to the world cup occasion in the summer by finishing third under coach jürgen klinsmann .
germany are now unbeaten in the seven games since joachim löw took over as coach after the world cup . bundesliga mainly animosity and sackings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann says the bickering mentality is counter-productive looking at the state of soccer in germany , lehmann called for improvement . " you get the impression that the attraction of the bundesliga mainly consists of who is at odds with whom and which coach is sacked next , " he said .
" soccer aspects are rarely mentioned , like whether a team is playing well . " in order to raise the standard - also manifested in mediocre showings in europe - lehmann called for a better soccer education and more professionalism in general . " werder bremen probably have a philosophy and maybe schalke 04 are building one , but everything else looks like patchwork , " he added .
" whenever i talk with presidents or general managers i get the impression that they know they must find a new coach sometime , but not by which criteria they need to choose him . " the bundesliga needs more quality in the positions of president , general manager and coach , " lehmann said . development in germany lagging behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rooney has been nurtured to stardom at man united development of young players also needs to get more attention , the germany no.1 said , pointing out that current english premiership leaders manchester united have done a good job in raising wayne rooney and cristiano ronaldo to the status of star players - with rooney far ahead of german lukas podolski , who is mainly benched at bayern munich . " rooney was n't good at first , " lehmann said .
" but manchester formed him ; he is getting better and better , the same with cristiano ronaldo .
i see the same at arsenal , the way young players are built up .

" the products come from foreign companies that have built production facilities on chinese soil , or set up joint ventures with chinese companies .

" wages are rising rapidly in china .
it 's common for skilled labor wages to double in a few years - annual increases of 25 to 30 percent are the norm in shanghai .
sooner or later the pressure will become too great .
and china wo n't be considered a cheap location for companies looking to produce high quality goods , particularly in the heavy machinery sector , for example . " that 's why the government in beijing is encouraging chinese businesses to shift from labor-intensive activities to technology-based areas . it has created a program to boost research and development so they can compete in sectors normally dominated by european and us firms .

but goalie jens lehmann still sees room for improvement . jens lehmann believes the german national soccer team has improved vastly compared to early 2006 and wants to qualify swiftly for euro 2008 . the germany goalkeeper also told kicker , a german sports magazine , this week that that young german soccer stars need a better education and the clubs a more professional management . " we are at least one class better than 12 months ago , " the arsenal goalkeeper said .
" the most important thing is that the players know exactly what they are supposed to do on the pitch .
of course we want to make sure that we qualify for the euro 2008 tournament . " germany won their first match of the year , a non-surprising 3-1 victory in a friendly against switzerland on wednesday .
the next euro 2008 qualifier is on march 24 away to a much stronger team , the czech republic . germany started poorly in 2006 but then rose to the world cup occasion in the summer by finishing third under coach jürgen klinsmann .
germany are now unbeaten in the seven games since joachim löw took over as coach after the world cup . bundesliga mainly animosity and sackings bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann says the bickering mentality is counter-productive looking at the state of soccer in germany , lehmann called for improvement .

" soccer aspects are rarely mentioned , like whether a team is playing well . " in order to raise the standard - also manifested in mediocre showings in europe - lehmann called for a better soccer education and more professionalism in general . " werder bremen probably have a philosophy and maybe schalke 04 are building one , but everything else looks like patchwork , " he added .
" whenever i talk with presidents or general managers i get the impression that they know they must find a new coach sometime , but not by which criteria they need to choose him . " the bundesliga needs more quality in the positions of president , general manager and coach , " lehmann said . development in germany lagging behind bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : rooney has been nurtured to stardom at man united development of young players also needs to get more attention , the germany no.1 said , pointing out that current english premiership leaders manchester united have done a good job in raising wayne rooney and cristiano ronaldo to the status of star players - with rooney far ahead of german lukas podolski , who is mainly benched at bayern munich . " rooney was n't good at first , " lehmann said .
" but manchester formed him ; he is getting better and better , the same with cristiano ronaldo .
i see the same at arsenal , the way young players are built up .

" gates , a former cia director who witnessed the collapse of the soviet union , responded with wry humor and a history lesson to putin who portrayed the united states in a speech here saturday as a dangerous , destabilizing world power . " speaking of issues going back many years , as an old cold warrior , one of yesterday 's speakers almost filled me with nostalgia for a less complex time .
almost , " gates said in a speech to the same international security conference . " i have , like your second speaker yesterday , a starkly different background - a career in the spy business .
and i guess old spies have a habit of blunt speaking , " he said . re-education for a cold warrior but in his debut speech as us defense chief , gates said he had gone to " re-education camp " as a university president where he learned in dealing with academic faculties that it is either " be nice " or " be gone . "
gates said the world today is different and more complex than during the cold war era , and partnerships with other countries , including russia , were needed to face common problems and a new challenge from islamic extremism . he said he had accepted an invitation from putin and russian defense minister sergei ivanov to visit russia .
' rumsfeld 's " old europe " belongs to the past ' the new us defense secretary also made a passing but pointed reference to his predecessor , donald rumsfeld , who antagonized european powers by dividing the nato alliance into countries that supported the us invasion in iraq and those who did not .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin surprised the conference by lashing out at the united states saturday " over the years , people have tried to put the nations of europe and of the alliance into different categories - the ' free world ' versus ' those behind the iron curtain ' , ' north ' versus ' south ' , ' east ' versus ' west , " ' he said .
" and i am told that some have even spoken in terms of ' old ' europe versus ' new . " ' " all of these characterizations belong to the past , " he said . " looking back , it seems clear that totalitarianism was defeated as much by ideas the west championed - now and then - as by icbms -lrb- intercontinental ballistic missiles -rrb- , tanks and warships that the west deployed , " he said .
" our most effective weapon , then and now , has been europe and north america 's shared belief in political and economic freedom , religious toleration , human rights and representative government and the rule of law , " he said . " today they are under threat by another virulent ideological adversary and are confronted by a range of other looming geopolitical challenges , " he said .
energy for political coercion putin on saturday stunned top officials and academics gathered in munich with a vehement attack on us leadership in the world .
a former kgb spy , putin charged that united states has " overstepped its borders in all spheres , " creating a dangerous " uni-polar " world that had brought war , ruin and insecurity . he questioned the intentions behind nato expansion eastward into countries that once formed part of the soviet union , and us plans for missile defense systems in poland and the czech republic , former soviet bloc states . gates in contrast said russia was " a partner in endeavors . " " but we wonder , too , about some russian policies that seem to work against international stability , such as its arms transfers and its temptation to use energy resources for political coercion , " he said . russia " need not fear law-based democracies on its border , " he added .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : security was tight in munich for the conference " no fewer than 18 terrorist organizations , many linked with al-qaeda , have pulled off bloody attacks throughout the world , " he said .
" those attacks - and other threats that have since emerged - revealed even more starkly the need to reorient the atlantic alliance to be able to export security beyond the borders of nato , " he said . he stressed the importance of not allowing success in afghanistan to slip away . other challenges he cited included sectarian conflicts and jihadist movements radiating out from central asia and the middle east ; an iran " with hegemonic ambitions seeking nuclear power ; " and the struggle over the future of iraq . he also said china was at a " strategic crossroads . " " all of us seek a constructive relationship with china , but we also wonder about strategic choices china may make , " he said .

but dealing with dictatorships in the region poses major challenges , writes journalist marcus bensmann in baku . central asia , located between the pamir mountains and the caspian sea , forms a strategic land link between china and europe , and this year , germany intends to use its eu council presidency to introduce a new central asia strategy that will forge closer ties between the region and europe .
as part of this initiative , in late 2006 , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier visited all five former soviet republics in central asia : kazakhstan , kyrgyzstan , tajikistan , turkmenistan and uzbekistan .
the reasons behind this strategy are clear .
under the steppes and deep beneath the caspian sea lie enormous reserves of oil and gas that could help secure europe 's long-term energy needs .
so far , the soviet-era pipeline network has had a virtual monopoly on the transport of oil and gas deposits .
the newly completed oil pipeline that runs from baku to the turkish mediterranean coast and the gas pipeline that follows this route up to the turkish-georgian border represent a challenge to russia 's pipeline dominance over central asia 's natural resources .
however , russia 's gasprom continues to rule the market in central asia .
in addition to russia , the us , and europe , china has emerged as a major competitor for these rich natural resources .
beijing is considering investing billions of dollars to develop the exploitation of energy reserves and build pipelines .
china and russia have secured their influence on the region through the shanghai cooperation organization , an intergovernmental body that includes all central asian countries except turkmenistan .
ruthless dictatorships central asia represents a crucial zone on the frontlines of the troubled european and american mission in afghanistan .
germany has established an airbase to supply its armed forces in afghanistan in the uzbek provincial capital of termez .
however , berlin and brussels face some uneasy conflicts in the region .
particularly in countries like uzbekistan and turkmenistan , rich natural resources have fallen into the hands of the ruling dictatorships , and citizens of these countries live under autocratic regimes .
until his death in december , turkmenistan president saparmurat niyazov imposed a bizarre personality cult on the country .
repressive rule helped him to fill his foreign bank accounts , but people were left with severe food shortages .
andijan massacre and sanctions in may 2005 , uzbek president islam karimov ordered government forces to open fire on tens of thousands of democracy protestors in the city of andijan .
estimates of those killed in the hail of bullets range from hundreds to thousands .
karimov and his government justified the brutal crackdown as a necessary measure to put down an alleged islamic coup - and opposed eu and us calls for an international inquiry into the killings .
as a result , the eu has imposed sanctions against uzbekistan since october 2005 , issued an arms embargo and refused to allow high-ranking members of the uzbek government to enter their territory .
it is not clear what exactly happened in andijan , but there remains no doubt that the uprising was sparked by protests against the despotic rule of the state .
the external threat of islamism helps karimov to retain his hold on power , yet it is also his despotic rule that has laid the foundations for extremist groups making extravagant promises .
dialogue with dictators germany 's policy on central asia aims to promote change through dialogue with dictators and the government is working to ease or drop eu sanctions against uzbekistan .
nevertheless , in november , the eu voted to extend the measures for another three months .
the eu would be well advised to take a differentiated approach to the countries in central asia .
kazakh president nursultan nazarbayev keeps an iron grip on power with doubtful elections and repressive measures , yet in contrast to uzbekistan , he has allowed the population to benefit from the wealth generated by the country 's rapidly growing economy .
kazakhstan even has a minor political opposition and a free press that is slowly beginning to flourish .
an economic perspective take a walk through the kazakh economic boomtown almaty and the uzbek capital , tashkent , and the difference is immediately obvious .
tashkent is shrouded in an atmosphere of dejection and lethargy , whereas almaty is full of bustling activity .
in the economically backward country of kyrgyzstan , a confident public is challenging the ruling elite .
since the overthrow of president askar akayev in march 2005 , the political process in the country has fumbled from crisis to crisis .
in contrast to the other countries of the region , however , kyrgyz citizens have relatively little to fear when confronting representatives of the state .
promoting development the eu should pursue a strategy that focuses on these countries and promotes their development , and above all , gives kyrgyzstan 's impoverished economy a helping hand .
the death of niyazov opens up a window of opportunity to encourage the unsettled turkmen leaders to institute reforms .
friendly handshakes and smiles , however , will do little to convince karimov to initiate reforms .
the uzbek president interprets every concession as a sign of weakness .
that is a lesson that the americans learned the hard way after they established a military base in uzbekistan in 2001 .
four years later , the andijan massacre cooled relations between the two countries , and the us had to abandon the base .
german foreign policymakers seem to be making the same mistake by openly flirting with the dictator in tashkent .
however , if europe is resolute in isolating karimov and works instead to promote prospering countries along the border with uzbekistan , the uzbek political leadership may in turn out pressure on karimov to introduce reforms , forcing him to soften his attitude .
uzbekistan and even turkmenistan need a bridge to the west even more than the west needs them .
without europe , they would be forced to enter into a reluctant dependency on china and russia .
this is an opportunity that european foreign policy should take full advantage of .

four years later , the andijan massacre cooled relations between the two countries , and the us had to abandon the base .
german foreign policymakers seem to be making the same mistake by openly flirting with the dictator in tashkent .
however , if europe is resolute in isolating karimov and works instead to promote prospering countries along the border with uzbekistan , the uzbek political leadership may in turn out pressure on karimov to introduce reforms , forcing him to soften his attitude .
uzbekistan and even turkmenistan need a bridge to the west even more than the west needs them .
without europe , they would be forced to enter into a reluctant dependency on china and russia .
this is an opportunity that european foreign policy should take full advantage of .

in england the 800-year-old principle was abolished in 2005 , meaning people could face trial again if new and compelling evidence emerged .
the conservatives want to see similar changes introduced in scotland .
a scottish executive spokeswoman said it had no current plans to change the law regarding double jeopardy .
compelling evidence last year legal history was made when william dunlop became the first person in the uk to be convicted of a crime for which he had he had previously been acquitted .
he was jailed for life after he admitted strangling 22-year-old julie hogg .
dunlop had previously stood trial for the killing twice , but on both occasions the jury failed to reach a verdict and he was formally cleared .
however he later told police he had lied in court .
ms goldie said : " we propose that in cases where new or compelling evidence becomes available , a retrial is allowed at the discretion of the lord advocate and the scottish court of criminal appeal . "
she said that recent advances in forensic technology meant material " not formerly usable as evidence could now be pivotal " .
" we anticipate its use being very rare , but in those few cases where new evidence enables the delivery of justice to a killer or other serious offenders and solace to a family , it is a change well worth making , " she added .
