the plan supported the rights of developing nations to pursue growth and rejected the idea of binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions . " the international community should respect the rights of the developing countries and allow them enough space for development .
the consequences of inhibiting their development would be far greater than not doing anything to fight climate change , " said ma kai , the minister of china 's key reform and development commission . un wants temperature limit ma implied that wealthy nations - those that have already benefited from emissions-producing industrial booms - are the ones who should take the lead in cutting greenhouse-gas emissions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is second only to the us in terms of greenhouse gases beijing 's plan was released just two days ahead of a meeting of eight leading industrial nations , where global warming is top of the agenda . un experts have warned that limiting global warming to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- is the threshold level to stop the worst impacts of climate change beijing wants further research but while the chinese plan includes a goal of reducing emissions from key pollutants by two percent a year up to 2010 , " our general stance is that china will not commit to any quantified emissions reduction targets , " ma said . " i 'm afraid -lrb- that the benefit of a two-degree threshold -rrb- still lacks a lot of scientific evidence and dependable and feasible research , " ma said .
" there is especially no research that details the economic impact of a two-degree restriction , nor what kind of influence such a target would bring on the development of each nation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing 's building boom is now legendary ma appeared to ignore a may report from the un 's top panel of climate scientists that said annual global economic growth would fall by only 0.12 percentage points if warming was limited to between 2.0-2.4 degrees celsius . g8 to issue statement the un 's international panel on climate change , made up of experts from over 120 nations including china , said nations had the money and the technology to keep global warming to two degrees . the panel said in an earlier report that increases beyond that threshold could unleash catastrophic consequences ranging from an increase in violent storms to severe drought to rising sea levels . ma 's comments were specifically aimed at an eu proposal calling for a limit on global warming this century to two degrees , and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
the european bloc hopes to enshrine the proposal in a summit statement of the g8 meeting in germany this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un warns more global warming could mean natural disaster china is the biggest greenhouse gas emitter after the united states . global warming - just " hysteria " ? meanwhile , former german chancellor helmut schmidt called for an end to the " hysteria " over global warming in the lead-up to the summit .
the topic is " hysterical , overheated , and that is especially because of the media , " schmidt told germany 's bild daily . there has always been climate change on earth , schmidt said . " we 've had warm- and ice-ages for hundreds of thousands of years , " he said , and added that the reasons behind the multiple climate changes have been " inadequately researched for the time being . " to assume that global climate change can be altered by any plans made at the heiligendamm summit is " idiotic , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the un continues a campaign to crack down on global political corruption , the german parliament has balked at reforming its own anti-corruption laws . in the kind of case that infuriates anti-corruption campaigners , a long-time member of parliament for the german state of north rhine-westphalia escaped sentencing although he had accepted 95,000 euros -lrb- $ 127,700 -rrb- from a construction company . a regional court in düsseldorf did find that wilhelm droste of the conservative christian democratic union did accept the money but could not decide whether the money was a bribe or a payment for " general good behavior . " after the decision droste referred to the court ’ s decision as " glorious . " anti-corruption at home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german parliament has a mixed view of corruption the german government has long been involved with various committees fighting corruption in africa and in the business world .
but when it comes to fighting bribery in their own halls , german politicians have avoided enacting tough legislation . in almost every country in the world , the corruption laws governing members of parliament are at least as strict as those that apply to government officials .
not so in germany . a german parliamentarian can only be prosecuted for corruption if it is proven that a bribe was accepted to directly influence a vote , a crime that carries a sentence of up to five years .
however , the bar is set so high that it is almost impossible to successfully prosecute such cases . in the 13 years since the law has been on the books , only one parliamentarian from the eastern german city of neuruppin has been sentenced . ' no ' to un convention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the un stomp out corruption ?
the united nations convention against corruption -lrb- uncac -rrb- was accepted by the un general assembly in october 2003 . as part of its campaign against corruption in government , the uncac states that " each state party shall endeavor to apply , within its own institutional and legal systems , codes or standards of conduct for the correct , honorable and proper performance of public functions . " the convention has been signed by 140 countries and ratified by 93 including the united states , great britain , france as well as uganda and sri lanka . germany signed the convention in december of 2003 but has since failed to ratify it . a new law ? anti-corruption groups such as transarency international and the association of taxpayers , along with a mix of officials from germany and the european union are now pushing for a new law . in response to highly-publicized bribery scandals at volkswagen and siemens , the german government last month moved to better fight international corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerzy montag of the german green party however most parliamentarians do not support any move to strengthen the anti-corruption laws governing themselves , arguing that a tightening of the law would hinder their ability to legally interact with lobbyists . " every political party in the government has members who have misgivings and will not participate in any tightening -lrb- of the law -rrb- , " said jerzy montag , a spokesperson for the green party . oliver samson -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the issue is how to do it better proponents of globalization say that free trade and open markets mean more prosperity for the world 's population .
at issue is how to make globalization work better for poor countries than is the case right now . hardly anyone can dispute the world bank 's utopian motto - " our dream is a world free of poverty . "
the big question is how to achieve such a lofty goal when the g8 summit , hosted by german chancellor angela merkel , kicks off on june 6-8 at the baltic sea resort heiligendamm . should the rich g8 industrial nations pour tens of billions of dollars into development aid programs ? or should they encourage greater economic integration through trade and investment , " globalization " in other words , to help lift the developing world out of poverty ? defining globalization the word " globalization " has gotten a bad rap according to experts , a catch-all term encompassing everything that is bad about go-go capitalism - hedge funds that can crash the world 's entire financial system , asian sweatshops , and wealth disparities , in which a prosperous few condemn the masses to a life of misery . environmentalists , too , have gotten on the bandwagon , denouncing ecological destruction and the perils of greenhouse warming , another focal point of the g8 summit . multinational corporations , meanwhile , are blamed for undermining not just local subsistence economies , but indigenous cultures in africa or latin america as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's - a powerful symbol of globalization the ubiquitous coca-cola logo and mcdonald 's arch , which penetrate the most remote corners of the earth , are globalization 's visible signs , but also powerful symbols of american cultural hegemony . in defense of capitalism and open competition proponents , however , say globalization is about raising the world 's living standards through free trade , even though market economies inevitably create winners and losers . " everyone can benefit from open markets , " said rainer hank , a german book author and journalist who has written extensively on the subject .
" the g8 critics ignore the fact that globalization has triggered significant overall growth in the last 25 years . " the average per person income has doubled in the world since 1980 , and 450 million people have emerged from absolute poverty , which the world bank defines as a daily income of less than two dollars a day . hank pointed out that socialist china and bureaucratic india , which account for one-third of the world 's population , are developing countries where economic growth has boomed due to market reforms , even though the income gap among individuals has widened considerably . " that chinese farmers are poor and entrepreneurs in the big city are rich can hardly be blamed on globalization , " he said . " why should social and economical inequities be unfair ? "
hank recently wrote in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" it 's part and parcel of the human condition . this is not to be confused with the principle that everyone must be equal before the law , but we can not ignore the fact that human beings are not all born with the same potential , nor do they have the same chances in life , because of gender , health , rich or poor parents , or just plain luck . " globalization has left much of africa left behind bildunterschrift : many african countries are unable to enter the global village , because they are grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife hank added that it 's unfortunate that africa is the one continent that has been to a large extent been left behind in the globalization process .
but pledges of aid , aid and more aid are not the solution . " africa is a catastrophe , " he said .
" in the post-colonial era , africa is again the ' white man 's burden . '
development aid is well-intentioned , but makes beggars out of people .
they become dependent , corrupt and it robs them of any initiative . " hank added that europe must do its share in stimulating growth by completely opening up its markets to goods from poor countries . other globalization experts who are free marketeers , such as the world bank 's richard newfarmer , say so many african countries are unable to enter the global village because they are still grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife . although the long-running bloodshed and genocide in places like darfur have reduced sudan to one of the continent 's poorest nations , newfarmer pointed out that kenya , tanzania and botswana have experienced steady growth for the past decade , because those countries have benefited from both development assistance and commerce . the debate is not aid vs. trade , but the need for both " we need to get away from the aid vs. trade approach , " he said .
" both are important .
the question is how to make globalization work for poor people . " if the g8 fulfill their pledges , they will be making an important contribution , " newfarmer added .
" the us and europe spend more on potato chips in a year than they do than on aid to developing countries . " there 's even room for improvement in trade policy , since a further lowering of protective trade barriers across the board would provide africa with more access to world markets , he said . globalization impacts on daily lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : globalization 's impact : women 's rights globalization is not just an economic process , but can positively influence politics and personal lives , according to nayan chanda of the yale center for the study of globalization . " china , india , vietnam , brazil are countries that have improved living standards enormously in a short time , " he said .
" now political changes are coming too , especially in china .
people are protesting more vigorously now , such as dissent over government attempts to block and filter the internet .
economic growth feeds political liberalization . " even the fall of soviet communism and the berlin wall were a consequence of the global impact of television , as those behind the iron curtain realized there could be a better life in other countries , say some experts . traditional family systems , too , are being challenged around the world , as more women work outside the home and stake a claim to greater gender equality .
but there 's room for improvement , according to newfarmer . " opening up the economy means opening up to new ideas , " he said .
" the notion of globalization being good or bad is not terribly meaningful .
the issue is how we can achieve better globalization . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the plan supported the rights of developing nations to pursue growth and rejected the idea of binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions . " the international community should respect the rights of the developing countries and allow them enough space for development .
the consequences of inhibiting their development would be far greater than not doing anything to fight climate change , " said ma kai , the minister of china 's key reform and development commission . un wants temperature limit ma implied that wealthy nations - those that have already benefited from emissions-producing industrial booms - are the ones who should take the lead in cutting greenhouse-gas emissions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is second only to the us in terms of greenhouse gases beijing 's plan was released just two days ahead of a meeting of eight leading industrial nations , where global warming is top of the agenda . un experts have warned that limiting global warming to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- is the threshold level to stop the worst impacts of climate change beijing wants further research but while the chinese plan includes a goal of reducing emissions from key pollutants by two percent a year up to 2010 , " our general stance is that china will not commit to any quantified emissions reduction targets , " ma said . " i 'm afraid -lrb- that the benefit of a two-degree threshold -rrb- still lacks a lot of scientific evidence and dependable and feasible research , " ma said .
" there is especially no research that details the economic impact of a two-degree restriction , nor what kind of influence such a target would bring on the development of each nation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing 's building boom is now legendary ma appeared to ignore a may report from the un 's top panel of climate scientists that said annual global economic growth would fall by only 0.12 percentage points if warming was limited to between 2.0-2.4 degrees celsius . g8 to issue statement the un 's international panel on climate change , made up of experts from over 120 nations including china , said nations had the money and the technology to keep global warming to two degrees . the panel said in an earlier report that increases beyond that threshold could unleash catastrophic consequences ranging from an increase in violent storms to severe drought to rising sea levels . ma 's comments were specifically aimed at an eu proposal calling for a limit on global warming this century to two degrees , and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
the european bloc hopes to enshrine the proposal in a summit statement of the g8 meeting in germany this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un warns more global warming could mean natural disaster china is the biggest greenhouse gas emitter after the united states . global warming - just " hysteria " ? meanwhile , former german chancellor helmut schmidt called for an end to the " hysteria " over global warming in the lead-up to the summit .
the topic is " hysterical , overheated , and that is especially because of the media , " schmidt told germany 's bild daily . there has always been climate change on earth , schmidt said . " we 've had warm- and ice-ages for hundreds of thousands of years , " he said , and added that the reasons behind the multiple climate changes have been " inadequately researched for the time being .

free movement on monday , protestors appealed for global freedom of migration and a loosening of asylum and immigration laws in industrialized countries to open doors to migrants from developing countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de globalization -pipe- 04.06.2007 experts : globalization improves , does n't worsen peoples ' lives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : globalization has left some poor countries behind .
the issue is how to do it better proponents of globalization say that free trade and open markets mean more prosperity for the world 's population .
at issue is how to make globalization work better for poor countries than is the case right now . hardly anyone can dispute the world bank 's utopian motto - " our dream is a world free of poverty . "
the big question is how to achieve such a lofty goal when the g8 summit , hosted by german chancellor angela merkel , kicks off on june 6-8 at the baltic sea resort heiligendamm . should the rich g8 industrial nations pour tens of billions of dollars into development aid programs ? or should they encourage greater economic integration through trade and investment , " globalization " in other words , to help lift the developing world out of poverty ? defining globalization the word " globalization " has gotten a bad rap according to experts , a catch-all term encompassing everything that is bad about go-go capitalism - hedge funds that can crash the world 's entire financial system , asian sweatshops , and wealth disparities , in which a prosperous few condemn the masses to a life of misery . environmentalists , too , have gotten on the bandwagon , denouncing ecological destruction and the perils of greenhouse warming , another focal point of the g8 summit . multinational corporations , meanwhile , are blamed for undermining not just local subsistence economies , but indigenous cultures in africa or latin america as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's - a powerful symbol of globalization the ubiquitous coca-cola logo and mcdonald 's arch , which penetrate the most remote corners of the earth , are globalization 's visible signs , but also powerful symbols of american cultural hegemony . in defense of capitalism and open competition proponents , however , say globalization is about raising the world 's living standards through free trade , even though market economies inevitably create winners and losers . " everyone can benefit from open markets , " said rainer hank , a german book author and journalist who has written extensively on the subject .
" the g8 critics ignore the fact that globalization has triggered significant overall growth in the last 25 years . " the average per person income has doubled in the world since 1980 , and 450 million people have emerged from absolute poverty , which the world bank defines as a daily income of less than two dollars a day . hank pointed out that socialist china and bureaucratic india , which account for one-third of the world 's population , are developing countries where economic growth has boomed due to market reforms , even though the income gap among individuals has widened considerably . " that chinese farmers are poor and entrepreneurs in the big city are rich can hardly be blamed on globalization , " he said . " why should social and economical inequities be unfair ? "
hank recently wrote in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" it 's part and parcel of the human condition . this is not to be confused with the principle that everyone must be equal before the law , but we can not ignore the fact that human beings are not all born with the same potential , nor do they have the same chances in life , because of gender , health , rich or poor parents , or just plain luck . " globalization has left much of africa left behind bildunterschrift : many african countries are unable to enter the global village , because they are grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife hank added that it 's unfortunate that africa is the one continent that has been to a large extent been left behind in the globalization process .
but pledges of aid , aid and more aid are not the solution . " africa is a catastrophe , " he said .
" in the post-colonial era , africa is again the ' white man 's burden . '
development aid is well-intentioned , but makes beggars out of people .
they become dependent , corrupt and it robs them of any initiative . " hank added that europe must do its share in stimulating growth by completely opening up its markets to goods from poor countries . other globalization experts who are free marketeers , such as the world bank 's richard newfarmer , say so many african countries are unable to enter the global village because they are still grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife . although the long-running bloodshed and genocide in places like darfur have reduced sudan to one of the continent 's poorest nations , newfarmer pointed out that kenya , tanzania and botswana have experienced steady growth for the past decade , because those countries have benefited from both development assistance and commerce . the debate is not aid vs. trade , but the need for both " we need to get away from the aid vs. trade approach , " he said .
" both are important .
the question is how to make globalization work for poor people . " if the g8 fulfill their pledges , they will be making an important contribution , " newfarmer added .
" the us and europe spend more on potato chips in a year than they do than on aid to developing countries . " there 's even room for improvement in trade policy , since a further lowering of protective trade barriers across the board would provide africa with more access to world markets , he said . globalization impacts on daily lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : globalization 's impact : women 's rights globalization is not just an economic process , but can positively influence politics and personal lives , according to nayan chanda of the yale center for the study of globalization . " china , india , vietnam , brazil are countries that have improved living standards enormously in a short time , " he said .
" now political changes are coming too , especially in china .
people are protesting more vigorously now , such as dissent over government attempts to block and filter the internet .
economic growth feeds political liberalization . " even the fall of soviet communism and the berlin wall were a consequence of the global impact of television , as those behind the iron curtain realized there could be a better life in other countries , say some experts . traditional family systems , too , are being challenged around the world , as more women work outside the home and stake a claim to greater gender equality .
but there 's room for improvement , according to newfarmer . " opening up the economy means opening up to new ideas , " he said .
" the notion of globalization being good or bad is not terribly meaningful .
the issue is how we can achieve better globalization . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the plan supported the rights of developing nations to pursue growth and rejected the idea of binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions . " the international community should respect the rights of the developing countries and allow them enough space for development .
the consequences of inhibiting their development would be far greater than not doing anything to fight climate change , " said ma kai , the minister of china 's key reform and development commission . un wants temperature limit ma implied that wealthy nations - those that have already benefited from emissions-producing industrial booms - are the ones who should take the lead in cutting greenhouse-gas emissions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is second only to the us in terms of greenhouse gases beijing 's plan was released just two days ahead of a meeting of eight leading industrial nations , where global warming is top of the agenda . un experts have warned that limiting global warming to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- is the threshold level to stop the worst impacts of climate change beijing wants further research but while the chinese plan includes a goal of reducing emissions from key pollutants by two percent a year up to 2010 , " our general stance is that china will not commit to any quantified emissions reduction targets , " ma said . " i 'm afraid -lrb- that the benefit of a two-degree threshold -rrb- still lacks a lot of scientific evidence and dependable and feasible research , " ma said .
" there is especially no research that details the economic impact of a two-degree restriction , nor what kind of influence such a target would bring on the development of each nation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing 's building boom is now legendary ma appeared to ignore a may report from the un 's top panel of climate scientists that said annual global economic growth would fall by only 0.12 percentage points if warming was limited to between 2.0-2.4 degrees celsius . g8 to issue statement the un 's international panel on climate change , made up of experts from over 120 nations including china , said nations had the money and the technology to keep global warming to two degrees . the panel said in an earlier report that increases beyond that threshold could unleash catastrophic consequences ranging from an increase in violent storms to severe drought to rising sea levels . ma 's comments were specifically aimed at an eu proposal calling for a limit on global warming this century to two degrees , and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
the european bloc hopes to enshrine the proposal in a summit statement of the g8 meeting in germany this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un warns more global warming could mean natural disaster china is the biggest greenhouse gas emitter after the united states . global warming - just " hysteria " ? meanwhile , former german chancellor helmut schmidt called for an end to the " hysteria " over global warming in the lead-up to the summit .
the topic is " hysterical , overheated , and that is especially because of the media , " schmidt told germany 's bild daily . there has always been climate change on earth , schmidt said . " we 've had warm- and ice-ages for hundreds of thousands of years , " he said , and added that the reasons behind the multiple climate changes have been " inadequately researched for the time being .

in the end , the hoppers created " a mini-mini-earthquake , " according to ulrich grünewald , who produced the segment for a science program on german television .
the ground moved one-twentieth of a millimeter , with four oscillations per second .
scientists from germany ’ s geological research institute measured movement up to a kilometer away . the china question according to grünewald , the idea came about when some of the show ’ s creators began mulling the perennial question , " what would happen if all 1.3 billion chinese jumped off the ground at the same time ? " " we showed that people can not start a -lrb- real -rrb- earthquake by hopping , " grünewald told the dpa news service .
an actual earthquake would contain billions of times more energy than the jumping germans produced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they first tried the experiment with a gymnast " the hardest thing was to get the hopping synchronized , " grünewald noted . the experiment , at the annual open-air music festival held at germany 's nürburgring raceway , was the culmination of a series . previously , the scientists had used smaller control groups and multiplied the results .
first they measured how many oscillations were produced by a gymnast doing a back-handspring and a flip .
then , 47 soccer players were made to bounce on their cleats . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all signs point to an unsettling demographic profile in eastern germany by 2005 " the prognosis for population development up to 2050 are alarming , " tiefensee told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" especially young women are leaving the east .
we can not just sit idly by and watch . "
the minister plans to start his " model project " in two of nine regions that have been deemed most affected .
these areas are all predominantly rural .
saved by the bookmobile ? " we want to see how we can improve services to thinly populated areas , " tiefensee told the paper .
the idea is to provide mobile medical services , multi-generational homes , and book-mobiles , and on-call bus service , among others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the fall of the berlin wall , the exodus began a new study by the berlin institute , a demographics research group , published on wednesday showed that young people - especially women between the ages of 18 and 29 - are flooding to western germany from the eastern states .
as a result , there are 25 percent more men than women in some areas - a european record . jobs first , opponents say tiefensee 's plan met with some criticism , however .
the german association of mid-sized businesses called it a " step in the wrong direction " that failed to attack the roots of the problem .
talking to the ddp news agency , the leader of the magdeburg branch of the association , jutta schubert , said the answer is to ensure jobs exist for the people who are already living there .
tiefensee 's first step should be to give businesses incentive to move to or stay in the area , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are 25 percent more men than women in some parts of the east she suggested that business-friendly measures - giving businesses more flexibility to hire and fire employees , creating financial incentives for companies - would bring businesses and jobs to the east . similarly , wolfgang böhmer , premier of the eastern state of sachsen-anhalt , said he was skeptical that such a project would create lasting change .
he , too , told state television that he thought job creation was the best way to keep people in the area . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de globalization -pipe- 04.06.2007 experts : globalization improves , does n't worsen peoples ' lives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : globalization has left some poor countries behind .
the issue is how to do it better proponents of globalization say that free trade and open markets mean more prosperity for the world 's population .
at issue is how to make globalization work better for poor countries than is the case right now . hardly anyone can dispute the world bank 's utopian motto - " our dream is a world free of poverty . "
the big question is how to achieve such a lofty goal when the g8 summit , hosted by german chancellor angela merkel , kicks off on june 6-8 at the baltic sea resort heiligendamm . should the rich g8 industrial nations pour tens of billions of dollars into development aid programs ? or should they encourage greater economic integration through trade and investment , " globalization " in other words , to help lift the developing world out of poverty ? defining globalization the word " globalization " has gotten a bad rap according to experts , a catch-all term encompassing everything that is bad about go-go capitalism - hedge funds that can crash the world 's entire financial system , asian sweatshops , and wealth disparities , in which a prosperous few condemn the masses to a life of misery . environmentalists , too , have gotten on the bandwagon , denouncing ecological destruction and the perils of greenhouse warming , another focal point of the g8 summit . multinational corporations , meanwhile , are blamed for undermining not just local subsistence economies , but indigenous cultures in africa or latin america as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's - a powerful symbol of globalization the ubiquitous coca-cola logo and mcdonald 's arch , which penetrate the most remote corners of the earth , are globalization 's visible signs , but also powerful symbols of american cultural hegemony . in defense of capitalism and open competition proponents , however , say globalization is about raising the world 's living standards through free trade , even though market economies inevitably create winners and losers . " everyone can benefit from open markets , " said rainer hank , a german book author and journalist who has written extensively on the subject .
" the g8 critics ignore the fact that globalization has triggered significant overall growth in the last 25 years . " the average per person income has doubled in the world since 1980 , and 450 million people have emerged from absolute poverty , which the world bank defines as a daily income of less than two dollars a day . hank pointed out that socialist china and bureaucratic india , which account for one-third of the world 's population , are developing countries where economic growth has boomed due to market reforms , even though the income gap among individuals has widened considerably . " that chinese farmers are poor and entrepreneurs in the big city are rich can hardly be blamed on globalization , " he said . " why should social and economical inequities be unfair ? "
hank recently wrote in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" it 's part and parcel of the human condition . this is not to be confused with the principle that everyone must be equal before the law , but we can not ignore the fact that human beings are not all born with the same potential , nor do they have the same chances in life , because of gender , health , rich or poor parents , or just plain luck . " globalization has left much of africa left behind bildunterschrift : many african countries are unable to enter the global village , because they are grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife hank added that it 's unfortunate that africa is the one continent that has been to a large extent been left behind in the globalization process .
but pledges of aid , aid and more aid are not the solution . " africa is a catastrophe , " he said .
" in the post-colonial era , africa is again the ' white man 's burden . '
development aid is well-intentioned , but makes beggars out of people .
they become dependent , corrupt and it robs them of any initiative . " hank added that europe must do its share in stimulating growth by completely opening up its markets to goods from poor countries . other globalization experts who are free marketeers , such as the world bank 's richard newfarmer , say so many african countries are unable to enter the global village because they are still grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife . although the long-running bloodshed and genocide in places like darfur have reduced sudan to one of the continent 's poorest nations , newfarmer pointed out that kenya , tanzania and botswana have experienced steady growth for the past decade , because those countries have benefited from both development assistance and commerce . the debate is not aid vs. trade , but the need for both " we need to get away from the aid vs. trade approach , " he said .
" both are important .
the question is how to make globalization work for poor people . " if the g8 fulfill their pledges , they will be making an important contribution , " newfarmer added .
" the us and europe spend more on potato chips in a year than they do than on aid to developing countries . " there 's even room for improvement in trade policy , since a further lowering of protective trade barriers across the board would provide africa with more access to world markets , he said . globalization impacts on daily lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : globalization 's impact : women 's rights globalization is not just an economic process , but can positively influence politics and personal lives , according to nayan chanda of the yale center for the study of globalization . " china , india , vietnam , brazil are countries that have improved living standards enormously in a short time , " he said .
" now political changes are coming too , especially in china .
people are protesting more vigorously now , such as dissent over government attempts to block and filter the internet .
economic growth feeds political liberalization . " even the fall of soviet communism and the berlin wall were a consequence of the global impact of television , as those behind the iron curtain realized there could be a better life in other countries , say some experts . traditional family systems , too , are being challenged around the world , as more women work outside the home and stake a claim to greater gender equality .
but there 's room for improvement , according to newfarmer . " opening up the economy means opening up to new ideas , " he said .
" the notion of globalization being good or bad is not terribly meaningful .
the issue is how we can achieve better globalization . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we fear that if the united states was protected against , let 's say , an iranian nuclear arsenal , and europe is not , the impact on us would be bad as well , " he said .
fried added that he was confident the europeans would eventually come to the conclusion that missile defense is in their interests .
analysts believe fried 's case has inadvertently been aided by the russians , whose threatening language has hardened the positions of the czech and polish governments as well as conservative circles in western europe .
" that 's a big reason why the czechs and poles want missile defense , " said reginald dale , a fellow at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , " because it bands them closer to the us , in case something happens in moscow .

dw-world.de spoke with an expert about the globalized car industry . dw-world.de : the vw golf is produced on four continents and sold on six .
is this normal for the global car industry ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the volkswagen golf is the third best-selling car in the world ferdinand dudenhöffer : yes .
what we see is that each of the large car manufacturers has a production facility in the different markets .
that means today being in western europe , the us , in the future increasingly in china , and in eastern europe .
so what we see is that for each platform a car will be produced in different countries .
we do not have an industry in which there is just one big factory which exports its products to all other countries .
in addition , what we see is that the products are not identical in each different market .
it may have the same technical platform , but the design and the options and features differ between countries .
why is that ?
they are different because the demands of customers differ between countries .
for example , in south america , incomes are lower than in western europe and customers need more affordable cars .
in the usa the customers want more space in the car , and that 's an important factor for a car to be successful there .
it is not possible to be in the high volume market and to send the same cars to every market all over the world .
so car makers are researching what their customers want and changing the car for each market ?
yes , they have to do market research and find out the wants of their customers or they will lose out to their competitors .
even though the cars are made in four continents , are the parts coming to these assembly plants from all over the world ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferdinand dudenhöffer is one of germany 's foremost car industry experts more and more we are seeing that the ckd -lrb- completely knocked down -rrb- cars are being produced for some countries in smaller volumes .
that is often the case if there are barriers to exporting cars to particular countries , and they are only being sold in smaller volumes .
with larger markets , with sales of 50,000 or more of a model , they really need their own plant which has its own suppliers of parts .
what is ckd ?
it means completely knocked down .
that means that every part of the car is placed in a transport box and shipped to a country and then what is called a ckd assembly is done .
that means that they open the box and then put the car together in the destination country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 2,000 vw golfs are produced every day around the world why do you think the vw golf is so successful on the world market ?
the most important market for the golf is in western europe and in this market the golf driver is spread across different customer and social groups .
successful sports people and chief executives , as well as students can drive a golf , and each of these groups perceive the golf favourably .
if a student drove a porsche or a mercedes everyone would think this car is too large for them .
if a ceo or a film star drove a small fiat , everyone would say " what is going on ? "
the golf is classless , it 's not specifically tailored to one specific customer group and it does n't exclude anyone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the car to be seen in - whether you 're a student or a star is global production a growing trend in the automotive industry ?
it is a strong growing trend .
if we look at the most successful companies doing global production then you have to look at not just vw but toyota .
toyota has cars , like the auris -lrb- which is the successor of the corolla -rrb- which are distributed and manufactured in north america , western europe , japan and asia .
they have a basic structure of the car and on this platform they manufacture a car which differs a little between each market , to best fulfil customer preferences .
that approach , going to different countries with a production line based on a basic structure with differing designs is one of the most important factors for success in the car industry .
given that the golf is produced all over the world , should we call it a german car or a global car ?
i think in the future we will not see cars as german , or french or italian or whatever .
the brands are what matter .
the golf is vw , and that is more important than saying it is a german car .
the car company and brands are based all over the world and they stand for that brand , not a specific country .

if we look at the most successful companies doing global production then you have to look at not just vw but toyota .
toyota has cars , like the auris -lrb- which is the successor of the corolla -rrb- which are distributed and manufactured in north america , western europe , japan and asia .
they have a basic structure of the car and on this platform they manufacture a car which differs a little between each market , to best fulfil customer preferences .
that approach , going to different countries with a production line based on a basic structure with differing designs is one of the most important factors for success in the car industry .
given that the golf is produced all over the world , should we call it a german car or a global car ?
i think in the future we will not see cars as german , or french or italian or whatever .
the brands are what matter .
the golf is vw , and that is more important than saying it is a german car .
the car company and brands are based all over the world and they stand for that brand , not a specific country .

dw-world.de spoke with an expert about the globalized car industry . dw-world.de : the vw golf is produced on four continents and sold on six .
is this normal for the global car industry ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the volkswagen golf is the third best-selling car in the world ferdinand dudenhöffer : yes .
what we see is that each of the large car manufacturers has a production facility in the different markets .
that means today being in western europe , the us , in the future increasingly in china , and in eastern europe .
so what we see is that for each platform a car will be produced in different countries .
we do not have an industry in which there is just one big factory which exports its products to all other countries .
in addition , what we see is that the products are not identical in each different market .
it may have the same technical platform , but the design and the options and features differ between countries .
why is that ?
they are different because the demands of customers differ between countries .
for example , in south america , incomes are lower than in western europe and customers need more affordable cars .
in the usa the customers want more space in the car , and that 's an important factor for a car to be successful there .
it is not possible to be in the high volume market and to send the same cars to every market all over the world .
so car makers are researching what their customers want and changing the car for each market ?
yes , they have to do market research and find out the wants of their customers or they will lose out to their competitors .
even though the cars are made in four continents , are the parts coming to these assembly plants from all over the world ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferdinand dudenhöffer is one of germany 's foremost car industry experts more and more we are seeing that the ckd -lrb- completely knocked down -rrb- cars are being produced for some countries in smaller volumes .
that is often the case if there are barriers to exporting cars to particular countries , and they are only being sold in smaller volumes .
with larger markets , with sales of 50,000 or more of a model , they really need their own plant which has its own suppliers of parts .
what is ckd ?
it means completely knocked down .
that means that every part of the car is placed in a transport box and shipped to a country and then what is called a ckd assembly is done .
that means that they open the box and then put the car together in the destination country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 2,000 vw golfs are produced every day around the world why do you think the vw golf is so successful on the world market ?
the most important market for the golf is in western europe and in this market the golf driver is spread across different customer and social groups .
successful sports people and chief executives , as well as students can drive a golf , and each of these groups perceive the golf favourably .
if a student drove a porsche or a mercedes everyone would think this car is too large for them .
if a ceo or a film star drove a small fiat , everyone would say " what is going on ? "
the golf is classless , it 's not specifically tailored to one specific customer group and it does n't exclude anyone .

the issue is how to do it better proponents of globalization say that free trade and open markets mean more prosperity for the world 's population .
at issue is how to make globalization work better for poor countries than is the case right now . hardly anyone can dispute the world bank 's utopian motto - " our dream is a world free of poverty . "
the big question is how to achieve such a lofty goal when the g8 summit , hosted by german chancellor angela merkel , kicks off on june 6-8 at the baltic sea resort heiligendamm . should the rich g8 industrial nations pour tens of billions of dollars into development aid programs ? or should they encourage greater economic integration through trade and investment , " globalization " in other words , to help lift the developing world out of poverty ? defining globalization the word " globalization " has gotten a bad rap according to experts , a catch-all term encompassing everything that is bad about go-go capitalism - hedge funds that can crash the world 's entire financial system , asian sweatshops , and wealth disparities , in which a prosperous few condemn the masses to a life of misery . environmentalists , too , have gotten on the bandwagon , denouncing ecological destruction and the perils of greenhouse warming , another focal point of the g8 summit . multinational corporations , meanwhile , are blamed for undermining not just local subsistence economies , but indigenous cultures in africa or latin america as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's - a powerful symbol of globalization the ubiquitous coca-cola logo and mcdonald 's arch , which penetrate the most remote corners of the earth , are globalization 's visible signs , but also powerful symbols of american cultural hegemony . in defense of capitalism and open competition proponents , however , say globalization is about raising the world 's living standards through free trade , even though market economies inevitably create winners and losers . " everyone can benefit from open markets , " said rainer hank , a german book author and journalist who has written extensively on the subject .
" the g8 critics ignore the fact that globalization has triggered significant overall growth in the last 25 years . " the average per person income has doubled in the world since 1980 , and 450 million people have emerged from absolute poverty , which the world bank defines as a daily income of less than two dollars a day . hank pointed out that socialist china and bureaucratic india , which account for one-third of the world 's population , are developing countries where economic growth has boomed due to market reforms , even though the income gap among individuals has widened considerably . " that chinese farmers are poor and entrepreneurs in the big city are rich can hardly be blamed on globalization , " he said . " why should social and economical inequities be unfair ? "
hank recently wrote in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" it 's part and parcel of the human condition . this is not to be confused with the principle that everyone must be equal before the law , but we can not ignore the fact that human beings are not all born with the same potential , nor do they have the same chances in life , because of gender , health , rich or poor parents , or just plain luck . " globalization has left much of africa left behind bildunterschrift : many african countries are unable to enter the global village , because they are grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife hank added that it 's unfortunate that africa is the one continent that has been to a large extent been left behind in the globalization process .
but pledges of aid , aid and more aid are not the solution . " africa is a catastrophe , " he said .
" in the post-colonial era , africa is again the ' white man 's burden . '
development aid is well-intentioned , but makes beggars out of people .
they become dependent , corrupt and it robs them of any initiative . " hank added that europe must do its share in stimulating growth by completely opening up its markets to goods from poor countries . other globalization experts who are free marketeers , such as the world bank 's richard newfarmer , say so many african countries are unable to enter the global village because they are still grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife . although the long-running bloodshed and genocide in places like darfur have reduced sudan to one of the continent 's poorest nations , newfarmer pointed out that kenya , tanzania and botswana have experienced steady growth for the past decade , because those countries have benefited from both development assistance and commerce . the debate is not aid vs. trade , but the need for both " we need to get away from the aid vs. trade approach , " he said .
" both are important .
the question is how to make globalization work for poor people . " if the g8 fulfill their pledges , they will be making an important contribution , " newfarmer added .
" the us and europe spend more on potato chips in a year than they do than on aid to developing countries . " there 's even room for improvement in trade policy , since a further lowering of protective trade barriers across the board would provide africa with more access to world markets , he said . globalization impacts on daily lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : globalization 's impact : women 's rights globalization is not just an economic process , but can positively influence politics and personal lives , according to nayan chanda of the yale center for the study of globalization . " china , india , vietnam , brazil are countries that have improved living standards enormously in a short time , " he said .
" now political changes are coming too , especially in china .
people are protesting more vigorously now , such as dissent over government attempts to block and filter the internet .
economic growth feeds political liberalization . " even the fall of soviet communism and the berlin wall were a consequence of the global impact of television , as those behind the iron curtain realized there could be a better life in other countries , say some experts . traditional family systems , too , are being challenged around the world , as more women work outside the home and stake a claim to greater gender equality .
but there 's room for improvement , according to newfarmer . " opening up the economy means opening up to new ideas , " he said .

in the end , the hoppers created " a mini-mini-earthquake , " according to ulrich grünewald , who produced the segment for a science program on german television .
the ground moved one-twentieth of a millimeter , with four oscillations per second .
scientists from germany ’ s geological research institute measured movement up to a kilometer away . the china question according to grünewald , the idea came about when some of the show ’ s creators began mulling the perennial question , " what would happen if all 1.3 billion chinese jumped off the ground at the same time ? " " we showed that people can not start a -lrb- real -rrb- earthquake by hopping , " grünewald told the dpa news service .
an actual earthquake would contain billions of times more energy than the jumping germans produced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they first tried the experiment with a gymnast " the hardest thing was to get the hopping synchronized , " grünewald noted . the experiment , at the annual open-air music festival held at germany 's nürburgring raceway , was the culmination of a series . previously , the scientists had used smaller control groups and multiplied the results .
first they measured how many oscillations were produced by a gymnast doing a back-handspring and a flip .

as the un continues a campaign to crack down on global political corruption , the german parliament has balked at reforming its own anti-corruption laws . in the kind of case that infuriates anti-corruption campaigners , a long-time member of parliament for the german state of north rhine-westphalia escaped sentencing although he had accepted 95,000 euros -lrb- $ 127,700 -rrb- from a construction company . a regional court in düsseldorf did find that wilhelm droste of the conservative christian democratic union did accept the money but could not decide whether the money was a bribe or a payment for " general good behavior . " after the decision droste referred to the court ’ s decision as " glorious . " anti-corruption at home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german parliament has a mixed view of corruption the german government has long been involved with various committees fighting corruption in africa and in the business world .
but when it comes to fighting bribery in their own halls , german politicians have avoided enacting tough legislation . in almost every country in the world , the corruption laws governing members of parliament are at least as strict as those that apply to government officials .
not so in germany . a german parliamentarian can only be prosecuted for corruption if it is proven that a bribe was accepted to directly influence a vote , a crime that carries a sentence of up to five years .
however , the bar is set so high that it is almost impossible to successfully prosecute such cases . in the 13 years since the law has been on the books , only one parliamentarian from the eastern german city of neuruppin has been sentenced . ' no ' to un convention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the un stomp out corruption ?
the united nations convention against corruption -lrb- uncac -rrb- was accepted by the un general assembly in october 2003 . as part of its campaign against corruption in government , the uncac states that " each state party shall endeavor to apply , within its own institutional and legal systems , codes or standards of conduct for the correct , honorable and proper performance of public functions . " the convention has been signed by 140 countries and ratified by 93 including the united states , great britain , france as well as uganda and sri lanka . germany signed the convention in december of 2003 but has since failed to ratify it . a new law ? anti-corruption groups such as transarency international and the association of taxpayers , along with a mix of officials from germany and the european union are now pushing for a new law . in response to highly-publicized bribery scandals at volkswagen and siemens , the german government last month moved to better fight international corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerzy montag of the german green party however most parliamentarians do not support any move to strengthen the anti-corruption laws governing themselves , arguing that a tightening of the law would hinder their ability to legally interact with lobbyists .

in the end , the hoppers created " a mini-mini-earthquake , " according to ulrich grünewald , who produced the segment for a science program on german television .
the ground moved one-twentieth of a millimeter , with four oscillations per second .
scientists from germany ’ s geological research institute measured movement up to a kilometer away . the china question according to grünewald , the idea came about when some of the show ’ s creators began mulling the perennial question , " what would happen if all 1.3 billion chinese jumped off the ground at the same time ? " " we showed that people can not start a -lrb- real -rrb- earthquake by hopping , " grünewald told the dpa news service .
an actual earthquake would contain billions of times more energy than the jumping germans produced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they first tried the experiment with a gymnast " the hardest thing was to get the hopping synchronized , " grünewald noted . the experiment , at the annual open-air music festival held at germany 's nürburgring raceway , was the culmination of a series . previously , the scientists had used smaller control groups and multiplied the results .
first they measured how many oscillations were produced by a gymnast doing a back-handspring and a flip .
then , 47 soccer players were made to bounce on their cleats . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de globalization -pipe- 04.06.2007 experts : globalization improves , does n't worsen peoples ' lives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : globalization has left some poor countries behind .
the issue is how to do it better proponents of globalization say that free trade and open markets mean more prosperity for the world 's population .
at issue is how to make globalization work better for poor countries than is the case right now . hardly anyone can dispute the world bank 's utopian motto - " our dream is a world free of poverty . "
the big question is how to achieve such a lofty goal when the g8 summit , hosted by german chancellor angela merkel , kicks off on june 6-8 at the baltic sea resort heiligendamm . should the rich g8 industrial nations pour tens of billions of dollars into development aid programs ? or should they encourage greater economic integration through trade and investment , " globalization " in other words , to help lift the developing world out of poverty ? defining globalization the word " globalization " has gotten a bad rap according to experts , a catch-all term encompassing everything that is bad about go-go capitalism - hedge funds that can crash the world 's entire financial system , asian sweatshops , and wealth disparities , in which a prosperous few condemn the masses to a life of misery . environmentalists , too , have gotten on the bandwagon , denouncing ecological destruction and the perils of greenhouse warming , another focal point of the g8 summit . multinational corporations , meanwhile , are blamed for undermining not just local subsistence economies , but indigenous cultures in africa or latin america as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's - a powerful symbol of globalization the ubiquitous coca-cola logo and mcdonald 's arch , which penetrate the most remote corners of the earth , are globalization 's visible signs , but also powerful symbols of american cultural hegemony . in defense of capitalism and open competition proponents , however , say globalization is about raising the world 's living standards through free trade , even though market economies inevitably create winners and losers . " everyone can benefit from open markets , " said rainer hank , a german book author and journalist who has written extensively on the subject .
" the g8 critics ignore the fact that globalization has triggered significant overall growth in the last 25 years . " the average per person income has doubled in the world since 1980 , and 450 million people have emerged from absolute poverty , which the world bank defines as a daily income of less than two dollars a day . hank pointed out that socialist china and bureaucratic india , which account for one-third of the world 's population , are developing countries where economic growth has boomed due to market reforms , even though the income gap among individuals has widened considerably . " that chinese farmers are poor and entrepreneurs in the big city are rich can hardly be blamed on globalization , " he said . " why should social and economical inequities be unfair ? "
hank recently wrote in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" it 's part and parcel of the human condition . this is not to be confused with the principle that everyone must be equal before the law , but we can not ignore the fact that human beings are not all born with the same potential , nor do they have the same chances in life , because of gender , health , rich or poor parents , or just plain luck . " globalization has left much of africa left behind bildunterschrift : many african countries are unable to enter the global village , because they are grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife hank added that it 's unfortunate that africa is the one continent that has been to a large extent been left behind in the globalization process .
but pledges of aid , aid and more aid are not the solution . " africa is a catastrophe , " he said .
" in the post-colonial era , africa is again the ' white man 's burden . '
development aid is well-intentioned , but makes beggars out of people .
they become dependent , corrupt and it robs them of any initiative . " hank added that europe must do its share in stimulating growth by completely opening up its markets to goods from poor countries . other globalization experts who are free marketeers , such as the world bank 's richard newfarmer , say so many african countries are unable to enter the global village because they are still grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife . although the long-running bloodshed and genocide in places like darfur have reduced sudan to one of the continent 's poorest nations , newfarmer pointed out that kenya , tanzania and botswana have experienced steady growth for the past decade , because those countries have benefited from both development assistance and commerce . the debate is not aid vs. trade , but the need for both " we need to get away from the aid vs. trade approach , " he said .
" both are important .
the question is how to make globalization work for poor people . " if the g8 fulfill their pledges , they will be making an important contribution , " newfarmer added .
" the us and europe spend more on potato chips in a year than they do than on aid to developing countries . " there 's even room for improvement in trade policy , since a further lowering of protective trade barriers across the board would provide africa with more access to world markets , he said . globalization impacts on daily lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : globalization 's impact : women 's rights globalization is not just an economic process , but can positively influence politics and personal lives , according to nayan chanda of the yale center for the study of globalization . " china , india , vietnam , brazil are countries that have improved living standards enormously in a short time , " he said .
" now political changes are coming too , especially in china .
people are protesting more vigorously now , such as dissent over government attempts to block and filter the internet .
economic growth feeds political liberalization . " even the fall of soviet communism and the berlin wall were a consequence of the global impact of television , as those behind the iron curtain realized there could be a better life in other countries , say some experts . traditional family systems , too , are being challenged around the world , as more women work outside the home and stake a claim to greater gender equality .
but there 's room for improvement , according to newfarmer . " opening up the economy means opening up to new ideas , " he said .
" the notion of globalization being good or bad is not terribly meaningful .
the issue is how we can achieve better globalization . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de globalization -pipe- 04.06.2007 experts : globalization improves , does n't worsen peoples ' lives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : globalization has left some poor countries behind .
the issue is how to do it better proponents of globalization say that free trade and open markets mean more prosperity for the world 's population .
at issue is how to make globalization work better for poor countries than is the case right now . hardly anyone can dispute the world bank 's utopian motto - " our dream is a world free of poverty . "
the big question is how to achieve such a lofty goal when the g8 summit , hosted by german chancellor angela merkel , kicks off on june 6-8 at the baltic sea resort heiligendamm . should the rich g8 industrial nations pour tens of billions of dollars into development aid programs ? or should they encourage greater economic integration through trade and investment , " globalization " in other words , to help lift the developing world out of poverty ? defining globalization the word " globalization " has gotten a bad rap according to experts , a catch-all term encompassing everything that is bad about go-go capitalism - hedge funds that can crash the world 's entire financial system , asian sweatshops , and wealth disparities , in which a prosperous few condemn the masses to a life of misery . environmentalists , too , have gotten on the bandwagon , denouncing ecological destruction and the perils of greenhouse warming , another focal point of the g8 summit . multinational corporations , meanwhile , are blamed for undermining not just local subsistence economies , but indigenous cultures in africa or latin america as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's - a powerful symbol of globalization the ubiquitous coca-cola logo and mcdonald 's arch , which penetrate the most remote corners of the earth , are globalization 's visible signs , but also powerful symbols of american cultural hegemony . in defense of capitalism and open competition proponents , however , say globalization is about raising the world 's living standards through free trade , even though market economies inevitably create winners and losers . " everyone can benefit from open markets , " said rainer hank , a german book author and journalist who has written extensively on the subject .
" the g8 critics ignore the fact that globalization has triggered significant overall growth in the last 25 years . " the average per person income has doubled in the world since 1980 , and 450 million people have emerged from absolute poverty , which the world bank defines as a daily income of less than two dollars a day . hank pointed out that socialist china and bureaucratic india , which account for one-third of the world 's population , are developing countries where economic growth has boomed due to market reforms , even though the income gap among individuals has widened considerably . " that chinese farmers are poor and entrepreneurs in the big city are rich can hardly be blamed on globalization , " he said . " why should social and economical inequities be unfair ? "
hank recently wrote in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" it 's part and parcel of the human condition . this is not to be confused with the principle that everyone must be equal before the law , but we can not ignore the fact that human beings are not all born with the same potential , nor do they have the same chances in life , because of gender , health , rich or poor parents , or just plain luck . " globalization has left much of africa left behind bildunterschrift : many african countries are unable to enter the global village , because they are grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife hank added that it 's unfortunate that africa is the one continent that has been to a large extent been left behind in the globalization process .
but pledges of aid , aid and more aid are not the solution . " africa is a catastrophe , " he said .
" in the post-colonial era , africa is again the ' white man 's burden . '
development aid is well-intentioned , but makes beggars out of people .
they become dependent , corrupt and it robs them of any initiative . " hank added that europe must do its share in stimulating growth by completely opening up its markets to goods from poor countries . other globalization experts who are free marketeers , such as the world bank 's richard newfarmer , say so many african countries are unable to enter the global village because they are still grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife . although the long-running bloodshed and genocide in places like darfur have reduced sudan to one of the continent 's poorest nations , newfarmer pointed out that kenya , tanzania and botswana have experienced steady growth for the past decade , because those countries have benefited from both development assistance and commerce . the debate is not aid vs. trade , but the need for both " we need to get away from the aid vs. trade approach , " he said .
" both are important .
the question is how to make globalization work for poor people . " if the g8 fulfill their pledges , they will be making an important contribution , " newfarmer added .
" the us and europe spend more on potato chips in a year than they do than on aid to developing countries . " there 's even room for improvement in trade policy , since a further lowering of protective trade barriers across the board would provide africa with more access to world markets , he said . globalization impacts on daily lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : globalization 's impact : women 's rights globalization is not just an economic process , but can positively influence politics and personal lives , according to nayan chanda of the yale center for the study of globalization . " china , india , vietnam , brazil are countries that have improved living standards enormously in a short time , " he said .
" now political changes are coming too , especially in china .
people are protesting more vigorously now , such as dissent over government attempts to block and filter the internet .
economic growth feeds political liberalization . " even the fall of soviet communism and the berlin wall were a consequence of the global impact of television , as those behind the iron curtain realized there could be a better life in other countries , say some experts . traditional family systems , too , are being challenged around the world , as more women work outside the home and stake a claim to greater gender equality .
but there 's room for improvement , according to newfarmer . " opening up the economy means opening up to new ideas , " he said .
" the notion of globalization being good or bad is not terribly meaningful .
the issue is how we can achieve better globalization . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the plan supported the rights of developing nations to pursue growth and rejected the idea of binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions . " the international community should respect the rights of the developing countries and allow them enough space for development .
the consequences of inhibiting their development would be far greater than not doing anything to fight climate change , " said ma kai , the minister of china 's key reform and development commission . un wants temperature limit ma implied that wealthy nations - those that have already benefited from emissions-producing industrial booms - are the ones who should take the lead in cutting greenhouse-gas emissions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is second only to the us in terms of greenhouse gases beijing 's plan was released just two days ahead of a meeting of eight leading industrial nations , where global warming is top of the agenda . un experts have warned that limiting global warming to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- is the threshold level to stop the worst impacts of climate change beijing wants further research but while the chinese plan includes a goal of reducing emissions from key pollutants by two percent a year up to 2010 , " our general stance is that china will not commit to any quantified emissions reduction targets , " ma said . " i 'm afraid -lrb- that the benefit of a two-degree threshold -rrb- still lacks a lot of scientific evidence and dependable and feasible research , " ma said .
" there is especially no research that details the economic impact of a two-degree restriction , nor what kind of influence such a target would bring on the development of each nation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing 's building boom is now legendary ma appeared to ignore a may report from the un 's top panel of climate scientists that said annual global economic growth would fall by only 0.12 percentage points if warming was limited to between 2.0-2.4 degrees celsius . g8 to issue statement the un 's international panel on climate change , made up of experts from over 120 nations including china , said nations had the money and the technology to keep global warming to two degrees . the panel said in an earlier report that increases beyond that threshold could unleash catastrophic consequences ranging from an increase in violent storms to severe drought to rising sea levels . ma 's comments were specifically aimed at an eu proposal calling for a limit on global warming this century to two degrees , and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
the european bloc hopes to enshrine the proposal in a summit statement of the g8 meeting in germany this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un warns more global warming could mean natural disaster china is the biggest greenhouse gas emitter after the united states . global warming - just " hysteria " ? meanwhile , former german chancellor helmut schmidt called for an end to the " hysteria " over global warming in the lead-up to the summit .
the topic is " hysterical , overheated , and that is especially because of the media , " schmidt told germany 's bild daily . there has always been climate change on earth , schmidt said . " we 've had warm- and ice-ages for hundreds of thousands of years , " he said , and added that the reasons behind the multiple climate changes have been " inadequately researched for the time being . " to assume that global climate change can be altered by any plans made at the heiligendamm summit is " idiotic , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the un continues a campaign to crack down on global political corruption , the german parliament has balked at reforming its own anti-corruption laws . in the kind of case that infuriates anti-corruption campaigners , a long-time member of parliament for the german state of north rhine-westphalia escaped sentencing although he had accepted 95,000 euros -lrb- $ 127,700 -rrb- from a construction company . a regional court in düsseldorf did find that wilhelm droste of the conservative christian democratic union did accept the money but could not decide whether the money was a bribe or a payment for " general good behavior . " after the decision droste referred to the court ’ s decision as " glorious . " anti-corruption at home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german parliament has a mixed view of corruption the german government has long been involved with various committees fighting corruption in africa and in the business world .
but when it comes to fighting bribery in their own halls , german politicians have avoided enacting tough legislation . in almost every country in the world , the corruption laws governing members of parliament are at least as strict as those that apply to government officials .
not so in germany . a german parliamentarian can only be prosecuted for corruption if it is proven that a bribe was accepted to directly influence a vote , a crime that carries a sentence of up to five years .
however , the bar is set so high that it is almost impossible to successfully prosecute such cases . in the 13 years since the law has been on the books , only one parliamentarian from the eastern german city of neuruppin has been sentenced . ' no ' to un convention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the un stomp out corruption ?
the united nations convention against corruption -lrb- uncac -rrb- was accepted by the un general assembly in october 2003 . as part of its campaign against corruption in government , the uncac states that " each state party shall endeavor to apply , within its own institutional and legal systems , codes or standards of conduct for the correct , honorable and proper performance of public functions . " the convention has been signed by 140 countries and ratified by 93 including the united states , great britain , france as well as uganda and sri lanka . germany signed the convention in december of 2003 but has since failed to ratify it . a new law ? anti-corruption groups such as transarency international and the association of taxpayers , along with a mix of officials from germany and the european union are now pushing for a new law . in response to highly-publicized bribery scandals at volkswagen and siemens , the german government last month moved to better fight international corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerzy montag of the german green party however most parliamentarians do not support any move to strengthen the anti-corruption laws governing themselves , arguing that a tightening of the law would hinder their ability to legally interact with lobbyists . " every political party in the government has members who have misgivings and will not participate in any tightening -lrb- of the law -rrb- , " said jerzy montag , a spokesperson for the green party . oliver samson -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the end , the hoppers created " a mini-mini-earthquake , " according to ulrich grünewald , who produced the segment for a science program on german television .
the ground moved one-twentieth of a millimeter , with four oscillations per second .
scientists from germany ’ s geological research institute measured movement up to a kilometer away . the china question according to grünewald , the idea came about when some of the show ’ s creators began mulling the perennial question , " what would happen if all 1.3 billion chinese jumped off the ground at the same time ? " " we showed that people can not start a -lrb- real -rrb- earthquake by hopping , " grünewald told the dpa news service .
an actual earthquake would contain billions of times more energy than the jumping germans produced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they first tried the experiment with a gymnast " the hardest thing was to get the hopping synchronized , " grünewald noted . the experiment , at the annual open-air music festival held at germany 's nürburgring raceway , was the culmination of a series . previously , the scientists had used smaller control groups and multiplied the results .
first they measured how many oscillations were produced by a gymnast doing a back-handspring and a flip .
then , 47 soccer players were made to bounce on their cleats . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all signs point to an unsettling demographic profile in eastern germany by 2005 " the prognosis for population development up to 2050 are alarming , " tiefensee told the bild am sonntag newspaper .
" especially young women are leaving the east .
we can not just sit idly by and watch . "
the minister plans to start his " model project " in two of nine regions that have been deemed most affected .
these areas are all predominantly rural .
saved by the bookmobile ? " we want to see how we can improve services to thinly populated areas , " tiefensee told the paper .
the idea is to provide mobile medical services , multi-generational homes , and book-mobiles , and on-call bus service , among others .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : with the fall of the berlin wall , the exodus began a new study by the berlin institute , a demographics research group , published on wednesday showed that young people - especially women between the ages of 18 and 29 - are flooding to western germany from the eastern states .
as a result , there are 25 percent more men than women in some areas - a european record . jobs first , opponents say tiefensee 's plan met with some criticism , however .
the german association of mid-sized businesses called it a " step in the wrong direction " that failed to attack the roots of the problem .
talking to the ddp news agency , the leader of the magdeburg branch of the association , jutta schubert , said the answer is to ensure jobs exist for the people who are already living there .
tiefensee 's first step should be to give businesses incentive to move to or stay in the area , she said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are 25 percent more men than women in some parts of the east she suggested that business-friendly measures - giving businesses more flexibility to hire and fire employees , creating financial incentives for companies - would bring businesses and jobs to the east . similarly , wolfgang böhmer , premier of the eastern state of sachsen-anhalt , said he was skeptical that such a project would create lasting change .
he , too , told state television that he thought job creation was the best way to keep people in the area . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : all signs point to an unsettling demographic profile in eastern germany by 2005 " the prognosis for population development up to 2050 are alarming , " tiefensee told the bild am sonntag newspaper .

the minister plans to start his " model project " in two of nine regions that have been deemed most affected .
these areas are all predominantly rural .

as a result , there are 25 percent more men than women in some areas - a european record . jobs first , opponents say tiefensee 's plan met with some criticism , however .
the german association of mid-sized businesses called it a " step in the wrong direction " that failed to attack the roots of the problem .
talking to the ddp news agency , the leader of the magdeburg branch of the association , jutta schubert , said the answer is to ensure jobs exist for the people who are already living there .
tiefensee 's first step should be to give businesses incentive to move to or stay in the area , she said .

he , too , told state television that he thought job creation was the best way to keep people in the area . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de globalization -pipe- 04.06.2007 experts : globalization improves , does n't worsen peoples ' lives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : globalization has left some poor countries behind .
the issue is how to do it better proponents of globalization say that free trade and open markets mean more prosperity for the world 's population .
at issue is how to make globalization work better for poor countries than is the case right now . hardly anyone can dispute the world bank 's utopian motto - " our dream is a world free of poverty . "
the big question is how to achieve such a lofty goal when the g8 summit , hosted by german chancellor angela merkel , kicks off on june 6-8 at the baltic sea resort heiligendamm . should the rich g8 industrial nations pour tens of billions of dollars into development aid programs ? or should they encourage greater economic integration through trade and investment , " globalization " in other words , to help lift the developing world out of poverty ? defining globalization the word " globalization " has gotten a bad rap according to experts , a catch-all term encompassing everything that is bad about go-go capitalism - hedge funds that can crash the world 's entire financial system , asian sweatshops , and wealth disparities , in which a prosperous few condemn the masses to a life of misery . environmentalists , too , have gotten on the bandwagon , denouncing ecological destruction and the perils of greenhouse warming , another focal point of the g8 summit . multinational corporations , meanwhile , are blamed for undermining not just local subsistence economies , but indigenous cultures in africa or latin america as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's - a powerful symbol of globalization the ubiquitous coca-cola logo and mcdonald 's arch , which penetrate the most remote corners of the earth , are globalization 's visible signs , but also powerful symbols of american cultural hegemony . in defense of capitalism and open competition proponents , however , say globalization is about raising the world 's living standards through free trade , even though market economies inevitably create winners and losers . " everyone can benefit from open markets , " said rainer hank , a german book author and journalist who has written extensively on the subject .
" the g8 critics ignore the fact that globalization has triggered significant overall growth in the last 25 years . " the average per person income has doubled in the world since 1980 , and 450 million people have emerged from absolute poverty , which the world bank defines as a daily income of less than two dollars a day . hank pointed out that socialist china and bureaucratic india , which account for one-third of the world 's population , are developing countries where economic growth has boomed due to market reforms , even though the income gap among individuals has widened considerably . " that chinese farmers are poor and entrepreneurs in the big city are rich can hardly be blamed on globalization , " he said . " why should social and economical inequities be unfair ? "
hank recently wrote in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" it 's part and parcel of the human condition . this is not to be confused with the principle that everyone must be equal before the law , but we can not ignore the fact that human beings are not all born with the same potential , nor do they have the same chances in life , because of gender , health , rich or poor parents , or just plain luck . " globalization has left much of africa left behind bildunterschrift : many african countries are unable to enter the global village , because they are grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife hank added that it 's unfortunate that africa is the one continent that has been to a large extent been left behind in the globalization process .
but pledges of aid , aid and more aid are not the solution . " africa is a catastrophe , " he said .
" in the post-colonial era , africa is again the ' white man 's burden . '
development aid is well-intentioned , but makes beggars out of people .
they become dependent , corrupt and it robs them of any initiative . " hank added that europe must do its share in stimulating growth by completely opening up its markets to goods from poor countries . other globalization experts who are free marketeers , such as the world bank 's richard newfarmer , say so many african countries are unable to enter the global village because they are still grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife . although the long-running bloodshed and genocide in places like darfur have reduced sudan to one of the continent 's poorest nations , newfarmer pointed out that kenya , tanzania and botswana have experienced steady growth for the past decade , because those countries have benefited from both development assistance and commerce . the debate is not aid vs. trade , but the need for both " we need to get away from the aid vs. trade approach , " he said .
" both are important .
the question is how to make globalization work for poor people . " if the g8 fulfill their pledges , they will be making an important contribution , " newfarmer added .
" the us and europe spend more on potato chips in a year than they do than on aid to developing countries . " there 's even room for improvement in trade policy , since a further lowering of protective trade barriers across the board would provide africa with more access to world markets , he said . globalization impacts on daily lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : globalization 's impact : women 's rights globalization is not just an economic process , but can positively influence politics and personal lives , according to nayan chanda of the yale center for the study of globalization . " china , india , vietnam , brazil are countries that have improved living standards enormously in a short time , " he said .
" now political changes are coming too , especially in china .
people are protesting more vigorously now , such as dissent over government attempts to block and filter the internet .
economic growth feeds political liberalization . " even the fall of soviet communism and the berlin wall were a consequence of the global impact of television , as those behind the iron curtain realized there could be a better life in other countries , say some experts . traditional family systems , too , are being challenged around the world , as more women work outside the home and stake a claim to greater gender equality .
but there 's room for improvement , according to newfarmer . " opening up the economy means opening up to new ideas , " he said .
" the notion of globalization being good or bad is not terribly meaningful .
the issue is how we can achieve better globalization . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the issue is how to do it better proponents of globalization say that free trade and open markets mean more prosperity for the world 's population .
at issue is how to make globalization work better for poor countries than is the case right now . hardly anyone can dispute the world bank 's utopian motto - " our dream is a world free of poverty . "
the big question is how to achieve such a lofty goal when the g8 summit , hosted by german chancellor angela merkel , kicks off on june 6-8 at the baltic sea resort heiligendamm . should the rich g8 industrial nations pour tens of billions of dollars into development aid programs ? or should they encourage greater economic integration through trade and investment , " globalization " in other words , to help lift the developing world out of poverty ? defining globalization the word " globalization " has gotten a bad rap according to experts , a catch-all term encompassing everything that is bad about go-go capitalism - hedge funds that can crash the world 's entire financial system , asian sweatshops , and wealth disparities , in which a prosperous few condemn the masses to a life of misery . environmentalists , too , have gotten on the bandwagon , denouncing ecological destruction and the perils of greenhouse warming , another focal point of the g8 summit . multinational corporations , meanwhile , are blamed for undermining not just local subsistence economies , but indigenous cultures in africa or latin america as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's - a powerful symbol of globalization the ubiquitous coca-cola logo and mcdonald 's arch , which penetrate the most remote corners of the earth , are globalization 's visible signs , but also powerful symbols of american cultural hegemony . in defense of capitalism and open competition proponents , however , say globalization is about raising the world 's living standards through free trade , even though market economies inevitably create winners and losers . " everyone can benefit from open markets , " said rainer hank , a german book author and journalist who has written extensively on the subject .
" the g8 critics ignore the fact that globalization has triggered significant overall growth in the last 25 years . " the average per person income has doubled in the world since 1980 , and 450 million people have emerged from absolute poverty , which the world bank defines as a daily income of less than two dollars a day . hank pointed out that socialist china and bureaucratic india , which account for one-third of the world 's population , are developing countries where economic growth has boomed due to market reforms , even though the income gap among individuals has widened considerably . " that chinese farmers are poor and entrepreneurs in the big city are rich can hardly be blamed on globalization , " he said . " why should social and economical inequities be unfair ? "
hank recently wrote in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" it 's part and parcel of the human condition . this is not to be confused with the principle that everyone must be equal before the law , but we can not ignore the fact that human beings are not all born with the same potential , nor do they have the same chances in life , because of gender , health , rich or poor parents , or just plain luck . " globalization has left much of africa left behind bildunterschrift : many african countries are unable to enter the global village , because they are grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife hank added that it 's unfortunate that africa is the one continent that has been to a large extent been left behind in the globalization process .
but pledges of aid , aid and more aid are not the solution . " africa is a catastrophe , " he said .
" in the post-colonial era , africa is again the ' white man 's burden . '
development aid is well-intentioned , but makes beggars out of people .
they become dependent , corrupt and it robs them of any initiative . " hank added that europe must do its share in stimulating growth by completely opening up its markets to goods from poor countries . other globalization experts who are free marketeers , such as the world bank 's richard newfarmer , say so many african countries are unable to enter the global village because they are still grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife . although the long-running bloodshed and genocide in places like darfur have reduced sudan to one of the continent 's poorest nations , newfarmer pointed out that kenya , tanzania and botswana have experienced steady growth for the past decade , because those countries have benefited from both development assistance and commerce . the debate is not aid vs. trade , but the need for both " we need to get away from the aid vs. trade approach , " he said .
" both are important .
the question is how to make globalization work for poor people . " if the g8 fulfill their pledges , they will be making an important contribution , " newfarmer added .
" the us and europe spend more on potato chips in a year than they do than on aid to developing countries . " there 's even room for improvement in trade policy , since a further lowering of protective trade barriers across the board would provide africa with more access to world markets , he said . globalization impacts on daily lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : globalization 's impact : women 's rights globalization is not just an economic process , but can positively influence politics and personal lives , according to nayan chanda of the yale center for the study of globalization . " china , india , vietnam , brazil are countries that have improved living standards enormously in a short time , " he said .
" now political changes are coming too , especially in china .
people are protesting more vigorously now , such as dissent over government attempts to block and filter the internet .
economic growth feeds political liberalization . " even the fall of soviet communism and the berlin wall were a consequence of the global impact of television , as those behind the iron curtain realized there could be a better life in other countries , say some experts . traditional family systems , too , are being challenged around the world , as more women work outside the home and stake a claim to greater gender equality .
but there 's room for improvement , according to newfarmer . " opening up the economy means opening up to new ideas , " he said .
" the notion of globalization being good or bad is not terribly meaningful .
the issue is how we can achieve better globalization . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the un continues a campaign to crack down on global political corruption , the german parliament has balked at reforming its own anti-corruption laws . in the kind of case that infuriates anti-corruption campaigners , a long-time member of parliament for the german state of north rhine-westphalia escaped sentencing although he had accepted 95,000 euros -lrb- $ 127,700 -rrb- from a construction company . a regional court in düsseldorf did find that wilhelm droste of the conservative christian democratic union did accept the money but could not decide whether the money was a bribe or a payment for " general good behavior . " after the decision droste referred to the court ’ s decision as " glorious .

in the end , the hoppers created " a mini-mini-earthquake , " according to ulrich grünewald , who produced the segment for a science program on german television .
the ground moved one-twentieth of a millimeter , with four oscillations per second .
scientists from germany ’ s geological research institute measured movement up to a kilometer away . the china question according to grünewald , the idea came about when some of the show ’ s creators began mulling the perennial question , " what would happen if all 1.3 billion chinese jumped off the ground at the same time ? " " we showed that people can not start a -lrb- real -rrb- earthquake by hopping , " grünewald told the dpa news service .
an actual earthquake would contain billions of times more energy than the jumping germans produced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they first tried the experiment with a gymnast " the hardest thing was to get the hopping synchronized , " grünewald noted . the experiment , at the annual open-air music festival held at germany 's nürburgring raceway , was the culmination of a series . previously , the scientists had used smaller control groups and multiplied the results .
first they measured how many oscillations were produced by a gymnast doing a back-handspring and a flip .
then , 47 soccer players were made to bounce on their cleats . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the announcement of the plans in january , after months of quiet discussions with the czech and polish governments , alarmed western europe , mainly over concerns that russian hostility toward the plans will divide the continent .
daniel fried , us assistant secretary of state for europe , has been piling up frequent-flier miles while leading the us effort to persuade europeans that the long-range shield is not directed at russia but instead against iran 's advancing ballistic missile capabilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush will meet with leaders in prague on tuesday us president george w. bush will visit prague on tuesday and warsaw on friday to pitch missile defense while he is in europe for the g8 summit in germany .
" notable shift in european attitudes " based on his numerous trips across the atlantic to meet with lawmakers and diplomats in various european capitals , fried believes his trips have already begun to pay off , noting recently that europe appears to have moved beyond the " primitive political rhetoric that had been thrown around at first . "
" we have seen a notable shift in european attitudes , " fried said .
the united states got a boost when nato tentatively backed the plans after determining at an april conference that the missile defense system posed no threat to russia and would not disrupt the balance of power in europe .
analysts also say that european leaders and politicians have been moving closer to the us position but argue that the initial uproar in europe could have been avoided if nato had been involved from the beginning . dealing directly with the poles and czechs has added to the commonly held belief that bush 's policies are unilateral , said jackson janes , director of the american institute for contemporary german studies at the johns hopkins university in washington .
" bush did n't bring it into the nato forum , " janes said .
" if he did that -lrb- sooner -rrb- he probably could have avoided this whole mess . "
opposition remains among european public the united states still faces considerable challenges trying to locate 10 interceptor missiles in poland and a radar site in the czech republic .
polls show solid opposition remains among europeans , even among poles and czechs , despite the general support of their governments for the missile shield .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pentagon 's missile defense agency said the shield would n't present a health hazard about 2,000 czechs held a protest on may 26 against hosting the radar facility .
bush 's visit to the czech republic coincides with preparations by several czech villages near the planned radar site to hold non-binding referenda on the plans .
many residents near the base fear that the powerful radar system will be a health hazard . the pentagon 's missile defense agency -lrb- mda -rrb- says the health worries are unfounded .
the radar that would go to the czech republic is being relocated from the marshall islands , where it has operated safely in a populated area , said richard lehner , an mda spokesman .
the x-band radar is just a larger version of the same type used in airports and will not be turned on for more than a couple hours a day or for testing , he said .
" it 's not like it goes around in a circle receiving and transmitting all the time , " lehner said in an interview .
" we have been using x-band radars for a very long time . "
resistance in the us the missile defense plans are facing growing resistance at home .
democrats in the house of representatives on may 17 slashed a pentagon request to begin preparing the sites in poland and the czech republic .
the center-left democrats wanted to shift the money to more promising missile defense technologies but are open to replenishing the funds once a formal agreement has been reached with poland and the czech republic .
the pentagon has said that the cuts could disrupt the effort to have the system in place by 2013 , about two years before us intelligence estimates that iran could have a ballistic missile capable of reaching the united states or europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense secretary gates could n't win the support of russian president putin fried , the state department official , said that nobody wants to wake up one day and find that iran has the ability to shoot a nuclear missile at europe .
link between us , european security when pressed during a session with reporters as to why the united states wants to force a missile defense shield on europeans who do n't want it , fried said history shows that us and european security can not be separated .
" we fear that if the united states was protected against , let 's say , an iranian nuclear arsenal , and europe is not , the impact on us would be bad as well , " he said .
fried added that he was confident the europeans would eventually come to the conclusion that missile defense is in their interests .
analysts believe fried 's case has inadvertently been aided by the russians , whose threatening language has hardened the positions of the czech and polish governments as well as conservative circles in western europe .
" that 's a big reason why the czechs and poles want missile defense , " said reginald dale , a fellow at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , " because it bands them closer to the us , in case something happens in moscow .

the announcement of the plans in january , after months of quiet discussions with the czech and polish governments , alarmed western europe , mainly over concerns that russian hostility toward the plans will divide the continent .

"
" we have seen a notable shift in european attitudes , " fried said .
the united states got a boost when nato tentatively backed the plans after determining at an april conference that the missile defense system posed no threat to russia and would not disrupt the balance of power in europe .
analysts also say that european leaders and politicians have been moving closer to the us position but argue that the initial uproar in europe could have been avoided if nato had been involved from the beginning . dealing directly with the poles and czechs has added to the commonly held belief that bush 's policies are unilateral , said jackson janes , director of the american institute for contemporary german studies at the johns hopkins university in washington .

bush 's visit to the czech republic coincides with preparations by several czech villages near the planned radar site to hold non-binding referenda on the plans .
many residents near the base fear that the powerful radar system will be a health hazard . the pentagon 's missile defense agency -lrb- mda -rrb- says the health worries are unfounded .
the radar that would go to the czech republic is being relocated from the marshall islands , where it has operated safely in a populated area , said richard lehner , an mda spokesman .
the x-band radar is just a larger version of the same type used in airports and will not be turned on for more than a couple hours a day or for testing , he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de globalization -pipe- 04.06.2007 experts : globalization improves , does n't worsen peoples ' lives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : globalization has left some poor countries behind .
the issue is how to do it better proponents of globalization say that free trade and open markets mean more prosperity for the world 's population .
at issue is how to make globalization work better for poor countries than is the case right now . hardly anyone can dispute the world bank 's utopian motto - " our dream is a world free of poverty . "
the big question is how to achieve such a lofty goal when the g8 summit , hosted by german chancellor angela merkel , kicks off on june 6-8 at the baltic sea resort heiligendamm . should the rich g8 industrial nations pour tens of billions of dollars into development aid programs ? or should they encourage greater economic integration through trade and investment , " globalization " in other words , to help lift the developing world out of poverty ? defining globalization the word " globalization " has gotten a bad rap according to experts , a catch-all term encompassing everything that is bad about go-go capitalism - hedge funds that can crash the world 's entire financial system , asian sweatshops , and wealth disparities , in which a prosperous few condemn the masses to a life of misery . environmentalists , too , have gotten on the bandwagon , denouncing ecological destruction and the perils of greenhouse warming , another focal point of the g8 summit . multinational corporations , meanwhile , are blamed for undermining not just local subsistence economies , but indigenous cultures in africa or latin america as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's - a powerful symbol of globalization the ubiquitous coca-cola logo and mcdonald 's arch , which penetrate the most remote corners of the earth , are globalization 's visible signs , but also powerful symbols of american cultural hegemony . in defense of capitalism and open competition proponents , however , say globalization is about raising the world 's living standards through free trade , even though market economies inevitably create winners and losers . " everyone can benefit from open markets , " said rainer hank , a german book author and journalist who has written extensively on the subject .
" the g8 critics ignore the fact that globalization has triggered significant overall growth in the last 25 years . " the average per person income has doubled in the world since 1980 , and 450 million people have emerged from absolute poverty , which the world bank defines as a daily income of less than two dollars a day . hank pointed out that socialist china and bureaucratic india , which account for one-third of the world 's population , are developing countries where economic growth has boomed due to market reforms , even though the income gap among individuals has widened considerably . " that chinese farmers are poor and entrepreneurs in the big city are rich can hardly be blamed on globalization , " he said . " why should social and economical inequities be unfair ? "
hank recently wrote in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" it 's part and parcel of the human condition . this is not to be confused with the principle that everyone must be equal before the law , but we can not ignore the fact that human beings are not all born with the same potential , nor do they have the same chances in life , because of gender , health , rich or poor parents , or just plain luck . " globalization has left much of africa left behind bildunterschrift : many african countries are unable to enter the global village , because they are grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife hank added that it 's unfortunate that africa is the one continent that has been to a large extent been left behind in the globalization process .
but pledges of aid , aid and more aid are not the solution . " africa is a catastrophe , " he said .
" in the post-colonial era , africa is again the ' white man 's burden . '
development aid is well-intentioned , but makes beggars out of people .
they become dependent , corrupt and it robs them of any initiative . " hank added that europe must do its share in stimulating growth by completely opening up its markets to goods from poor countries . other globalization experts who are free marketeers , such as the world bank 's richard newfarmer , say so many african countries are unable to enter the global village because they are still grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife . although the long-running bloodshed and genocide in places like darfur have reduced sudan to one of the continent 's poorest nations , newfarmer pointed out that kenya , tanzania and botswana have experienced steady growth for the past decade , because those countries have benefited from both development assistance and commerce . the debate is not aid vs. trade , but the need for both " we need to get away from the aid vs. trade approach , " he said .
" both are important .
the question is how to make globalization work for poor people . " if the g8 fulfill their pledges , they will be making an important contribution , " newfarmer added .
" the us and europe spend more on potato chips in a year than they do than on aid to developing countries . " there 's even room for improvement in trade policy , since a further lowering of protective trade barriers across the board would provide africa with more access to world markets , he said . globalization impacts on daily lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : globalization 's impact : women 's rights globalization is not just an economic process , but can positively influence politics and personal lives , according to nayan chanda of the yale center for the study of globalization . " china , india , vietnam , brazil are countries that have improved living standards enormously in a short time , " he said .
" now political changes are coming too , especially in china .
people are protesting more vigorously now , such as dissent over government attempts to block and filter the internet .
economic growth feeds political liberalization . " even the fall of soviet communism and the berlin wall were a consequence of the global impact of television , as those behind the iron curtain realized there could be a better life in other countries , say some experts . traditional family systems , too , are being challenged around the world , as more women work outside the home and stake a claim to greater gender equality .
but there 's room for improvement , according to newfarmer . " opening up the economy means opening up to new ideas , " he said .
" the notion of globalization being good or bad is not terribly meaningful .
the issue is how we can achieve better globalization . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the announcement of the plans in january , after months of quiet discussions with the czech and polish governments , alarmed western europe , mainly over concerns that russian hostility toward the plans will divide the continent .
daniel fried , us assistant secretary of state for europe , has been piling up frequent-flier miles while leading the us effort to persuade europeans that the long-range shield is not directed at russia but instead against iran 's advancing ballistic missile capabilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush will meet with leaders in prague on tuesday us president george w. bush will visit prague on tuesday and warsaw on friday to pitch missile defense while he is in europe for the g8 summit in germany .
" notable shift in european attitudes " based on his numerous trips across the atlantic to meet with lawmakers and diplomats in various european capitals , fried believes his trips have already begun to pay off , noting recently that europe appears to have moved beyond the " primitive political rhetoric that had been thrown around at first . "
" we have seen a notable shift in european attitudes , " fried said .
the united states got a boost when nato tentatively backed the plans after determining at an april conference that the missile defense system posed no threat to russia and would not disrupt the balance of power in europe .
analysts also say that european leaders and politicians have been moving closer to the us position but argue that the initial uproar in europe could have been avoided if nato had been involved from the beginning . dealing directly with the poles and czechs has added to the commonly held belief that bush 's policies are unilateral , said jackson janes , director of the american institute for contemporary german studies at the johns hopkins university in washington .
" bush did n't bring it into the nato forum , " janes said .
" if he did that -lrb- sooner -rrb- he probably could have avoided this whole mess . "
opposition remains among european public the united states still faces considerable challenges trying to locate 10 interceptor missiles in poland and a radar site in the czech republic .
polls show solid opposition remains among europeans , even among poles and czechs , despite the general support of their governments for the missile shield .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pentagon 's missile defense agency said the shield would n't present a health hazard about 2,000 czechs held a protest on may 26 against hosting the radar facility .
bush 's visit to the czech republic coincides with preparations by several czech villages near the planned radar site to hold non-binding referenda on the plans .
many residents near the base fear that the powerful radar system will be a health hazard . the pentagon 's missile defense agency -lrb- mda -rrb- says the health worries are unfounded .
the radar that would go to the czech republic is being relocated from the marshall islands , where it has operated safely in a populated area , said richard lehner , an mda spokesman .
the x-band radar is just a larger version of the same type used in airports and will not be turned on for more than a couple hours a day or for testing , he said .
" it 's not like it goes around in a circle receiving and transmitting all the time , " lehner said in an interview .
" we have been using x-band radars for a very long time . "
resistance in the us the missile defense plans are facing growing resistance at home .
democrats in the house of representatives on may 17 slashed a pentagon request to begin preparing the sites in poland and the czech republic .
the center-left democrats wanted to shift the money to more promising missile defense technologies but are open to replenishing the funds once a formal agreement has been reached with poland and the czech republic .
the pentagon has said that the cuts could disrupt the effort to have the system in place by 2013 , about two years before us intelligence estimates that iran could have a ballistic missile capable of reaching the united states or europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense secretary gates could n't win the support of russian president putin fried , the state department official , said that nobody wants to wake up one day and find that iran has the ability to shoot a nuclear missile at europe .
link between us , european security when pressed during a session with reporters as to why the united states wants to force a missile defense shield on europeans who do n't want it , fried said history shows that us and european security can not be separated .
" we fear that if the united states was protected against , let 's say , an iranian nuclear arsenal , and europe is not , the impact on us would be bad as well , " he said .
fried added that he was confident the europeans would eventually come to the conclusion that missile defense is in their interests .
analysts believe fried 's case has inadvertently been aided by the russians , whose threatening language has hardened the positions of the czech and polish governments as well as conservative circles in western europe .
" that 's a big reason why the czechs and poles want missile defense , " said reginald dale , a fellow at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , " because it bands them closer to the us , in case something happens in moscow .

the issue is how to do it better proponents of globalization say that free trade and open markets mean more prosperity for the world 's population .
at issue is how to make globalization work better for poor countries than is the case right now . hardly anyone can dispute the world bank 's utopian motto - " our dream is a world free of poverty . "
the big question is how to achieve such a lofty goal when the g8 summit , hosted by german chancellor angela merkel , kicks off on june 6-8 at the baltic sea resort heiligendamm . should the rich g8 industrial nations pour tens of billions of dollars into development aid programs ? or should they encourage greater economic integration through trade and investment , " globalization " in other words , to help lift the developing world out of poverty ? defining globalization the word " globalization " has gotten a bad rap according to experts , a catch-all term encompassing everything that is bad about go-go capitalism - hedge funds that can crash the world 's entire financial system , asian sweatshops , and wealth disparities , in which a prosperous few condemn the masses to a life of misery . environmentalists , too , have gotten on the bandwagon , denouncing ecological destruction and the perils of greenhouse warming , another focal point of the g8 summit . multinational corporations , meanwhile , are blamed for undermining not just local subsistence economies , but indigenous cultures in africa or latin america as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's - a powerful symbol of globalization the ubiquitous coca-cola logo and mcdonald 's arch , which penetrate the most remote corners of the earth , are globalization 's visible signs , but also powerful symbols of american cultural hegemony . in defense of capitalism and open competition proponents , however , say globalization is about raising the world 's living standards through free trade , even though market economies inevitably create winners and losers . " everyone can benefit from open markets , " said rainer hank , a german book author and journalist who has written extensively on the subject .
" the g8 critics ignore the fact that globalization has triggered significant overall growth in the last 25 years . " the average per person income has doubled in the world since 1980 , and 450 million people have emerged from absolute poverty , which the world bank defines as a daily income of less than two dollars a day . hank pointed out that socialist china and bureaucratic india , which account for one-third of the world 's population , are developing countries where economic growth has boomed due to market reforms , even though the income gap among individuals has widened considerably . " that chinese farmers are poor and entrepreneurs in the big city are rich can hardly be blamed on globalization , " he said . " why should social and economical inequities be unfair ? "
hank recently wrote in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" it 's part and parcel of the human condition . this is not to be confused with the principle that everyone must be equal before the law , but we can not ignore the fact that human beings are not all born with the same potential , nor do they have the same chances in life , because of gender , health , rich or poor parents , or just plain luck . " globalization has left much of africa left behind bildunterschrift : many african countries are unable to enter the global village , because they are grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife hank added that it 's unfortunate that africa is the one continent that has been to a large extent been left behind in the globalization process .
but pledges of aid , aid and more aid are not the solution . " africa is a catastrophe , " he said .
" in the post-colonial era , africa is again the ' white man 's burden . '
development aid is well-intentioned , but makes beggars out of people .
they become dependent , corrupt and it robs them of any initiative . " hank added that europe must do its share in stimulating growth by completely opening up its markets to goods from poor countries . other globalization experts who are free marketeers , such as the world bank 's richard newfarmer , say so many african countries are unable to enter the global village because they are still grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife . although the long-running bloodshed and genocide in places like darfur have reduced sudan to one of the continent 's poorest nations , newfarmer pointed out that kenya , tanzania and botswana have experienced steady growth for the past decade , because those countries have benefited from both development assistance and commerce . the debate is not aid vs. trade , but the need for both " we need to get away from the aid vs. trade approach , " he said .
" both are important .
the question is how to make globalization work for poor people . " if the g8 fulfill their pledges , they will be making an important contribution , " newfarmer added .
" the us and europe spend more on potato chips in a year than they do than on aid to developing countries . " there 's even room for improvement in trade policy , since a further lowering of protective trade barriers across the board would provide africa with more access to world markets , he said . globalization impacts on daily lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : globalization 's impact : women 's rights globalization is not just an economic process , but can positively influence politics and personal lives , according to nayan chanda of the yale center for the study of globalization . " china , india , vietnam , brazil are countries that have improved living standards enormously in a short time , " he said .
" now political changes are coming too , especially in china .
people are protesting more vigorously now , such as dissent over government attempts to block and filter the internet .
economic growth feeds political liberalization . " even the fall of soviet communism and the berlin wall were a consequence of the global impact of television , as those behind the iron curtain realized there could be a better life in other countries , say some experts . traditional family systems , too , are being challenged around the world , as more women work outside the home and stake a claim to greater gender equality .
but there 's room for improvement , according to newfarmer . " opening up the economy means opening up to new ideas , " he said .
" the notion of globalization being good or bad is not terribly meaningful .

" the us and europe spend more on potato chips in a year than they do than on aid to developing countries .

" china , india , vietnam , brazil are countries that have improved living standards enormously in a short time , " he said .
" now political changes are coming too , especially in china .
people are protesting more vigorously now , such as dissent over government attempts to block and filter the internet .
economic growth feeds political liberalization . " even the fall of soviet communism and the berlin wall were a consequence of the global impact of television , as those behind the iron curtain realized there could be a better life in other countries , say some experts . traditional family systems , too , are being challenged around the world , as more women work outside the home and stake a claim to greater gender equality .
but there 's room for improvement , according to newfarmer . " opening up the economy means opening up to new ideas , " he said .

dw-world.de spoke with an expert about the globalized car industry . dw-world.de : the vw golf is produced on four continents and sold on six .
is this normal for the global car industry ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the volkswagen golf is the third best-selling car in the world ferdinand dudenhöffer : yes .
what we see is that each of the large car manufacturers has a production facility in the different markets .
that means today being in western europe , the us , in the future increasingly in china , and in eastern europe .
so what we see is that for each platform a car will be produced in different countries .
we do not have an industry in which there is just one big factory which exports its products to all other countries .
in addition , what we see is that the products are not identical in each different market .
it may have the same technical platform , but the design and the options and features differ between countries .
why is that ?
they are different because the demands of customers differ between countries .
for example , in south america , incomes are lower than in western europe and customers need more affordable cars .
in the usa the customers want more space in the car , and that 's an important factor for a car to be successful there .
it is not possible to be in the high volume market and to send the same cars to every market all over the world .
so car makers are researching what their customers want and changing the car for each market ?
yes , they have to do market research and find out the wants of their customers or they will lose out to their competitors .
even though the cars are made in four continents , are the parts coming to these assembly plants from all over the world ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferdinand dudenhöffer is one of germany 's foremost car industry experts more and more we are seeing that the ckd -lrb- completely knocked down -rrb- cars are being produced for some countries in smaller volumes .
that is often the case if there are barriers to exporting cars to particular countries , and they are only being sold in smaller volumes .
with larger markets , with sales of 50,000 or more of a model , they really need their own plant which has its own suppliers of parts .
what is ckd ?
it means completely knocked down .
that means that every part of the car is placed in a transport box and shipped to a country and then what is called a ckd assembly is done .
that means that they open the box and then put the car together in the destination country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 2,000 vw golfs are produced every day around the world why do you think the vw golf is so successful on the world market ?
the most important market for the golf is in western europe and in this market the golf driver is spread across different customer and social groups .
successful sports people and chief executives , as well as students can drive a golf , and each of these groups perceive the golf favourably .
if a student drove a porsche or a mercedes everyone would think this car is too large for them .
if a ceo or a film star drove a small fiat , everyone would say " what is going on ? "
the golf is classless , it 's not specifically tailored to one specific customer group and it does n't exclude anyone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the car to be seen in - whether you 're a student or a star is global production a growing trend in the automotive industry ?
it is a strong growing trend .
if we look at the most successful companies doing global production then you have to look at not just vw but toyota .
toyota has cars , like the auris -lrb- which is the successor of the corolla -rrb- which are distributed and manufactured in north america , western europe , japan and asia .
they have a basic structure of the car and on this platform they manufacture a car which differs a little between each market , to best fulfil customer preferences .
that approach , going to different countries with a production line based on a basic structure with differing designs is one of the most important factors for success in the car industry .
given that the golf is produced all over the world , should we call it a german car or a global car ?
i think in the future we will not see cars as german , or french or italian or whatever .
the brands are what matter .
the golf is vw , and that is more important than saying it is a german car .
the car company and brands are based all over the world and they stand for that brand , not a specific country .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the car to be seen in - whether you 're a student or a star is global production a growing trend in the automotive industry ?
it is a strong growing trend .
if we look at the most successful companies doing global production then you have to look at not just vw but toyota .
toyota has cars , like the auris -lrb- which is the successor of the corolla -rrb- which are distributed and manufactured in north america , western europe , japan and asia .
they have a basic structure of the car and on this platform they manufacture a car which differs a little between each market , to best fulfil customer preferences .
that approach , going to different countries with a production line based on a basic structure with differing designs is one of the most important factors for success in the car industry .
given that the golf is produced all over the world , should we call it a german car or a global car ?
i think in the future we will not see cars as german , or french or italian or whatever .
the brands are what matter .
the golf is vw , and that is more important than saying it is a german car .
the car company and brands are based all over the world and they stand for that brand , not a specific country .

dw-world.de spoke with an expert about the globalized car industry . dw-world.de : the vw golf is produced on four continents and sold on six .
is this normal for the global car industry ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the volkswagen golf is the third best-selling car in the world ferdinand dudenhöffer : yes .
what we see is that each of the large car manufacturers has a production facility in the different markets .
that means today being in western europe , the us , in the future increasingly in china , and in eastern europe .
so what we see is that for each platform a car will be produced in different countries .
we do not have an industry in which there is just one big factory which exports its products to all other countries .
in addition , what we see is that the products are not identical in each different market .
it may have the same technical platform , but the design and the options and features differ between countries .
why is that ?
they are different because the demands of customers differ between countries .
for example , in south america , incomes are lower than in western europe and customers need more affordable cars .
in the usa the customers want more space in the car , and that 's an important factor for a car to be successful there .
it is not possible to be in the high volume market and to send the same cars to every market all over the world .
so car makers are researching what their customers want and changing the car for each market ?
yes , they have to do market research and find out the wants of their customers or they will lose out to their competitors .
even though the cars are made in four continents , are the parts coming to these assembly plants from all over the world ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferdinand dudenhöffer is one of germany 's foremost car industry experts more and more we are seeing that the ckd -lrb- completely knocked down -rrb- cars are being produced for some countries in smaller volumes .
that is often the case if there are barriers to exporting cars to particular countries , and they are only being sold in smaller volumes .
with larger markets , with sales of 50,000 or more of a model , they really need their own plant which has its own suppliers of parts .
what is ckd ?
it means completely knocked down .
that means that every part of the car is placed in a transport box and shipped to a country and then what is called a ckd assembly is done .
that means that they open the box and then put the car together in the destination country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 2,000 vw golfs are produced every day around the world why do you think the vw golf is so successful on the world market ?
the most important market for the golf is in western europe and in this market the golf driver is spread across different customer and social groups .
successful sports people and chief executives , as well as students can drive a golf , and each of these groups perceive the golf favourably .
if a student drove a porsche or a mercedes everyone would think this car is too large for them .
if a ceo or a film star drove a small fiat , everyone would say " what is going on ? "

they have a basic structure of the car and on this platform they manufacture a car which differs a little between each market , to best fulfil customer preferences .
that approach , going to different countries with a production line based on a basic structure with differing designs is one of the most important factors for success in the car industry .
given that the golf is produced all over the world , should we call it a german car or a global car ?
i think in the future we will not see cars as german , or french or italian or whatever .
the brands are what matter .
the golf is vw , and that is more important than saying it is a german car .
the car company and brands are based all over the world and they stand for that brand , not a specific country .

the announcement of the plans in january , after months of quiet discussions with the czech and polish governments , alarmed western europe , mainly over concerns that russian hostility toward the plans will divide the continent .
daniel fried , us assistant secretary of state for europe , has been piling up frequent-flier miles while leading the us effort to persuade europeans that the long-range shield is not directed at russia but instead against iran 's advancing ballistic missile capabilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush will meet with leaders in prague on tuesday us president george w. bush will visit prague on tuesday and warsaw on friday to pitch missile defense while he is in europe for the g8 summit in germany .
" notable shift in european attitudes " based on his numerous trips across the atlantic to meet with lawmakers and diplomats in various european capitals , fried believes his trips have already begun to pay off , noting recently that europe appears to have moved beyond the " primitive political rhetoric that had been thrown around at first . "
" we have seen a notable shift in european attitudes , " fried said .
the united states got a boost when nato tentatively backed the plans after determining at an april conference that the missile defense system posed no threat to russia and would not disrupt the balance of power in europe .
analysts also say that european leaders and politicians have been moving closer to the us position but argue that the initial uproar in europe could have been avoided if nato had been involved from the beginning . dealing directly with the poles and czechs has added to the commonly held belief that bush 's policies are unilateral , said jackson janes , director of the american institute for contemporary german studies at the johns hopkins university in washington .
" bush did n't bring it into the nato forum , " janes said .
" if he did that -lrb- sooner -rrb- he probably could have avoided this whole mess . "
opposition remains among european public the united states still faces considerable challenges trying to locate 10 interceptor missiles in poland and a radar site in the czech republic .
polls show solid opposition remains among europeans , even among poles and czechs , despite the general support of their governments for the missile shield .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pentagon 's missile defense agency said the shield would n't present a health hazard about 2,000 czechs held a protest on may 26 against hosting the radar facility .
bush 's visit to the czech republic coincides with preparations by several czech villages near the planned radar site to hold non-binding referenda on the plans .
many residents near the base fear that the powerful radar system will be a health hazard . the pentagon 's missile defense agency -lrb- mda -rrb- says the health worries are unfounded .
the radar that would go to the czech republic is being relocated from the marshall islands , where it has operated safely in a populated area , said richard lehner , an mda spokesman .
the x-band radar is just a larger version of the same type used in airports and will not be turned on for more than a couple hours a day or for testing , he said .
" it 's not like it goes around in a circle receiving and transmitting all the time , " lehner said in an interview .
" we have been using x-band radars for a very long time . "
resistance in the us the missile defense plans are facing growing resistance at home .
democrats in the house of representatives on may 17 slashed a pentagon request to begin preparing the sites in poland and the czech republic .
the center-left democrats wanted to shift the money to more promising missile defense technologies but are open to replenishing the funds once a formal agreement has been reached with poland and the czech republic .
the pentagon has said that the cuts could disrupt the effort to have the system in place by 2013 , about two years before us intelligence estimates that iran could have a ballistic missile capable of reaching the united states or europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense secretary gates could n't win the support of russian president putin fried , the state department official , said that nobody wants to wake up one day and find that iran has the ability to shoot a nuclear missile at europe .

" we fear that if the united states was protected against , let 's say , an iranian nuclear arsenal , and europe is not , the impact on us would be bad as well , " he said .
fried added that he was confident the europeans would eventually come to the conclusion that missile defense is in their interests .
analysts believe fried 's case has inadvertently been aided by the russians , whose threatening language has hardened the positions of the czech and polish governments as well as conservative circles in western europe .

" if he did that -lrb- sooner -rrb- he probably could have avoided this whole mess . "
opposition remains among european public the united states still faces considerable challenges trying to locate 10 interceptor missiles in poland and a radar site in the czech republic .
polls show solid opposition remains among europeans , even among poles and czechs , despite the general support of their governments for the missile shield .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pentagon 's missile defense agency said the shield would n't present a health hazard about 2,000 czechs held a protest on may 26 against hosting the radar facility .
bush 's visit to the czech republic coincides with preparations by several czech villages near the planned radar site to hold non-binding referenda on the plans .
many residents near the base fear that the powerful radar system will be a health hazard . the pentagon 's missile defense agency -lrb- mda -rrb- says the health worries are unfounded .
the radar that would go to the czech republic is being relocated from the marshall islands , where it has operated safely in a populated area , said richard lehner , an mda spokesman .
the x-band radar is just a larger version of the same type used in airports and will not be turned on for more than a couple hours a day or for testing , he said .
" it 's not like it goes around in a circle receiving and transmitting all the time , " lehner said in an interview .
" we have been using x-band radars for a very long time . "
resistance in the us the missile defense plans are facing growing resistance at home .
democrats in the house of representatives on may 17 slashed a pentagon request to begin preparing the sites in poland and the czech republic .
the center-left democrats wanted to shift the money to more promising missile defense technologies but are open to replenishing the funds once a formal agreement has been reached with poland and the czech republic .
the pentagon has said that the cuts could disrupt the effort to have the system in place by 2013 , about two years before us intelligence estimates that iran could have a ballistic missile capable of reaching the united states or europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense secretary gates could n't win the support of russian president putin fried , the state department official , said that nobody wants to wake up one day and find that iran has the ability to shoot a nuclear missile at europe .
link between us , european security when pressed during a session with reporters as to why the united states wants to force a missile defense shield on europeans who do n't want it , fried said history shows that us and european security can not be separated .
" we fear that if the united states was protected against , let 's say , an iranian nuclear arsenal , and europe is not , the impact on us would be bad as well , " he said .
fried added that he was confident the europeans would eventually come to the conclusion that missile defense is in their interests .
analysts believe fried 's case has inadvertently been aided by the russians , whose threatening language has hardened the positions of the czech and polish governments as well as conservative circles in western europe .
" that 's a big reason why the czechs and poles want missile defense , " said reginald dale , a fellow at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , " because it bands them closer to the us , in case something happens in moscow .

as the un continues a campaign to crack down on global political corruption , the german parliament has balked at reforming its own anti-corruption laws . in the kind of case that infuriates anti-corruption campaigners , a long-time member of parliament for the german state of north rhine-westphalia escaped sentencing although he had accepted 95,000 euros -lrb- $ 127,700 -rrb- from a construction company . a regional court in düsseldorf did find that wilhelm droste of the conservative christian democratic union did accept the money but could not decide whether the money was a bribe or a payment for " general good behavior . " after the decision droste referred to the court ’ s decision as " glorious . " anti-corruption at home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german parliament has a mixed view of corruption the german government has long been involved with various committees fighting corruption in africa and in the business world .
but when it comes to fighting bribery in their own halls , german politicians have avoided enacting tough legislation . in almost every country in the world , the corruption laws governing members of parliament are at least as strict as those that apply to government officials .
not so in germany . a german parliamentarian can only be prosecuted for corruption if it is proven that a bribe was accepted to directly influence a vote , a crime that carries a sentence of up to five years .

the plan supported the rights of developing nations to pursue growth and rejected the idea of binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions . " the international community should respect the rights of the developing countries and allow them enough space for development .
the consequences of inhibiting their development would be far greater than not doing anything to fight climate change , " said ma kai , the minister of china 's key reform and development commission . un wants temperature limit ma implied that wealthy nations - those that have already benefited from emissions-producing industrial booms - are the ones who should take the lead in cutting greenhouse-gas emissions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is second only to the us in terms of greenhouse gases beijing 's plan was released just two days ahead of a meeting of eight leading industrial nations , where global warming is top of the agenda . un experts have warned that limiting global warming to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- is the threshold level to stop the worst impacts of climate change beijing wants further research but while the chinese plan includes a goal of reducing emissions from key pollutants by two percent a year up to 2010 , " our general stance is that china will not commit to any quantified emissions reduction targets , " ma said . " i 'm afraid -lrb- that the benefit of a two-degree threshold -rrb- still lacks a lot of scientific evidence and dependable and feasible research , " ma said .
" there is especially no research that details the economic impact of a two-degree restriction , nor what kind of influence such a target would bring on the development of each nation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing 's building boom is now legendary ma appeared to ignore a may report from the un 's top panel of climate scientists that said annual global economic growth would fall by only 0.12 percentage points if warming was limited to between 2.0-2.4 degrees celsius . g8 to issue statement the un 's international panel on climate change , made up of experts from over 120 nations including china , said nations had the money and the technology to keep global warming to two degrees . the panel said in an earlier report that increases beyond that threshold could unleash catastrophic consequences ranging from an increase in violent storms to severe drought to rising sea levels . ma 's comments were specifically aimed at an eu proposal calling for a limit on global warming this century to two degrees , and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
the european bloc hopes to enshrine the proposal in a summit statement of the g8 meeting in germany this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un warns more global warming could mean natural disaster china is the biggest greenhouse gas emitter after the united states . global warming - just " hysteria " ? meanwhile , former german chancellor helmut schmidt called for an end to the " hysteria " over global warming in the lead-up to the summit .
the topic is " hysterical , overheated , and that is especially because of the media , " schmidt told germany 's bild daily . there has always been climate change on earth , schmidt said . " we 've had warm- and ice-ages for hundreds of thousands of years , " he said , and added that the reasons behind the multiple climate changes have been " inadequately researched for the time being .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 04.06.2007 us in diplomatic push to sell missile defense in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pentagon wants the missile defense system in place by 2013 president bush visits prague and warsaw this week and us officials are racing to win support for the missile defense shield they 're planning to set up in central europe . top us diplomats and military brass have been scrambling around europe in recent months to rally support for plans to deploy a missile defense system to poland and the czech republic .
the announcement of the plans in january , after months of quiet discussions with the czech and polish governments , alarmed western europe , mainly over concerns that russian hostility toward the plans will divide the continent .
daniel fried , us assistant secretary of state for europe , has been piling up frequent-flier miles while leading the us effort to persuade europeans that the long-range shield is not directed at russia but instead against iran 's advancing ballistic missile capabilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush will meet with leaders in prague on tuesday us president george w. bush will visit prague on tuesday and warsaw on friday to pitch missile defense while he is in europe for the g8 summit in germany .
" notable shift in european attitudes " based on his numerous trips across the atlantic to meet with lawmakers and diplomats in various european capitals , fried believes his trips have already begun to pay off , noting recently that europe appears to have moved beyond the " primitive political rhetoric that had been thrown around at first . "
" we have seen a notable shift in european attitudes , " fried said .
the united states got a boost when nato tentatively backed the plans after determining at an april conference that the missile defense system posed no threat to russia and would not disrupt the balance of power in europe .
analysts also say that european leaders and politicians have been moving closer to the us position but argue that the initial uproar in europe could have been avoided if nato had been involved from the beginning . dealing directly with the poles and czechs has added to the commonly held belief that bush 's policies are unilateral , said jackson janes , director of the american institute for contemporary german studies at the johns hopkins university in washington .
" bush did n't bring it into the nato forum , " janes said .
" if he did that -lrb- sooner -rrb- he probably could have avoided this whole mess . "
opposition remains among european public the united states still faces considerable challenges trying to locate 10 interceptor missiles in poland and a radar site in the czech republic .
polls show solid opposition remains among europeans , even among poles and czechs , despite the general support of their governments for the missile shield .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pentagon 's missile defense agency said the shield would n't present a health hazard about 2,000 czechs held a protest on may 26 against hosting the radar facility .
bush 's visit to the czech republic coincides with preparations by several czech villages near the planned radar site to hold non-binding referenda on the plans .
many residents near the base fear that the powerful radar system will be a health hazard . the pentagon 's missile defense agency -lrb- mda -rrb- says the health worries are unfounded .
the radar that would go to the czech republic is being relocated from the marshall islands , where it has operated safely in a populated area , said richard lehner , an mda spokesman .
the x-band radar is just a larger version of the same type used in airports and will not be turned on for more than a couple hours a day or for testing , he said .
" it 's not like it goes around in a circle receiving and transmitting all the time , " lehner said in an interview .
" we have been using x-band radars for a very long time . "
resistance in the us the missile defense plans are facing growing resistance at home .
democrats in the house of representatives on may 17 slashed a pentagon request to begin preparing the sites in poland and the czech republic .
the center-left democrats wanted to shift the money to more promising missile defense technologies but are open to replenishing the funds once a formal agreement has been reached with poland and the czech republic .
the pentagon has said that the cuts could disrupt the effort to have the system in place by 2013 , about two years before us intelligence estimates that iran could have a ballistic missile capable of reaching the united states or europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense secretary gates could n't win the support of russian president putin fried , the state department official , said that nobody wants to wake up one day and find that iran has the ability to shoot a nuclear missile at europe .
link between us , european security when pressed during a session with reporters as to why the united states wants to force a missile defense shield on europeans who do n't want it , fried said history shows that us and european security can not be separated .
" we fear that if the united states was protected against , let 's say , an iranian nuclear arsenal , and europe is not , the impact on us would be bad as well , " he said .
fried added that he was confident the europeans would eventually come to the conclusion that missile defense is in their interests .

analysts also say that european leaders and politicians have been moving closer to the us position but argue that the initial uproar in europe could have been avoided if nato had been involved from the beginning . dealing directly with the poles and czechs has added to the commonly held belief that bush 's policies are unilateral , said jackson janes , director of the american institute for contemporary german studies at the johns hopkins university in washington .
" bush did n't bring it into the nato forum , " janes said .
" if he did that -lrb- sooner -rrb- he probably could have avoided this whole mess . "
opposition remains among european public the united states still faces considerable challenges trying to locate 10 interceptor missiles in poland and a radar site in the czech republic .
polls show solid opposition remains among europeans , even among poles and czechs , despite the general support of their governments for the missile shield .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pentagon 's missile defense agency said the shield would n't present a health hazard about 2,000 czechs held a protest on may 26 against hosting the radar facility .
bush 's visit to the czech republic coincides with preparations by several czech villages near the planned radar site to hold non-binding referenda on the plans .
many residents near the base fear that the powerful radar system will be a health hazard . the pentagon 's missile defense agency -lrb- mda -rrb- says the health worries are unfounded .
the radar that would go to the czech republic is being relocated from the marshall islands , where it has operated safely in a populated area , said richard lehner , an mda spokesman .
the x-band radar is just a larger version of the same type used in airports and will not be turned on for more than a couple hours a day or for testing , he said .
" it 's not like it goes around in a circle receiving and transmitting all the time , " lehner said in an interview .
" we have been using x-band radars for a very long time . "
resistance in the us the missile defense plans are facing growing resistance at home .
democrats in the house of representatives on may 17 slashed a pentagon request to begin preparing the sites in poland and the czech republic .
the center-left democrats wanted to shift the money to more promising missile defense technologies but are open to replenishing the funds once a formal agreement has been reached with poland and the czech republic .
the pentagon has said that the cuts could disrupt the effort to have the system in place by 2013 , about two years before us intelligence estimates that iran could have a ballistic missile capable of reaching the united states or europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense secretary gates could n't win the support of russian president putin fried , the state department official , said that nobody wants to wake up one day and find that iran has the ability to shoot a nuclear missile at europe .
link between us , european security when pressed during a session with reporters as to why the united states wants to force a missile defense shield on europeans who do n't want it , fried said history shows that us and european security can not be separated .
" we fear that if the united states was protected against , let 's say , an iranian nuclear arsenal , and europe is not , the impact on us would be bad as well , " he said .
fried added that he was confident the europeans would eventually come to the conclusion that missile defense is in their interests .
analysts believe fried 's case has inadvertently been aided by the russians , whose threatening language has hardened the positions of the czech and polish governments as well as conservative circles in western europe .
" that 's a big reason why the czechs and poles want missile defense , " said reginald dale , a fellow at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , " because it bands them closer to the us , in case something happens in moscow .

the sculpture should be completed this year . the memorial , to be located in tiergarten park , will stand adjacent to the holocaust memorial built to honor the lives of the 6 million jews killed under the nazi regime . danish-born michael elmgreen and norwegian ingar dragset were selected last year to design the memorial .
their design consists of a large concrete structure with a square opening inside which a film projection will be visible . a new memorial the original plan was to feature a looped video of two men locked in an endless kiss but this plan was dropped after complaints that the film ignored lesbians . like the holocaust memorial , designed by architect peter eisenman , the new monument will have the shape and texture of a concrete slab . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the holocaust memorial 's 2,751 slabs viewed from the air bernd neumann , germany 's culture secretary , made the announcement on monday after meeting with supporters of the memorial . according to a his statement the film will now alternate every two years between a clip of men kissing and a clip of women kissing . “ with the installation of a memorial in the middle of our capital , the resolution by the german government to commemorate the homosexual victims of the nazi regime is realized , ” said neumann in a statement . the statement went on to state that the memorial should be completed by the end of this year .

the plan supported the rights of developing nations to pursue growth and rejected the idea of binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions . " the international community should respect the rights of the developing countries and allow them enough space for development .
the consequences of inhibiting their development would be far greater than not doing anything to fight climate change , " said ma kai , the minister of china 's key reform and development commission . un wants temperature limit ma implied that wealthy nations - those that have already benefited from emissions-producing industrial booms - are the ones who should take the lead in cutting greenhouse-gas emissions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is second only to the us in terms of greenhouse gases beijing 's plan was released just two days ahead of a meeting of eight leading industrial nations , where global warming is top of the agenda . un experts have warned that limiting global warming to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- is the threshold level to stop the worst impacts of climate change beijing wants further research but while the chinese plan includes a goal of reducing emissions from key pollutants by two percent a year up to 2010 , " our general stance is that china will not commit to any quantified emissions reduction targets , " ma said . " i 'm afraid -lrb- that the benefit of a two-degree threshold -rrb- still lacks a lot of scientific evidence and dependable and feasible research , " ma said .
" there is especially no research that details the economic impact of a two-degree restriction , nor what kind of influence such a target would bring on the development of each nation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing 's building boom is now legendary ma appeared to ignore a may report from the un 's top panel of climate scientists that said annual global economic growth would fall by only 0.12 percentage points if warming was limited to between 2.0-2.4 degrees celsius . g8 to issue statement the un 's international panel on climate change , made up of experts from over 120 nations including china , said nations had the money and the technology to keep global warming to two degrees . the panel said in an earlier report that increases beyond that threshold could unleash catastrophic consequences ranging from an increase in violent storms to severe drought to rising sea levels . ma 's comments were specifically aimed at an eu proposal calling for a limit on global warming this century to two degrees , and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
the european bloc hopes to enshrine the proposal in a summit statement of the g8 meeting in germany this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un warns more global warming could mean natural disaster china is the biggest greenhouse gas emitter after the united states . global warming - just " hysteria " ? meanwhile , former german chancellor helmut schmidt called for an end to the " hysteria " over global warming in the lead-up to the summit .
the topic is " hysterical , overheated , and that is especially because of the media , " schmidt told germany 's bild daily . there has always been climate change on earth , schmidt said . " we 've had warm- and ice-ages for hundreds of thousands of years , " he said , and added that the reasons behind the multiple climate changes have been " inadequately researched for the time being .

as the un continues a campaign to crack down on global political corruption , the german parliament has balked at reforming its own anti-corruption laws . in the kind of case that infuriates anti-corruption campaigners , a long-time member of parliament for the german state of north rhine-westphalia escaped sentencing although he had accepted 95,000 euros -lrb- $ 127,700 -rrb- from a construction company . a regional court in düsseldorf did find that wilhelm droste of the conservative christian democratic union did accept the money but could not decide whether the money was a bribe or a payment for " general good behavior . " after the decision droste referred to the court ’ s decision as " glorious . " anti-corruption at home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german parliament has a mixed view of corruption the german government has long been involved with various committees fighting corruption in africa and in the business world .
but when it comes to fighting bribery in their own halls , german politicians have avoided enacting tough legislation . in almost every country in the world , the corruption laws governing members of parliament are at least as strict as those that apply to government officials .
not so in germany . a german parliamentarian can only be prosecuted for corruption if it is proven that a bribe was accepted to directly influence a vote , a crime that carries a sentence of up to five years .
however , the bar is set so high that it is almost impossible to successfully prosecute such cases . in the 13 years since the law has been on the books , only one parliamentarian from the eastern german city of neuruppin has been sentenced . ' no ' to un convention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the un stomp out corruption ?

the plan supported the rights of developing nations to pursue growth and rejected the idea of binding limits on greenhouse gas emissions . " the international community should respect the rights of the developing countries and allow them enough space for development .
the consequences of inhibiting their development would be far greater than not doing anything to fight climate change , " said ma kai , the minister of china 's key reform and development commission . un wants temperature limit ma implied that wealthy nations - those that have already benefited from emissions-producing industrial booms - are the ones who should take the lead in cutting greenhouse-gas emissions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is second only to the us in terms of greenhouse gases beijing 's plan was released just two days ahead of a meeting of eight leading industrial nations , where global warming is top of the agenda . un experts have warned that limiting global warming to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- is the threshold level to stop the worst impacts of climate change beijing wants further research but while the chinese plan includes a goal of reducing emissions from key pollutants by two percent a year up to 2010 , " our general stance is that china will not commit to any quantified emissions reduction targets , " ma said . " i 'm afraid -lrb- that the benefit of a two-degree threshold -rrb- still lacks a lot of scientific evidence and dependable and feasible research , " ma said .
" there is especially no research that details the economic impact of a two-degree restriction , nor what kind of influence such a target would bring on the development of each nation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing 's building boom is now legendary ma appeared to ignore a may report from the un 's top panel of climate scientists that said annual global economic growth would fall by only 0.12 percentage points if warming was limited to between 2.0-2.4 degrees celsius . g8 to issue statement the un 's international panel on climate change , made up of experts from over 120 nations including china , said nations had the money and the technology to keep global warming to two degrees . the panel said in an earlier report that increases beyond that threshold could unleash catastrophic consequences ranging from an increase in violent storms to severe drought to rising sea levels . ma 's comments were specifically aimed at an eu proposal calling for a limit on global warming this century to two degrees , and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
the european bloc hopes to enshrine the proposal in a summit statement of the g8 meeting in germany this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un warns more global warming could mean natural disaster china is the biggest greenhouse gas emitter after the united states . global warming - just " hysteria " ? meanwhile , former german chancellor helmut schmidt called for an end to the " hysteria " over global warming in the lead-up to the summit .
the topic is " hysterical , overheated , and that is especially because of the media , " schmidt told germany 's bild daily . there has always been climate change on earth , schmidt said . " we 've had warm- and ice-ages for hundreds of thousands of years , " he said , and added that the reasons behind the multiple climate changes have been " inadequately researched for the time being .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de defense -pipe- 04.06.2007 us in diplomatic push to sell missile defense in europe großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pentagon wants the missile defense system in place by 2013 president bush visits prague and warsaw this week and us officials are racing to win support for the missile defense shield they 're planning to set up in central europe . top us diplomats and military brass have been scrambling around europe in recent months to rally support for plans to deploy a missile defense system to poland and the czech republic .
the announcement of the plans in january , after months of quiet discussions with the czech and polish governments , alarmed western europe , mainly over concerns that russian hostility toward the plans will divide the continent .
daniel fried , us assistant secretary of state for europe , has been piling up frequent-flier miles while leading the us effort to persuade europeans that the long-range shield is not directed at russia but instead against iran 's advancing ballistic missile capabilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush will meet with leaders in prague on tuesday us president george w. bush will visit prague on tuesday and warsaw on friday to pitch missile defense while he is in europe for the g8 summit in germany .
" notable shift in european attitudes " based on his numerous trips across the atlantic to meet with lawmakers and diplomats in various european capitals , fried believes his trips have already begun to pay off , noting recently that europe appears to have moved beyond the " primitive political rhetoric that had been thrown around at first . "
" we have seen a notable shift in european attitudes , " fried said .
the united states got a boost when nato tentatively backed the plans after determining at an april conference that the missile defense system posed no threat to russia and would not disrupt the balance of power in europe .
analysts also say that european leaders and politicians have been moving closer to the us position but argue that the initial uproar in europe could have been avoided if nato had been involved from the beginning . dealing directly with the poles and czechs has added to the commonly held belief that bush 's policies are unilateral , said jackson janes , director of the american institute for contemporary german studies at the johns hopkins university in washington .
" bush did n't bring it into the nato forum , " janes said .
" if he did that -lrb- sooner -rrb- he probably could have avoided this whole mess . "
opposition remains among european public the united states still faces considerable challenges trying to locate 10 interceptor missiles in poland and a radar site in the czech republic .
polls show solid opposition remains among europeans , even among poles and czechs , despite the general support of their governments for the missile shield .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pentagon 's missile defense agency said the shield would n't present a health hazard about 2,000 czechs held a protest on may 26 against hosting the radar facility .
bush 's visit to the czech republic coincides with preparations by several czech villages near the planned radar site to hold non-binding referenda on the plans .
many residents near the base fear that the powerful radar system will be a health hazard . the pentagon 's missile defense agency -lrb- mda -rrb- says the health worries are unfounded .
the radar that would go to the czech republic is being relocated from the marshall islands , where it has operated safely in a populated area , said richard lehner , an mda spokesman .
the x-band radar is just a larger version of the same type used in airports and will not be turned on for more than a couple hours a day or for testing , he said .
" it 's not like it goes around in a circle receiving and transmitting all the time , " lehner said in an interview .
" we have been using x-band radars for a very long time . "
resistance in the us the missile defense plans are facing growing resistance at home .
democrats in the house of representatives on may 17 slashed a pentagon request to begin preparing the sites in poland and the czech republic .
the center-left democrats wanted to shift the money to more promising missile defense technologies but are open to replenishing the funds once a formal agreement has been reached with poland and the czech republic .
the pentagon has said that the cuts could disrupt the effort to have the system in place by 2013 , about two years before us intelligence estimates that iran could have a ballistic missile capable of reaching the united states or europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense secretary gates could n't win the support of russian president putin fried , the state department official , said that nobody wants to wake up one day and find that iran has the ability to shoot a nuclear missile at europe .
link between us , european security when pressed during a session with reporters as to why the united states wants to force a missile defense shield on europeans who do n't want it , fried said history shows that us and european security can not be separated .
" we fear that if the united states was protected against , let 's say , an iranian nuclear arsenal , and europe is not , the impact on us would be bad as well , " he said .
fried added that he was confident the europeans would eventually come to the conclusion that missile defense is in their interests .
analysts believe fried 's case has inadvertently been aided by the russians , whose threatening language has hardened the positions of the czech and polish governments as well as conservative circles in western europe .
" that 's a big reason why the czechs and poles want missile defense , " said reginald dale , a fellow at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , " because it bands them closer to the us , in case something happens in moscow .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de globalization -pipe- 04.06.2007 experts : globalization improves , does n't worsen peoples ' lives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : globalization has left some poor countries behind .
the issue is how to do it better proponents of globalization say that free trade and open markets mean more prosperity for the world 's population .
at issue is how to make globalization work better for poor countries than is the case right now . hardly anyone can dispute the world bank 's utopian motto - " our dream is a world free of poverty . "
the big question is how to achieve such a lofty goal when the g8 summit , hosted by german chancellor angela merkel , kicks off on june 6-8 at the baltic sea resort heiligendamm . should the rich g8 industrial nations pour tens of billions of dollars into development aid programs ? or should they encourage greater economic integration through trade and investment , " globalization " in other words , to help lift the developing world out of poverty ? defining globalization the word " globalization " has gotten a bad rap according to experts , a catch-all term encompassing everything that is bad about go-go capitalism - hedge funds that can crash the world 's entire financial system , asian sweatshops , and wealth disparities , in which a prosperous few condemn the masses to a life of misery . environmentalists , too , have gotten on the bandwagon , denouncing ecological destruction and the perils of greenhouse warming , another focal point of the g8 summit . multinational corporations , meanwhile , are blamed for undermining not just local subsistence economies , but indigenous cultures in africa or latin america as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's - a powerful symbol of globalization the ubiquitous coca-cola logo and mcdonald 's arch , which penetrate the most remote corners of the earth , are globalization 's visible signs , but also powerful symbols of american cultural hegemony . in defense of capitalism and open competition proponents , however , say globalization is about raising the world 's living standards through free trade , even though market economies inevitably create winners and losers . " everyone can benefit from open markets , " said rainer hank , a german book author and journalist who has written extensively on the subject .
" the g8 critics ignore the fact that globalization has triggered significant overall growth in the last 25 years . " the average per person income has doubled in the world since 1980 , and 450 million people have emerged from absolute poverty , which the world bank defines as a daily income of less than two dollars a day . hank pointed out that socialist china and bureaucratic india , which account for one-third of the world 's population , are developing countries where economic growth has boomed due to market reforms , even though the income gap among individuals has widened considerably . " that chinese farmers are poor and entrepreneurs in the big city are rich can hardly be blamed on globalization , " he said . " why should social and economical inequities be unfair ? "
hank recently wrote in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" it 's part and parcel of the human condition . this is not to be confused with the principle that everyone must be equal before the law , but we can not ignore the fact that human beings are not all born with the same potential , nor do they have the same chances in life , because of gender , health , rich or poor parents , or just plain luck . " globalization has left much of africa left behind bildunterschrift : many african countries are unable to enter the global village , because they are grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife hank added that it 's unfortunate that africa is the one continent that has been to a large extent been left behind in the globalization process .
but pledges of aid , aid and more aid are not the solution . " africa is a catastrophe , " he said .
" in the post-colonial era , africa is again the ' white man 's burden . '
development aid is well-intentioned , but makes beggars out of people .
they become dependent , corrupt and it robs them of any initiative . " hank added that europe must do its share in stimulating growth by completely opening up its markets to goods from poor countries . other globalization experts who are free marketeers , such as the world bank 's richard newfarmer , say so many african countries are unable to enter the global village because they are still grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife . although the long-running bloodshed and genocide in places like darfur have reduced sudan to one of the continent 's poorest nations , newfarmer pointed out that kenya , tanzania and botswana have experienced steady growth for the past decade , because those countries have benefited from both development assistance and commerce . the debate is not aid vs. trade , but the need for both " we need to get away from the aid vs. trade approach , " he said .
" both are important .
the question is how to make globalization work for poor people . " if the g8 fulfill their pledges , they will be making an important contribution , " newfarmer added .
" the us and europe spend more on potato chips in a year than they do than on aid to developing countries . " there 's even room for improvement in trade policy , since a further lowering of protective trade barriers across the board would provide africa with more access to world markets , he said . globalization impacts on daily lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : globalization 's impact : women 's rights globalization is not just an economic process , but can positively influence politics and personal lives , according to nayan chanda of the yale center for the study of globalization . " china , india , vietnam , brazil are countries that have improved living standards enormously in a short time , " he said .
" now political changes are coming too , especially in china .
people are protesting more vigorously now , such as dissent over government attempts to block and filter the internet .
economic growth feeds political liberalization . " even the fall of soviet communism and the berlin wall were a consequence of the global impact of television , as those behind the iron curtain realized there could be a better life in other countries , say some experts . traditional family systems , too , are being challenged around the world , as more women work outside the home and stake a claim to greater gender equality .
but there 's room for improvement , according to newfarmer . " opening up the economy means opening up to new ideas , " he said .
" the notion of globalization being good or bad is not terribly meaningful .
the issue is how we can achieve better globalization . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

as the un continues a campaign to crack down on global political corruption , the german parliament has balked at reforming its own anti-corruption laws . in the kind of case that infuriates anti-corruption campaigners , a long-time member of parliament for the german state of north rhine-westphalia escaped sentencing although he had accepted 95,000 euros -lrb- $ 127,700 -rrb- from a construction company . a regional court in düsseldorf did find that wilhelm droste of the conservative christian democratic union did accept the money but could not decide whether the money was a bribe or a payment for " general good behavior . " after the decision droste referred to the court ’ s decision as " glorious . " anti-corruption at home bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the german parliament has a mixed view of corruption the german government has long been involved with various committees fighting corruption in africa and in the business world .
but when it comes to fighting bribery in their own halls , german politicians have avoided enacting tough legislation . in almost every country in the world , the corruption laws governing members of parliament are at least as strict as those that apply to government officials .
not so in germany . a german parliamentarian can only be prosecuted for corruption if it is proven that a bribe was accepted to directly influence a vote , a crime that carries a sentence of up to five years .
however , the bar is set so high that it is almost impossible to successfully prosecute such cases . in the 13 years since the law has been on the books , only one parliamentarian from the eastern german city of neuruppin has been sentenced . ' no ' to un convention bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : can the un stomp out corruption ?
the united nations convention against corruption -lrb- uncac -rrb- was accepted by the un general assembly in october 2003 . as part of its campaign against corruption in government , the uncac states that " each state party shall endeavor to apply , within its own institutional and legal systems , codes or standards of conduct for the correct , honorable and proper performance of public functions . " the convention has been signed by 140 countries and ratified by 93 including the united states , great britain , france as well as uganda and sri lanka . germany signed the convention in december of 2003 but has since failed to ratify it . a new law ? anti-corruption groups such as transarency international and the association of taxpayers , along with a mix of officials from germany and the european union are now pushing for a new law . in response to highly-publicized bribery scandals at volkswagen and siemens , the german government last month moved to better fight international corruption . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jerzy montag of the german green party however most parliamentarians do not support any move to strengthen the anti-corruption laws governing themselves , arguing that a tightening of the law would hinder their ability to legally interact with lobbyists . " every political party in the government has members who have misgivings and will not participate in any tightening -lrb- of the law -rrb- , " said jerzy montag , a spokesperson for the green party . oliver samson -lrb- ot -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the issue is how to do it better proponents of globalization say that free trade and open markets mean more prosperity for the world 's population .
at issue is how to make globalization work better for poor countries than is the case right now . hardly anyone can dispute the world bank 's utopian motto - " our dream is a world free of poverty . "
the big question is how to achieve such a lofty goal when the g8 summit , hosted by german chancellor angela merkel , kicks off on june 6-8 at the baltic sea resort heiligendamm . should the rich g8 industrial nations pour tens of billions of dollars into development aid programs ? or should they encourage greater economic integration through trade and investment , " globalization " in other words , to help lift the developing world out of poverty ? defining globalization the word " globalization " has gotten a bad rap according to experts , a catch-all term encompassing everything that is bad about go-go capitalism - hedge funds that can crash the world 's entire financial system , asian sweatshops , and wealth disparities , in which a prosperous few condemn the masses to a life of misery . environmentalists , too , have gotten on the bandwagon , denouncing ecological destruction and the perils of greenhouse warming , another focal point of the g8 summit . multinational corporations , meanwhile , are blamed for undermining not just local subsistence economies , but indigenous cultures in africa or latin america as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's - a powerful symbol of globalization the ubiquitous coca-cola logo and mcdonald 's arch , which penetrate the most remote corners of the earth , are globalization 's visible signs , but also powerful symbols of american cultural hegemony . in defense of capitalism and open competition proponents , however , say globalization is about raising the world 's living standards through free trade , even though market economies inevitably create winners and losers . " everyone can benefit from open markets , " said rainer hank , a german book author and journalist who has written extensively on the subject .
" the g8 critics ignore the fact that globalization has triggered significant overall growth in the last 25 years . " the average per person income has doubled in the world since 1980 , and 450 million people have emerged from absolute poverty , which the world bank defines as a daily income of less than two dollars a day . hank pointed out that socialist china and bureaucratic india , which account for one-third of the world 's population , are developing countries where economic growth has boomed due to market reforms , even though the income gap among individuals has widened considerably . " that chinese farmers are poor and entrepreneurs in the big city are rich can hardly be blamed on globalization , " he said . " why should social and economical inequities be unfair ? "
hank recently wrote in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" it 's part and parcel of the human condition . this is not to be confused with the principle that everyone must be equal before the law , but we can not ignore the fact that human beings are not all born with the same potential , nor do they have the same chances in life , because of gender , health , rich or poor parents , or just plain luck . " globalization has left much of africa left behind bildunterschrift : many african countries are unable to enter the global village , because they are grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife hank added that it 's unfortunate that africa is the one continent that has been to a large extent been left behind in the globalization process .
but pledges of aid , aid and more aid are not the solution . " africa is a catastrophe , " he said .
" in the post-colonial era , africa is again the ' white man 's burden . '
development aid is well-intentioned , but makes beggars out of people .
they become dependent , corrupt and it robs them of any initiative . " hank added that europe must do its share in stimulating growth by completely opening up its markets to goods from poor countries . other globalization experts who are free marketeers , such as the world bank 's richard newfarmer , say so many african countries are unable to enter the global village because they are still grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife . although the long-running bloodshed and genocide in places like darfur have reduced sudan to one of the continent 's poorest nations , newfarmer pointed out that kenya , tanzania and botswana have experienced steady growth for the past decade , because those countries have benefited from both development assistance and commerce . the debate is not aid vs. trade , but the need for both " we need to get away from the aid vs. trade approach , " he said .
" both are important .
the question is how to make globalization work for poor people . " if the g8 fulfill their pledges , they will be making an important contribution , " newfarmer added .
" the us and europe spend more on potato chips in a year than they do than on aid to developing countries . " there 's even room for improvement in trade policy , since a further lowering of protective trade barriers across the board would provide africa with more access to world markets , he said . globalization impacts on daily lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : globalization 's impact : women 's rights globalization is not just an economic process , but can positively influence politics and personal lives , according to nayan chanda of the yale center for the study of globalization . " china , india , vietnam , brazil are countries that have improved living standards enormously in a short time , " he said .
" now political changes are coming too , especially in china .
people are protesting more vigorously now , such as dissent over government attempts to block and filter the internet .
economic growth feeds political liberalization . " even the fall of soviet communism and the berlin wall were a consequence of the global impact of television , as those behind the iron curtain realized there could be a better life in other countries , say some experts . traditional family systems , too , are being challenged around the world , as more women work outside the home and stake a claim to greater gender equality .
but there 's room for improvement , according to newfarmer . " opening up the economy means opening up to new ideas , " he said .

" we have to seriously think about whether a de-escalation strategy is still called for , " wolfgang speck , chairman of the german police union -lrb- dpolg -rrb- , said in monday 's edition of the daily oldenburgische volkszeitung .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some demonstrators pelted police with stones police have been accused of provoking the demonstrators , while other say the police were n't proactive enough in quelling the outbreak of violence .
parliamentarian dieter wiefelspütz of the social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- defended the police 's de-escalation strategy in an interview with the berliner zeitung published monday .
" we ca n't pour more gasoline on the fire , " he said .
wiefelspütz was , however , also critical of the police .
" i do n't want to make accusations , but the question has to be asked , whether the police behaved professionally or not , " he told berlins daily tagesspiegel .
germany 's left wing has been particularly critical of the police 's response to saturday 's demonstrations , where 433 of those injured were police officers .
" the state should not allow itself to be provoked to over-reaction during the summit , " green party chairwoman renate künast told parliament .
demonstrators lack violence-prevention plan bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstration leaders have said they ca n't do anything about the violence attac , an organization critical of globalization which was involved in the demonstrations in rostock , apologized for the violent turn the event took .
attac organizer werner rätz told the online version of the frankfurter rundschau that his group did not have a concrete concept of how to deal with violent demonstrators .
law enforcement officials and politicians have urged the peaceful anti-globalization demonstrators to partner with the police and avoid hindering tactics such as peaceful blockades .
one of the problems is that " it 's really difficult to take action against violent demonstrators who hide behind peaceful demonstrators , " said schleswig-holstein 's interior minister ralf stegner -lrb- spd -rrb- .
he told the frankfurter rundschau that he did n't see a viable alternative to the de-escalation strategy .
appeal to lift no-demonstration zone bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : who is provoking who ?
globalization critics called early monday for a last-minute repeal of the no-demonstration zone surrounding the g8 summit meeting place in the resort town of heiligendamm in northern germany .
currently , demonstrations are not allowed within several kilometers of the site .
knut abramowski , the head of the g8 police unit kavala , has said that some 2,000 potentially violent demonstrators are still in rostock , many of whom were among those active on saturday .
" i 'm counting on the worst , " said konrad freiberg of the gdp police union in the daily bild-zeitung of demonstrations expected to surround the g8 summit .

the issue is how to do it better proponents of globalization say that free trade and open markets mean more prosperity for the world 's population .
at issue is how to make globalization work better for poor countries than is the case right now . hardly anyone can dispute the world bank 's utopian motto - " our dream is a world free of poverty . "
the big question is how to achieve such a lofty goal when the g8 summit , hosted by german chancellor angela merkel , kicks off on june 6-8 at the baltic sea resort heiligendamm . should the rich g8 industrial nations pour tens of billions of dollars into development aid programs ? or should they encourage greater economic integration through trade and investment , " globalization " in other words , to help lift the developing world out of poverty ? defining globalization the word " globalization " has gotten a bad rap according to experts , a catch-all term encompassing everything that is bad about go-go capitalism - hedge funds that can crash the world 's entire financial system , asian sweatshops , and wealth disparities , in which a prosperous few condemn the masses to a life of misery . environmentalists , too , have gotten on the bandwagon , denouncing ecological destruction and the perils of greenhouse warming , another focal point of the g8 summit . multinational corporations , meanwhile , are blamed for undermining not just local subsistence economies , but indigenous cultures in africa or latin america as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's - a powerful symbol of globalization the ubiquitous coca-cola logo and mcdonald 's arch , which penetrate the most remote corners of the earth , are globalization 's visible signs , but also powerful symbols of american cultural hegemony . in defense of capitalism and open competition proponents , however , say globalization is about raising the world 's living standards through free trade , even though market economies inevitably create winners and losers . " everyone can benefit from open markets , " said rainer hank , a german book author and journalist who has written extensively on the subject .
" the g8 critics ignore the fact that globalization has triggered significant overall growth in the last 25 years . " the average per person income has doubled in the world since 1980 , and 450 million people have emerged from absolute poverty , which the world bank defines as a daily income of less than two dollars a day . hank pointed out that socialist china and bureaucratic india , which account for one-third of the world 's population , are developing countries where economic growth has boomed due to market reforms , even though the income gap among individuals has widened considerably . " that chinese farmers are poor and entrepreneurs in the big city are rich can hardly be blamed on globalization , " he said . " why should social and economical inequities be unfair ? "
hank recently wrote in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" it 's part and parcel of the human condition . this is not to be confused with the principle that everyone must be equal before the law , but we can not ignore the fact that human beings are not all born with the same potential , nor do they have the same chances in life , because of gender , health , rich or poor parents , or just plain luck . " globalization has left much of africa left behind bildunterschrift : many african countries are unable to enter the global village , because they are grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife hank added that it 's unfortunate that africa is the one continent that has been to a large extent been left behind in the globalization process .
but pledges of aid , aid and more aid are not the solution . " africa is a catastrophe , " he said .
" in the post-colonial era , africa is again the ' white man 's burden . '
development aid is well-intentioned , but makes beggars out of people .
they become dependent , corrupt and it robs them of any initiative . " hank added that europe must do its share in stimulating growth by completely opening up its markets to goods from poor countries . other globalization experts who are free marketeers , such as the world bank 's richard newfarmer , say so many african countries are unable to enter the global village because they are still grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife . although the long-running bloodshed and genocide in places like darfur have reduced sudan to one of the continent 's poorest nations , newfarmer pointed out that kenya , tanzania and botswana have experienced steady growth for the past decade , because those countries have benefited from both development assistance and commerce . the debate is not aid vs. trade , but the need for both " we need to get away from the aid vs. trade approach , " he said .
" both are important .
the question is how to make globalization work for poor people . " if the g8 fulfill their pledges , they will be making an important contribution , " newfarmer added .
" the us and europe spend more on potato chips in a year than they do than on aid to developing countries . " there 's even room for improvement in trade policy , since a further lowering of protective trade barriers across the board would provide africa with more access to world markets , he said . globalization impacts on daily lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : globalization 's impact : women 's rights globalization is not just an economic process , but can positively influence politics and personal lives , according to nayan chanda of the yale center for the study of globalization . " china , india , vietnam , brazil are countries that have improved living standards enormously in a short time , " he said .
" now political changes are coming too , especially in china .
people are protesting more vigorously now , such as dissent over government attempts to block and filter the internet .
economic growth feeds political liberalization . " even the fall of soviet communism and the berlin wall were a consequence of the global impact of television , as those behind the iron curtain realized there could be a better life in other countries , say some experts . traditional family systems , too , are being challenged around the world , as more women work outside the home and stake a claim to greater gender equality .
but there 's room for improvement , according to newfarmer . " opening up the economy means opening up to new ideas , " he said .
" the notion of globalization being good or bad is not terribly meaningful .
the issue is how we can achieve better globalization . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the issue is how to do it better proponents of globalization say that free trade and open markets mean more prosperity for the world 's population .
at issue is how to make globalization work better for poor countries than is the case right now . hardly anyone can dispute the world bank 's utopian motto - " our dream is a world free of poverty . "
the big question is how to achieve such a lofty goal when the g8 summit , hosted by german chancellor angela merkel , kicks off on june 6-8 at the baltic sea resort heiligendamm . should the rich g8 industrial nations pour tens of billions of dollars into development aid programs ? or should they encourage greater economic integration through trade and investment , " globalization " in other words , to help lift the developing world out of poverty ? defining globalization the word " globalization " has gotten a bad rap according to experts , a catch-all term encompassing everything that is bad about go-go capitalism - hedge funds that can crash the world 's entire financial system , asian sweatshops , and wealth disparities , in which a prosperous few condemn the masses to a life of misery . environmentalists , too , have gotten on the bandwagon , denouncing ecological destruction and the perils of greenhouse warming , another focal point of the g8 summit . multinational corporations , meanwhile , are blamed for undermining not just local subsistence economies , but indigenous cultures in africa or latin america as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's - a powerful symbol of globalization the ubiquitous coca-cola logo and mcdonald 's arch , which penetrate the most remote corners of the earth , are globalization 's visible signs , but also powerful symbols of american cultural hegemony . in defense of capitalism and open competition proponents , however , say globalization is about raising the world 's living standards through free trade , even though market economies inevitably create winners and losers . " everyone can benefit from open markets , " said rainer hank , a german book author and journalist who has written extensively on the subject .
" the g8 critics ignore the fact that globalization has triggered significant overall growth in the last 25 years . " the average per person income has doubled in the world since 1980 , and 450 million people have emerged from absolute poverty , which the world bank defines as a daily income of less than two dollars a day . hank pointed out that socialist china and bureaucratic india , which account for one-third of the world 's population , are developing countries where economic growth has boomed due to market reforms , even though the income gap among individuals has widened considerably . " that chinese farmers are poor and entrepreneurs in the big city are rich can hardly be blamed on globalization , " he said . " why should social and economical inequities be unfair ? "
hank recently wrote in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" it 's part and parcel of the human condition . this is not to be confused with the principle that everyone must be equal before the law , but we can not ignore the fact that human beings are not all born with the same potential , nor do they have the same chances in life , because of gender , health , rich or poor parents , or just plain luck . " globalization has left much of africa left behind bildunterschrift : many african countries are unable to enter the global village , because they are grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife hank added that it 's unfortunate that africa is the one continent that has been to a large extent been left behind in the globalization process .
but pledges of aid , aid and more aid are not the solution . " africa is a catastrophe , " he said .
" in the post-colonial era , africa is again the ' white man 's burden . '
development aid is well-intentioned , but makes beggars out of people .
they become dependent , corrupt and it robs them of any initiative . " hank added that europe must do its share in stimulating growth by completely opening up its markets to goods from poor countries . other globalization experts who are free marketeers , such as the world bank 's richard newfarmer , say so many african countries are unable to enter the global village because they are still grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife . although the long-running bloodshed and genocide in places like darfur have reduced sudan to one of the continent 's poorest nations , newfarmer pointed out that kenya , tanzania and botswana have experienced steady growth for the past decade , because those countries have benefited from both development assistance and commerce . the debate is not aid vs. trade , but the need for both " we need to get away from the aid vs. trade approach , " he said .
" both are important .
the question is how to make globalization work for poor people . " if the g8 fulfill their pledges , they will be making an important contribution , " newfarmer added .
" the us and europe spend more on potato chips in a year than they do than on aid to developing countries . " there 's even room for improvement in trade policy , since a further lowering of protective trade barriers across the board would provide africa with more access to world markets , he said . globalization impacts on daily lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : globalization 's impact : women 's rights globalization is not just an economic process , but can positively influence politics and personal lives , according to nayan chanda of the yale center for the study of globalization . " china , india , vietnam , brazil are countries that have improved living standards enormously in a short time , " he said .
" now political changes are coming too , especially in china .
people are protesting more vigorously now , such as dissent over government attempts to block and filter the internet .
economic growth feeds political liberalization . " even the fall of soviet communism and the berlin wall were a consequence of the global impact of television , as those behind the iron curtain realized there could be a better life in other countries , say some experts . traditional family systems , too , are being challenged around the world , as more women work outside the home and stake a claim to greater gender equality .
but there 's room for improvement , according to newfarmer . " opening up the economy means opening up to new ideas , " he said .

the big question is how to achieve such a lofty goal when the g8 summit , hosted by german chancellor angela merkel , kicks off on june 6-8 at the baltic sea resort heiligendamm . should the rich g8 industrial nations pour tens of billions of dollars into development aid programs ? or should they encourage greater economic integration through trade and investment , " globalization " in other words , to help lift the developing world out of poverty ? defining globalization the word " globalization " has gotten a bad rap according to experts , a catch-all term encompassing everything that is bad about go-go capitalism - hedge funds that can crash the world 's entire financial system , asian sweatshops , and wealth disparities , in which a prosperous few condemn the masses to a life of misery . environmentalists , too , have gotten on the bandwagon , denouncing ecological destruction and the perils of greenhouse warming , another focal point of the g8 summit . multinational corporations , meanwhile , are blamed for undermining not just local subsistence economies , but indigenous cultures in africa or latin america as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's - a powerful symbol of globalization the ubiquitous coca-cola logo and mcdonald 's arch , which penetrate the most remote corners of the earth , are globalization 's visible signs , but also powerful symbols of american cultural hegemony . in defense of capitalism and open competition proponents , however , say globalization is about raising the world 's living standards through free trade , even though market economies inevitably create winners and losers . " everyone can benefit from open markets , " said rainer hank , a german book author and journalist who has written extensively on the subject .
" the g8 critics ignore the fact that globalization has triggered significant overall growth in the last 25 years . " the average per person income has doubled in the world since 1980 , and 450 million people have emerged from absolute poverty , which the world bank defines as a daily income of less than two dollars a day . hank pointed out that socialist china and bureaucratic india , which account for one-third of the world 's population , are developing countries where economic growth has boomed due to market reforms , even though the income gap among individuals has widened considerably . " that chinese farmers are poor and entrepreneurs in the big city are rich can hardly be blamed on globalization , " he said . " why should social and economical inequities be unfair ? "
hank recently wrote in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" it 's part and parcel of the human condition . this is not to be confused with the principle that everyone must be equal before the law , but we can not ignore the fact that human beings are not all born with the same potential , nor do they have the same chances in life , because of gender , health , rich or poor parents , or just plain luck . " globalization has left much of africa left behind bildunterschrift : many african countries are unable to enter the global village , because they are grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife hank added that it 's unfortunate that africa is the one continent that has been to a large extent been left behind in the globalization process .
but pledges of aid , aid and more aid are not the solution . " africa is a catastrophe , " he said .
" in the post-colonial era , africa is again the ' white man 's burden . '
development aid is well-intentioned , but makes beggars out of people .
they become dependent , corrupt and it robs them of any initiative . " hank added that europe must do its share in stimulating growth by completely opening up its markets to goods from poor countries . other globalization experts who are free marketeers , such as the world bank 's richard newfarmer , say so many african countries are unable to enter the global village because they are still grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife . although the long-running bloodshed and genocide in places like darfur have reduced sudan to one of the continent 's poorest nations , newfarmer pointed out that kenya , tanzania and botswana have experienced steady growth for the past decade , because those countries have benefited from both development assistance and commerce . the debate is not aid vs. trade , but the need for both " we need to get away from the aid vs. trade approach , " he said .
" both are important .
the question is how to make globalization work for poor people . " if the g8 fulfill their pledges , they will be making an important contribution , " newfarmer added .
" the us and europe spend more on potato chips in a year than they do than on aid to developing countries . " there 's even room for improvement in trade policy , since a further lowering of protective trade barriers across the board would provide africa with more access to world markets , he said . globalization impacts on daily lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : globalization 's impact : women 's rights globalization is not just an economic process , but can positively influence politics and personal lives , according to nayan chanda of the yale center for the study of globalization . " china , india , vietnam , brazil are countries that have improved living standards enormously in a short time , " he said .
" now political changes are coming too , especially in china .
people are protesting more vigorously now , such as dissent over government attempts to block and filter the internet .
economic growth feeds political liberalization . " even the fall of soviet communism and the berlin wall were a consequence of the global impact of television , as those behind the iron curtain realized there could be a better life in other countries , say some experts . traditional family systems , too , are being challenged around the world , as more women work outside the home and stake a claim to greater gender equality .
but there 's room for improvement , according to newfarmer . " opening up the economy means opening up to new ideas , " he said .

the announcement of the plans in january , after months of quiet discussions with the czech and polish governments , alarmed western europe , mainly over concerns that russian hostility toward the plans will divide the continent .
daniel fried , us assistant secretary of state for europe , has been piling up frequent-flier miles while leading the us effort to persuade europeans that the long-range shield is not directed at russia but instead against iran 's advancing ballistic missile capabilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush will meet with leaders in prague on tuesday us president george w. bush will visit prague on tuesday and warsaw on friday to pitch missile defense while he is in europe for the g8 summit in germany .
" notable shift in european attitudes " based on his numerous trips across the atlantic to meet with lawmakers and diplomats in various european capitals , fried believes his trips have already begun to pay off , noting recently that europe appears to have moved beyond the " primitive political rhetoric that had been thrown around at first . "
" we have seen a notable shift in european attitudes , " fried said .
the united states got a boost when nato tentatively backed the plans after determining at an april conference that the missile defense system posed no threat to russia and would not disrupt the balance of power in europe .
analysts also say that european leaders and politicians have been moving closer to the us position but argue that the initial uproar in europe could have been avoided if nato had been involved from the beginning . dealing directly with the poles and czechs has added to the commonly held belief that bush 's policies are unilateral , said jackson janes , director of the american institute for contemporary german studies at the johns hopkins university in washington .
" bush did n't bring it into the nato forum , " janes said .
" if he did that -lrb- sooner -rrb- he probably could have avoided this whole mess . "
opposition remains among european public the united states still faces considerable challenges trying to locate 10 interceptor missiles in poland and a radar site in the czech republic .
polls show solid opposition remains among europeans , even among poles and czechs , despite the general support of their governments for the missile shield .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pentagon 's missile defense agency said the shield would n't present a health hazard about 2,000 czechs held a protest on may 26 against hosting the radar facility .
bush 's visit to the czech republic coincides with preparations by several czech villages near the planned radar site to hold non-binding referenda on the plans .
many residents near the base fear that the powerful radar system will be a health hazard . the pentagon 's missile defense agency -lrb- mda -rrb- says the health worries are unfounded .
the radar that would go to the czech republic is being relocated from the marshall islands , where it has operated safely in a populated area , said richard lehner , an mda spokesman .
the x-band radar is just a larger version of the same type used in airports and will not be turned on for more than a couple hours a day or for testing , he said .
" it 's not like it goes around in a circle receiving and transmitting all the time , " lehner said in an interview .
" we have been using x-band radars for a very long time . "
resistance in the us the missile defense plans are facing growing resistance at home .
democrats in the house of representatives on may 17 slashed a pentagon request to begin preparing the sites in poland and the czech republic .
the center-left democrats wanted to shift the money to more promising missile defense technologies but are open to replenishing the funds once a formal agreement has been reached with poland and the czech republic .
the pentagon has said that the cuts could disrupt the effort to have the system in place by 2013 , about two years before us intelligence estimates that iran could have a ballistic missile capable of reaching the united states or europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense secretary gates could n't win the support of russian president putin fried , the state department official , said that nobody wants to wake up one day and find that iran has the ability to shoot a nuclear missile at europe .
link between us , european security when pressed during a session with reporters as to why the united states wants to force a missile defense shield on europeans who do n't want it , fried said history shows that us and european security can not be separated .
" we fear that if the united states was protected against , let 's say , an iranian nuclear arsenal , and europe is not , the impact on us would be bad as well , " he said .
fried added that he was confident the europeans would eventually come to the conclusion that missile defense is in their interests .
analysts believe fried 's case has inadvertently been aided by the russians , whose threatening language has hardened the positions of the czech and polish governments as well as conservative circles in western europe .
" that 's a big reason why the czechs and poles want missile defense , " said reginald dale , a fellow at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , " because it bands them closer to the us , in case something happens in moscow .

the issue is how to do it better proponents of globalization say that free trade and open markets mean more prosperity for the world 's population .
at issue is how to make globalization work better for poor countries than is the case right now . hardly anyone can dispute the world bank 's utopian motto - " our dream is a world free of poverty . "
the big question is how to achieve such a lofty goal when the g8 summit , hosted by german chancellor angela merkel , kicks off on june 6-8 at the baltic sea resort heiligendamm . should the rich g8 industrial nations pour tens of billions of dollars into development aid programs ? or should they encourage greater economic integration through trade and investment , " globalization " in other words , to help lift the developing world out of poverty ? defining globalization the word " globalization " has gotten a bad rap according to experts , a catch-all term encompassing everything that is bad about go-go capitalism - hedge funds that can crash the world 's entire financial system , asian sweatshops , and wealth disparities , in which a prosperous few condemn the masses to a life of misery . environmentalists , too , have gotten on the bandwagon , denouncing ecological destruction and the perils of greenhouse warming , another focal point of the g8 summit . multinational corporations , meanwhile , are blamed for undermining not just local subsistence economies , but indigenous cultures in africa or latin america as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's - a powerful symbol of globalization the ubiquitous coca-cola logo and mcdonald 's arch , which penetrate the most remote corners of the earth , are globalization 's visible signs , but also powerful symbols of american cultural hegemony . in defense of capitalism and open competition proponents , however , say globalization is about raising the world 's living standards through free trade , even though market economies inevitably create winners and losers . " everyone can benefit from open markets , " said rainer hank , a german book author and journalist who has written extensively on the subject .
" the g8 critics ignore the fact that globalization has triggered significant overall growth in the last 25 years . " the average per person income has doubled in the world since 1980 , and 450 million people have emerged from absolute poverty , which the world bank defines as a daily income of less than two dollars a day . hank pointed out that socialist china and bureaucratic india , which account for one-third of the world 's population , are developing countries where economic growth has boomed due to market reforms , even though the income gap among individuals has widened considerably . " that chinese farmers are poor and entrepreneurs in the big city are rich can hardly be blamed on globalization , " he said . " why should social and economical inequities be unfair ? "
hank recently wrote in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" it 's part and parcel of the human condition . this is not to be confused with the principle that everyone must be equal before the law , but we can not ignore the fact that human beings are not all born with the same potential , nor do they have the same chances in life , because of gender , health , rich or poor parents , or just plain luck . " globalization has left much of africa left behind bildunterschrift : many african countries are unable to enter the global village , because they are grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife hank added that it 's unfortunate that africa is the one continent that has been to a large extent been left behind in the globalization process .
but pledges of aid , aid and more aid are not the solution . " africa is a catastrophe , " he said .
" in the post-colonial era , africa is again the ' white man 's burden . '
development aid is well-intentioned , but makes beggars out of people .
they become dependent , corrupt and it robs them of any initiative . " hank added that europe must do its share in stimulating growth by completely opening up its markets to goods from poor countries . other globalization experts who are free marketeers , such as the world bank 's richard newfarmer , say so many african countries are unable to enter the global village because they are still grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife . although the long-running bloodshed and genocide in places like darfur have reduced sudan to one of the continent 's poorest nations , newfarmer pointed out that kenya , tanzania and botswana have experienced steady growth for the past decade , because those countries have benefited from both development assistance and commerce . the debate is not aid vs. trade , but the need for both " we need to get away from the aid vs. trade approach , " he said .
" both are important .
the question is how to make globalization work for poor people . " if the g8 fulfill their pledges , they will be making an important contribution , " newfarmer added .
" the us and europe spend more on potato chips in a year than they do than on aid to developing countries . " there 's even room for improvement in trade policy , since a further lowering of protective trade barriers across the board would provide africa with more access to world markets , he said . globalization impacts on daily lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : globalization 's impact : women 's rights globalization is not just an economic process , but can positively influence politics and personal lives , according to nayan chanda of the yale center for the study of globalization . " china , india , vietnam , brazil are countries that have improved living standards enormously in a short time , " he said .
" now political changes are coming too , especially in china .
people are protesting more vigorously now , such as dissent over government attempts to block and filter the internet .
economic growth feeds political liberalization . " even the fall of soviet communism and the berlin wall were a consequence of the global impact of television , as those behind the iron curtain realized there could be a better life in other countries , say some experts . traditional family systems , too , are being challenged around the world , as more women work outside the home and stake a claim to greater gender equality .
but there 's room for improvement , according to newfarmer . " opening up the economy means opening up to new ideas , " he said .
" the notion of globalization being good or bad is not terribly meaningful .
the issue is how we can achieve better globalization . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the announcement of the plans in january , after months of quiet discussions with the czech and polish governments , alarmed western europe , mainly over concerns that russian hostility toward the plans will divide the continent .
daniel fried , us assistant secretary of state for europe , has been piling up frequent-flier miles while leading the us effort to persuade europeans that the long-range shield is not directed at russia but instead against iran 's advancing ballistic missile capabilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush will meet with leaders in prague on tuesday us president george w. bush will visit prague on tuesday and warsaw on friday to pitch missile defense while he is in europe for the g8 summit in germany .

"
" we have seen a notable shift in european attitudes , " fried said .
the united states got a boost when nato tentatively backed the plans after determining at an april conference that the missile defense system posed no threat to russia and would not disrupt the balance of power in europe .
analysts also say that european leaders and politicians have been moving closer to the us position but argue that the initial uproar in europe could have been avoided if nato had been involved from the beginning . dealing directly with the poles and czechs has added to the commonly held belief that bush 's policies are unilateral , said jackson janes , director of the american institute for contemporary german studies at the johns hopkins university in washington .

" if he did that -lrb- sooner -rrb- he probably could have avoided this whole mess . "
opposition remains among european public the united states still faces considerable challenges trying to locate 10 interceptor missiles in poland and a radar site in the czech republic .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pentagon 's missile defense agency said the shield would n't present a health hazard about 2,000 czechs held a protest on may 26 against hosting the radar facility .
bush 's visit to the czech republic coincides with preparations by several czech villages near the planned radar site to hold non-binding referenda on the plans .
many residents near the base fear that the powerful radar system will be a health hazard . the pentagon 's missile defense agency -lrb- mda -rrb- says the health worries are unfounded .
the radar that would go to the czech republic is being relocated from the marshall islands , where it has operated safely in a populated area , said richard lehner , an mda spokesman .
the x-band radar is just a larger version of the same type used in airports and will not be turned on for more than a couple hours a day or for testing , he said .
" it 's not like it goes around in a circle receiving and transmitting all the time , " lehner said in an interview .

the announcement of the plans in january , after months of quiet discussions with the czech and polish governments , alarmed western europe , mainly over concerns that russian hostility toward the plans will divide the continent .
daniel fried , us assistant secretary of state for europe , has been piling up frequent-flier miles while leading the us effort to persuade europeans that the long-range shield is not directed at russia but instead against iran 's advancing ballistic missile capabilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush will meet with leaders in prague on tuesday us president george w. bush will visit prague on tuesday and warsaw on friday to pitch missile defense while he is in europe for the g8 summit in germany .
" notable shift in european attitudes " based on his numerous trips across the atlantic to meet with lawmakers and diplomats in various european capitals , fried believes his trips have already begun to pay off , noting recently that europe appears to have moved beyond the " primitive political rhetoric that had been thrown around at first . "
" we have seen a notable shift in european attitudes , " fried said .
the united states got a boost when nato tentatively backed the plans after determining at an april conference that the missile defense system posed no threat to russia and would not disrupt the balance of power in europe .
analysts also say that european leaders and politicians have been moving closer to the us position but argue that the initial uproar in europe could have been avoided if nato had been involved from the beginning . dealing directly with the poles and czechs has added to the commonly held belief that bush 's policies are unilateral , said jackson janes , director of the american institute for contemporary german studies at the johns hopkins university in washington .
" bush did n't bring it into the nato forum , " janes said .
" if he did that -lrb- sooner -rrb- he probably could have avoided this whole mess . "
opposition remains among european public the united states still faces considerable challenges trying to locate 10 interceptor missiles in poland and a radar site in the czech republic .
polls show solid opposition remains among europeans , even among poles and czechs , despite the general support of their governments for the missile shield .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pentagon 's missile defense agency said the shield would n't present a health hazard about 2,000 czechs held a protest on may 26 against hosting the radar facility .
bush 's visit to the czech republic coincides with preparations by several czech villages near the planned radar site to hold non-binding referenda on the plans .
many residents near the base fear that the powerful radar system will be a health hazard . the pentagon 's missile defense agency -lrb- mda -rrb- says the health worries are unfounded .
the radar that would go to the czech republic is being relocated from the marshall islands , where it has operated safely in a populated area , said richard lehner , an mda spokesman .
the x-band radar is just a larger version of the same type used in airports and will not be turned on for more than a couple hours a day or for testing , he said .
" it 's not like it goes around in a circle receiving and transmitting all the time , " lehner said in an interview .
" we have been using x-band radars for a very long time . "
resistance in the us the missile defense plans are facing growing resistance at home .
democrats in the house of representatives on may 17 slashed a pentagon request to begin preparing the sites in poland and the czech republic .
the center-left democrats wanted to shift the money to more promising missile defense technologies but are open to replenishing the funds once a formal agreement has been reached with poland and the czech republic .
the pentagon has said that the cuts could disrupt the effort to have the system in place by 2013 , about two years before us intelligence estimates that iran could have a ballistic missile capable of reaching the united states or europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense secretary gates could n't win the support of russian president putin fried , the state department official , said that nobody wants to wake up one day and find that iran has the ability to shoot a nuclear missile at europe .
link between us , european security when pressed during a session with reporters as to why the united states wants to force a missile defense shield on europeans who do n't want it , fried said history shows that us and european security can not be separated .
" we fear that if the united states was protected against , let 's say , an iranian nuclear arsenal , and europe is not , the impact on us would be bad as well , " he said .
fried added that he was confident the europeans would eventually come to the conclusion that missile defense is in their interests .
analysts believe fried 's case has inadvertently been aided by the russians , whose threatening language has hardened the positions of the czech and polish governments as well as conservative circles in western europe .
" that 's a big reason why the czechs and poles want missile defense , " said reginald dale , a fellow at the center for strategic and international studies in washington , " because it bands them closer to the us , in case something happens in moscow . " dw staff / dpa -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin : we will target europe if us builds missile system russia stepped up the cold war rhetoric on sunday with president vladimir putin warning it would point missiles at europe if the us expands its defenses near its borders .

-lrb- 30.05.2007 -rrb- us and czech republic discuss missile shield us negotiators launched a second round of talks in prague tuesday over the location of a tracking radar station in the czech republic as part of an expanded missile defense shield in europe .

the consequences of inhibiting their development would be far greater than not doing anything to fight climate change , " said ma kai , the minister of china 's key reform and development commission . un wants temperature limit ma implied that wealthy nations - those that have already benefited from emissions-producing industrial booms - are the ones who should take the lead in cutting greenhouse-gas emissions . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china is second only to the us in terms of greenhouse gases beijing 's plan was released just two days ahead of a meeting of eight leading industrial nations , where global warming is top of the agenda . un experts have warned that limiting global warming to two degrees celsius -lrb- 3.6 degrees fahrenheit -rrb- is the threshold level to stop the worst impacts of climate change beijing wants further research but while the chinese plan includes a goal of reducing emissions from key pollutants by two percent a year up to 2010 , " our general stance is that china will not commit to any quantified emissions reduction targets , " ma said . " i 'm afraid -lrb- that the benefit of a two-degree threshold -rrb- still lacks a lot of scientific evidence and dependable and feasible research , " ma said .
" there is especially no research that details the economic impact of a two-degree restriction , nor what kind of influence such a target would bring on the development of each nation . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : beijing 's building boom is now legendary ma appeared to ignore a may report from the un 's top panel of climate scientists that said annual global economic growth would fall by only 0.12 percentage points if warming was limited to between 2.0-2.4 degrees celsius . g8 to issue statement the un 's international panel on climate change , made up of experts from over 120 nations including china , said nations had the money and the technology to keep global warming to two degrees . the panel said in an earlier report that increases beyond that threshold could unleash catastrophic consequences ranging from an increase in violent storms to severe drought to rising sea levels . ma 's comments were specifically aimed at an eu proposal calling for a limit on global warming this century to two degrees , and cutting global greenhouse gas emissions to 50 percent below 1990 levels by 2050 .
the european bloc hopes to enshrine the proposal in a summit statement of the g8 meeting in germany this week . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un warns more global warming could mean natural disaster china is the biggest greenhouse gas emitter after the united states . global warming - just " hysteria " ? meanwhile , former german chancellor helmut schmidt called for an end to the " hysteria " over global warming in the lead-up to the summit .
the topic is " hysterical , overheated , and that is especially because of the media , " schmidt told germany 's bild daily . there has always been climate change on earth , schmidt said . " we 've had warm- and ice-ages for hundreds of thousands of years , " he said , and added that the reasons behind the multiple climate changes have been " inadequately researched for the time being . " to assume that global climate change can be altered by any plans made at the heiligendamm summit is " idiotic , " he said . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the issue is how to do it better proponents of globalization say that free trade and open markets mean more prosperity for the world 's population .
at issue is how to make globalization work better for poor countries than is the case right now . hardly anyone can dispute the world bank 's utopian motto - " our dream is a world free of poverty . "
the big question is how to achieve such a lofty goal when the g8 summit , hosted by german chancellor angela merkel , kicks off on june 6-8 at the baltic sea resort heiligendamm . should the rich g8 industrial nations pour tens of billions of dollars into development aid programs ? or should they encourage greater economic integration through trade and investment , " globalization " in other words , to help lift the developing world out of poverty ? defining globalization the word " globalization " has gotten a bad rap according to experts , a catch-all term encompassing everything that is bad about go-go capitalism - hedge funds that can crash the world 's entire financial system , asian sweatshops , and wealth disparities , in which a prosperous few condemn the masses to a life of misery . environmentalists , too , have gotten on the bandwagon , denouncing ecological destruction and the perils of greenhouse warming , another focal point of the g8 summit . multinational corporations , meanwhile , are blamed for undermining not just local subsistence economies , but indigenous cultures in africa or latin america as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's - a powerful symbol of globalization the ubiquitous coca-cola logo and mcdonald 's arch , which penetrate the most remote corners of the earth , are globalization 's visible signs , but also powerful symbols of american cultural hegemony . in defense of capitalism and open competition proponents , however , say globalization is about raising the world 's living standards through free trade , even though market economies inevitably create winners and losers . " everyone can benefit from open markets , " said rainer hank , a german book author and journalist who has written extensively on the subject .
" the g8 critics ignore the fact that globalization has triggered significant overall growth in the last 25 years . " the average per person income has doubled in the world since 1980 , and 450 million people have emerged from absolute poverty , which the world bank defines as a daily income of less than two dollars a day . hank pointed out that socialist china and bureaucratic india , which account for one-third of the world 's population , are developing countries where economic growth has boomed due to market reforms , even though the income gap among individuals has widened considerably . " that chinese farmers are poor and entrepreneurs in the big city are rich can hardly be blamed on globalization , " he said . " why should social and economical inequities be unfair ? "
hank recently wrote in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" it 's part and parcel of the human condition . this is not to be confused with the principle that everyone must be equal before the law , but we can not ignore the fact that human beings are not all born with the same potential , nor do they have the same chances in life , because of gender , health , rich or poor parents , or just plain luck . " globalization has left much of africa left behind bildunterschrift : many african countries are unable to enter the global village , because they are grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife hank added that it 's unfortunate that africa is the one continent that has been to a large extent been left behind in the globalization process .

" in the post-colonial era , africa is again the ' white man 's burden . '
development aid is well-intentioned , but makes beggars out of people .
they become dependent , corrupt and it robs them of any initiative . " hank added that europe must do its share in stimulating growth by completely opening up its markets to goods from poor countries . other globalization experts who are free marketeers , such as the world bank 's richard newfarmer , say so many african countries are unable to enter the global village because they are still grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife . although the long-running bloodshed and genocide in places like darfur have reduced sudan to one of the continent 's poorest nations , newfarmer pointed out that kenya , tanzania and botswana have experienced steady growth for the past decade , because those countries have benefited from both development assistance and commerce . the debate is not aid vs. trade , but the need for both " we need to get away from the aid vs. trade approach , " he said .
" both are important .
the question is how to make globalization work for poor people . " if the g8 fulfill their pledges , they will be making an important contribution , " newfarmer added .
" the us and europe spend more on potato chips in a year than they do than on aid to developing countries .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de globalization -pipe- 04.06.2007 experts : globalization improves , does n't worsen peoples ' lives großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : globalization has left some poor countries behind .
the issue is how to do it better proponents of globalization say that free trade and open markets mean more prosperity for the world 's population .
at issue is how to make globalization work better for poor countries than is the case right now . hardly anyone can dispute the world bank 's utopian motto - " our dream is a world free of poverty . "
the big question is how to achieve such a lofty goal when the g8 summit , hosted by german chancellor angela merkel , kicks off on june 6-8 at the baltic sea resort heiligendamm . should the rich g8 industrial nations pour tens of billions of dollars into development aid programs ? or should they encourage greater economic integration through trade and investment , " globalization " in other words , to help lift the developing world out of poverty ? defining globalization the word " globalization " has gotten a bad rap according to experts , a catch-all term encompassing everything that is bad about go-go capitalism - hedge funds that can crash the world 's entire financial system , asian sweatshops , and wealth disparities , in which a prosperous few condemn the masses to a life of misery . environmentalists , too , have gotten on the bandwagon , denouncing ecological destruction and the perils of greenhouse warming , another focal point of the g8 summit . multinational corporations , meanwhile , are blamed for undermining not just local subsistence economies , but indigenous cultures in africa or latin america as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's - a powerful symbol of globalization the ubiquitous coca-cola logo and mcdonald 's arch , which penetrate the most remote corners of the earth , are globalization 's visible signs , but also powerful symbols of american cultural hegemony . in defense of capitalism and open competition proponents , however , say globalization is about raising the world 's living standards through free trade , even though market economies inevitably create winners and losers . " everyone can benefit from open markets , " said rainer hank , a german book author and journalist who has written extensively on the subject .
" the g8 critics ignore the fact that globalization has triggered significant overall growth in the last 25 years . " the average per person income has doubled in the world since 1980 , and 450 million people have emerged from absolute poverty , which the world bank defines as a daily income of less than two dollars a day . hank pointed out that socialist china and bureaucratic india , which account for one-third of the world 's population , are developing countries where economic growth has boomed due to market reforms , even though the income gap among individuals has widened considerably . " that chinese farmers are poor and entrepreneurs in the big city are rich can hardly be blamed on globalization , " he said . " why should social and economical inequities be unfair ? "
hank recently wrote in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" it 's part and parcel of the human condition . this is not to be confused with the principle that everyone must be equal before the law , but we can not ignore the fact that human beings are not all born with the same potential , nor do they have the same chances in life , because of gender , health , rich or poor parents , or just plain luck . " globalization has left much of africa left behind bildunterschrift : many african countries are unable to enter the global village , because they are grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife hank added that it 's unfortunate that africa is the one continent that has been to a large extent been left behind in the globalization process .
but pledges of aid , aid and more aid are not the solution . " africa is a catastrophe , " he said .
" in the post-colonial era , africa is again the ' white man 's burden . '
development aid is well-intentioned , but makes beggars out of people .
they become dependent , corrupt and it robs them of any initiative . " hank added that europe must do its share in stimulating growth by completely opening up its markets to goods from poor countries . other globalization experts who are free marketeers , such as the world bank 's richard newfarmer , say so many african countries are unable to enter the global village because they are still grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife . although the long-running bloodshed and genocide in places like darfur have reduced sudan to one of the continent 's poorest nations , newfarmer pointed out that kenya , tanzania and botswana have experienced steady growth for the past decade , because those countries have benefited from both development assistance and commerce . the debate is not aid vs. trade , but the need for both " we need to get away from the aid vs. trade approach , " he said .
" both are important .
the question is how to make globalization work for poor people . " if the g8 fulfill their pledges , they will be making an important contribution , " newfarmer added .
" the us and europe spend more on potato chips in a year than they do than on aid to developing countries . " there 's even room for improvement in trade policy , since a further lowering of protective trade barriers across the board would provide africa with more access to world markets , he said . globalization impacts on daily lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : globalization 's impact : women 's rights globalization is not just an economic process , but can positively influence politics and personal lives , according to nayan chanda of the yale center for the study of globalization . " china , india , vietnam , brazil are countries that have improved living standards enormously in a short time , " he said .
" now political changes are coming too , especially in china .
people are protesting more vigorously now , such as dissent over government attempts to block and filter the internet .
economic growth feeds political liberalization . " even the fall of soviet communism and the berlin wall were a consequence of the global impact of television , as those behind the iron curtain realized there could be a better life in other countries , say some experts . traditional family systems , too , are being challenged around the world , as more women work outside the home and stake a claim to greater gender equality .
but there 's room for improvement , according to newfarmer . " opening up the economy means opening up to new ideas , " he said .
" the notion of globalization being good or bad is not terribly meaningful .
the issue is how we can achieve better globalization . " diana fong send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 04.06.2007 the auto industry goes global großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since 2005 , vw has produced an extra one million golfs , bringing the total to 25 million the vw golf is the best-selling german car of all time : over 2,000 golfs are built every day , on four continents , and sold in more than 150 countries .
dw-world.de spoke with an expert about the globalized car industry . dw-world.de : the vw golf is produced on four continents and sold on six .
is this normal for the global car industry ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the volkswagen golf is the third best-selling car in the world ferdinand dudenhöffer : yes .
what we see is that each of the large car manufacturers has a production facility in the different markets .
that means today being in western europe , the us , in the future increasingly in china , and in eastern europe .
so what we see is that for each platform a car will be produced in different countries .
we do not have an industry in which there is just one big factory which exports its products to all other countries .
in addition , what we see is that the products are not identical in each different market .
it may have the same technical platform , but the design and the options and features differ between countries .
why is that ?
they are different because the demands of customers differ between countries .
for example , in south america , incomes are lower than in western europe and customers need more affordable cars .
in the usa the customers want more space in the car , and that 's an important factor for a car to be successful there .
it is not possible to be in the high volume market and to send the same cars to every market all over the world .
so car makers are researching what their customers want and changing the car for each market ?
yes , they have to do market research and find out the wants of their customers or they will lose out to their competitors .
even though the cars are made in four continents , are the parts coming to these assembly plants from all over the world ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferdinand dudenhöffer is one of germany 's foremost car industry experts more and more we are seeing that the ckd -lrb- completely knocked down -rrb- cars are being produced for some countries in smaller volumes .
that is often the case if there are barriers to exporting cars to particular countries , and they are only being sold in smaller volumes .
with larger markets , with sales of 50,000 or more of a model , they really need their own plant which has its own suppliers of parts .
what is ckd ?
it means completely knocked down .
that means that every part of the car is placed in a transport box and shipped to a country and then what is called a ckd assembly is done .
that means that they open the box and then put the car together in the destination country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 2,000 vw golfs are produced every day around the world why do you think the vw golf is so successful on the world market ?
the most important market for the golf is in western europe and in this market the golf driver is spread across different customer and social groups .
successful sports people and chief executives , as well as students can drive a golf , and each of these groups perceive the golf favourably .
if a student drove a porsche or a mercedes everyone would think this car is too large for them .
if a ceo or a film star drove a small fiat , everyone would say " what is going on ? "
the golf is classless , it 's not specifically tailored to one specific customer group and it does n't exclude anyone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the car to be seen in - whether you 're a student or a star is global production a growing trend in the automotive industry ?
it is a strong growing trend .
if we look at the most successful companies doing global production then you have to look at not just vw but toyota .
toyota has cars , like the auris -lrb- which is the successor of the corolla -rrb- which are distributed and manufactured in north america , western europe , japan and asia .
they have a basic structure of the car and on this platform they manufacture a car which differs a little between each market , to best fulfil customer preferences .
that approach , going to different countries with a production line based on a basic structure with differing designs is one of the most important factors for success in the car industry .
given that the golf is produced all over the world , should we call it a german car or a global car ?
i think in the future we will not see cars as german , or french or italian or whatever .
the brands are what matter .
the golf is vw , and that is more important than saying it is a german car .
the car company and brands are based all over the world and they stand for that brand , not a specific country .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the volkswagen golf is the third best-selling car in the world ferdinand dudenhöffer : yes .
what we see is that each of the large car manufacturers has a production facility in the different markets .
that means today being in western europe , the us , in the future increasingly in china , and in eastern europe .
so what we see is that for each platform a car will be produced in different countries .
we do not have an industry in which there is just one big factory which exports its products to all other countries .
in addition , what we see is that the products are not identical in each different market .
it may have the same technical platform , but the design and the options and features differ between countries .
why is that ?
they are different because the demands of customers differ between countries .
for example , in south america , incomes are lower than in western europe and customers need more affordable cars .
in the usa the customers want more space in the car , and that 's an important factor for a car to be successful there .
it is not possible to be in the high volume market and to send the same cars to every market all over the world .
so car makers are researching what their customers want and changing the car for each market ?
yes , they have to do market research and find out the wants of their customers or they will lose out to their competitors .
even though the cars are made in four continents , are the parts coming to these assembly plants from all over the world ?

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 2,000 vw golfs are produced every day around the world why do you think the vw golf is so successful on the world market ?
the most important market for the golf is in western europe and in this market the golf driver is spread across different customer and social groups .
successful sports people and chief executives , as well as students can drive a golf , and each of these groups perceive the golf favourably .
if a student drove a porsche or a mercedes everyone would think this car is too large for them .
if a ceo or a film star drove a small fiat , everyone would say " what is going on ? "
the golf is classless , it 's not specifically tailored to one specific customer group and it does n't exclude anyone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the car to be seen in - whether you 're a student or a star is global production a growing trend in the automotive industry ?
it is a strong growing trend .
if we look at the most successful companies doing global production then you have to look at not just vw but toyota .
toyota has cars , like the auris -lrb- which is the successor of the corolla -rrb- which are distributed and manufactured in north america , western europe , japan and asia .
they have a basic structure of the car and on this platform they manufacture a car which differs a little between each market , to best fulfil customer preferences .
that approach , going to different countries with a production line based on a basic structure with differing designs is one of the most important factors for success in the car industry .
given that the golf is produced all over the world , should we call it a german car or a global car ?
i think in the future we will not see cars as german , or french or italian or whatever .
the brands are what matter .
the golf is vw , and that is more important than saying it is a german car .
the car company and brands are based all over the world and they stand for that brand , not a specific country .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the volkswagen golf is the third best-selling car in the world ferdinand dudenhöffer : yes .
what we see is that each of the large car manufacturers has a production facility in the different markets .
that means today being in western europe , the us , in the future increasingly in china , and in eastern europe .
so what we see is that for each platform a car will be produced in different countries .
we do not have an industry in which there is just one big factory which exports its products to all other countries .
in addition , what we see is that the products are not identical in each different market .
it may have the same technical platform , but the design and the options and features differ between countries .
why is that ?
they are different because the demands of customers differ between countries .
for example , in south america , incomes are lower than in western europe and customers need more affordable cars .
in the usa the customers want more space in the car , and that 's an important factor for a car to be successful there .
it is not possible to be in the high volume market and to send the same cars to every market all over the world .
so car makers are researching what their customers want and changing the car for each market ?
yes , they have to do market research and find out the wants of their customers or they will lose out to their competitors .
even though the cars are made in four continents , are the parts coming to these assembly plants from all over the world ?

successful sports people and chief executives , as well as students can drive a golf , and each of these groups perceive the golf favourably .
if a student drove a porsche or a mercedes everyone would think this car is too large for them .
if a ceo or a film star drove a small fiat , everyone would say " what is going on ? "
the golf is classless , it 's not specifically tailored to one specific customer group and it does n't exclude anyone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the car to be seen in - whether you 're a student or a star is global production a growing trend in the automotive industry ?
it is a strong growing trend .
if we look at the most successful companies doing global production then you have to look at not just vw but toyota .
toyota has cars , like the auris -lrb- which is the successor of the corolla -rrb- which are distributed and manufactured in north america , western europe , japan and asia .
they have a basic structure of the car and on this platform they manufacture a car which differs a little between each market , to best fulfil customer preferences .
that approach , going to different countries with a production line based on a basic structure with differing designs is one of the most important factors for success in the car industry .
given that the golf is produced all over the world , should we call it a german car or a global car ?
i think in the future we will not see cars as german , or french or italian or whatever .
the brands are what matter .
the golf is vw , and that is more important than saying it is a german car .
the car company and brands are based all over the world and they stand for that brand , not a specific country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 04.06.2007 the auto industry goes global großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : since 2005 , vw has produced an extra one million golfs , bringing the total to 25 million the vw golf is the best-selling german car of all time : over 2,000 golfs are built every day , on four continents , and sold in more than 150 countries .
dw-world.de spoke with an expert about the globalized car industry . dw-world.de : the vw golf is produced on four continents and sold on six .
is this normal for the global car industry ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the volkswagen golf is the third best-selling car in the world ferdinand dudenhöffer : yes .
what we see is that each of the large car manufacturers has a production facility in the different markets .
that means today being in western europe , the us , in the future increasingly in china , and in eastern europe .
so what we see is that for each platform a car will be produced in different countries .
we do not have an industry in which there is just one big factory which exports its products to all other countries .
in addition , what we see is that the products are not identical in each different market .
it may have the same technical platform , but the design and the options and features differ between countries .
why is that ?
they are different because the demands of customers differ between countries .
for example , in south america , incomes are lower than in western europe and customers need more affordable cars .
in the usa the customers want more space in the car , and that 's an important factor for a car to be successful there .
it is not possible to be in the high volume market and to send the same cars to every market all over the world .
so car makers are researching what their customers want and changing the car for each market ?
yes , they have to do market research and find out the wants of their customers or they will lose out to their competitors .
even though the cars are made in four continents , are the parts coming to these assembly plants from all over the world ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferdinand dudenhöffer is one of germany 's foremost car industry experts more and more we are seeing that the ckd -lrb- completely knocked down -rrb- cars are being produced for some countries in smaller volumes .
that is often the case if there are barriers to exporting cars to particular countries , and they are only being sold in smaller volumes .
with larger markets , with sales of 50,000 or more of a model , they really need their own plant which has its own suppliers of parts .
what is ckd ?
it means completely knocked down .
that means that every part of the car is placed in a transport box and shipped to a country and then what is called a ckd assembly is done .
that means that they open the box and then put the car together in the destination country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 2,000 vw golfs are produced every day around the world why do you think the vw golf is so successful on the world market ?
the most important market for the golf is in western europe and in this market the golf driver is spread across different customer and social groups .

the announcement of the plans in january , after months of quiet discussions with the czech and polish governments , alarmed western europe , mainly over concerns that russian hostility toward the plans will divide the continent .
daniel fried , us assistant secretary of state for europe , has been piling up frequent-flier miles while leading the us effort to persuade europeans that the long-range shield is not directed at russia but instead against iran 's advancing ballistic missile capabilities .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush will meet with leaders in prague on tuesday us president george w. bush will visit prague on tuesday and warsaw on friday to pitch missile defense while he is in europe for the g8 summit in germany .
" notable shift in european attitudes " based on his numerous trips across the atlantic to meet with lawmakers and diplomats in various european capitals , fried believes his trips have already begun to pay off , noting recently that europe appears to have moved beyond the " primitive political rhetoric that had been thrown around at first . "
" we have seen a notable shift in european attitudes , " fried said .
the united states got a boost when nato tentatively backed the plans after determining at an april conference that the missile defense system posed no threat to russia and would not disrupt the balance of power in europe .
analysts also say that european leaders and politicians have been moving closer to the us position but argue that the initial uproar in europe could have been avoided if nato had been involved from the beginning . dealing directly with the poles and czechs has added to the commonly held belief that bush 's policies are unilateral , said jackson janes , director of the american institute for contemporary german studies at the johns hopkins university in washington .
" bush did n't bring it into the nato forum , " janes said .
" if he did that -lrb- sooner -rrb- he probably could have avoided this whole mess . "
opposition remains among european public the united states still faces considerable challenges trying to locate 10 interceptor missiles in poland and a radar site in the czech republic .
polls show solid opposition remains among europeans , even among poles and czechs , despite the general support of their governments for the missile shield .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the pentagon 's missile defense agency said the shield would n't present a health hazard about 2,000 czechs held a protest on may 26 against hosting the radar facility .
bush 's visit to the czech republic coincides with preparations by several czech villages near the planned radar site to hold non-binding referenda on the plans .
many residents near the base fear that the powerful radar system will be a health hazard . the pentagon 's missile defense agency -lrb- mda -rrb- says the health worries are unfounded .
the radar that would go to the czech republic is being relocated from the marshall islands , where it has operated safely in a populated area , said richard lehner , an mda spokesman .
the x-band radar is just a larger version of the same type used in airports and will not be turned on for more than a couple hours a day or for testing , he said .
" it 's not like it goes around in a circle receiving and transmitting all the time , " lehner said in an interview .
" we have been using x-band radars for a very long time . "
resistance in the us the missile defense plans are facing growing resistance at home .
democrats in the house of representatives on may 17 slashed a pentagon request to begin preparing the sites in poland and the czech republic .
the center-left democrats wanted to shift the money to more promising missile defense technologies but are open to replenishing the funds once a formal agreement has been reached with poland and the czech republic .
the pentagon has said that the cuts could disrupt the effort to have the system in place by 2013 , about two years before us intelligence estimates that iran could have a ballistic missile capable of reaching the united states or europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us defense secretary gates could n't win the support of russian president putin fried , the state department official , said that nobody wants to wake up one day and find that iran has the ability to shoot a nuclear missile at europe .

fried added that he was confident the europeans would eventually come to the conclusion that missile defense is in their interests .

dw-world.de spoke with an expert about the globalized car industry . dw-world.de : the vw golf is produced on four continents and sold on six .
is this normal for the global car industry ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the volkswagen golf is the third best-selling car in the world ferdinand dudenhöffer : yes .
what we see is that each of the large car manufacturers has a production facility in the different markets .
that means today being in western europe , the us , in the future increasingly in china , and in eastern europe .
so what we see is that for each platform a car will be produced in different countries .
we do not have an industry in which there is just one big factory which exports its products to all other countries .
in addition , what we see is that the products are not identical in each different market .
it may have the same technical platform , but the design and the options and features differ between countries .
why is that ?
they are different because the demands of customers differ between countries .
for example , in south america , incomes are lower than in western europe and customers need more affordable cars .
in the usa the customers want more space in the car , and that 's an important factor for a car to be successful there .
it is not possible to be in the high volume market and to send the same cars to every market all over the world .
so car makers are researching what their customers want and changing the car for each market ?
yes , they have to do market research and find out the wants of their customers or they will lose out to their competitors .
even though the cars are made in four continents , are the parts coming to these assembly plants from all over the world ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferdinand dudenhöffer is one of germany 's foremost car industry experts more and more we are seeing that the ckd -lrb- completely knocked down -rrb- cars are being produced for some countries in smaller volumes .
that is often the case if there are barriers to exporting cars to particular countries , and they are only being sold in smaller volumes .
with larger markets , with sales of 50,000 or more of a model , they really need their own plant which has its own suppliers of parts .
what is ckd ?
it means completely knocked down .
that means that every part of the car is placed in a transport box and shipped to a country and then what is called a ckd assembly is done .
that means that they open the box and then put the car together in the destination country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 2,000 vw golfs are produced every day around the world why do you think the vw golf is so successful on the world market ?
the most important market for the golf is in western europe and in this market the golf driver is spread across different customer and social groups .
successful sports people and chief executives , as well as students can drive a golf , and each of these groups perceive the golf favourably .
if a student drove a porsche or a mercedes everyone would think this car is too large for them .
if a ceo or a film star drove a small fiat , everyone would say " what is going on ? "
the golf is classless , it 's not specifically tailored to one specific customer group and it does n't exclude anyone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the car to be seen in - whether you 're a student or a star is global production a growing trend in the automotive industry ?
it is a strong growing trend .
if we look at the most successful companies doing global production then you have to look at not just vw but toyota .
toyota has cars , like the auris -lrb- which is the successor of the corolla -rrb- which are distributed and manufactured in north america , western europe , japan and asia .
they have a basic structure of the car and on this platform they manufacture a car which differs a little between each market , to best fulfil customer preferences .
that approach , going to different countries with a production line based on a basic structure with differing designs is one of the most important factors for success in the car industry .
given that the golf is produced all over the world , should we call it a german car or a global car ?
i think in the future we will not see cars as german , or french or italian or whatever .
the brands are what matter .
the golf is vw , and that is more important than saying it is a german car .
the car company and brands are based all over the world and they stand for that brand , not a specific country .

dw-world.de spoke with an expert about the globalized car industry . dw-world.de : the vw golf is produced on four continents and sold on six .
is this normal for the global car industry ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the volkswagen golf is the third best-selling car in the world ferdinand dudenhöffer : yes .
what we see is that each of the large car manufacturers has a production facility in the different markets .
that means today being in western europe , the us , in the future increasingly in china , and in eastern europe .
so what we see is that for each platform a car will be produced in different countries .
we do not have an industry in which there is just one big factory which exports its products to all other countries .
in addition , what we see is that the products are not identical in each different market .
it may have the same technical platform , but the design and the options and features differ between countries .
why is that ?
they are different because the demands of customers differ between countries .
for example , in south america , incomes are lower than in western europe and customers need more affordable cars .
in the usa the customers want more space in the car , and that 's an important factor for a car to be successful there .
it is not possible to be in the high volume market and to send the same cars to every market all over the world .
so car makers are researching what their customers want and changing the car for each market ?
yes , they have to do market research and find out the wants of their customers or they will lose out to their competitors .
even though the cars are made in four continents , are the parts coming to these assembly plants from all over the world ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ferdinand dudenhöffer is one of germany 's foremost car industry experts more and more we are seeing that the ckd -lrb- completely knocked down -rrb- cars are being produced for some countries in smaller volumes .
that is often the case if there are barriers to exporting cars to particular countries , and they are only being sold in smaller volumes .
with larger markets , with sales of 50,000 or more of a model , they really need their own plant which has its own suppliers of parts .
what is ckd ?
it means completely knocked down .
that means that every part of the car is placed in a transport box and shipped to a country and then what is called a ckd assembly is done .
that means that they open the box and then put the car together in the destination country .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : over 2,000 vw golfs are produced every day around the world why do you think the vw golf is so successful on the world market ?
the most important market for the golf is in western europe and in this market the golf driver is spread across different customer and social groups .
successful sports people and chief executives , as well as students can drive a golf , and each of these groups perceive the golf favourably .
if a student drove a porsche or a mercedes everyone would think this car is too large for them .
if a ceo or a film star drove a small fiat , everyone would say " what is going on ? "
the golf is classless , it 's not specifically tailored to one specific customer group and it does n't exclude anyone .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the car to be seen in - whether you 're a student or a star is global production a growing trend in the automotive industry ?
it is a strong growing trend .
if we look at the most successful companies doing global production then you have to look at not just vw but toyota .
toyota has cars , like the auris -lrb- which is the successor of the corolla -rrb- which are distributed and manufactured in north america , western europe , japan and asia .
they have a basic structure of the car and on this platform they manufacture a car which differs a little between each market , to best fulfil customer preferences .
that approach , going to different countries with a production line based on a basic structure with differing designs is one of the most important factors for success in the car industry .
given that the golf is produced all over the world , should we call it a german car or a global car ?
i think in the future we will not see cars as german , or french or italian or whatever .
the brands are what matter .
the golf is vw , and that is more important than saying it is a german car .
the car company and brands are based all over the world and they stand for that brand , not a specific country .

in the end , the hoppers created " a mini-mini-earthquake , " according to ulrich grünewald , who produced the segment for a science program on german television .
the ground moved one-twentieth of a millimeter , with four oscillations per second .
scientists from germany ’ s geological research institute measured movement up to a kilometer away . the china question according to grünewald , the idea came about when some of the show ’ s creators began mulling the perennial question , " what would happen if all 1.3 billion chinese jumped off the ground at the same time ? " " we showed that people can not start a -lrb- real -rrb- earthquake by hopping , " grünewald told the dpa news service .
an actual earthquake would contain billions of times more energy than the jumping germans produced . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they first tried the experiment with a gymnast " the hardest thing was to get the hopping synchronized , " grünewald noted . the experiment , at the annual open-air music festival held at germany 's nürburgring raceway , was the culmination of a series . previously , the scientists had used smaller control groups and multiplied the results .
first they measured how many oscillations were produced by a gymnast doing a back-handspring and a flip .
then , 47 soccer players were made to bounce on their cleats . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the issue is how to do it better proponents of globalization say that free trade and open markets mean more prosperity for the world 's population .
at issue is how to make globalization work better for poor countries than is the case right now . hardly anyone can dispute the world bank 's utopian motto - " our dream is a world free of poverty . "
the big question is how to achieve such a lofty goal when the g8 summit , hosted by german chancellor angela merkel , kicks off on june 6-8 at the baltic sea resort heiligendamm . should the rich g8 industrial nations pour tens of billions of dollars into development aid programs ? or should they encourage greater economic integration through trade and investment , " globalization " in other words , to help lift the developing world out of poverty ? defining globalization the word " globalization " has gotten a bad rap according to experts , a catch-all term encompassing everything that is bad about go-go capitalism - hedge funds that can crash the world 's entire financial system , asian sweatshops , and wealth disparities , in which a prosperous few condemn the masses to a life of misery . environmentalists , too , have gotten on the bandwagon , denouncing ecological destruction and the perils of greenhouse warming , another focal point of the g8 summit . multinational corporations , meanwhile , are blamed for undermining not just local subsistence economies , but indigenous cultures in africa or latin america as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mcdonald 's - a powerful symbol of globalization the ubiquitous coca-cola logo and mcdonald 's arch , which penetrate the most remote corners of the earth , are globalization 's visible signs , but also powerful symbols of american cultural hegemony . in defense of capitalism and open competition proponents , however , say globalization is about raising the world 's living standards through free trade , even though market economies inevitably create winners and losers . " everyone can benefit from open markets , " said rainer hank , a german book author and journalist who has written extensively on the subject .
" the g8 critics ignore the fact that globalization has triggered significant overall growth in the last 25 years . " the average per person income has doubled in the world since 1980 , and 450 million people have emerged from absolute poverty , which the world bank defines as a daily income of less than two dollars a day . hank pointed out that socialist china and bureaucratic india , which account for one-third of the world 's population , are developing countries where economic growth has boomed due to market reforms , even though the income gap among individuals has widened considerably . " that chinese farmers are poor and entrepreneurs in the big city are rich can hardly be blamed on globalization , " he said . " why should social and economical inequities be unfair ? "
hank recently wrote in the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung .
" it 's part and parcel of the human condition . this is not to be confused with the principle that everyone must be equal before the law , but we can not ignore the fact that human beings are not all born with the same potential , nor do they have the same chances in life , because of gender , health , rich or poor parents , or just plain luck . " globalization has left much of africa left behind bildunterschrift : many african countries are unable to enter the global village , because they are grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife hank added that it 's unfortunate that africa is the one continent that has been to a large extent been left behind in the globalization process .
but pledges of aid , aid and more aid are not the solution . " africa is a catastrophe , " he said .
" in the post-colonial era , africa is again the ' white man 's burden . '
development aid is well-intentioned , but makes beggars out of people .
they become dependent , corrupt and it robs them of any initiative . " hank added that europe must do its share in stimulating growth by completely opening up its markets to goods from poor countries . other globalization experts who are free marketeers , such as the world bank 's richard newfarmer , say so many african countries are unable to enter the global village because they are still grappling with desperately needed infrastructure and civil strife . although the long-running bloodshed and genocide in places like darfur have reduced sudan to one of the continent 's poorest nations , newfarmer pointed out that kenya , tanzania and botswana have experienced steady growth for the past decade , because those countries have benefited from both development assistance and commerce . the debate is not aid vs. trade , but the need for both " we need to get away from the aid vs. trade approach , " he said .
" both are important .
the question is how to make globalization work for poor people . " if the g8 fulfill their pledges , they will be making an important contribution , " newfarmer added .
" the us and europe spend more on potato chips in a year than they do than on aid to developing countries . " there 's even room for improvement in trade policy , since a further lowering of protective trade barriers across the board would provide africa with more access to world markets , he said . globalization impacts on daily lives bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : globalization 's impact : women 's rights globalization is not just an economic process , but can positively influence politics and personal lives , according to nayan chanda of the yale center for the study of globalization . " china , india , vietnam , brazil are countries that have improved living standards enormously in a short time , " he said .
" now political changes are coming too , especially in china .
people are protesting more vigorously now , such as dissent over government attempts to block and filter the internet .
economic growth feeds political liberalization . " even the fall of soviet communism and the berlin wall were a consequence of the global impact of television , as those behind the iron curtain realized there could be a better life in other countries , say some experts . traditional family systems , too , are being challenged around the world , as more women work outside the home and stake a claim to greater gender equality .
but there 's room for improvement , according to newfarmer . " opening up the economy means opening up to new ideas , " he said .

as a result , there are 25 percent more men than women in some areas - a european record . jobs first , opponents say tiefensee 's plan met with some criticism , however .
the german association of mid-sized businesses called it a " step in the wrong direction " that failed to attack the roots of the problem .
talking to the ddp news agency , the leader of the magdeburg branch of the association , jutta schubert , said the answer is to ensure jobs exist for the people who are already living there .
tiefensee 's first step should be to give businesses incentive to move to or stay in the area , she said .

the bbc middle east editor jeremy bowen , who presented the radio 4 series six days that changed the middle east , here gives his own assessment .
it took only six days for israel to smash the armed forces of egypt , jordan and syria but over the last 40 years , the legacy of the war has shaped the conflict into what it is today .
the war made 250,000 more palestinians - and more than 100,000 syrians - into refugees .
no peace is possible in the middle east without solving their problems .
israel became an occupier .
see a map of land taken by israel during the 1967 war it captured the sinai peninsula and the gaza strip from egypt , the golan heights from syria , and the west bank and east jerusalem from jordan . "
the tail started wagging the dog - now the tail is so strong the dog ca n't move " david rubinger israeli photographer of the six-day war israel had another , very serious , war with syria and egypt in 1973 , but increasingly the main arab thrust against israel came from palestinian groups , led by yasser arafat 's plo .
listen to jeremy bowen 's programmes six days that changed the middle east for palestinians , the lesson of the humiliating defeat suffered by the arab frontline states in 1967 was that no-one else was going to do their fighting for them .
the failure of arab nationalism in 1967 was also a major factor in the early development of political islam .
the mosques began providing the answers to questions that the secular strongmen could not convincingly answer .
spoiling for a fight while historians hold different views on the 1967 war , one school of thought is that it is a myth to suggest the israeli david slew the arab goliath , and that it is more accurate to say there were two goliaths in the middle east .
the arabs , taken together , had big armed forces , but they were not ready for combat . "
we have nothing for israel except war " ahmed said egyptian radio announcer speaking before the war the jewish goliath had never been in better shape , and knew it , or rather its leaders did .
in 1967 israel was a fortress society in a way that it is no longer .
there was no television , and generals and politicians did not leak their business to their favourite journalists as they do today .
israeli civilians , especially in the crisis that led to war , were left to their own fears , which for many people were considerable .
the jewish state was only 19 years old and the youngest survivors of the holocaust were barely in their 20s .
egyptian leader gamal abdul nasser 's radio station voice of the arabs fed their anxieties by broadcasting bloodcurdling threats .
its chief announcer , ahmed said , had the best known voice in the arab world in the 1960s after nasser himself and the legendary diva , umm kulthum .
said was famous for lines like this : " we have nothing for israel except war - comprehensive war ... marching against its gangs , destroying and putting an end to the whole zionist existence ... every one of the 100 million arabs has been living for the past 19 years on one hope - to live to die on the day that israel is liquidated . "
no wonder many israelis and their friends and relations abroad were scared stiff .
reports of what said was saying , and even the broken hebrew of broadcasts beamed directly into israel from cairo , convinced many israeli civilians that if they were facing enemies that were prepared to annihilate them , then they needed to fight , and fight hard .
the problem for the arabs was they believed ahmed said and his colleagues too , and convinced themselves that an easy victory was coming .
the generals ' hour israel 's generals were not taken in .
they all knew that the only way that israel would lose the war would be if the idf did not turn up . "
the israeli generals ... had been training to finish the unfinished business of israel 's independence war of 1948 - the capture of east jerusalem - for most of their careers " so did king hussein of jordan , and most of the egyptian generals - with the exception of the inept and corrupt commander-in-chief , field marshal abd al hakim amer .
the israeli air force destroyed the egyptian air force on the ground on the morning of 5 june 1967 in a surprise attack .
in the next five days israel confirmed the intelligence estimates of the british and the americans .
six weeks earlier , the british cabinet 's joint intelligence committee had concluded that an arab victory was " inconceivable . "
around the same time , the us joint chiefs of staff said israel would be " militarily unchallengeable by any combination of arab states at least during the next five years " .
the israeli generals , hugely self-confident , mainly sabras -lrb- native-born israeli jews -rrb- in their late 30s and early 40s , had been training to finish the unfinished business of israel 's independence war of 1948 - the capture of east jerusalem - for most of their careers .
when their political leaders , most of whom were cautious immigrants at least 20 years older , tried to use diplomacy to end the crisis that led to war , the top brass were beside themselves with frustration .
they believed that delay meant more casualties , and the unnecessary postponement of the inevitable war and inevitable victory for which they had been preparing .
victors nasser 's motives for risking war in 1967 are still debated . "
another explanation is that nasser was prepared to take israel to the brink to reinforce his position as an arab hero " two israeli historians have recently suggested that he was egged on by the soviet union , which wanted egypt to destroy israel 's nuclear weapons programme at dimona .
another explanation is that nasser was prepared to take israel to the brink to reinforce his position as an arab hero .
if it went over the brink , he assumed the superpowers would rescue him and deliver a political victory , as they had in the suez war of 1956 .
when victory came , israeli civilians , who had never been told how strong israel was , believed that they had escaped a terrible fate .
david rubinger , the israeli photographer who took the most iconic pictures of the war , was with idf paratroopers when they captured the western wall , and was swept up in the mood : " we were all crying .
it was n't religious weeping .
it was relief .
we had felt doomed , sentenced to death .
then someone took off the noose and said you 're not just free , you 're king .
it seemed like a miracle . "
the conviction that it was a miracle , that god saved the jewish people and reunited them with their historic homeland in judea and samaria , is still the driving force behind israeli religious nationalism .
when the messianic moment of victory combined with the tendency within zionism to push out the frontier , the result was the settlement movement .
occupiers israel 's reward , apart from victory itself , was a new strategic relationship with the united states .
yet even before the fighting ended , as israel completed its capture of jerusalem and the west bank , president lyndon baines johnson , one of the staunchest friends israel has ever had in the white house , warned that by the time the americans had finished with all the " festering problems " , they were going to " wish the war had never happened " .
four days after the war ended , us secretary of state dean rusk warned that if israel held on to the west bank , palestinians would spend the rest of the century trying to get it back .
forty years on , israel has settled around 450,000 people on land occupied in 1967 , in defiance of almost all countries ' interpretation of international law except its own .
the settlers are protected by all the resources of the state , including the idf , from a rebellious subject people , many of whom believe that ruthless violence targeted at civilians as well as soldiers is a legitimate response to occupation .
for palestinians , the settlements are a catastrophe , made worse every day by the fact that they are expanding fast .
after 40 years as an occupier , israel can no longer count on the international support it had in 1967 .
the settlers see their presence as a national asset , necessity and obligation , but many other israelis , to varying degrees , believe the settlements , and all the other legacies of 1967 that have deepened the conflict with the palestinians , are a national disaster .
" the tail started wagging the dog , " david rubinger complains bitterly .
" now the tail is so strong the dog ca n't move . "
clickable guide to how the war unfolded return to top amendments were made to this article on 15 and 16 april and on 13 october 2009 following findings by the editorial standards committee of the bbc trust , published on 15 april 2009 .
the trust said the language used by jeremy bowen in the article had in some cases not been sufficiently clear and precise to meet the corporation 's standards on accuracy .
it also upheld one complaint and partially upheld another complaint that the article breached guidelines on impartiality .

the bbc middle east editor jeremy bowen , who presented the radio 4 series six days that changed the middle east , here gives his own assessment .
rubinger 's famous photo -lrb- l -rrb- was updated in 2007 by amit shabi enlarge image it took only six days for israel to smash the armed forces of egypt , jordan and syria but over the last 40 years , the legacy of the war has shaped the conflict into what it is today .
the war made 250,000 more palestinians - and more than 100,000 syrians - into refugees .
no peace is possible in the middle east without solving their problems .
israel became an occupier .
see a map of land taken by israel during the 1967 war it captured the sinai peninsula and the gaza strip from egypt , the golan heights from syria , and the west bank and east jerusalem from jordan .
the tail started wagging the dog - now the tail is so strong the dog ca n't move david rubinger israeli photographer of the six-day war israel had another , very serious , war with syria and egypt in 1973 , but increasingly the main arab thrust against israel came from palestinian groups , led by yasser arafat 's plo .
listen to jeremy bowen 's programmes six days that changed the middle east for palestinians , the lesson of the humiliating defeat suffered by the arab frontline states in 1967 was that no-one else was going to do their fighting for them .
the failure of arab nationalism in 1967 was also a major factor in the early development of political islam .
the mosques began providing the answers to questions that the secular strongmen could not convincingly answer .
spoiling for a fight while historians hold different views on the 1967 war , one school of thought is that it is a myth to suggest the israeli david slew the arab goliath , and that it is more accurate to say there were two goliaths in the middle east .
the arabs , taken together , had big armed forces , but they were not ready for combat .
we have nothing for israel except war ahmed said egyptian radio announcer speaking before the war the jewish goliath had never been in better shape , and knew it , or rather its leaders did .
in 1967 israel was a fortress society in a way that it is no longer .
there was no television , and generals and politicians did not leak their business to their favourite journalists as they do today .
israeli civilians , especially in the crisis that led to war , were left to their own fears , which for many people were considerable .
the jewish state was only 19 years old and the youngest survivors of the holocaust were barely in their 20s .
egyptian leader gamal abdul nasser 's radio station voice of the arabs fed their anxieties by broadcasting bloodcurdling threats .
its chief announcer , ahmed said , had the best known voice in the arab world in the 1960s after nasser himself and the legendary diva , umm kulthum .
said was famous for lines like this : " we have nothing for israel except war - comprehensive war ... marching against its gangs , destroying and putting an end to the whole zionist existence ... every one of the 100 million arabs has been living for the past 19 years on one hope - to live to die on the day that israel is liquidated . "
no wonder many israelis and their friends and relations abroad were scared stiff .
reports of what said was saying , and even the broken hebrew of broadcasts beamed directly into israel from cairo , convinced many israeli civilians that if they were facing enemies that were prepared to annihilate them , then they needed to fight , and fight hard .
the problem for the arabs was they believed ahmed said and his colleagues too , and convinced themselves that an easy victory was coming .
the generals ' hour israel 's generals were not taken in .
they all knew that the only way that israel would lose the war would be if the idf did not turn up .
the israeli generals ... had been training to finish the unfinished business of israel 's independence war of 1948 - the capture of east jerusalem - for most of their careers so did king hussein of jordan , and most of the egyptian generals - with the exception of the inept and corrupt commander-in-chief , field marshal abd al hakim amer .
the israeli air force destroyed the egyptian air force on the ground on the morning of 5 june 1967 in a surprise attack .
in the next five days israel confirmed the intelligence estimates of the british and the americans .
six weeks earlier , the british cabinet 's joint intelligence committee had concluded that an arab victory was " inconceivable . "
around the same time , the us joint chiefs of staff said israel would be " militarily unchallengeable by any combination of arab states at least during the next five years " .
the israeli generals , hugely self-confident , mainly sabras -lrb- native-born israeli jews -rrb- in their late 30s and early 40s , had been training to finish the unfinished business of israel 's independence war of 1948 - the capture of east jerusalem - for most of their careers .
when their political leaders , most of whom were cautious immigrants at least 20 years older , tried to use diplomacy to end the crisis that led to war , the top brass were beside themselves with frustration .
they believed that delay meant more casualties , and the unnecessary postponement of the inevitable war and inevitable victory for which they had been preparing .
victors nasser 's motives for risking war in 1967 are still debated .
another explanation is that nasser was prepared to take israel to the brink to reinforce his position as an arab hero two israeli historians have recently suggested that he was egged on by the soviet union , which wanted egypt to destroy israel 's nuclear weapons programme at dimona .
another explanation is that nasser was prepared to take israel to the brink to reinforce his position as an arab hero .

the jewish state was only 19 years old and the youngest survivors of the holocaust were barely in their 20s .
egyptian leader gamal abdul nasser 's radio station voice of the arabs fed their anxieties by broadcasting bloodcurdling threats .

the bbc middle east editor jeremy bowen , who presented the radio 4 series six days that changed the middle east , here gives his own assessment .
rubinger 's famous photo -lrb- l -rrb- was updated in 2007 by amit shabi enlarge image it took only six days for israel to smash the armed forces of egypt , jordan and syria but over the last 40 years , the legacy of the war has shaped the conflict into what it is today .
the war made 250,000 more palestinians - and more than 100,000 syrians - into refugees .
no peace is possible in the middle east without solving their problems .
israel became an occupier .
see a map of land taken by israel during the 1967 war it captured the sinai peninsula and the gaza strip from egypt , the golan heights from syria , and the west bank and east jerusalem from jordan .
the tail started wagging the dog - now the tail is so strong the dog ca n't move david rubinger israeli photographer of the six-day war israel had another , very serious , war with syria and egypt in 1973 , but increasingly the main arab thrust against israel came from palestinian groups , led by yasser arafat 's plo .
listen to jeremy bowen 's programmes six days that changed the middle east for palestinians , the lesson of the humiliating defeat suffered by the arab frontline states in 1967 was that no-one else was going to do their fighting for them .
the failure of arab nationalism in 1967 was also a major factor in the early development of political islam .
the mosques began providing the answers to questions that the secular strongmen could not convincingly answer .
spoiling for a fight while historians hold different views on the 1967 war , one school of thought is that it is a myth to suggest the israeli david slew the arab goliath , and that it is more accurate to say there were two goliaths in the middle east .
the arabs , taken together , had big armed forces , but they were not ready for combat .
we have nothing for israel except war ahmed said egyptian radio announcer speaking before the war the jewish goliath had never been in better shape , and knew it , or rather its leaders did .
in 1967 israel was a fortress society in a way that it is no longer .
there was no television , and generals and politicians did not leak their business to their favourite journalists as they do today .
israeli civilians , especially in the crisis that led to war , were left to their own fears , which for many people were considerable .
the jewish state was only 19 years old and the youngest survivors of the holocaust were barely in their 20s .
egyptian leader gamal abdul nasser 's radio station voice of the arabs fed their anxieties by broadcasting bloodcurdling threats .
its chief announcer , ahmed said , had the best known voice in the arab world in the 1960s after nasser himself and the legendary diva , umm kulthum .
said was famous for lines like this : " we have nothing for israel except war - comprehensive war ... marching against its gangs , destroying and putting an end to the whole zionist existence ... every one of the 100 million arabs has been living for the past 19 years on one hope - to live to die on the day that israel is liquidated . "
no wonder many israelis and their friends and relations abroad were scared stiff .
reports of what said was saying , and even the broken hebrew of broadcasts beamed directly into israel from cairo , convinced many israeli civilians that if they were facing enemies that were prepared to annihilate them , then they needed to fight , and fight hard .
the problem for the arabs was they believed ahmed said and his colleagues too , and convinced themselves that an easy victory was coming .
the generals ' hour israel 's generals were not taken in .
they all knew that the only way that israel would lose the war would be if the idf did not turn up .
the israeli generals ... had been training to finish the unfinished business of israel 's independence war of 1948 - the capture of east jerusalem - for most of their careers so did king hussein of jordan , and most of the egyptian generals - with the exception of the inept and corrupt commander-in-chief , field marshal abd al hakim amer .
the israeli air force destroyed the egyptian air force on the ground on the morning of 5 june 1967 in a surprise attack .
in the next five days israel confirmed the intelligence estimates of the british and the americans .
six weeks earlier , the british cabinet 's joint intelligence committee had concluded that an arab victory was " inconceivable . "
around the same time , the us joint chiefs of staff said israel would be " militarily unchallengeable by any combination of arab states at least during the next five years " .
the israeli generals , hugely self-confident , mainly sabras -lrb- native-born israeli jews -rrb- in their late 30s and early 40s , had been training to finish the unfinished business of israel 's independence war of 1948 - the capture of east jerusalem - for most of their careers .
when their political leaders , most of whom were cautious immigrants at least 20 years older , tried to use diplomacy to end the crisis that led to war , the top brass were beside themselves with frustration .
they believed that delay meant more casualties , and the unnecessary postponement of the inevitable war and inevitable victory for which they had been preparing .
victors nasser 's motives for risking war in 1967 are still debated .
another explanation is that nasser was prepared to take israel to the brink to reinforce his position as an arab hero two israeli historians have recently suggested that he was egged on by the soviet union , which wanted egypt to destroy israel 's nuclear weapons programme at dimona .
another explanation is that nasser was prepared to take israel to the brink to reinforce his position as an arab hero .
if it went over the brink , he assumed the superpowers would rescue him and deliver a political victory , as they had in the suez war of 1956 .
when victory came , israeli civilians , who had never been told how strong israel was , believed that they had escaped a terrible fate .
david rubinger , the israeli photographer who took the most iconic pictures of the war , was with idf paratroopers when they captured the western wall , and was swept up in the mood : " we were all crying .
it was n't religious weeping .
it was relief .
we had felt doomed , sentenced to death .
then someone took off the noose and said you 're not just free , you 're king .
it seemed like a miracle . "
the conviction that it was a miracle , that god saved the jewish people and reunited them with their historic homeland in judea and samaria , is still the driving force behind israeli religious nationalism .
when the messianic moment of victory combined with the tendency within zionism to push out the frontier , the result was the settlement movement .
occupiers israel 's reward , apart from victory itself , was a new strategic relationship with the united states .
nearly half a million jews have settled in the west bank since 1967 yet even before the fighting ended , as israel completed its capture of jerusalem and the west bank , president lyndon baines johnson , one of the staunchest friends israel has ever had in the white house , warned that by the time the americans had finished with all the " festering problems " , they were going to " wish the war had never happened " .
four days after the war ended , us secretary of state dean rusk warned that if israel held on to the west bank , palestinians would spend the rest of the century trying to get it back .
forty years on , israel has settled around 450,000 people on land occupied in 1967 , in defiance of almost all countries ' interpretation of international law except its own .
the settlers are protected by all the resources of the state , including the idf , from a rebellious subject people , many of whom believe that ruthless violence targeted at civilians as well as soldiers is a legitimate response to occupation .
for palestinians , the settlements are a catastrophe , made worse every day by the fact that they are expanding fast .
after 40 years as an occupier , israel can no longer count on the international support it had in 1967 .
the settlers see their presence as a national asset , necessity and obligation , but many other israelis , to varying degrees , believe the settlements , and all the other legacies of 1967 that have deepened the conflict with the palestinians , are a national disaster .
" the tail started wagging the dog , " david rubinger complains bitterly .
" now the tail is so strong the dog ca n't move . "
clickable guide to how the war unfolded return to top amendments were made to this article on 15 and 16 april and on 13 october 2009 following findings by the editorial standards committee of the bbc trust , published on 15 april 2009 .
the trust said the language used by jeremy bowen in the article had in some cases not been sufficiently clear and precise to meet the corporation 's standards on accuracy .
it also upheld one complaint and partially upheld another complaint that the article breached guidelines on impartiality .

dr barry morgan said the third assembly term begins with a " tortuous and convoluted " system of legislating which does not go far enough .
the queen will officially open the senedd on tuesday .
the assembly government said archbishop morgan was entitled to his opinion on the 2006 government of wales act .
assembly members have been given new powers to make their own laws .
the legislation also provided for an eventual move to full law-making powers but only after a referendum .
but archbishop morgan , while recognising that the act gives wales more legal bite and authority than before , said it did not go far enough .
the archbishop criticised the ' clumsy method of governance ' he said the assembly should have primary legislative power in all the fields like education and health which are devolved to it .
he criticised a " cumbersome and clumsy method of governance " which entails the welsh assembly petitioning the secretary of state for wales , who in turn asks the government for time to introduce orders in council in parliament , to give the assembly powers to pass legislation within the boundaries of each order .
the church leader called it a " rather a demeaning way of setting about things " .
he added : " it is a very tortuous process , even when the governments in london and cardiff are of the same political hue .
if they are not , relationships could be fraught and the governance of wales would suffer as a result .
" if wales , like scotland , is mature enough to have a legislature it ought to be responsible for law making itself and not have to petition the secretary of state and westminster for the right to do so , " dr morgan added .
he also criticised the assembly government for not publishing a guide to explain the new act 's implications to the people of wales .
dr morgan said the movement cymru yfory had taken it on itself to produce a guide , as an act of public service .
' raise awareness ' a spokesman for the assembly government said : " devolution is an evolutionary process and the new act opens an exciting chapter for devolution in wales allowing the national assembly to pass laws , which would have previously had to go through the uk parliament .
" we are about to embark on the use of the new government of wales act machinery for acquiring new powers and the test of their workability will now come through practice .
" we have worked hard to raise awareness of how this will benefit the people of wales . "
the spokesman welcomed dr morgan and cymru yfory 's efforts to build on work to further raise awareness of the new act .

the 57-year-old prefers to do his talking through his guitar but was happy to discuss his love for music , stretching back to childhood .
but he does not miss the band , whose brothers in arms album was once the uk 's best ever seller , or the fame that came with it .
" it just got too big , " he admitted .
" it got to the point when i 'd get into the catering area and did n't recognise the truck drivers .
what i loved about touring is that you felt like a little family .
" the road crew would travel all over the world , they were independent , great people and i valued the relationship we had with them - and we had a part of the crew who had been from wales . "
" i feel incredibly privileged , but if anyone can tell me one good thing about fame , i 'd be very interested to hear it .
it 's a by-product of success . "
" i do n't go nuts if a tune does n't come - i wait for it to happen , even if it takes 40 years " mark knopfler he now prefers the smaller stage and different musical settings .
" now i 'm more folk music-based , i 'm writing for the string bass , accordion , i love the fiddle - i 'm writing for these kind of instruments too . "
' pulsing power ' as well as playing hits like sultans of swing , romeo and juliet and the theme from local hero , he drew on songs inspired by his childhood .
he thanked his family for his introduction to music " my uncle kingsley in newcastle was a very happy young guy , he had a harmonica , banjo and played the boogie woogie piano .
i remember thinking - i was four - this is for me .
it was cosmic , like the blocks of logic were crashing into place . "
his father later bought him a £ 50 version of the fender stratocaster , he coveted .
" i think i slept with it on the first date .
this was what i wanted .
the old guy in the shop said when we were leaving - ' stick at it . " '
" i did n't have the nerve to ask my dad for an amplifier , so i plugged it into the radio and had the 1.5 watts of pulsing power !
it blew up shortly afterwards . "
he played secondary waltz - about his strict ex-army scottish gym teacher who taught his pupils to dance - " waltzing with fear in their hearts " , although he admitted it took him 40 years to find the right melody for it .
" i do n't go nuts if a tune does n't come - i wait for it to happen , even if it takes 40 years . "
but knopfler may have been lost to acting - had the national youth theatre not cast the best parts in the modern-dress julius caesar in sunderland to students from london .
" we had a couple of weeks off school to rehearse which was great , but they brought in these students from rada - the geordies were the spear carriers and the mob .
" i know what you 're going to say , nothing much has changed . "

the 57-year-old prefers to do his talking through his guitar but was happy to discuss his love for music , stretching back to childhood .
but he does not miss the band , whose brothers in arms album was once the uk 's best ever seller , or the fame that came with it .
" it just got too big , " he admitted .
" it got to the point when i 'd get into the catering area and did n't recognise the truck drivers .
what i loved about touring is that you felt like a little family .
" the road crew would travel all over the world , they were independent , great people and i valued the relationship we had with them - and we had a part of the crew who had been from wales . "
" i feel incredibly privileged , but if anyone can tell me one good thing about fame , i 'd be very interested to hear it .
it 's a by-product of success . "
i do n't go nuts if a tune does n't come - i wait for it to happen , even if it takes 40 years mark knopfler he now prefers the smaller stage and different musical settings .
" now i 'm more folk music-based , i 'm writing for the string bass , accordion , i love the fiddle - i 'm writing for these kind of instruments too . "
' pulsing power ' as well as playing hits like sultans of swing , romeo and juliet and the theme from local hero , he drew on songs inspired by his childhood .
he thanked his family for his introduction to music " my uncle kingsley in newcastle was a very happy young guy , he had a harmonica , banjo and played the boogie woogie piano .
i remember thinking - i was four - this is for me .
it was cosmic , like the blocks of logic were crashing into place . "
his father later bought him a £ 50 version of the fender stratocaster , he coveted .
" i think i slept with it on the first date .
this was what i wanted .
the old guy in the shop said when we were leaving - ' stick at it . " '

below is a representative selection of the subjects covered in the hundreds of questions received .
answers and viewpoints were provided by a range of falkland islands residents , expats , commentators and officials .
scroll down or click on the links below to choose a question .
are there still signs of war ?
are immigrants welcome ?
what entertainment is there ?
do they worry about losing the islands ?
what happened to the oil ?
has respect declined ?
what accent do they have ?
what nationality do they feel ?
how are they governed ?
did anyone agree with argentine rule ?
signs of war ?
q : is there still any physical evidence of the conflict visible in and around the towns and countryside ?
mark hellewell , united kingdom a : yes , the most obvious signs are the minefields .
these are well fenced and marked , and do not present a danger to life , but they are a constant reminder of the war .
traces of conflict in pictures a feasibility study on mine clearance , carried out at the university of cranfield , concluded that 100 % clearance of the estimated 20,000 mines was feasible .
as signatories of the ottawa convention banning anti-personnel mines , the uk is obliged to fund the clearance by 2009 .
many falkland islanders , and the fi government , have said they would prefer the minefields to be left alone and the money be given over to countries in more need , such as sierra leone .
the reasons include : the cost to the uk taxpayer , which we guess could run into tens of millions ; the safety of the mine clearance teams ; the environmental impact and the logistical upheaval within a limited infrastructure .
everyone knows where the minefields are , and they are mostly on land of little economic value .
we have made our views known through the foreign office , but ultimately the decision lies with the uk government .
elsewhere there are many memories of the fighting - most obvious is wreckage from fighter planes and helicopters .
if you walk up mount tumbledown , just outside stanley , you will see dug-outs , an old argentine field kitchen , barbed wire and discarded argentine army boots .
live ammunition still turns up from time to time .
richard davies , councillor for land use and environment , falkland islands government .
return to top are immigrants welcome ?
q : how easy is it to move to the falkland islands , and are immigrants welcome , whether with a profession or as a pensioner ?
if so , what are the professions that the islands need , and what are the costs of living there , including home purchase ?
greg , ipswich a : the falkland islands are part of the uk , but there is no automatic right for british visitors to settle here and overseas citizens may not purchase land without showing they are going to be able to support themselves and then getting a licence .
having said that , last year 's census showed only a third of residents were born here .
there are contracts for professionals sometimes advertised , usually for two or three years , and some contract workers settle here .
there are also people from saint helena and chile , who have become assimilated .
like with marmite , you love it or hate it here .
bear in mind that this place needs the full range of jobs for a modern country , including an airline with all local pilots , but has a population of only 3,000 .
regarding cost of living , some things are much more expensive , some much cheaper .
good wine is £ 3 a bottle , good fish £ 4 a kilo - but imports from the uk have to come 8,000 miles and that shows .
you can get a lot of house for your money , but most people build their own for about £ 100,000 .
there are very few re-sales but £ 110,000 is about the going rate , when one occurs .
there 's no vat and the top tax rate has just gone up to 26 % .
mark brunet , general manager , falkland islands development corporation .
-lsb- moved from east sussex , uk , to the falklands in february , on a three-year contract -rsb- return to top how do islanders entertain themselves ?
q : how do they entertain themselves ?
what tv or radio stations do they have ?
where do they go for a weekend away or a holiday ?
which countries most influence their culture ?
argentina / south america for being so close or britain for being part of british territory ?
lydia chessum , near munich , germany a : falkland islanders enjoy a varied social life .
there are many pubs and restaurants in stanley and we also enjoy other events such as community theatre .
civilians can use the cinema and a bowling alley at the nearby military base .
the majority of locals enjoy the outdoors , fishing , golf , and horse riding , and we also have a very good leisure centre .
a lot of fundraising goes on in stanley , often resulting in dances .
the victory bar is one popular haunt we have a military tv channel which broadcasts programmes from britain .
some people also subscribe to cable channels from south america .
there is a local radio station and a military radio station .
it 's impossible to leave the falklands for just a weekend , but many locals will head out to camp -lrb- the countryside -rrb- for a few days .
nearly everybody has access to transport and insurance and fuel prices are low .
britain was always the most popular holiday destination as many have had family there or children at college / university .
south america is now becoming more popular with weekly flights ; santiago , chile , is popular for short breaks .
britain has had the strongest influence on our culture - the traditional red telephone boxes and letter boxes make stanley look like a little piece of britain .
the food is predominantly british-style , and people drive land rovers .
however , there are a number of chilean and saint helenian workers here and areas of their culture are becoming commonplace , especially the asado - meat roasted over a fire on a spit .
samantha marsh , tourism assistant , and sian ferguson , agriculture assistant , stanley .
return to top do they worry about losing the islands ?
q : do the islanders believe they are there to stay for generations to come , or do they worry about the situation de-stabilising , and britain losing the islands , either to force , or to politics ?
-lrb- for example , the handing back of hong kong in 1997 . -rrb-
luke thompson , gloucester , england a : i believe the majority of islanders see themselves here for generations and generations to come .
this , at least , is the ideal and optimistic view , and you ca n't be pessimistic about war and losing your right to self-determination , it is too sad .
i think it is unlikely the argentines will ever try to use force again , especially if our garrison here remains as it is - they would be foolish to try .
what people do worry about is changing politics .
what if , in years to come , the british government no longer has any concern regarding the falklands and finally bow to the sovereignty claims and hand the falklands to argentina ?
what if in generations to come the falkland islands government want us to be independent ?
we shun britain and argentina then does use force to take the islands it claims ?
i sincerely hope none of the above situations occur in my lifetime , but because we do want our future generations to be falkland islanders and british they are situations we do not want to come to fruition .
zoe luxton , veterinary officer , stanley return to top what happened to the oil ?
q : almost 10 years ago there was exploratory oil and gas drilling around the falklands .
nothing has happened since yet apparently incredibly rich oil sources were found .
in a world where the quest for hydrocarbons is becoming more intense , with deeper waters drilled and unstable regimes dictating supply , why has nothing further happened in the islands ?
does the lack of development have anything to do with the argentinean situation ?
jon bevan , swansea oil billions beckon falkland islands economy ... and was oil the real reason there was a war ?
jim pretty , eastleigh , hampshire a : in fact a great deal has happened since 1998 when the first wells were drilled in the falkland islands .
a group of independent companies have spent tens of millions of dollars on exploration in preparation for a second drilling phase .
this summer 3d and a 2d seismic survey have been carried out offshore and also a csem -lrb- controlled source electro-magnetic -rrb- survey .
the new data will now be interpreted to assist companies in locating more prospects for drilling .
low oil prices in 1998 -lrb- the price fell to as low as $ 11 a barrel -rrb- saw the larger companies with licences leave the area and now very high oil prices are hampering drilling due to the unavailability of drilling rigs that can be contracted to work in the south atlantic .
it is not unusual for remote frontier areas to take several decades for exploration to proceed .
the delay has not been caused by argentine claims to sovereignty .
it is not believed in the falkland islands that the reason for the war in 1982 was over oil .
it is believed that the war was about sovereignty of the islands .
after the invasion the uk government took the decision to retake the islands to ensure that british subjects could exercise their right to self-determination .
phyl rendell , director of minerals and agriculture , falkland islands government .
return to top has there been a decline in respect and manners ?
q : are there issues , as in england , where there has been a severe decline in general manners and respect for other people over the last 25 years ?
steve yates , stockport a : overall , a healthy level of respect for one another exists in the falklands and people certainly care for each other .
with modern communications and comforts , there is less need for people to rely on each other as they might have done 25 years ago but , if something goes wrong for a family , everyone still steps in to help .
as with the uk , the older generation feels young people in the falklands do n't have the respect for their elders that they should and this is something people are aware we need to watch out for .
however , we are not in the same situation as the uk : everyone - yes , even teenagers - still greet each other in the street and wave as they drive by .
jenny cockwell , editor , penguin news .
return to top what accent do the islanders have ?
q : what accent / dialects do the falkland islanders possess ?
ian , lowestoft , united kingdom a : i first noticed an accent just before i arrived in the falkland islands -lsb- in 2006 -rsb- when i met a couple of people who were in the uk visiting friends .
it was hard to place the accent at first but on meeting more people when i arrived here , it seems to be a bit of a mixture of new zealand / australia and the south west of england !
but there seems to be quite a range of different accents , which is understandable as there are many different nationalities on the islands .
the children i teach do n't seem to have strong accents , it must be something that develops over time .
a lot of the children have mixed backgrounds too - some have one parent from the falklands and the other from somewhere like st helena , chile or some other country .
having lived here a while , i reckon you could tell a falkland islander if you spoke to them outside of the islands .
kate williams , teacher , stanley infant and junior school . -lsb- originally from aberdyfi , wales -rsb- return to top what nationality do they feel they are ?
some are more keen than others to make their feelings known q : what nationality do they actually feel ?
they live so close to argentina , do they go there often ?
when i was in argentina a few years ago , people on the trains would come through asking for money , having been injured as soldiers in ' las malvinas ' .
should i have felt awkward in that situation being british ?
frances lond-caulk , mexico city , mexico a : i feel british .
i 've lived in britain and i 've studied there , and i 've always felt 100 % at home there .
i also have my identity as a falkland islander , which is a strong thing and a part of who i am , but i do n't suppose it counts as a nationality .
despite the proximity of argentina , i have never been .
there 's no political or moral reason behind this ; i 'd like to go to buenos aires , and one day i 'm sure i will , but with the whole of south america on my doorstop , there 's a lot of places i plan to go .
on top of this , much of my annual leave is used just visiting britain to see family and friends , limiting time for travel .
as regards feeling awkward in the presence of an argentine war veteran , you should n't feel half as awkward as the members of the argentine government who sent under-prepared soldiers to fight a war in the name of jingoism and government popularity , and then treated them badly when they came home .
this also applies , though to a lesser extent , to the argentine public whom i believe would rather have forgotten their injured and defeated soldiers than live and work alongside them .
daniel fowler , aquaculture scientist , stanley .
return to top how are the falklands governed ?
the building of government house began in 1845 q : how are the islands governed ?
do they have an elected parliament , or an -lrb- elected -rrb- person representing their interests at westminster ?
mark newbury , tynemouth ... and do falklanders pay uk taxes ?
mark linehan , cardiff , wales a : the falkland islands are internally self-governing except for foreign affairs and defence .
we have a legislative assembly consisting of eight members , elected for four years .
they are responsible for passing laws and for the administration of the country , including the economy , health service , education and policing .
the falkland islands are economically self-sufficient save for the cost of defence .
like other overseas territories we have a governor who is appointed by the foreign office for three to four years .
their responsibility is to be the conduit between the uk government and the falkland islands government -lrb- fig -rrb- , to consult with fig on foreign affairs and defence issues , and to advise fig on adherence to the uk 's international responsibilities .
the governor chairs the executive council -lrb- the cabinet -rrb- but it is the elected members who make decisions .
we do not have direct representation in westminster , but maintain an office in london which keeps close contact with parliament and its members , to keep them informed on issues in the falklands .
the falklands levies taxation for internal purposes .
we do not pay tax to the uk , nor do we receive any monies directly from the uk for any purpose .
councillor mike summers , falkland islands government .
return to top did anyone agree with argentine rule ?
q : did any of the islanders actually not mind the prospect of argentine rule ?
rowan hunter , teddington a : i was living at fox bay east on west falkland at the time of the invasion but i can assure you that only a very small handful of islanders in 1982 would have accepted the prospect of argentine rule .
the islands had been under pressure from argentina from many years to accept a change of sovereignty but the islanders strongly rejected this pressure .
for example , uk minister nicholas ridley visited the islands in november 1980 with the object of persuading the islanders to accept a hong kong-style ' lease back ' solution to the problem .
there were demonstrations in the streets of stanley rejecting this initiative , resulting in renewed demands to " keep the falkland islands british " from islanders .
towards the end of the conflict two islanders opted to leave to go to argentina - one had been working for the argentine authorities and the other was married to an argentine national .
it is interesting to note that there was a small number of argentine nationals who settled in the islands in the years prior to the conflict and who opted to remain in the islands where they made their homes .
councillor richard cockwell , falkland islands government .

these are well fenced and marked , and do not present a danger to life , but they are a constant reminder of the war .
traces of conflict in pictures a feasibility study on mine clearance , carried out at the university of cranfield , concluded that 100 % clearance of the estimated 20,000 mines was feasible .
as signatories of the ottawa convention banning anti-personnel mines , the uk is obliged to fund the clearance by 2009 .
many falkland islanders , and the fi government , have said they would prefer the minefields to be left alone and the money be given over to countries in more need , such as sierra leone .
the reasons include : the cost to the uk taxpayer , which we guess could run into tens of millions ; the safety of the mine clearance teams ; the environmental impact and the logistical upheaval within a limited infrastructure .
everyone knows where the minefields are , and they are mostly on land of little economic value .
we have made our views known through the foreign office , but ultimately the decision lies with the uk government .
elsewhere there are many memories of the fighting - most obvious is wreckage from fighter planes and helicopters .
if you walk up mount tumbledown , just outside stanley , you will see dug-outs , an old argentine field kitchen , barbed wire and discarded argentine army boots .
live ammunition still turns up from time to time .

return to top are immigrants welcome ?
q : how easy is it to move to the falkland islands , and are immigrants welcome , whether with a profession or as a pensioner ?
if so , what are the professions that the islands need , and what are the costs of living there , including home purchase ?
greg , ipswich a : the falkland islands are part of the uk , but there is no automatic right for british visitors to settle here and overseas citizens may not purchase land without showing they are going to be able to support themselves and then getting a licence .
having said that , last year 's census showed only a third of residents were born here .
there are contracts for professionals sometimes advertised , usually for two or three years , and some contract workers settle here .
there are also people from saint helena and chile , who have become assimilated .
like with marmite , you love it or hate it here .
bear in mind that this place needs the full range of jobs for a modern country , including an airline with all local pilots , but has a population of only 3,000 .
regarding cost of living , some things are much more expensive , some much cheaper .
good wine is £ 3 a bottle , good fish £ 4 a kilo - but imports from the uk have to come 8,000 miles and that shows .
you can get a lot of house for your money , but most people build their own for about £ 100,000 .
there are very few re-sales but £ 110,000 is about the going rate , when one occurs .
there 's no vat and the top tax rate has just gone up to 26 % .

q : how do they entertain themselves ?
what tv or radio stations do they have ?
where do they go for a weekend away or a holiday ?
which countries most influence their culture ?
argentina / south america for being so close or britain for being part of british territory ?
lydia chessum , near munich , germany a : falkland islanders enjoy a varied social life .
there are many pubs and restaurants in stanley and we also enjoy other events such as community theatre .
civilians can use the cinema and a bowling alley at the nearby military base .
the majority of locals enjoy the outdoors , fishing , golf , and horse riding , and we also have a very good leisure centre .
a lot of fundraising goes on in stanley , often resulting in dances .
the victory bar is one popular haunt we have a military tv channel which broadcasts programmes from britain .
some people also subscribe to cable channels from south america .
there is a local radio station and a military radio station .
it 's impossible to leave the falklands for just a weekend , but many locals will head out to camp -lrb- the countryside -rrb- for a few days .
nearly everybody has access to transport and insurance and fuel prices are low .
britain was always the most popular holiday destination as many have had family there or children at college / university .
south america is now becoming more popular with weekly flights ; santiago , chile , is popular for short breaks .
britain has had the strongest influence on our culture - the traditional red telephone boxes and letter boxes make stanley look like a little piece of britain .
the food is predominantly british-style , and people drive land rovers .
however , there are a number of chilean and saint helenian workers here and areas of their culture are becoming commonplace , especially the asado - meat roasted over a fire on a spit .
samantha marsh , tourism assistant , and sian ferguson , agriculture assistant , stanley .
return to top do they worry about losing the islands ?
q : do the islanders believe they are there to stay for generations to come , or do they worry about the situation de-stabilising , and britain losing the islands , either to force , or to politics ?
-lrb- for example , the handing back of hong kong in 1997 . -rrb-
luke thompson , gloucester , england a : i believe the majority of islanders see themselves here for generations and generations to come .
this , at least , is the ideal and optimistic view , and you ca n't be pessimistic about war and losing your right to self-determination , it is too sad .
i think it is unlikely the argentines will ever try to use force again , especially if our garrison here remains as it is - they would be foolish to try .
what people do worry about is changing politics .
what if , in years to come , the british government no longer has any concern regarding the falklands and finally bow to the sovereignty claims and hand the falklands to argentina ?
what if in generations to come the falkland islands government want us to be independent ?
we shun britain and argentina then does use force to take the islands it claims ?
i sincerely hope none of the above situations occur in my lifetime , but because we do want our future generations to be falkland islanders and british they are situations we do not want to come to fruition .
zoe luxton , veterinary officer , stanley return to top what happened to the oil ?
q : almost 10 years ago there was exploratory oil and gas drilling around the falklands .
nothing has happened since yet apparently incredibly rich oil sources were found .
in a world where the quest for hydrocarbons is becoming more intense , with deeper waters drilled and unstable regimes dictating supply , why has nothing further happened in the islands ?
does the lack of development have anything to do with the argentinean situation ?
jon bevan , swansea oil billions beckon falkland islands economy ... and was oil the real reason there was a war ?
jim pretty , eastleigh , hampshire a : in fact a great deal has happened since 1998 when the first wells were drilled in the falkland islands .
a group of independent companies have spent tens of millions of dollars on exploration in preparation for a second drilling phase .
this summer 3d and a 2d seismic survey have been carried out offshore and also a csem -lrb- controlled source electro-magnetic -rrb- survey .
the new data will now be interpreted to assist companies in locating more prospects for drilling .
low oil prices in 1998 -lrb- the price fell to as low as $ 11 a barrel -rrb- saw the larger companies with licences leave the area and now very high oil prices are hampering drilling due to the unavailability of drilling rigs that can be contracted to work in the south atlantic .
it is not unusual for remote frontier areas to take several decades for exploration to proceed .
the delay has not been caused by argentine claims to sovereignty .
it is not believed in the falkland islands that the reason for the war in 1982 was over oil .
it is believed that the war was about sovereignty of the islands .
after the invasion the uk government took the decision to retake the islands to ensure that british subjects could exercise their right to self-determination .
phyl rendell , director of minerals and agriculture , falkland islands government .
return to top has there been a decline in respect and manners ?
q : are there issues , as in england , where there has been a severe decline in general manners and respect for other people over the last 25 years ?
steve yates , stockport a : overall , a healthy level of respect for one another exists in the falklands and people certainly care for each other .
with modern communications and comforts , there is less need for people to rely on each other as they might have done 25 years ago but , if something goes wrong for a family , everyone still steps in to help .
as with the uk , the older generation feels young people in the falklands do n't have the respect for their elders that they should and this is something people are aware we need to watch out for .
however , we are not in the same situation as the uk : everyone - yes , even teenagers - still greet each other in the street and wave as they drive by .
jenny cockwell , editor , penguin news .
return to top what accent do the islanders have ?
q : what accent / dialects do the falkland islanders possess ?
ian , lowestoft , united kingdom a : i first noticed an accent just before i arrived in the falkland islands -lsb- in 2006 -rsb- when i met a couple of people who were in the uk visiting friends .
it was hard to place the accent at first but on meeting more people when i arrived here , it seems to be a bit of a mixture of new zealand / australia and the south west of england !
but there seems to be quite a range of different accents , which is understandable as there are many different nationalities on the islands .
the children i teach do n't seem to have strong accents , it must be something that develops over time .
a lot of the children have mixed backgrounds too - some have one parent from the falklands and the other from somewhere like st helena , chile or some other country .
having lived here a while , i reckon you could tell a falkland islander if you spoke to them outside of the islands .
kate williams , teacher , stanley infant and junior school . -lsb- originally from aberdyfi , wales -rsb- return to top what nationality do they feel they are ?
some are more keen than others to make their feelings known q : what nationality do they actually feel ?
they live so close to argentina , do they go there often ?
when i was in argentina a few years ago , people on the trains would come through asking for money , having been injured as soldiers in ' las malvinas ' .
should i have felt awkward in that situation being british ?
frances lond-caulk , mexico city , mexico a : i feel british .
i 've lived in britain and i 've studied there , and i 've always felt 100 % at home there .
i also have my identity as a falkland islander , which is a strong thing and a part of who i am , but i do n't suppose it counts as a nationality .
despite the proximity of argentina , i have never been .
there 's no political or moral reason behind this ; i 'd like to go to buenos aires , and one day i 'm sure i will , but with the whole of south america on my doorstop , there 's a lot of places i plan to go .
on top of this , much of my annual leave is used just visiting britain to see family and friends , limiting time for travel .
as regards feeling awkward in the presence of an argentine war veteran , you should n't feel half as awkward as the members of the argentine government who sent under-prepared soldiers to fight a war in the name of jingoism and government popularity , and then treated them badly when they came home .
this also applies , though to a lesser extent , to the argentine public whom i believe would rather have forgotten their injured and defeated soldiers than live and work alongside them .
daniel fowler , aquaculture scientist , stanley .
return to top how are the falklands governed ?
the building of government house began in 1845 q : how are the islands governed ?
do they have an elected parliament , or an -lrb- elected -rrb- person representing their interests at westminster ?
mark newbury , tynemouth ... and do falklanders pay uk taxes ?
mark linehan , cardiff , wales a : the falkland islands are internally self-governing except for foreign affairs and defence .
we have a legislative assembly consisting of eight members , elected for four years .
they are responsible for passing laws and for the administration of the country , including the economy , health service , education and policing .
the falkland islands are economically self-sufficient save for the cost of defence .
like other overseas territories we have a governor who is appointed by the foreign office for three to four years .
their responsibility is to be the conduit between the uk government and the falkland islands government -lrb- fig -rrb- , to consult with fig on foreign affairs and defence issues , and to advise fig on adherence to the uk 's international responsibilities .
the governor chairs the executive council -lrb- the cabinet -rrb- but it is the elected members who make decisions .
we do not have direct representation in westminster , but maintain an office in london which keeps close contact with parliament and its members , to keep them informed on issues in the falklands .
the falklands levies taxation for internal purposes .
we do not pay tax to the uk , nor do we receive any monies directly from the uk for any purpose .
councillor mike summers , falkland islands government .
return to top did anyone agree with argentine rule ?
q : did any of the islanders actually not mind the prospect of argentine rule ?
rowan hunter , teddington a : i was living at fox bay east on west falkland at the time of the invasion but i can assure you that only a very small handful of islanders in 1982 would have accepted the prospect of argentine rule .
the islands had been under pressure from argentina from many years to accept a change of sovereignty but the islanders strongly rejected this pressure .
for example , uk minister nicholas ridley visited the islands in november 1980 with the object of persuading the islanders to accept a hong kong-style ' lease back ' solution to the problem .
there were demonstrations in the streets of stanley rejecting this initiative , resulting in renewed demands to " keep the falkland islands british " from islanders .
towards the end of the conflict two islanders opted to leave to go to argentina - one had been working for the argentine authorities and the other was married to an argentine national .
it is interesting to note that there was a small number of argentine nationals who settled in the islands in the years prior to the conflict and who opted to remain in the islands where they made their homes .

signs of war ?
q : is there still any physical evidence of the conflict visible in and around the towns and countryside ?
mark hellewell , united kingdom a : yes , the most obvious signs are the minefields .
these are well fenced and marked , and do not present a danger to life , but they are a constant reminder of the war .
traces of conflict in pictures a feasibility study on mine clearance , carried out at the university of cranfield , concluded that 100 % clearance of the estimated 20,000 mines was feasible .
as signatories of the ottawa convention banning anti-personnel mines , the uk is obliged to fund the clearance by 2009 .
many falkland islanders , and the fi government , have said they would prefer the minefields to be left alone and the money be given over to countries in more need , such as sierra leone .
the reasons include : the cost to the uk taxpayer , which we guess could run into tens of millions ; the safety of the mine clearance teams ; the environmental impact and the logistical upheaval within a limited infrastructure .
everyone knows where the minefields are , and they are mostly on land of little economic value .
we have made our views known through the foreign office , but ultimately the decision lies with the uk government .
elsewhere there are many memories of the fighting - most obvious is wreckage from fighter planes and helicopters .
if you walk up mount tumbledown , just outside stanley , you will see dug-outs , an old argentine field kitchen , barbed wire and discarded argentine army boots .
live ammunition still turns up from time to time .
richard davies , councillor for land use and environment , falkland islands government .
return to top are immigrants welcome ?
q : how easy is it to move to the falkland islands , and are immigrants welcome , whether with a profession or as a pensioner ?
if so , what are the professions that the islands need , and what are the costs of living there , including home purchase ?
greg , ipswich a : the falkland islands are part of the uk , but there is no automatic right for british visitors to settle here and overseas citizens may not purchase land without showing they are going to be able to support themselves and then getting a licence .
having said that , last year 's census showed only a third of residents were born here .
there are contracts for professionals sometimes advertised , usually for two or three years , and some contract workers settle here .
there are also people from saint helena and chile , who have become assimilated .
like with marmite , you love it or hate it here .
bear in mind that this place needs the full range of jobs for a modern country , including an airline with all local pilots , but has a population of only 3,000 .
regarding cost of living , some things are much more expensive , some much cheaper .
good wine is £ 3 a bottle , good fish £ 4 a kilo - but imports from the uk have to come 8,000 miles and that shows .
you can get a lot of house for your money , but most people build their own for about £ 100,000 .
there are very few re-sales but £ 110,000 is about the going rate , when one occurs .
there 's no vat and the top tax rate has just gone up to 26 % .
mark brunet , general manager , falkland islands development corporation .
-lsb- moved from east sussex , uk , to the falklands in february , on a three-year contract -rsb- return to top how do islanders entertain themselves ?
q : how do they entertain themselves ?
what tv or radio stations do they have ?
where do they go for a weekend away or a holiday ?
which countries most influence their culture ?
argentina / south america for being so close or britain for being part of british territory ?
lydia chessum , near munich , germany a : falkland islanders enjoy a varied social life .
there are many pubs and restaurants in stanley and we also enjoy other events such as community theatre .
civilians can use the cinema and a bowling alley at the nearby military base .
the majority of locals enjoy the outdoors , fishing , golf , and horse riding , and we also have a very good leisure centre .
a lot of fundraising goes on in stanley , often resulting in dances .
the victory bar is one popular haunt we have a military tv channel which broadcasts programmes from britain .
some people also subscribe to cable channels from south america .
there is a local radio station and a military radio station .
it 's impossible to leave the falklands for just a weekend , but many locals will head out to camp -lrb- the countryside -rrb- for a few days .
nearly everybody has access to transport and insurance and fuel prices are low .
britain was always the most popular holiday destination as many have had family there or children at college / university .
south america is now becoming more popular with weekly flights ; santiago , chile , is popular for short breaks .
britain has had the strongest influence on our culture - the traditional red telephone boxes and letter boxes make stanley look like a little piece of britain .
the food is predominantly british-style , and people drive land rovers .
however , there are a number of chilean and saint helenian workers here and areas of their culture are becoming commonplace , especially the asado - meat roasted over a fire on a spit .
samantha marsh , tourism assistant , and sian ferguson , agriculture assistant , stanley .
return to top do they worry about losing the islands ?
q : do the islanders believe they are there to stay for generations to come , or do they worry about the situation de-stabilising , and britain losing the islands , either to force , or to politics ?
-lrb- for example , the handing back of hong kong in 1997 . -rrb-
luke thompson , gloucester , england a : i believe the majority of islanders see themselves here for generations and generations to come .
this , at least , is the ideal and optimistic view , and you ca n't be pessimistic about war and losing your right to self-determination , it is too sad .
i think it is unlikely the argentines will ever try to use force again , especially if our garrison here remains as it is - they would be foolish to try .
what people do worry about is changing politics .
what if , in years to come , the british government no longer has any concern regarding the falklands and finally bow to the sovereignty claims and hand the falklands to argentina ?
what if in generations to come the falkland islands government want us to be independent ?
we shun britain and argentina then does use force to take the islands it claims ?
i sincerely hope none of the above situations occur in my lifetime , but because we do want our future generations to be falkland islanders and british they are situations we do not want to come to fruition .
zoe luxton , veterinary officer , stanley return to top what happened to the oil ?
q : almost 10 years ago there was exploratory oil and gas drilling around the falklands .
nothing has happened since yet apparently incredibly rich oil sources were found .
in a world where the quest for hydrocarbons is becoming more intense , with deeper waters drilled and unstable regimes dictating supply , why has nothing further happened in the islands ?
does the lack of development have anything to do with the argentinean situation ?
jon bevan , swansea oil billions beckon falkland islands economy ... and was oil the real reason there was a war ?
jim pretty , eastleigh , hampshire a : in fact a great deal has happened since 1998 when the first wells were drilled in the falkland islands .
a group of independent companies have spent tens of millions of dollars on exploration in preparation for a second drilling phase .
this summer 3d and a 2d seismic survey have been carried out offshore and also a csem -lrb- controlled source electro-magnetic -rrb- survey .
the new data will now be interpreted to assist companies in locating more prospects for drilling .
low oil prices in 1998 -lrb- the price fell to as low as $ 11 a barrel -rrb- saw the larger companies with licences leave the area and now very high oil prices are hampering drilling due to the unavailability of drilling rigs that can be contracted to work in the south atlantic .
it is not unusual for remote frontier areas to take several decades for exploration to proceed .
the delay has not been caused by argentine claims to sovereignty .
it is not believed in the falkland islands that the reason for the war in 1982 was over oil .
it is believed that the war was about sovereignty of the islands .
after the invasion the uk government took the decision to retake the islands to ensure that british subjects could exercise their right to self-determination .
phyl rendell , director of minerals and agriculture , falkland islands government .
return to top has there been a decline in respect and manners ?
q : are there issues , as in england , where there has been a severe decline in general manners and respect for other people over the last 25 years ?
steve yates , stockport a : overall , a healthy level of respect for one another exists in the falklands and people certainly care for each other .
with modern communications and comforts , there is less need for people to rely on each other as they might have done 25 years ago but , if something goes wrong for a family , everyone still steps in to help .
as with the uk , the older generation feels young people in the falklands do n't have the respect for their elders that they should and this is something people are aware we need to watch out for .
however , we are not in the same situation as the uk : everyone - yes , even teenagers - still greet each other in the street and wave as they drive by .
jenny cockwell , editor , penguin news .
return to top what accent do the islanders have ?
q : what accent / dialects do the falkland islanders possess ?
ian , lowestoft , united kingdom a : i first noticed an accent just before i arrived in the falkland islands -lsb- in 2006 -rsb- when i met a couple of people who were in the uk visiting friends .
it was hard to place the accent at first but on meeting more people when i arrived here , it seems to be a bit of a mixture of new zealand / australia and the south west of england !
but there seems to be quite a range of different accents , which is understandable as there are many different nationalities on the islands .
the children i teach do n't seem to have strong accents , it must be something that develops over time .
a lot of the children have mixed backgrounds too - some have one parent from the falklands and the other from somewhere like st helena , chile or some other country .
having lived here a while , i reckon you could tell a falkland islander if you spoke to them outside of the islands .
kate williams , teacher , stanley infant and junior school . -lsb- originally from aberdyfi , wales -rsb- return to top what nationality do they feel they are ?
some are more keen than others to make their feelings known q : what nationality do they actually feel ?
they live so close to argentina , do they go there often ?
when i was in argentina a few years ago , people on the trains would come through asking for money , having been injured as soldiers in ' las malvinas ' .
should i have felt awkward in that situation being british ?
frances lond-caulk , mexico city , mexico a : i feel british .
i 've lived in britain and i 've studied there , and i 've always felt 100 % at home there .
i also have my identity as a falkland islander , which is a strong thing and a part of who i am , but i do n't suppose it counts as a nationality .
despite the proximity of argentina , i have never been .
there 's no political or moral reason behind this ; i 'd like to go to buenos aires , and one day i 'm sure i will , but with the whole of south america on my doorstop , there 's a lot of places i plan to go .
on top of this , much of my annual leave is used just visiting britain to see family and friends , limiting time for travel .
as regards feeling awkward in the presence of an argentine war veteran , you should n't feel half as awkward as the members of the argentine government who sent under-prepared soldiers to fight a war in the name of jingoism and government popularity , and then treated them badly when they came home .
this also applies , though to a lesser extent , to the argentine public whom i believe would rather have forgotten their injured and defeated soldiers than live and work alongside them .
daniel fowler , aquaculture scientist , stanley .
return to top how are the falklands governed ?
the building of government house began in 1845 q : how are the islands governed ?
do they have an elected parliament , or an -lrb- elected -rrb- person representing their interests at westminster ?
mark newbury , tynemouth ... and do falklanders pay uk taxes ?
mark linehan , cardiff , wales a : the falkland islands are internally self-governing except for foreign affairs and defence .
we have a legislative assembly consisting of eight members , elected for four years .
they are responsible for passing laws and for the administration of the country , including the economy , health service , education and policing .
the falkland islands are economically self-sufficient save for the cost of defence .
like other overseas territories we have a governor who is appointed by the foreign office for three to four years .
their responsibility is to be the conduit between the uk government and the falkland islands government -lrb- fig -rrb- , to consult with fig on foreign affairs and defence issues , and to advise fig on adherence to the uk 's international responsibilities .
the governor chairs the executive council -lrb- the cabinet -rrb- but it is the elected members who make decisions .
we do not have direct representation in westminster , but maintain an office in london which keeps close contact with parliament and its members , to keep them informed on issues in the falklands .
the falklands levies taxation for internal purposes .
we do not pay tax to the uk , nor do we receive any monies directly from the uk for any purpose .
councillor mike summers , falkland islands government .
return to top did anyone agree with argentine rule ?
q : did any of the islanders actually not mind the prospect of argentine rule ?
rowan hunter , teddington a : i was living at fox bay east on west falkland at the time of the invasion but i can assure you that only a very small handful of islanders in 1982 would have accepted the prospect of argentine rule .
the islands had been under pressure from argentina from many years to accept a change of sovereignty but the islanders strongly rejected this pressure .
for example , uk minister nicholas ridley visited the islands in november 1980 with the object of persuading the islanders to accept a hong kong-style ' lease back ' solution to the problem .
there were demonstrations in the streets of stanley rejecting this initiative , resulting in renewed demands to " keep the falkland islands british " from islanders .
towards the end of the conflict two islanders opted to leave to go to argentina - one had been working for the argentine authorities and the other was married to an argentine national .
it is interesting to note that there was a small number of argentine nationals who settled in the islands in the years prior to the conflict and who opted to remain in the islands where they made their homes .
councillor richard cockwell , falkland islands government .

return to top did anyone agree with argentine rule ?
q : did any of the islanders actually not mind the prospect of argentine rule ?
rowan hunter , teddington a : i was living at fox bay east on west falkland at the time of the invasion but i can assure you that only a very small handful of islanders in 1982 would have accepted the prospect of argentine rule .
the islands had been under pressure from argentina from many years to accept a change of sovereignty but the islanders strongly rejected this pressure .
for example , uk minister nicholas ridley visited the islands in november 1980 with the object of persuading the islanders to accept a hong kong-style ' lease back ' solution to the problem .
there were demonstrations in the streets of stanley rejecting this initiative , resulting in renewed demands to " keep the falkland islands british " from islanders .
towards the end of the conflict two islanders opted to leave to go to argentina - one had been working for the argentine authorities and the other was married to an argentine national .
it is interesting to note that there was a small number of argentine nationals who settled in the islands in the years prior to the conflict and who opted to remain in the islands where they made their homes .

signs of war ?
q : is there still any physical evidence of the conflict visible in and around the towns and countryside ?
mark hellewell , united kingdom a : yes , the most obvious signs are the minefields .
these are well fenced and marked , and do not present a danger to life , but they are a constant reminder of the war .
traces of conflict in pictures a feasibility study on mine clearance , carried out at the university of cranfield , concluded that 100 % clearance of the estimated 20,000 mines was feasible .
as signatories of the ottawa convention banning anti-personnel mines , the uk is obliged to fund the clearance by 2009 .
many falkland islanders , and the fi government , have said they would prefer the minefields to be left alone and the money be given over to countries in more need , such as sierra leone .
the reasons include : the cost to the uk taxpayer , which we guess could run into tens of millions ; the safety of the mine clearance teams ; the environmental impact and the logistical upheaval within a limited infrastructure .
everyone knows where the minefields are , and they are mostly on land of little economic value .
we have made our views known through the foreign office , but ultimately the decision lies with the uk government .
elsewhere there are many memories of the fighting - most obvious is wreckage from fighter planes and helicopters .
if you walk up mount tumbledown , just outside stanley , you will see dug-outs , an old argentine field kitchen , barbed wire and discarded argentine army boots .
live ammunition still turns up from time to time .
richard davies , councillor for land use and environment , falkland islands government .
return to top are immigrants welcome ?
q : how easy is it to move to the falkland islands , and are immigrants welcome , whether with a profession or as a pensioner ?
if so , what are the professions that the islands need , and what are the costs of living there , including home purchase ?
greg , ipswich a : the falkland islands are part of the uk , but there is no automatic right for british visitors to settle here and overseas citizens may not purchase land without showing they are going to be able to support themselves and then getting a licence .
having said that , last year 's census showed only a third of residents were born here .
there are contracts for professionals sometimes advertised , usually for two or three years , and some contract workers settle here .
there are also people from saint helena and chile , who have become assimilated .
like with marmite , you love it or hate it here .
bear in mind that this place needs the full range of jobs for a modern country , including an airline with all local pilots , but has a population of only 3,000 .
regarding cost of living , some things are much more expensive , some much cheaper .
good wine is £ 3 a bottle , good fish £ 4 a kilo - but imports from the uk have to come 8,000 miles and that shows .
you can get a lot of house for your money , but most people build their own for about £ 100,000 .
there are very few re-sales but £ 110,000 is about the going rate , when one occurs .
there 's no vat and the top tax rate has just gone up to 26 % .
mark brunet , general manager , falkland islands development corporation .
-lsb- moved from east sussex , uk , to the falklands in february , on a three-year contract -rsb- return to top how do islanders entertain themselves ?
q : how do they entertain themselves ?
what tv or radio stations do they have ?
where do they go for a weekend away or a holiday ?
which countries most influence their culture ?
argentina / south america for being so close or britain for being part of british territory ?
lydia chessum , near munich , germany a : falkland islanders enjoy a varied social life .
there are many pubs and restaurants in stanley and we also enjoy other events such as community theatre .
civilians can use the cinema and a bowling alley at the nearby military base .
the majority of locals enjoy the outdoors , fishing , golf , and horse riding , and we also have a very good leisure centre .
a lot of fundraising goes on in stanley , often resulting in dances .
the victory bar is one popular haunt we have a military tv channel which broadcasts programmes from britain .
some people also subscribe to cable channels from south america .
there is a local radio station and a military radio station .
it 's impossible to leave the falklands for just a weekend , but many locals will head out to camp -lrb- the countryside -rrb- for a few days .
nearly everybody has access to transport and insurance and fuel prices are low .
britain was always the most popular holiday destination as many have had family there or children at college / university .
south america is now becoming more popular with weekly flights ; santiago , chile , is popular for short breaks .
britain has had the strongest influence on our culture - the traditional red telephone boxes and letter boxes make stanley look like a little piece of britain .
the food is predominantly british-style , and people drive land rovers .
however , there are a number of chilean and saint helenian workers here and areas of their culture are becoming commonplace , especially the asado - meat roasted over a fire on a spit .
samantha marsh , tourism assistant , and sian ferguson , agriculture assistant , stanley .
return to top do they worry about losing the islands ?
q : do the islanders believe they are there to stay for generations to come , or do they worry about the situation de-stabilising , and britain losing the islands , either to force , or to politics ?
-lrb- for example , the handing back of hong kong in 1997 . -rrb-
luke thompson , gloucester , england a : i believe the majority of islanders see themselves here for generations and generations to come .
this , at least , is the ideal and optimistic view , and you ca n't be pessimistic about war and losing your right to self-determination , it is too sad .
i think it is unlikely the argentines will ever try to use force again , especially if our garrison here remains as it is - they would be foolish to try .
what people do worry about is changing politics .
what if , in years to come , the british government no longer has any concern regarding the falklands and finally bow to the sovereignty claims and hand the falklands to argentina ?
what if in generations to come the falkland islands government want us to be independent ?
we shun britain and argentina then does use force to take the islands it claims ?
i sincerely hope none of the above situations occur in my lifetime , but because we do want our future generations to be falkland islanders and british they are situations we do not want to come to fruition .
zoe luxton , veterinary officer , stanley return to top what happened to the oil ?
q : almost 10 years ago there was exploratory oil and gas drilling around the falklands .
nothing has happened since yet apparently incredibly rich oil sources were found .
in a world where the quest for hydrocarbons is becoming more intense , with deeper waters drilled and unstable regimes dictating supply , why has nothing further happened in the islands ?
does the lack of development have anything to do with the argentinean situation ?
jon bevan , swansea oil billions beckon falkland islands economy ... and was oil the real reason there was a war ?
jim pretty , eastleigh , hampshire a : in fact a great deal has happened since 1998 when the first wells were drilled in the falkland islands .
a group of independent companies have spent tens of millions of dollars on exploration in preparation for a second drilling phase .
this summer 3d and a 2d seismic survey have been carried out offshore and also a csem -lrb- controlled source electro-magnetic -rrb- survey .
the new data will now be interpreted to assist companies in locating more prospects for drilling .
low oil prices in 1998 -lrb- the price fell to as low as $ 11 a barrel -rrb- saw the larger companies with licences leave the area and now very high oil prices are hampering drilling due to the unavailability of drilling rigs that can be contracted to work in the south atlantic .
it is not unusual for remote frontier areas to take several decades for exploration to proceed .
the delay has not been caused by argentine claims to sovereignty .
it is not believed in the falkland islands that the reason for the war in 1982 was over oil .
it is believed that the war was about sovereignty of the islands .
after the invasion the uk government took the decision to retake the islands to ensure that british subjects could exercise their right to self-determination .
phyl rendell , director of minerals and agriculture , falkland islands government .
return to top has there been a decline in respect and manners ?
q : are there issues , as in england , where there has been a severe decline in general manners and respect for other people over the last 25 years ?
steve yates , stockport a : overall , a healthy level of respect for one another exists in the falklands and people certainly care for each other .
with modern communications and comforts , there is less need for people to rely on each other as they might have done 25 years ago but , if something goes wrong for a family , everyone still steps in to help .
as with the uk , the older generation feels young people in the falklands do n't have the respect for their elders that they should and this is something people are aware we need to watch out for .
however , we are not in the same situation as the uk : everyone - yes , even teenagers - still greet each other in the street and wave as they drive by .
jenny cockwell , editor , penguin news .
return to top what accent do the islanders have ?
q : what accent / dialects do the falkland islanders possess ?
ian , lowestoft , united kingdom a : i first noticed an accent just before i arrived in the falkland islands -lsb- in 2006 -rsb- when i met a couple of people who were in the uk visiting friends .
it was hard to place the accent at first but on meeting more people when i arrived here , it seems to be a bit of a mixture of new zealand / australia and the south west of england !
but there seems to be quite a range of different accents , which is understandable as there are many different nationalities on the islands .
the children i teach do n't seem to have strong accents , it must be something that develops over time .
a lot of the children have mixed backgrounds too - some have one parent from the falklands and the other from somewhere like st helena , chile or some other country .
having lived here a while , i reckon you could tell a falkland islander if you spoke to them outside of the islands .
kate williams , teacher , stanley infant and junior school . -lsb- originally from aberdyfi , wales -rsb- return to top what nationality do they feel they are ?
some are more keen than others to make their feelings known q : what nationality do they actually feel ?
they live so close to argentina , do they go there often ?
when i was in argentina a few years ago , people on the trains would come through asking for money , having been injured as soldiers in ' las malvinas ' .
should i have felt awkward in that situation being british ?
frances lond-caulk , mexico city , mexico a : i feel british .
i 've lived in britain and i 've studied there , and i 've always felt 100 % at home there .
i also have my identity as a falkland islander , which is a strong thing and a part of who i am , but i do n't suppose it counts as a nationality .
despite the proximity of argentina , i have never been .
there 's no political or moral reason behind this ; i 'd like to go to buenos aires , and one day i 'm sure i will , but with the whole of south america on my doorstop , there 's a lot of places i plan to go .
on top of this , much of my annual leave is used just visiting britain to see family and friends , limiting time for travel .
as regards feeling awkward in the presence of an argentine war veteran , you should n't feel half as awkward as the members of the argentine government who sent under-prepared soldiers to fight a war in the name of jingoism and government popularity , and then treated them badly when they came home .
this also applies , though to a lesser extent , to the argentine public whom i believe would rather have forgotten their injured and defeated soldiers than live and work alongside them .
daniel fowler , aquaculture scientist , stanley .
return to top how are the falklands governed ?
the building of government house began in 1845 q : how are the islands governed ?
do they have an elected parliament , or an -lrb- elected -rrb- person representing their interests at westminster ?
mark newbury , tynemouth ... and do falklanders pay uk taxes ?
mark linehan , cardiff , wales a : the falkland islands are internally self-governing except for foreign affairs and defence .
we have a legislative assembly consisting of eight members , elected for four years .
they are responsible for passing laws and for the administration of the country , including the economy , health service , education and policing .
the falkland islands are economically self-sufficient save for the cost of defence .
like other overseas territories we have a governor who is appointed by the foreign office for three to four years .
their responsibility is to be the conduit between the uk government and the falkland islands government -lrb- fig -rrb- , to consult with fig on foreign affairs and defence issues , and to advise fig on adherence to the uk 's international responsibilities .
the governor chairs the executive council -lrb- the cabinet -rrb- but it is the elected members who make decisions .
we do not have direct representation in westminster , but maintain an office in london which keeps close contact with parliament and its members , to keep them informed on issues in the falklands .
the falklands levies taxation for internal purposes .
we do not pay tax to the uk , nor do we receive any monies directly from the uk for any purpose .

there 's no political or moral reason behind this ; i 'd like to go to buenos aires , and one day i 'm sure i will , but with the whole of south america on my doorstop , there 's a lot of places i plan to go .
on top of this , much of my annual leave is used just visiting britain to see family and friends , limiting time for travel .
as regards feeling awkward in the presence of an argentine war veteran , you should n't feel half as awkward as the members of the argentine government who sent under-prepared soldiers to fight a war in the name of jingoism and government popularity , and then treated them badly when they came home .
this also applies , though to a lesser extent , to the argentine public whom i believe would rather have forgotten their injured and defeated soldiers than live and work alongside them .

return to top how are the falklands governed ?
the building of government house began in 1845 q : how are the islands governed ?
do they have an elected parliament , or an -lrb- elected -rrb- person representing their interests at westminster ?
mark newbury , tynemouth ... and do falklanders pay uk taxes ?
mark linehan , cardiff , wales a : the falkland islands are internally self-governing except for foreign affairs and defence .
we have a legislative assembly consisting of eight members , elected for four years .
they are responsible for passing laws and for the administration of the country , including the economy , health service , education and policing .
the falkland islands are economically self-sufficient save for the cost of defence .
like other overseas territories we have a governor who is appointed by the foreign office for three to four years .
their responsibility is to be the conduit between the uk government and the falkland islands government -lrb- fig -rrb- , to consult with fig on foreign affairs and defence issues , and to advise fig on adherence to the uk 's international responsibilities .
the governor chairs the executive council -lrb- the cabinet -rrb- but it is the elected members who make decisions .
we do not have direct representation in westminster , but maintain an office in london which keeps close contact with parliament and its members , to keep them informed on issues in the falklands .
the falklands levies taxation for internal purposes .
we do not pay tax to the uk , nor do we receive any monies directly from the uk for any purpose .
councillor mike summers , falkland islands government .
return to top did anyone agree with argentine rule ?
q : did any of the islanders actually not mind the prospect of argentine rule ?
rowan hunter , teddington a : i was living at fox bay east on west falkland at the time of the invasion but i can assure you that only a very small handful of islanders in 1982 would have accepted the prospect of argentine rule .
the islands had been under pressure from argentina from many years to accept a change of sovereignty but the islanders strongly rejected this pressure .
for example , uk minister nicholas ridley visited the islands in november 1980 with the object of persuading the islanders to accept a hong kong-style ' lease back ' solution to the problem .
there were demonstrations in the streets of stanley rejecting this initiative , resulting in renewed demands to " keep the falkland islands british " from islanders .
towards the end of the conflict two islanders opted to leave to go to argentina - one had been working for the argentine authorities and the other was married to an argentine national .
it is interesting to note that there was a small number of argentine nationals who settled in the islands in the years prior to the conflict and who opted to remain in the islands where they made their homes .

below is a representative selection of the subjects covered in the hundreds of questions received .
answers and viewpoints were provided by a range of falkland islands residents , expats , commentators and officials .

signs of war ?
q : is there still any physical evidence of the conflict visible in and around the towns and countryside ?
mark hellewell , united kingdom a : yes , the most obvious signs are the minefields .
these are well fenced and marked , and do not present a danger to life , but they are a constant reminder of the war .
traces of conflict in pictures a feasibility study on mine clearance , carried out at the university of cranfield , concluded that 100 % clearance of the estimated 20,000 mines was feasible .
as signatories of the ottawa convention banning anti-personnel mines , the uk is obliged to fund the clearance by 2009 .
many falkland islanders , and the fi government , have said they would prefer the minefields to be left alone and the money be given over to countries in more need , such as sierra leone .
the reasons include : the cost to the uk taxpayer , which we guess could run into tens of millions ; the safety of the mine clearance teams ; the environmental impact and the logistical upheaval within a limited infrastructure .
everyone knows where the minefields are , and they are mostly on land of little economic value .
we have made our views known through the foreign office , but ultimately the decision lies with the uk government .
elsewhere there are many memories of the fighting - most obvious is wreckage from fighter planes and helicopters .
if you walk up mount tumbledown , just outside stanley , you will see dug-outs , an old argentine field kitchen , barbed wire and discarded argentine army boots .
live ammunition still turns up from time to time .
richard davies , councillor for land use and environment , falkland islands government .
return to top are immigrants welcome ?
q : how easy is it to move to the falkland islands , and are immigrants welcome , whether with a profession or as a pensioner ?
if so , what are the professions that the islands need , and what are the costs of living there , including home purchase ?
greg , ipswich a : the falkland islands are part of the uk , but there is no automatic right for british visitors to settle here and overseas citizens may not purchase land without showing they are going to be able to support themselves and then getting a licence .
having said that , last year 's census showed only a third of residents were born here .
there are contracts for professionals sometimes advertised , usually for two or three years , and some contract workers settle here .
there are also people from saint helena and chile , who have become assimilated .
like with marmite , you love it or hate it here .
bear in mind that this place needs the full range of jobs for a modern country , including an airline with all local pilots , but has a population of only 3,000 .
regarding cost of living , some things are much more expensive , some much cheaper .
good wine is £ 3 a bottle , good fish £ 4 a kilo - but imports from the uk have to come 8,000 miles and that shows .
you can get a lot of house for your money , but most people build their own for about £ 100,000 .
there are very few re-sales but £ 110,000 is about the going rate , when one occurs .
there 's no vat and the top tax rate has just gone up to 26 % .
mark brunet , general manager , falkland islands development corporation .
-lsb- moved from east sussex , uk , to the falklands in february , on a three-year contract -rsb- return to top how do islanders entertain themselves ?
q : how do they entertain themselves ?
what tv or radio stations do they have ?
where do they go for a weekend away or a holiday ?
which countries most influence their culture ?
argentina / south america for being so close or britain for being part of british territory ?
lydia chessum , near munich , germany a : falkland islanders enjoy a varied social life .
there are many pubs and restaurants in stanley and we also enjoy other events such as community theatre .
civilians can use the cinema and a bowling alley at the nearby military base .
the majority of locals enjoy the outdoors , fishing , golf , and horse riding , and we also have a very good leisure centre .
a lot of fundraising goes on in stanley , often resulting in dances .
the victory bar is one popular haunt we have a military tv channel which broadcasts programmes from britain .
some people also subscribe to cable channels from south america .
there is a local radio station and a military radio station .
it 's impossible to leave the falklands for just a weekend , but many locals will head out to camp -lrb- the countryside -rrb- for a few days .
nearly everybody has access to transport and insurance and fuel prices are low .
britain was always the most popular holiday destination as many have had family there or children at college / university .
south america is now becoming more popular with weekly flights ; santiago , chile , is popular for short breaks .
britain has had the strongest influence on our culture - the traditional red telephone boxes and letter boxes make stanley look like a little piece of britain .
the food is predominantly british-style , and people drive land rovers .
however , there are a number of chilean and saint helenian workers here and areas of their culture are becoming commonplace , especially the asado - meat roasted over a fire on a spit .
samantha marsh , tourism assistant , and sian ferguson , agriculture assistant , stanley .
return to top do they worry about losing the islands ?
q : do the islanders believe they are there to stay for generations to come , or do they worry about the situation de-stabilising , and britain losing the islands , either to force , or to politics ?
-lrb- for example , the handing back of hong kong in 1997 . -rrb-
luke thompson , gloucester , england a : i believe the majority of islanders see themselves here for generations and generations to come .
this , at least , is the ideal and optimistic view , and you ca n't be pessimistic about war and losing your right to self-determination , it is too sad .
i think it is unlikely the argentines will ever try to use force again , especially if our garrison here remains as it is - they would be foolish to try .
what people do worry about is changing politics .
what if , in years to come , the british government no longer has any concern regarding the falklands and finally bow to the sovereignty claims and hand the falklands to argentina ?
what if in generations to come the falkland islands government want us to be independent ?
we shun britain and argentina then does use force to take the islands it claims ?
i sincerely hope none of the above situations occur in my lifetime , but because we do want our future generations to be falkland islanders and british they are situations we do not want to come to fruition .
zoe luxton , veterinary officer , stanley return to top what happened to the oil ?
q : almost 10 years ago there was exploratory oil and gas drilling around the falklands .
nothing has happened since yet apparently incredibly rich oil sources were found .
in a world where the quest for hydrocarbons is becoming more intense , with deeper waters drilled and unstable regimes dictating supply , why has nothing further happened in the islands ?
does the lack of development have anything to do with the argentinean situation ?
jon bevan , swansea oil billions beckon falkland islands economy ... and was oil the real reason there was a war ?
jim pretty , eastleigh , hampshire a : in fact a great deal has happened since 1998 when the first wells were drilled in the falkland islands .
a group of independent companies have spent tens of millions of dollars on exploration in preparation for a second drilling phase .
this summer 3d and a 2d seismic survey have been carried out offshore and also a csem -lrb- controlled source electro-magnetic -rrb- survey .
the new data will now be interpreted to assist companies in locating more prospects for drilling .
low oil prices in 1998 -lrb- the price fell to as low as $ 11 a barrel -rrb- saw the larger companies with licences leave the area and now very high oil prices are hampering drilling due to the unavailability of drilling rigs that can be contracted to work in the south atlantic .
it is not unusual for remote frontier areas to take several decades for exploration to proceed .
the delay has not been caused by argentine claims to sovereignty .
it is not believed in the falkland islands that the reason for the war in 1982 was over oil .
it is believed that the war was about sovereignty of the islands .
after the invasion the uk government took the decision to retake the islands to ensure that british subjects could exercise their right to self-determination .
phyl rendell , director of minerals and agriculture , falkland islands government .
return to top has there been a decline in respect and manners ?
q : are there issues , as in england , where there has been a severe decline in general manners and respect for other people over the last 25 years ?
steve yates , stockport a : overall , a healthy level of respect for one another exists in the falklands and people certainly care for each other .
with modern communications and comforts , there is less need for people to rely on each other as they might have done 25 years ago but , if something goes wrong for a family , everyone still steps in to help .
as with the uk , the older generation feels young people in the falklands do n't have the respect for their elders that they should and this is something people are aware we need to watch out for .
however , we are not in the same situation as the uk : everyone - yes , even teenagers - still greet each other in the street and wave as they drive by .
jenny cockwell , editor , penguin news .
return to top what accent do the islanders have ?
q : what accent / dialects do the falkland islanders possess ?
ian , lowestoft , united kingdom a : i first noticed an accent just before i arrived in the falkland islands -lsb- in 2006 -rsb- when i met a couple of people who were in the uk visiting friends .
it was hard to place the accent at first but on meeting more people when i arrived here , it seems to be a bit of a mixture of new zealand / australia and the south west of england !
but there seems to be quite a range of different accents , which is understandable as there are many different nationalities on the islands .
the children i teach do n't seem to have strong accents , it must be something that develops over time .
a lot of the children have mixed backgrounds too - some have one parent from the falklands and the other from somewhere like st helena , chile or some other country .
having lived here a while , i reckon you could tell a falkland islander if you spoke to them outside of the islands .
kate williams , teacher , stanley infant and junior school . -lsb- originally from aberdyfi , wales -rsb- return to top what nationality do they feel they are ?
some are more keen than others to make their feelings known q : what nationality do they actually feel ?
they live so close to argentina , do they go there often ?
when i was in argentina a few years ago , people on the trains would come through asking for money , having been injured as soldiers in ' las malvinas ' .
should i have felt awkward in that situation being british ?
frances lond-caulk , mexico city , mexico a : i feel british .
i 've lived in britain and i 've studied there , and i 've always felt 100 % at home there .
i also have my identity as a falkland islander , which is a strong thing and a part of who i am , but i do n't suppose it counts as a nationality .
despite the proximity of argentina , i have never been .
there 's no political or moral reason behind this ; i 'd like to go to buenos aires , and one day i 'm sure i will , but with the whole of south america on my doorstop , there 's a lot of places i plan to go .
on top of this , much of my annual leave is used just visiting britain to see family and friends , limiting time for travel .
as regards feeling awkward in the presence of an argentine war veteran , you should n't feel half as awkward as the members of the argentine government who sent under-prepared soldiers to fight a war in the name of jingoism and government popularity , and then treated them badly when they came home .
this also applies , though to a lesser extent , to the argentine public whom i believe would rather have forgotten their injured and defeated soldiers than live and work alongside them .

do they have an elected parliament , or an -lrb- elected -rrb- person representing their interests at westminster ?

it was hard to place the accent at first but on meeting more people when i arrived here , it seems to be a bit of a mixture of new zealand / australia and the south west of england !
but there seems to be quite a range of different accents , which is understandable as there are many different nationalities on the islands .
the children i teach do n't seem to have strong accents , it must be something that develops over time .
a lot of the children have mixed backgrounds too - some have one parent from the falklands and the other from somewhere like st helena , chile or some other country .
having lived here a while , i reckon you could tell a falkland islander if you spoke to them outside of the islands .
kate williams , teacher , stanley infant and junior school . -lsb- originally from aberdyfi , wales -rsb- return to top what nationality do they feel they are ?
some are more keen than others to make their feelings known q : what nationality do they actually feel ?
they live so close to argentina , do they go there often ?
when i was in argentina a few years ago , people on the trains would come through asking for money , having been injured as soldiers in ' las malvinas ' .
should i have felt awkward in that situation being british ?
frances lond-caulk , mexico city , mexico a : i feel british .
i 've lived in britain and i 've studied there , and i 've always felt 100 % at home there .
i also have my identity as a falkland islander , which is a strong thing and a part of who i am , but i do n't suppose it counts as a nationality .
despite the proximity of argentina , i have never been .
there 's no political or moral reason behind this ; i 'd like to go to buenos aires , and one day i 'm sure i will , but with the whole of south america on my doorstop , there 's a lot of places i plan to go .
on top of this , much of my annual leave is used just visiting britain to see family and friends , limiting time for travel .
as regards feeling awkward in the presence of an argentine war veteran , you should n't feel half as awkward as the members of the argentine government who sent under-prepared soldiers to fight a war in the name of jingoism and government popularity , and then treated them badly when they came home .
this also applies , though to a lesser extent , to the argentine public whom i believe would rather have forgotten their injured and defeated soldiers than live and work alongside them .
daniel fowler , aquaculture scientist , stanley .
return to top how are the falklands governed ?
the building of government house began in 1845 q : how are the islands governed ?
do they have an elected parliament , or an -lrb- elected -rrb- person representing their interests at westminster ?
mark newbury , tynemouth ... and do falklanders pay uk taxes ?
mark linehan , cardiff , wales a : the falkland islands are internally self-governing except for foreign affairs and defence .
we have a legislative assembly consisting of eight members , elected for four years .
they are responsible for passing laws and for the administration of the country , including the economy , health service , education and policing .
the falkland islands are economically self-sufficient save for the cost of defence .
like other overseas territories we have a governor who is appointed by the foreign office for three to four years .
their responsibility is to be the conduit between the uk government and the falkland islands government -lrb- fig -rrb- , to consult with fig on foreign affairs and defence issues , and to advise fig on adherence to the uk 's international responsibilities .
the governor chairs the executive council -lrb- the cabinet -rrb- but it is the elected members who make decisions .
we do not have direct representation in westminster , but maintain an office in london which keeps close contact with parliament and its members , to keep them informed on issues in the falklands .
the falklands levies taxation for internal purposes .
we do not pay tax to the uk , nor do we receive any monies directly from the uk for any purpose .
councillor mike summers , falkland islands government .
return to top did anyone agree with argentine rule ?
q : did any of the islanders actually not mind the prospect of argentine rule ?
rowan hunter , teddington a : i was living at fox bay east on west falkland at the time of the invasion but i can assure you that only a very small handful of islanders in 1982 would have accepted the prospect of argentine rule .
the islands had been under pressure from argentina from many years to accept a change of sovereignty but the islanders strongly rejected this pressure .
for example , uk minister nicholas ridley visited the islands in november 1980 with the object of persuading the islanders to accept a hong kong-style ' lease back ' solution to the problem .
there were demonstrations in the streets of stanley rejecting this initiative , resulting in renewed demands to " keep the falkland islands british " from islanders .
towards the end of the conflict two islanders opted to leave to go to argentina - one had been working for the argentine authorities and the other was married to an argentine national .
it is interesting to note that there was a small number of argentine nationals who settled in the islands in the years prior to the conflict and who opted to remain in the islands where they made their homes .

signs of war ?
q : is there still any physical evidence of the conflict visible in and around the towns and countryside ?
mark hellewell , united kingdom a : yes , the most obvious signs are the minefields .
these are well fenced and marked , and do not present a danger to life , but they are a constant reminder of the war .
traces of conflict in pictures a feasibility study on mine clearance , carried out at the university of cranfield , concluded that 100 % clearance of the estimated 20,000 mines was feasible .
as signatories of the ottawa convention banning anti-personnel mines , the uk is obliged to fund the clearance by 2009 .
many falkland islanders , and the fi government , have said they would prefer the minefields to be left alone and the money be given over to countries in more need , such as sierra leone .
the reasons include : the cost to the uk taxpayer , which we guess could run into tens of millions ; the safety of the mine clearance teams ; the environmental impact and the logistical upheaval within a limited infrastructure .
everyone knows where the minefields are , and they are mostly on land of little economic value .
we have made our views known through the foreign office , but ultimately the decision lies with the uk government .
elsewhere there are many memories of the fighting - most obvious is wreckage from fighter planes and helicopters .
if you walk up mount tumbledown , just outside stanley , you will see dug-outs , an old argentine field kitchen , barbed wire and discarded argentine army boots .
live ammunition still turns up from time to time .
richard davies , councillor for land use and environment , falkland islands government .
return to top are immigrants welcome ?
q : how easy is it to move to the falkland islands , and are immigrants welcome , whether with a profession or as a pensioner ?
if so , what are the professions that the islands need , and what are the costs of living there , including home purchase ?
greg , ipswich a : the falkland islands are part of the uk , but there is no automatic right for british visitors to settle here and overseas citizens may not purchase land without showing they are going to be able to support themselves and then getting a licence .
having said that , last year 's census showed only a third of residents were born here .
there are contracts for professionals sometimes advertised , usually for two or three years , and some contract workers settle here .
there are also people from saint helena and chile , who have become assimilated .
like with marmite , you love it or hate it here .
bear in mind that this place needs the full range of jobs for a modern country , including an airline with all local pilots , but has a population of only 3,000 .
regarding cost of living , some things are much more expensive , some much cheaper .
good wine is £ 3 a bottle , good fish £ 4 a kilo - but imports from the uk have to come 8,000 miles and that shows .
you can get a lot of house for your money , but most people build their own for about £ 100,000 .
there are very few re-sales but £ 110,000 is about the going rate , when one occurs .
there 's no vat and the top tax rate has just gone up to 26 % .
mark brunet , general manager , falkland islands development corporation .
-lsb- moved from east sussex , uk , to the falklands in february , on a three-year contract -rsb- return to top how do islanders entertain themselves ?
q : how do they entertain themselves ?
what tv or radio stations do they have ?
where do they go for a weekend away or a holiday ?
which countries most influence their culture ?
argentina / south america for being so close or britain for being part of british territory ?
lydia chessum , near munich , germany a : falkland islanders enjoy a varied social life .
there are many pubs and restaurants in stanley and we also enjoy other events such as community theatre .
civilians can use the cinema and a bowling alley at the nearby military base .
the majority of locals enjoy the outdoors , fishing , golf , and horse riding , and we also have a very good leisure centre .
a lot of fundraising goes on in stanley , often resulting in dances .
the victory bar is one popular haunt we have a military tv channel which broadcasts programmes from britain .
some people also subscribe to cable channels from south america .
there is a local radio station and a military radio station .
it 's impossible to leave the falklands for just a weekend , but many locals will head out to camp -lrb- the countryside -rrb- for a few days .
nearly everybody has access to transport and insurance and fuel prices are low .
britain was always the most popular holiday destination as many have had family there or children at college / university .
south america is now becoming more popular with weekly flights ; santiago , chile , is popular for short breaks .
britain has had the strongest influence on our culture - the traditional red telephone boxes and letter boxes make stanley look like a little piece of britain .
the food is predominantly british-style , and people drive land rovers .
however , there are a number of chilean and saint helenian workers here and areas of their culture are becoming commonplace , especially the asado - meat roasted over a fire on a spit .
samantha marsh , tourism assistant , and sian ferguson , agriculture assistant , stanley .
return to top do they worry about losing the islands ?
q : do the islanders believe they are there to stay for generations to come , or do they worry about the situation de-stabilising , and britain losing the islands , either to force , or to politics ?
-lrb- for example , the handing back of hong kong in 1997 . -rrb-
luke thompson , gloucester , england a : i believe the majority of islanders see themselves here for generations and generations to come .
this , at least , is the ideal and optimistic view , and you ca n't be pessimistic about war and losing your right to self-determination , it is too sad .
i think it is unlikely the argentines will ever try to use force again , especially if our garrison here remains as it is - they would be foolish to try .
what people do worry about is changing politics .
what if , in years to come , the british government no longer has any concern regarding the falklands and finally bow to the sovereignty claims and hand the falklands to argentina ?
what if in generations to come the falkland islands government want us to be independent ?
we shun britain and argentina then does use force to take the islands it claims ?
i sincerely hope none of the above situations occur in my lifetime , but because we do want our future generations to be falkland islanders and british they are situations we do not want to come to fruition .
zoe luxton , veterinary officer , stanley return to top what happened to the oil ?
q : almost 10 years ago there was exploratory oil and gas drilling around the falklands .
nothing has happened since yet apparently incredibly rich oil sources were found .
in a world where the quest for hydrocarbons is becoming more intense , with deeper waters drilled and unstable regimes dictating supply , why has nothing further happened in the islands ?
does the lack of development have anything to do with the argentinean situation ?
jon bevan , swansea oil billions beckon falkland islands economy ... and was oil the real reason there was a war ?
jim pretty , eastleigh , hampshire a : in fact a great deal has happened since 1998 when the first wells were drilled in the falkland islands .
a group of independent companies have spent tens of millions of dollars on exploration in preparation for a second drilling phase .
this summer 3d and a 2d seismic survey have been carried out offshore and also a csem -lrb- controlled source electro-magnetic -rrb- survey .
the new data will now be interpreted to assist companies in locating more prospects for drilling .
low oil prices in 1998 -lrb- the price fell to as low as $ 11 a barrel -rrb- saw the larger companies with licences leave the area and now very high oil prices are hampering drilling due to the unavailability of drilling rigs that can be contracted to work in the south atlantic .
it is not unusual for remote frontier areas to take several decades for exploration to proceed .
the delay has not been caused by argentine claims to sovereignty .
it is not believed in the falkland islands that the reason for the war in 1982 was over oil .
it is believed that the war was about sovereignty of the islands .
after the invasion the uk government took the decision to retake the islands to ensure that british subjects could exercise their right to self-determination .
phyl rendell , director of minerals and agriculture , falkland islands government .
return to top has there been a decline in respect and manners ?
q : are there issues , as in england , where there has been a severe decline in general manners and respect for other people over the last 25 years ?
steve yates , stockport a : overall , a healthy level of respect for one another exists in the falklands and people certainly care for each other .
with modern communications and comforts , there is less need for people to rely on each other as they might have done 25 years ago but , if something goes wrong for a family , everyone still steps in to help .
as with the uk , the older generation feels young people in the falklands do n't have the respect for their elders that they should and this is something people are aware we need to watch out for .
however , we are not in the same situation as the uk : everyone - yes , even teenagers - still greet each other in the street and wave as they drive by .

low oil prices in 1998 -lrb- the price fell to as low as $ 11 a barrel -rrb- saw the larger companies with licences leave the area and now very high oil prices are hampering drilling due to the unavailability of drilling rigs that can be contracted to work in the south atlantic .
it is not unusual for remote frontier areas to take several decades for exploration to proceed .
the delay has not been caused by argentine claims to sovereignty .
it is not believed in the falkland islands that the reason for the war in 1982 was over oil .
it is believed that the war was about sovereignty of the islands .
after the invasion the uk government took the decision to retake the islands to ensure that british subjects could exercise their right to self-determination .
phyl rendell , director of minerals and agriculture , falkland islands government .
return to top has there been a decline in respect and manners ?
q : are there issues , as in england , where there has been a severe decline in general manners and respect for other people over the last 25 years ?
steve yates , stockport a : overall , a healthy level of respect for one another exists in the falklands and people certainly care for each other .
with modern communications and comforts , there is less need for people to rely on each other as they might have done 25 years ago but , if something goes wrong for a family , everyone still steps in to help .
as with the uk , the older generation feels young people in the falklands do n't have the respect for their elders that they should and this is something people are aware we need to watch out for .
however , we are not in the same situation as the uk : everyone - yes , even teenagers - still greet each other in the street and wave as they drive by .
jenny cockwell , editor , penguin news .
return to top what accent do the islanders have ?
q : what accent / dialects do the falkland islanders possess ?
ian , lowestoft , united kingdom a : i first noticed an accent just before i arrived in the falkland islands -lsb- in 2006 -rsb- when i met a couple of people who were in the uk visiting friends .
it was hard to place the accent at first but on meeting more people when i arrived here , it seems to be a bit of a mixture of new zealand / australia and the south west of england !
but there seems to be quite a range of different accents , which is understandable as there are many different nationalities on the islands .
the children i teach do n't seem to have strong accents , it must be something that develops over time .
a lot of the children have mixed backgrounds too - some have one parent from the falklands and the other from somewhere like st helena , chile or some other country .
having lived here a while , i reckon you could tell a falkland islander if you spoke to them outside of the islands .
kate williams , teacher , stanley infant and junior school . -lsb- originally from aberdyfi , wales -rsb- return to top what nationality do they feel they are ?
some are more keen than others to make their feelings known q : what nationality do they actually feel ?
they live so close to argentina , do they go there often ?
when i was in argentina a few years ago , people on the trains would come through asking for money , having been injured as soldiers in ' las malvinas ' .
should i have felt awkward in that situation being british ?
frances lond-caulk , mexico city , mexico a : i feel british .
i 've lived in britain and i 've studied there , and i 've always felt 100 % at home there .
i also have my identity as a falkland islander , which is a strong thing and a part of who i am , but i do n't suppose it counts as a nationality .
despite the proximity of argentina , i have never been .
there 's no political or moral reason behind this ; i 'd like to go to buenos aires , and one day i 'm sure i will , but with the whole of south america on my doorstop , there 's a lot of places i plan to go .
on top of this , much of my annual leave is used just visiting britain to see family and friends , limiting time for travel .
as regards feeling awkward in the presence of an argentine war veteran , you should n't feel half as awkward as the members of the argentine government who sent under-prepared soldiers to fight a war in the name of jingoism and government popularity , and then treated them badly when they came home .
this also applies , though to a lesser extent , to the argentine public whom i believe would rather have forgotten their injured and defeated soldiers than live and work alongside them .
daniel fowler , aquaculture scientist , stanley .
return to top how are the falklands governed ?
the building of government house began in 1845 q : how are the islands governed ?
do they have an elected parliament , or an -lrb- elected -rrb- person representing their interests at westminster ?
mark newbury , tynemouth ... and do falklanders pay uk taxes ?
mark linehan , cardiff , wales a : the falkland islands are internally self-governing except for foreign affairs and defence .
we have a legislative assembly consisting of eight members , elected for four years .
they are responsible for passing laws and for the administration of the country , including the economy , health service , education and policing .
the falkland islands are economically self-sufficient save for the cost of defence .
like other overseas territories we have a governor who is appointed by the foreign office for three to four years .
their responsibility is to be the conduit between the uk government and the falkland islands government -lrb- fig -rrb- , to consult with fig on foreign affairs and defence issues , and to advise fig on adherence to the uk 's international responsibilities .
the governor chairs the executive council -lrb- the cabinet -rrb- but it is the elected members who make decisions .
we do not have direct representation in westminster , but maintain an office in london which keeps close contact with parliament and its members , to keep them informed on issues in the falklands .
the falklands levies taxation for internal purposes .
we do not pay tax to the uk , nor do we receive any monies directly from the uk for any purpose .
councillor mike summers , falkland islands government .
return to top did anyone agree with argentine rule ?
q : did any of the islanders actually not mind the prospect of argentine rule ?
rowan hunter , teddington a : i was living at fox bay east on west falkland at the time of the invasion but i can assure you that only a very small handful of islanders in 1982 would have accepted the prospect of argentine rule .
the islands had been under pressure from argentina from many years to accept a change of sovereignty but the islanders strongly rejected this pressure .
for example , uk minister nicholas ridley visited the islands in november 1980 with the object of persuading the islanders to accept a hong kong-style ' lease back ' solution to the problem .
there were demonstrations in the streets of stanley rejecting this initiative , resulting in renewed demands to " keep the falkland islands british " from islanders .
towards the end of the conflict two islanders opted to leave to go to argentina - one had been working for the argentine authorities and the other was married to an argentine national .
it is interesting to note that there was a small number of argentine nationals who settled in the islands in the years prior to the conflict and who opted to remain in the islands where they made their homes .

signs of war ?
q : is there still any physical evidence of the conflict visible in and around the towns and countryside ?
mark hellewell , united kingdom a : yes , the most obvious signs are the minefields .
these are well fenced and marked , and do not present a danger to life , but they are a constant reminder of the war .
traces of conflict in pictures a feasibility study on mine clearance , carried out at the university of cranfield , concluded that 100 % clearance of the estimated 20,000 mines was feasible .
as signatories of the ottawa convention banning anti-personnel mines , the uk is obliged to fund the clearance by 2009 .
many falkland islanders , and the fi government , have said they would prefer the minefields to be left alone and the money be given over to countries in more need , such as sierra leone .
the reasons include : the cost to the uk taxpayer , which we guess could run into tens of millions ; the safety of the mine clearance teams ; the environmental impact and the logistical upheaval within a limited infrastructure .
everyone knows where the minefields are , and they are mostly on land of little economic value .
we have made our views known through the foreign office , but ultimately the decision lies with the uk government .
elsewhere there are many memories of the fighting - most obvious is wreckage from fighter planes and helicopters .
if you walk up mount tumbledown , just outside stanley , you will see dug-outs , an old argentine field kitchen , barbed wire and discarded argentine army boots .
live ammunition still turns up from time to time .
richard davies , councillor for land use and environment , falkland islands government .
return to top are immigrants welcome ?
q : how easy is it to move to the falkland islands , and are immigrants welcome , whether with a profession or as a pensioner ?
if so , what are the professions that the islands need , and what are the costs of living there , including home purchase ?
greg , ipswich a : the falkland islands are part of the uk , but there is no automatic right for british visitors to settle here and overseas citizens may not purchase land without showing they are going to be able to support themselves and then getting a licence .
having said that , last year 's census showed only a third of residents were born here .
there are contracts for professionals sometimes advertised , usually for two or three years , and some contract workers settle here .
there are also people from saint helena and chile , who have become assimilated .
like with marmite , you love it or hate it here .
bear in mind that this place needs the full range of jobs for a modern country , including an airline with all local pilots , but has a population of only 3,000 .
regarding cost of living , some things are much more expensive , some much cheaper .
good wine is £ 3 a bottle , good fish £ 4 a kilo - but imports from the uk have to come 8,000 miles and that shows .
you can get a lot of house for your money , but most people build their own for about £ 100,000 .
there are very few re-sales but £ 110,000 is about the going rate , when one occurs .
there 's no vat and the top tax rate has just gone up to 26 % .
mark brunet , general manager , falkland islands development corporation .
-lsb- moved from east sussex , uk , to the falklands in february , on a three-year contract -rsb- return to top how do islanders entertain themselves ?
q : how do they entertain themselves ?
what tv or radio stations do they have ?
where do they go for a weekend away or a holiday ?
which countries most influence their culture ?
argentina / south america for being so close or britain for being part of british territory ?
lydia chessum , near munich , germany a : falkland islanders enjoy a varied social life .
there are many pubs and restaurants in stanley and we also enjoy other events such as community theatre .
civilians can use the cinema and a bowling alley at the nearby military base .
the majority of locals enjoy the outdoors , fishing , golf , and horse riding , and we also have a very good leisure centre .
a lot of fundraising goes on in stanley , often resulting in dances .
the victory bar is one popular haunt we have a military tv channel which broadcasts programmes from britain .
some people also subscribe to cable channels from south america .
there is a local radio station and a military radio station .
it 's impossible to leave the falklands for just a weekend , but many locals will head out to camp -lrb- the countryside -rrb- for a few days .
nearly everybody has access to transport and insurance and fuel prices are low .
britain was always the most popular holiday destination as many have had family there or children at college / university .
south america is now becoming more popular with weekly flights ; santiago , chile , is popular for short breaks .
britain has had the strongest influence on our culture - the traditional red telephone boxes and letter boxes make stanley look like a little piece of britain .
the food is predominantly british-style , and people drive land rovers .
however , there are a number of chilean and saint helenian workers here and areas of their culture are becoming commonplace , especially the asado - meat roasted over a fire on a spit .
samantha marsh , tourism assistant , and sian ferguson , agriculture assistant , stanley .
return to top do they worry about losing the islands ?
q : do the islanders believe they are there to stay for generations to come , or do they worry about the situation de-stabilising , and britain losing the islands , either to force , or to politics ?
-lrb- for example , the handing back of hong kong in 1997 . -rrb-
luke thompson , gloucester , england a : i believe the majority of islanders see themselves here for generations and generations to come .
this , at least , is the ideal and optimistic view , and you ca n't be pessimistic about war and losing your right to self-determination , it is too sad .
i think it is unlikely the argentines will ever try to use force again , especially if our garrison here remains as it is - they would be foolish to try .
what people do worry about is changing politics .
what if , in years to come , the british government no longer has any concern regarding the falklands and finally bow to the sovereignty claims and hand the falklands to argentina ?
what if in generations to come the falkland islands government want us to be independent ?
we shun britain and argentina then does use force to take the islands it claims ?
i sincerely hope none of the above situations occur in my lifetime , but because we do want our future generations to be falkland islanders and british they are situations we do not want to come to fruition .
zoe luxton , veterinary officer , stanley return to top what happened to the oil ?
q : almost 10 years ago there was exploratory oil and gas drilling around the falklands .
nothing has happened since yet apparently incredibly rich oil sources were found .
in a world where the quest for hydrocarbons is becoming more intense , with deeper waters drilled and unstable regimes dictating supply , why has nothing further happened in the islands ?
does the lack of development have anything to do with the argentinean situation ?
jon bevan , swansea oil billions beckon falkland islands economy ... and was oil the real reason there was a war ?
jim pretty , eastleigh , hampshire a : in fact a great deal has happened since 1998 when the first wells were drilled in the falkland islands .
a group of independent companies have spent tens of millions of dollars on exploration in preparation for a second drilling phase .
this summer 3d and a 2d seismic survey have been carried out offshore and also a csem -lrb- controlled source electro-magnetic -rrb- survey .
the new data will now be interpreted to assist companies in locating more prospects for drilling .
low oil prices in 1998 -lrb- the price fell to as low as $ 11 a barrel -rrb- saw the larger companies with licences leave the area and now very high oil prices are hampering drilling due to the unavailability of drilling rigs that can be contracted to work in the south atlantic .
it is not unusual for remote frontier areas to take several decades for exploration to proceed .
the delay has not been caused by argentine claims to sovereignty .
it is not believed in the falkland islands that the reason for the war in 1982 was over oil .
it is believed that the war was about sovereignty of the islands .
after the invasion the uk government took the decision to retake the islands to ensure that british subjects could exercise their right to self-determination .

however , we are not in the same situation as the uk : everyone - yes , even teenagers - still greet each other in the street and wave as they drive by .

-lrb- for example , the handing back of hong kong in 1997 . -rrb-
luke thompson , gloucester , england a : i believe the majority of islanders see themselves here for generations and generations to come .
this , at least , is the ideal and optimistic view , and you ca n't be pessimistic about war and losing your right to self-determination , it is too sad .
i think it is unlikely the argentines will ever try to use force again , especially if our garrison here remains as it is - they would be foolish to try .
what people do worry about is changing politics .
what if , in years to come , the british government no longer has any concern regarding the falklands and finally bow to the sovereignty claims and hand the falklands to argentina ?
what if in generations to come the falkland islands government want us to be independent ?
we shun britain and argentina then does use force to take the islands it claims ?
i sincerely hope none of the above situations occur in my lifetime , but because we do want our future generations to be falkland islanders and british they are situations we do not want to come to fruition .
zoe luxton , veterinary officer , stanley return to top what happened to the oil ?
q : almost 10 years ago there was exploratory oil and gas drilling around the falklands .
nothing has happened since yet apparently incredibly rich oil sources were found .
in a world where the quest for hydrocarbons is becoming more intense , with deeper waters drilled and unstable regimes dictating supply , why has nothing further happened in the islands ?
does the lack of development have anything to do with the argentinean situation ?
jon bevan , swansea oil billions beckon falkland islands economy ... and was oil the real reason there was a war ?
jim pretty , eastleigh , hampshire a : in fact a great deal has happened since 1998 when the first wells were drilled in the falkland islands .
a group of independent companies have spent tens of millions of dollars on exploration in preparation for a second drilling phase .
this summer 3d and a 2d seismic survey have been carried out offshore and also a csem -lrb- controlled source electro-magnetic -rrb- survey .
the new data will now be interpreted to assist companies in locating more prospects for drilling .
low oil prices in 1998 -lrb- the price fell to as low as $ 11 a barrel -rrb- saw the larger companies with licences leave the area and now very high oil prices are hampering drilling due to the unavailability of drilling rigs that can be contracted to work in the south atlantic .
it is not unusual for remote frontier areas to take several decades for exploration to proceed .
the delay has not been caused by argentine claims to sovereignty .
it is not believed in the falkland islands that the reason for the war in 1982 was over oil .
it is believed that the war was about sovereignty of the islands .
after the invasion the uk government took the decision to retake the islands to ensure that british subjects could exercise their right to self-determination .
phyl rendell , director of minerals and agriculture , falkland islands government .
return to top has there been a decline in respect and manners ?
q : are there issues , as in england , where there has been a severe decline in general manners and respect for other people over the last 25 years ?
steve yates , stockport a : overall , a healthy level of respect for one another exists in the falklands and people certainly care for each other .
with modern communications and comforts , there is less need for people to rely on each other as they might have done 25 years ago but , if something goes wrong for a family , everyone still steps in to help .
as with the uk , the older generation feels young people in the falklands do n't have the respect for their elders that they should and this is something people are aware we need to watch out for .
however , we are not in the same situation as the uk : everyone - yes , even teenagers - still greet each other in the street and wave as they drive by .
jenny cockwell , editor , penguin news .
return to top what accent do the islanders have ?
q : what accent / dialects do the falkland islanders possess ?
ian , lowestoft , united kingdom a : i first noticed an accent just before i arrived in the falkland islands -lsb- in 2006 -rsb- when i met a couple of people who were in the uk visiting friends .
it was hard to place the accent at first but on meeting more people when i arrived here , it seems to be a bit of a mixture of new zealand / australia and the south west of england !
but there seems to be quite a range of different accents , which is understandable as there are many different nationalities on the islands .
the children i teach do n't seem to have strong accents , it must be something that develops over time .
a lot of the children have mixed backgrounds too - some have one parent from the falklands and the other from somewhere like st helena , chile or some other country .
having lived here a while , i reckon you could tell a falkland islander if you spoke to them outside of the islands .
kate williams , teacher , stanley infant and junior school . -lsb- originally from aberdyfi , wales -rsb- return to top what nationality do they feel they are ?
some are more keen than others to make their feelings known q : what nationality do they actually feel ?
they live so close to argentina , do they go there often ?
when i was in argentina a few years ago , people on the trains would come through asking for money , having been injured as soldiers in ' las malvinas ' .
should i have felt awkward in that situation being british ?
frances lond-caulk , mexico city , mexico a : i feel british .
i 've lived in britain and i 've studied there , and i 've always felt 100 % at home there .
i also have my identity as a falkland islander , which is a strong thing and a part of who i am , but i do n't suppose it counts as a nationality .
despite the proximity of argentina , i have never been .
there 's no political or moral reason behind this ; i 'd like to go to buenos aires , and one day i 'm sure i will , but with the whole of south america on my doorstop , there 's a lot of places i plan to go .
on top of this , much of my annual leave is used just visiting britain to see family and friends , limiting time for travel .
as regards feeling awkward in the presence of an argentine war veteran , you should n't feel half as awkward as the members of the argentine government who sent under-prepared soldiers to fight a war in the name of jingoism and government popularity , and then treated them badly when they came home .
this also applies , though to a lesser extent , to the argentine public whom i believe would rather have forgotten their injured and defeated soldiers than live and work alongside them .
daniel fowler , aquaculture scientist , stanley .
return to top how are the falklands governed ?
the building of government house began in 1845 q : how are the islands governed ?
do they have an elected parliament , or an -lrb- elected -rrb- person representing their interests at westminster ?
mark newbury , tynemouth ... and do falklanders pay uk taxes ?
mark linehan , cardiff , wales a : the falkland islands are internally self-governing except for foreign affairs and defence .
we have a legislative assembly consisting of eight members , elected for four years .
they are responsible for passing laws and for the administration of the country , including the economy , health service , education and policing .
the falkland islands are economically self-sufficient save for the cost of defence .
like other overseas territories we have a governor who is appointed by the foreign office for three to four years .
their responsibility is to be the conduit between the uk government and the falkland islands government -lrb- fig -rrb- , to consult with fig on foreign affairs and defence issues , and to advise fig on adherence to the uk 's international responsibilities .
the governor chairs the executive council -lrb- the cabinet -rrb- but it is the elected members who make decisions .
we do not have direct representation in westminster , but maintain an office in london which keeps close contact with parliament and its members , to keep them informed on issues in the falklands .
the falklands levies taxation for internal purposes .
we do not pay tax to the uk , nor do we receive any monies directly from the uk for any purpose .
councillor mike summers , falkland islands government .
return to top did anyone agree with argentine rule ?
q : did any of the islanders actually not mind the prospect of argentine rule ?
rowan hunter , teddington a : i was living at fox bay east on west falkland at the time of the invasion but i can assure you that only a very small handful of islanders in 1982 would have accepted the prospect of argentine rule .
the islands had been under pressure from argentina from many years to accept a change of sovereignty but the islanders strongly rejected this pressure .
for example , uk minister nicholas ridley visited the islands in november 1980 with the object of persuading the islanders to accept a hong kong-style ' lease back ' solution to the problem .
there were demonstrations in the streets of stanley rejecting this initiative , resulting in renewed demands to " keep the falkland islands british " from islanders .
towards the end of the conflict two islanders opted to leave to go to argentina - one had been working for the argentine authorities and the other was married to an argentine national .
it is interesting to note that there was a small number of argentine nationals who settled in the islands in the years prior to the conflict and who opted to remain in the islands where they made their homes .

below is a representative selection of the subjects covered in the hundreds of questions received .

signs of war ?
q : is there still any physical evidence of the conflict visible in and around the towns and countryside ?
mark hellewell , united kingdom a : yes , the most obvious signs are the minefields .
these are well fenced and marked , and do not present a danger to life , but they are a constant reminder of the war .
traces of conflict in pictures a feasibility study on mine clearance , carried out at the university of cranfield , concluded that 100 % clearance of the estimated 20,000 mines was feasible .
as signatories of the ottawa convention banning anti-personnel mines , the uk is obliged to fund the clearance by 2009 .
many falkland islanders , and the fi government , have said they would prefer the minefields to be left alone and the money be given over to countries in more need , such as sierra leone .
the reasons include : the cost to the uk taxpayer , which we guess could run into tens of millions ; the safety of the mine clearance teams ; the environmental impact and the logistical upheaval within a limited infrastructure .
everyone knows where the minefields are , and they are mostly on land of little economic value .
we have made our views known through the foreign office , but ultimately the decision lies with the uk government .
elsewhere there are many memories of the fighting - most obvious is wreckage from fighter planes and helicopters .
if you walk up mount tumbledown , just outside stanley , you will see dug-outs , an old argentine field kitchen , barbed wire and discarded argentine army boots .
live ammunition still turns up from time to time .
richard davies , councillor for land use and environment , falkland islands government .
return to top are immigrants welcome ?
q : how easy is it to move to the falkland islands , and are immigrants welcome , whether with a profession or as a pensioner ?
if so , what are the professions that the islands need , and what are the costs of living there , including home purchase ?
greg , ipswich a : the falkland islands are part of the uk , but there is no automatic right for british visitors to settle here and overseas citizens may not purchase land without showing they are going to be able to support themselves and then getting a licence .
having said that , last year 's census showed only a third of residents were born here .
there are contracts for professionals sometimes advertised , usually for two or three years , and some contract workers settle here .
there are also people from saint helena and chile , who have become assimilated .
like with marmite , you love it or hate it here .
bear in mind that this place needs the full range of jobs for a modern country , including an airline with all local pilots , but has a population of only 3,000 .
regarding cost of living , some things are much more expensive , some much cheaper .
good wine is £ 3 a bottle , good fish £ 4 a kilo - but imports from the uk have to come 8,000 miles and that shows .
you can get a lot of house for your money , but most people build their own for about £ 100,000 .
there are very few re-sales but £ 110,000 is about the going rate , when one occurs .
there 's no vat and the top tax rate has just gone up to 26 % .
mark brunet , general manager , falkland islands development corporation .

q : how do they entertain themselves ?
what tv or radio stations do they have ?
where do they go for a weekend away or a holiday ?
which countries most influence their culture ?
argentina / south america for being so close or britain for being part of british territory ?
lydia chessum , near munich , germany a : falkland islanders enjoy a varied social life .
there are many pubs and restaurants in stanley and we also enjoy other events such as community theatre .
civilians can use the cinema and a bowling alley at the nearby military base .
the majority of locals enjoy the outdoors , fishing , golf , and horse riding , and we also have a very good leisure centre .
a lot of fundraising goes on in stanley , often resulting in dances .
the victory bar is one popular haunt we have a military tv channel which broadcasts programmes from britain .
some people also subscribe to cable channels from south america .
there is a local radio station and a military radio station .
it 's impossible to leave the falklands for just a weekend , but many locals will head out to camp -lrb- the countryside -rrb- for a few days .
nearly everybody has access to transport and insurance and fuel prices are low .
britain was always the most popular holiday destination as many have had family there or children at college / university .
south america is now becoming more popular with weekly flights ; santiago , chile , is popular for short breaks .
britain has had the strongest influence on our culture - the traditional red telephone boxes and letter boxes make stanley look like a little piece of britain .
the food is predominantly british-style , and people drive land rovers .
however , there are a number of chilean and saint helenian workers here and areas of their culture are becoming commonplace , especially the asado - meat roasted over a fire on a spit .

where do they go for a weekend away or a holiday ?
which countries most influence their culture ?
argentina / south america for being so close or britain for being part of british territory ?
lydia chessum , near munich , germany a : falkland islanders enjoy a varied social life .
there are many pubs and restaurants in stanley and we also enjoy other events such as community theatre .
civilians can use the cinema and a bowling alley at the nearby military base .
the majority of locals enjoy the outdoors , fishing , golf , and horse riding , and we also have a very good leisure centre .
a lot of fundraising goes on in stanley , often resulting in dances .
the victory bar is one popular haunt we have a military tv channel which broadcasts programmes from britain .
some people also subscribe to cable channels from south america .
there is a local radio station and a military radio station .
it 's impossible to leave the falklands for just a weekend , but many locals will head out to camp -lrb- the countryside -rrb- for a few days .
nearly everybody has access to transport and insurance and fuel prices are low .
britain was always the most popular holiday destination as many have had family there or children at college / university .
south america is now becoming more popular with weekly flights ; santiago , chile , is popular for short breaks .
britain has had the strongest influence on our culture - the traditional red telephone boxes and letter boxes make stanley look like a little piece of britain .
the food is predominantly british-style , and people drive land rovers .
however , there are a number of chilean and saint helenian workers here and areas of their culture are becoming commonplace , especially the asado - meat roasted over a fire on a spit .

return to top do they worry about losing the islands ?
q : do the islanders believe they are there to stay for generations to come , or do they worry about the situation de-stabilising , and britain losing the islands , either to force , or to politics ?
-lrb- for example , the handing back of hong kong in 1997 . -rrb-
luke thompson , gloucester , england a : i believe the majority of islanders see themselves here for generations and generations to come .
this , at least , is the ideal and optimistic view , and you ca n't be pessimistic about war and losing your right to self-determination , it is too sad .
i think it is unlikely the argentines will ever try to use force again , especially if our garrison here remains as it is - they would be foolish to try .
what people do worry about is changing politics .
what if , in years to come , the british government no longer has any concern regarding the falklands and finally bow to the sovereignty claims and hand the falklands to argentina ?
what if in generations to come the falkland islands government want us to be independent ?
we shun britain and argentina then does use force to take the islands it claims ?
i sincerely hope none of the above situations occur in my lifetime , but because we do want our future generations to be falkland islanders and british they are situations we do not want to come to fruition .
zoe luxton , veterinary officer , stanley return to top what happened to the oil ?
q : almost 10 years ago there was exploratory oil and gas drilling around the falklands .
nothing has happened since yet apparently incredibly rich oil sources were found .
in a world where the quest for hydrocarbons is becoming more intense , with deeper waters drilled and unstable regimes dictating supply , why has nothing further happened in the islands ?
does the lack of development have anything to do with the argentinean situation ?
jon bevan , swansea oil billions beckon falkland islands economy ... and was oil the real reason there was a war ?
jim pretty , eastleigh , hampshire a : in fact a great deal has happened since 1998 when the first wells were drilled in the falkland islands .
a group of independent companies have spent tens of millions of dollars on exploration in preparation for a second drilling phase .
this summer 3d and a 2d seismic survey have been carried out offshore and also a csem -lrb- controlled source electro-magnetic -rrb- survey .
the new data will now be interpreted to assist companies in locating more prospects for drilling .
low oil prices in 1998 -lrb- the price fell to as low as $ 11 a barrel -rrb- saw the larger companies with licences leave the area and now very high oil prices are hampering drilling due to the unavailability of drilling rigs that can be contracted to work in the south atlantic .
it is not unusual for remote frontier areas to take several decades for exploration to proceed .
the delay has not been caused by argentine claims to sovereignty .
it is not believed in the falkland islands that the reason for the war in 1982 was over oil .
it is believed that the war was about sovereignty of the islands .
after the invasion the uk government took the decision to retake the islands to ensure that british subjects could exercise their right to self-determination .
phyl rendell , director of minerals and agriculture , falkland islands government .
return to top has there been a decline in respect and manners ?
q : are there issues , as in england , where there has been a severe decline in general manners and respect for other people over the last 25 years ?
steve yates , stockport a : overall , a healthy level of respect for one another exists in the falklands and people certainly care for each other .
with modern communications and comforts , there is less need for people to rely on each other as they might have done 25 years ago but , if something goes wrong for a family , everyone still steps in to help .
as with the uk , the older generation feels young people in the falklands do n't have the respect for their elders that they should and this is something people are aware we need to watch out for .
however , we are not in the same situation as the uk : everyone - yes , even teenagers - still greet each other in the street and wave as they drive by .

return to top what accent do the islanders have ?
q : what accent / dialects do the falkland islanders possess ?
ian , lowestoft , united kingdom a : i first noticed an accent just before i arrived in the falkland islands -lsb- in 2006 -rsb- when i met a couple of people who were in the uk visiting friends .
it was hard to place the accent at first but on meeting more people when i arrived here , it seems to be a bit of a mixture of new zealand / australia and the south west of england !
but there seems to be quite a range of different accents , which is understandable as there are many different nationalities on the islands .
the children i teach do n't seem to have strong accents , it must be something that develops over time .
a lot of the children have mixed backgrounds too - some have one parent from the falklands and the other from somewhere like st helena , chile or some other country .
having lived here a while , i reckon you could tell a falkland islander if you spoke to them outside of the islands .
kate williams , teacher , stanley infant and junior school . -lsb- originally from aberdyfi , wales -rsb- return to top what nationality do they feel they are ?
some are more keen than others to make their feelings known q : what nationality do they actually feel ?
they live so close to argentina , do they go there often ?
when i was in argentina a few years ago , people on the trains would come through asking for money , having been injured as soldiers in ' las malvinas ' .
should i have felt awkward in that situation being british ?
frances lond-caulk , mexico city , mexico a : i feel british .
i 've lived in britain and i 've studied there , and i 've always felt 100 % at home there .
i also have my identity as a falkland islander , which is a strong thing and a part of who i am , but i do n't suppose it counts as a nationality .
despite the proximity of argentina , i have never been .
there 's no political or moral reason behind this ; i 'd like to go to buenos aires , and one day i 'm sure i will , but with the whole of south america on my doorstop , there 's a lot of places i plan to go .
on top of this , much of my annual leave is used just visiting britain to see family and friends , limiting time for travel .
as regards feeling awkward in the presence of an argentine war veteran , you should n't feel half as awkward as the members of the argentine government who sent under-prepared soldiers to fight a war in the name of jingoism and government popularity , and then treated them badly when they came home .
this also applies , though to a lesser extent , to the argentine public whom i believe would rather have forgotten their injured and defeated soldiers than live and work alongside them .

return to top how are the falklands governed ?
the building of government house began in 1845 q : how are the islands governed ?
do they have an elected parliament , or an -lrb- elected -rrb- person representing their interests at westminster ?
mark newbury , tynemouth ... and do falklanders pay uk taxes ?
mark linehan , cardiff , wales a : the falkland islands are internally self-governing except for foreign affairs and defence .
we have a legislative assembly consisting of eight members , elected for four years .
they are responsible for passing laws and for the administration of the country , including the economy , health service , education and policing .
the falkland islands are economically self-sufficient save for the cost of defence .
like other overseas territories we have a governor who is appointed by the foreign office for three to four years .
their responsibility is to be the conduit between the uk government and the falkland islands government -lrb- fig -rrb- , to consult with fig on foreign affairs and defence issues , and to advise fig on adherence to the uk 's international responsibilities .
the governor chairs the executive council -lrb- the cabinet -rrb- but it is the elected members who make decisions .
we do not have direct representation in westminster , but maintain an office in london which keeps close contact with parliament and its members , to keep them informed on issues in the falklands .
the falklands levies taxation for internal purposes .
we do not pay tax to the uk , nor do we receive any monies directly from the uk for any purpose .
councillor mike summers , falkland islands government .
return to top did anyone agree with argentine rule ?
q : did any of the islanders actually not mind the prospect of argentine rule ?
rowan hunter , teddington a : i was living at fox bay east on west falkland at the time of the invasion but i can assure you that only a very small handful of islanders in 1982 would have accepted the prospect of argentine rule .
the islands had been under pressure from argentina from many years to accept a change of sovereignty but the islanders strongly rejected this pressure .
for example , uk minister nicholas ridley visited the islands in november 1980 with the object of persuading the islanders to accept a hong kong-style ' lease back ' solution to the problem .
there were demonstrations in the streets of stanley rejecting this initiative , resulting in renewed demands to " keep the falkland islands british " from islanders .
towards the end of the conflict two islanders opted to leave to go to argentina - one had been working for the argentine authorities and the other was married to an argentine national .
it is interesting to note that there was a small number of argentine nationals who settled in the islands in the years prior to the conflict and who opted to remain in the islands where they made their homes .

below is a representative selection of the subjects covered in the hundreds of questions received .
answers and viewpoints were provided by a range of falkland islands residents , expats , commentators and officials .
scroll down or click on the links below to choose a question .
signs of war ?
q : is there still any physical evidence of the conflict visible in and around the towns and countryside ?
mark hellewell , united kingdom a : yes , the most obvious signs are the minefields .
these are well fenced and marked , and do not present a danger to life , but they are a constant reminder of the war .
a feasibility study on mine clearance , carried out at the university of cranfield , concluded that 100 % clearance of the estimated 20,000 mines was feasible .
as signatories of the ottawa convention banning anti-personnel mines , the uk is obliged to fund the clearance by 2009 .
many falkland islanders , and the fi government , have said they would prefer the minefields to be left alone and the money be given over to countries in more need , such as sierra leone .
the reasons include : the cost to the uk taxpayer , which we guess could run into tens of millions ; the safety of the mine clearance teams ; the environmental impact and the logistical upheaval within a limited infrastructure .
everyone knows where the minefields are , and they are mostly on land of little economic value .
we have made our views known through the foreign office , but ultimately the decision lies with the uk government .
elsewhere there are many memories of the fighting - most obvious is wreckage from fighter planes and helicopters .
if you walk up mount tumbledown , just outside stanley , you will see dug-outs , an old argentine field kitchen , barbed wire and discarded argentine army boots .
live ammunition still turns up from time to time .
richard davies , councillor for land use and environment , falkland islands government .
are immigrants welcome ?
q : how easy is it to move to the falkland islands , and are immigrants welcome , whether with a profession or as a pensioner ?
if so , what are the professions that the islands need , and what are the costs of living there , including home purchase ?
greg , ipswich a : the falkland islands are part of the uk , but there is no automatic right for british visitors to settle here and overseas citizens may not purchase land without showing they are going to be able to support themselves and then getting a licence .
having said that , last year 's census showed only a third of residents were born here .
there are contracts for professionals sometimes advertised , usually for two or three years , and some contract workers settle here .
there are also people from saint helena and chile , who have become assimilated .
like with marmite , you love it or hate it here .
bear in mind that this place needs the full range of jobs for a modern country , including an airline with all local pilots , but has a population of only 3,000 .
regarding cost of living , some things are much more expensive , some much cheaper .
good wine is £ 3 a bottle , good fish £ 4 a kilo - but imports from the uk have to come 8,000 miles and that shows .
you can get a lot of house for your money , but most people build their own for about £ 100,000 .
there are very few re-sales but £ 110,000 is about the going rate , when one occurs .
there 's no vat and the top tax rate has just gone up to 26 % .

bbc wales 's eye on wales has spoken to ex-servicemen who have struggled to cope after serving in the armed forces .
scores of welsh guards were caught up in the bombing of the troop ship the sir galahad during the falklands war .
the assembly government said it would consider a meeting to discuss proposals for a treatment centre in wales .
as survivors of the war prepare to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the argentine surrender this month , eye on wales reveals that charity combat stress - the only organisation offering specialist residential treatment for ex-combat veterans - is considering opening a new treatment centre in wales .
since the closure of the uk 's military hospitals , it has provided a safety net for hundreds of ex-servicemen and women suffering post-traumatic stress disorder -lrb- ptsd -rrb- , depression , alcoholism , drug dependency and other mental difficulties .
the charity runs three treatment centres , providing a total of 90 beds in shropshire , surrey and ayr in scotland .
wales 's sole specialist ptsd centre caters only for patients from cardiff and the vale , and many veterans face a postcode lottery in trying to find the appropriate help and support in the community .
commodore toby elliott , chief executive of combat stress , said : " typically , eight years ago we had about 300 cases referred to us , but last year we had 965 new cases and this year , it looks as if it 's going to be even greater than that . "
he added that it can take " many years " for ex-servicemen to realise they need help , and he claimed that the nhs did not " really understand them and ca n't cope with them " .
former welsh guardsman chris duggan , diagnosed with ptsd after the falklands , has benefited from the care provided by combat stress .
mr duggan , from swansea , said : " the facilities and treatment centre is amazing , but the main thing about combat stress is that you 're there with people who have served in the forces , who have psychological problems . "
a welsh assembly government spokesman told eye on wales they would consider any approaches from combat stress to discuss proposals for a treatment centre in wales .

bbc wales 's eye on wales has spoken to ex-servicemen who have struggled to cope after serving in the armed forces .
scores of welsh guards were caught up in the bombing of the troop ship the sir galahad during the falklands war .
the assembly government said it would consider a meeting to discuss proposals for a treatment centre in wales .
as survivors of the war prepare to commemorate the 25th anniversary of the argentine surrender this month , eye on wales reveals that charity combat stress - the only organisation offering specialist residential treatment for ex-combat veterans - is considering opening a new treatment centre in wales .
since the closure of the uk 's military hospitals , it has provided a safety net for hundreds of ex-servicemen and women suffering post-traumatic stress disorder -lrb- ptsd -rrb- , depression , alcoholism , drug dependency and other mental difficulties .
forty-eight welsh guards died when the sir galahad was attacked the charity runs three treatment centres , providing a total of 90 beds in shropshire , surrey and ayr in scotland .
wales 's sole specialist ptsd centre caters only for patients from cardiff and the vale , and many veterans face a postcode lottery in trying to find the appropriate help and support in the community .
commodore toby elliott , chief executive of combat stress , said : " typically , eight years ago we had about 300 cases referred to us , but last year we had 965 new cases and this year , it looks as if it 's going to be even greater than that . "
he added that it can take " many years " for ex-servicemen to realise they need help , and he claimed that the nhs did not " really understand them and ca n't cope with them " .
former welsh guardsman chris duggan , diagnosed with ptsd after the falklands , has benefited from the care provided by combat stress .
mr duggan , from swansea , said : " the facilities and treatment centre is amazing , but the main thing about combat stress is that you 're there with people who have served in the forces , who have psychological problems . "

a study showed using the drug with chemotherapy before surgery completely eradicated tumours in 43 % of patients with her-2 positive breast cancer .
this was almost twice as many as for patients treated only with chemotherapy - 23 % of these showed the same effect .
the findings were reported to the american society for clinical oncology .
herceptin is currently used after surgery in women with her-2 positive breast cancer to prevent tumours returning .
about a quarter of the 44,000 breast cancer patients in the uk each year have her-2 positive tumours , which are particularly aggressive and likely to return .
normally women with large tumours are treated with chemotherapy to shrink the tumours so that operations can be performed with less risk of having to remove the whole breast .
tumours shrunk in the new research scientists studied 228 patients with her-2 positive breast cancer .
115 patients received chemotherapy plus herceptin for one year , and 113 patients received chemotherapy alone , before surgery .
taking herceptin made the shrinking more likely , as well as eradicating the tumours completely in many cases .
in 38 % pf patients tumours which had spread to other parts of the body were also removed .
this is very welcome news for patients with a particularly aggressive form of breast cancer dr andrew wardley professor alex markham , cancer research uk 's senior medical advisor , said it was encouraging that the cancer was eradicated from the lymph nodes of some patients .
he said the results of the study were exciting , but he added that it had only included a relatively small number of patients .
long-term survival dr andrew wardley , consultant medical oncologist at christie hospital , manchester , said the results added to the already substantial evidence supporting the use of herceptin .
he said : " this is very welcome news for patients with a particularly aggressive form of breast cancer , some of whom will no longer face the prospect of losing their breasts . "
he added that treating cancer early with herceptin to eradicate it could have important implications for long-term survival .
the research was carried out by cancer organisation group solti , and drug manufacturer roche .

photo by patrick eagar .
enlarge image through the carefully trimmed foliage , st paul 's majestic dome appears no larger than a thumbnail .
seen from 10 miles away , london 's iconic cathedral seems to hover in the distance like a mirage , shimmering in the heat .
this unique " viewing corridor " from king henry viii 's mound , down a specially maintained tree-lined avenue , has been a feature of richmond park in south-west london , since the early 1700s .
with the surrounding modern buildings carefully hidden by the holly hedging , this " key hole " view of the 18th century landmark from the park is like a window to london 's past .
but heritage campaigners fear new planning laws - introduced by london mayor ken livingstone and rubber-stamped by communities secretary ruth kelly - mean sir christopher wren 's masterpiece could end up crowded out by sky-scrapers .
under the new planning rules , the so-called viewing corridor has been narrowed from a width of 150m to 70m .
it is one of ten historic views which have been narrowed - freeing up patches of the city for development where it is currently banned .
see how london 's views have changed " in terms of heritage , it 's vandalism , " said tony arbour , chairman of the london assembly 's planning committee .
campaigners want to save the views arguing they are part of the city 's heritage and its present-day charm .
' high density ' planning laws were initially relaxed in the 1960s but restrictions were brought in later in the face of rapid urbanisation .
ten strategic views of st paul 's cathedral and the palace of westminster were enshrined in the statute books in 1991 .
london has successfully mixed old and new but the new guidance threatens this balance hal moggridge landscape architect but mr livingstone believes the rules need to be relaxed once again to meet the demands of a growing and vibrant city .
according to the greater london authority , london needs to accommodate another 600,000 workers in the next decade .
the mayor favours " high-density " developments in the city and the docklands over the prospect of a never-ending low-rise sprawl .
construction is about to begin on a 47-storey tower in the city of london , dubbed the " cheesegrater " .
at london bridge station , developers are pressing ahead with the " shard " , which at 310m -lrb- 1,017ft -rrb- will be europe 's tallest skyscraper .
under the mayor 's plans , several new strategic views have been identified , taking the number of vistas protected under planning laws to 26 .
secretary of state for communities and local government , ruth kelly , approved the changes contained in the london view management framework , which take effect from 13 july .
in the consultation preceding the decision , 51 % of respondents , including english heritage , objected to the proposals .
the agency said the new rules failed to stress the importance of the views or how new developments within them will be assessed .
emotional appeal landscape architect hal moggridge , former consultant for the inner london royal parks , said the new rules could " ruin the city 's skyline " .
" people see cities in relation to particular views they know .
it seems to be how cities are identified .
" they are iconic views for the most part and therefore have an emotional appeal .
" london has successfully mixed old and new but the new guidance threatens this balance . "
st paul 's encapsulates the great architectural past of london tony arbour london assembly member the mayor said the viewing corridors needed to be narrowed to meet increasing demand for new homes and jobs .
a spokesman for his office said : " the changes to these corridors will in no way detract from peoples ' enjoyment of st paul 's and the palace of westminster .
" the framework ensures that no new buildings will be allowed to block the protected views of london 's most famous landmarks . "
the spokesman said taller buildings must be considered in some locations to meet demand created by the city 's growth .
' fragile view ' several developers are understood to have been awaiting ms kelly 's ruling before pushing ahead with major central london developments .
legal & general -lrb- l & g -rrb- said its plans for walbrook square , a large mixed development in queen victoria street , hinged on the ruling .

seen from 10 miles away , london 's iconic cathedral seems to hover in the distance like a mirage , shimmering in the heat .
this unique " viewing corridor " from king henry viii 's mound , down a specially maintained tree-lined avenue , has been a feature of richmond park in south-west london , since the early 1700s .
with the surrounding modern buildings carefully hidden by the holly hedging , this " key hole " view of the 18th century landmark from the park is like a window to london 's past .
but heritage campaigners fear new planning laws - introduced by london mayor ken livingstone and rubber-stamped by communities secretary ruth kelly - mean sir christopher wren 's masterpiece could end up crowded out by sky-scrapers .
under the new planning rules , the so-called viewing corridor has been narrowed from a width of 150m to 70m .
it is one of ten historic views which have been narrowed - freeing up patches of the city for development where it is currently banned .
see how london 's views have changed " in terms of heritage , it 's vandalism , " said tony arbour , chairman of the london assembly 's planning committee .
campaigners want to save the views arguing they are part of the city 's heritage and its present-day charm .
' high density ' planning laws were initially relaxed in the 1960s but restrictions were brought in later in the face of rapid urbanisation .
ten strategic views of st paul 's cathedral and the palace of westminster were enshrined in the statute books in 1991 .
london has successfully mixed old and new but the new guidance threatens this balance hal moggridge landscape architect but mr livingstone believes the rules need to be relaxed once again to meet the demands of a growing and vibrant city .
according to the greater london authority , london needs to accommodate another 600,000 workers in the next decade .
the mayor favours " high-density " developments in the city and the docklands over the prospect of a never-ending low-rise sprawl .
construction is about to begin on a 47-storey tower in the city of london , dubbed the " cheesegrater " .
at london bridge station , developers are pressing ahead with the " shard " , which at 310m -lrb- 1,017ft -rrb- will be europe 's tallest skyscraper .
under the mayor 's plans , several new strategic views have been identified , taking the number of vistas protected under planning laws to 26 .
secretary of state for communities and local government , ruth kelly , approved the changes contained in the london view management framework , which take effect from 13 july .
in the consultation preceding the decision , 51 % of respondents , including english heritage , objected to the proposals .
the agency said the new rules failed to stress the importance of the views or how new developments within them will be assessed .
emotional appeal landscape architect hal moggridge , former consultant for the inner london royal parks , said the new rules could " ruin the city 's skyline " .
" people see cities in relation to particular views they know .

higher education minister bill rammell said the review provided a helpful contribution to a particularly complex and sensitive subject .
" the effective and accurate delivery of islamic studies within our universities is important for a multitude of reasons including wider community cohesion and preventing violent extremism in the name of islam , " he said .
this was why an extra £ 1m was being invested in the training of imams and why islamic studies was being designated a " strategic subject " , he added .
' major shift ' a strategic subject is one where it is in the national interest to safeguard research and graduates with the right knowledge and skills .
science and engineering subjects are designated strategic subjects .
mr rammell added that dr siddiqui 's review , as well as other reports and conferences on islam in higher education , suggested islamic studies departments were concentrating too much on a middle eastern focus and ignore the realities of islam in modern multi-cultural britain .
the dfes can not say how many people are studying islam at university , but currently there are 44 higher education courses with islamic studies in the title being taught .
spokesman for the federation of student islamic societies faisal hanjra said the government were wrong to try to use the teaching of islam as a tool to deal with extremism and radicalisation .
he said : " the vast majority of muslims do n't learn their islam from universities , they learn it from the imams in their local communities .
" there 's no evidence at all to suggest that students are being radicalised or anything of that nature . "
monitoring muslim students in his report , dr siddiqui says discussion about the teaching of islam in higher education has been conducted " in complete ignorance of the muslim community and their patterns of belief and practice " .
he also says that " a major shift of focus " from " an arab and middle eastern perspective to that of a plural society in britain is needed " .
the report concludes that islamic studies syllabuses should focus on aspects of islam " relevant to contemporary practice of faith " .
students should be able to learn parts of the syllabus from islamic scholars , it adds .
it also calls for more recognition of the importance of campus islamic societies and more prayer facilities .
the publication of the report comes after a unanimous vote by the university and college union last week urged lecturers not to meet government demands to inform on pupils suspected of extremism .

higher education minister bill rammell said the review provided a helpful contribution to a particularly complex and sensitive subject .
" the effective and accurate delivery of islamic studies within our universities is important for a multitude of reasons including wider community cohesion and preventing violent extremism in the name of islam , " he said .
this was why an extra £ 1m was being invested in the training of imams and why islamic studies was being designated a " strategic subject " , he added .
' major shift ' a strategic subject is one where it is in the national interest to safeguard research and graduates with the right knowledge and skills .
science and engineering subjects are designated strategic subjects .
mr rammell added that dr siddiqui 's review , as well as other reports and conferences on islam in higher education , suggested islamic studies departments were concentrating too much on a middle eastern focus and ignore the realities of islam in modern multi-cultural britain .
the dfes can not say how many people are studying islam at university , but currently there are 44 higher education courses with islamic studies in the title being taught .
spokesman for the federation of student islamic societies faisal hanjra said the government were wrong to try to use the teaching of islam as a tool to deal with extremism and radicalisation .
he said : " the vast majority of muslims do n't learn their islam from universities , they learn it from the imams in their local communities .
" there 's no evidence at all to suggest that students are being radicalised or anything of that nature . "
monitoring muslim students in his report , dr siddiqui says discussion about the teaching of islam in higher education has been conducted " in complete ignorance of the muslim community and their patterns of belief and practice " .
he also says that " a major shift of focus " from " an arab and middle eastern perspective to that of a plural society in britain is needed " .
the report concludes that islamic studies syllabuses should focus on aspects of islam " relevant to contemporary practice of faith " .
students should be able to learn parts of the syllabus from islamic scholars , it adds .
it also calls for more recognition of the importance of campus islamic societies and more prayer facilities .
the publication of the report comes after a unanimous vote by the university and college union last week urged lecturers not to meet government demands to inform on pupils suspected of extremism .
' intellectual rigour ' the government had asked lecturers to monitor the activity of muslim students and to report any suspicious behaviour .
education spokesman for the muslim council of britain tahir alam said he did not agree that islamic studies were being taught with a complete disregard of modern events .
" there has been a trend that the subject is taught as a foreign element and it is also important that it is taught a domestic element as well , " he added .
president of the vice-chancellor 's group , universities uk , professor drummond bone said it will be for the relevant academic community to debate any future changes to the teaching of islamic studies .
but he added : " it is important that all academic disciplines follow the normal quality procedures which ensure critical intellectual rigour and openness . "

academic ataullah siddiqui 's review paints a picture of islamic studies departments where the post-9/11 and 7 july world has largely passed them by .
it argues that more emphasis should be placed on islam in a modern context .
ministers will now label islamic studies a " strategic subject " because of its role " in preventing extremism " .
the effective and accurate delivery of islamic studies within our universities is important for a multitude of reasons should islamic studies be re-thought ?
bill rammell the review was commissioned by the dfes to assess the way in which islam is taught and to improve support and advice available to muslim students .
it was published as tony blair prepared to give a speech on islam and the importance of british muslims in london .
higher education minister bill rammell said the review provided a helpful contribution to a particularly complex and sensitive subject .
" the effective and accurate delivery of islamic studies within our universities is important for a multitude of reasons including wider community cohesion and preventing violent extremism in the name of islam , " he said .
this was why an extra £ 1m was being invested in the training of imams and why islamic studies was being designated a " strategic subject " , he added .
' major shift ' a strategic subject is one where it is in the national interest to safeguard research and graduates with the right knowledge and skills .
science and engineering subjects are designated strategic subjects .
mr rammell added that dr siddiqui 's review , as well as other reports and conferences on islam in higher education , suggested islamic studies departments were concentrating too much on a middle eastern focus and ignore the realities of islam in modern multi-cultural britain .
the dfes can not say how many people are studying islam at university , but currently there are 44 higher education courses with islamic studies in the title being taught .
spokesman for the federation of student islamic societies faisal hanjra said the government were wrong to try to use the teaching of islam as a tool to deal with extremism and radicalisation .
he said : " the vast majority of muslims do n't learn their islam from universities , they learn it from the imams in their local communities .
" there 's no evidence at all to suggest that students are being radicalised or anything of that nature . "
monitoring muslim students in his report , dr siddiqui says discussion about the teaching of islam in higher education has been conducted " in complete ignorance of the muslim community and their patterns of belief and practice " .
he also says that " a major shift of focus " from " an arab and middle eastern perspective to that of a plural society in britain is needed " .
the report concludes that islamic studies syllabuses should focus on aspects of islam " relevant to contemporary practice of faith " .
students should be able to learn parts of the syllabus from islamic scholars , it adds .
it also calls for more recognition of the importance of campus islamic societies and more prayer facilities .
the publication of the report comes after a unanimous vote by the university and college union last week urged lecturers not to meet government demands to inform on pupils suspected of extremism .
' intellectual rigour ' the government had asked lecturers to monitor the activity of muslim students and to report any suspicious behaviour .
education spokesman for the muslim council of britain tahir alam said he did not agree that islamic studies were being taught with a complete disregard of modern events .
" there has been a trend that the subject is taught as a foreign element and it is also important that it is taught a domestic element as well , " he added .
president of the vice-chancellor 's group , universities uk , professor drummond bone said it will be for the relevant academic community to debate any future changes to the teaching of islamic studies .
but he added : " it is important that all academic disciplines follow the normal quality procedures which ensure critical intellectual rigour and openness . "

a leeds team found a lack of oxygen in the brain , which occurs during strokes or even in heavy snorers , can affect brain cells called astrocytes .
the changes to the cells let glutamate , a neurotransmitter , build up - which could contribute to alzheimer 's .
the journal of neuroscience study may help scientists prevent alzheimer 's .
under normal circumstances astrocytes mop up glutamate in the brain .
however , the leeds team found a lack of oxygen decreased the expression of proteins required by the cells to carry out this task .
even though the patient may outwardly recover , the hidden cell damage may be irreversible professor chris peers glutamate is toxic if allowed to build up in high levels , so the accumulation could lead to brain cell death , and eventually to the onset of alzheimer 's .
lead researcher professor chris peers said the study was important as it suggested why beta amyloid , the protein that builds up in the brains of alzheimer 's patients , is key to the process of triggering disease .
an important link it is already known that low oxygen can cause astrocytes to increase their production of beta amyloid .
the latest research suggests it may be this increased production of beta amyloid that blocks expression of the proteins needed for astrocytes to mop up excess glutamate .
professor peers said : " this is an important factor in what 's going on in hypoxic brains .
" even though the patient may outwardly recover , the hidden cell damage may be irreversible . "
" it could even be an issue for people who snore heavily , whose sleep patterns are such that there will be times in the night when their brain is hypoxic - deprived of sufficient oxygen . "
mechanism important professor susanne sorensen , head of research at the alzheimer 's society , said : " the team examined the role of cells that support neurones in the brain .

a leeds team found a lack of oxygen in the brain , which occurs during strokes or even in heavy snorers , can affect brain cells called astrocytes .
the changes to the cells let glutamate , a neurotransmitter , build up - which could contribute to alzheimer 's .
the journal of neuroscience study may help scientists prevent alzheimer 's .
under normal circumstances astrocytes mop up glutamate in the brain .
however , the leeds team found a lack of oxygen decreased the expression of proteins required by the cells to carry out this task .
even though the patient may outwardly recover , the hidden cell damage may be irreversible professor chris peers glutamate is toxic if allowed to build up in high levels , so the accumulation could lead to brain cell death , and eventually to the onset of alzheimer 's .
lead researcher professor chris peers said the study was important as it suggested why beta amyloid , the protein that builds up in the brains of alzheimer 's patients , is key to the process of triggering disease .
an important link it is already known that low oxygen can cause astrocytes to increase their production of beta amyloid .
the latest research suggests it may be this increased production of beta amyloid that blocks expression of the proteins needed for astrocytes to mop up excess glutamate .
professor peers said : " this is an important factor in what 's going on in hypoxic brains .
" even though the patient may outwardly recover , the hidden cell damage may be irreversible . "
" it could even be an issue for people who snore heavily , whose sleep patterns are such that there will be times in the night when their brain is hypoxic - deprived of sufficient oxygen . "
mechanism important professor susanne sorensen , head of research at the alzheimer 's society , said : " the team examined the role of cells that support neurones in the brain .
" this is exciting because rather than focussing on neurones they looked at processes in the brain , which until now have not be researched in so much detail . "
co-author dr hugh pearson said : " for most forms of alzheimer 's we do n't know what the underlying factor that makes people develop it is . "
he said that understanding processses that link having the stroke and developing alzheimer 's they could help with the development of treatments to intervene and so decrease the number of alzheimer 's cases .

the charge would apply only to routine appointments and not emergencies , says the motion to be proposed at a british medical association gps ' conference .
doctors said patients using surgeries at such times tended to be in employment and could afford to pay .
but patients branded the idea a scandal and the government said it would not be introducing payments for care .
the motion , put forward by a group of family doctors from across the country , states : " resources for routine care outside core hours should be partially or wholly provided by a fee charged to the patient . "
a fee of between £ 15 and £ 20 has been suggested .

the idea comes amid widespread criticism for gps over their high salaries .
about a third of their pay now comes from bonuses for meeting targets on objectives such as reducing disease after a new contract started in 2004 .
in the first year of the deal , earnings rose by a third , breaking through the £ 100,000 barrier in the process .
dr andrew green , a gp from hedon , yorkshire , said the problems experienced by some patients in full-time work in accessing their gps needed to be addressed in a way that would not impact the care offered to daytime patients .
he said while these patients needed to be served at more convenient times , this should not impact other patients .

" they are going to be people in employment , almost by definition , and to ask them to bear the extra costs seems reasonable . "

he described as non-existent the threat from iran that washington says the new system is designed to counter , suggesting it might be aimed at russia .
last week , russia said it had tested a ballistic missile to maintain " strategic balance " in the world .
the us says the system , to be placed in eastern europe , is not aimed at russia .
washington wants to deploy interceptor rockets in poland and a radar base in the czech republic to counter what it describes as a potential threat from " rogue states " such as iran and north korea .
' not our fault ' mr putin made his comments in an interview with foreign reporters ahead of the g8 meeting that starts in germany on wednesday .
we are being told the anti-missile defence system is targeted against something that does not exist - does n't it seem funny to you ?
president vladimir putin new discord set to last gorbachev criticises us us president george w bush is due to meet him at the three-day summit in the resort of heiligendamm .
the bbc 's rupert wingfield-hayes in moscow says if mr putin 's words are anything to go by the summit is likely to be stormy .
mr putin said he hoped us officials would change their minds about the missile defence plan .
" if this does n't happen , then we disclaim responsibility for our retaliatory steps , because it is not we who are the initiators of the new arms race which is undoubtedly brewing in europe , " he said .
see map of us missile defence bases mr putin said neither iran nor north korea had the weapons that the system was intended to shoot down .
" we are being told the anti-missile defence system is targeted against something that does not exist .
does n't it seem funny to you ? " he asked .
meanwhile top iranian security official ali larijani described the planned deployment as the " joke of the year " , adding that iranian missiles were not capable of reaching europe .
' new targets ' mr putin said a new arms race would be the fault of the us .
rather than simply demand lugovoi 's extradition , -lsb- the uk -rsb- should send enough evidence for the case to be taken to court vladimir putin litvinenko demand " foolish " he said washington had " altered the strategic balance " by unilaterally pulling out of the anti-ballistic missile -lrb- abm -rrb- treaty in 2002 .
" if the american nuclear potential grows in european territory , we will have to have new targets in europe , " mr putin said .
" it is up to our military to define these targets , in addition to defining the choice between ballistic and cruise missiles . "
last tuesday , russia tested an rs-24 missile that successfully struck its target 5,500km -lrb- 3,400 miles -rrb- away .
it was designed to evade missile defence systems , russia 's defence ministry said .
mr putin went on to accuse the west of hypocrisy in criticising russia 's human rights record .
he said the us was the main violator of freedoms and human rights around the world and that france , germany and britain had problems of their own .
finally he accused britain of foolishness in trying to extradite former kgb officer andrei lugovoi for the murder of alexander litvinenko , another former kgb agent and a critic of mr putin .

president vladimir putin new discord set to last gorbachev criticises us us president george w bush is due to meet him at the three-day summit in the resort of heiligendamm .
the bbc 's rupert wingfield-hayes in moscow says if mr putin 's words are anything to go by the summit is likely to be stormy .
mr putin said he hoped us officials would change their minds about the missile defence plan .
" if this does n't happen , then we disclaim responsibility for our retaliatory steps , because it is not we who are the initiators of the new arms race which is undoubtedly brewing in europe , " he said .

" we are being told the anti-missile defence system is targeted against something that does not exist .
does n't it seem funny to you ? " he asked .
meanwhile top iranian security official ali larijani described the planned deployment as the " joke of the year " , adding that iranian missiles were not capable of reaching europe .
' new targets ' mr putin said a new arms race would be the fault of the us .
rather than simply demand lugovoi 's extradition , -lsb- the uk -rsb- should send enough evidence for the case to be taken to court vladimir putin litvinenko demand " foolish " he said washington had " altered the strategic balance " by unilaterally pulling out of the anti-ballistic missile -lrb- abm -rrb- treaty in 2002 .
" if the american nuclear potential grows in european territory , we will have to have new targets in europe , " mr putin said .
" it is up to our military to define these targets , in addition to defining the choice between ballistic and cruise missiles . "
last tuesday , russia tested an rs-24 missile that successfully struck its target 5,500km -lrb- 3,400 miles -rrb- away .
it was designed to evade missile defence systems , russia 's defence ministry said .
mr putin went on to accuse the west of hypocrisy in criticising russia 's human rights record .
he said the us was the main violator of freedoms and human rights around the world and that france , germany and britain had problems of their own .
finally he accused britain of foolishness in trying to extradite former kgb officer andrei lugovoi for the murder of alexander litvinenko , another former kgb agent and a critic of mr putin .

tours to apartheid-era south africa , perennial ball-tampering rows , the fallout from england 's boycott of zimbabwe and the extraordinary bodyline series of the early 1930s all generated acres of press coverage .
but all pale in comparison with cricket 's darkest corner , the ongoing scandal of match fixing .
commentators have been quick to link woolmer 's death with the underworld .
conspiracy theories that he was silenced as he about to lift the lid on the world of match rigging have spread like wildfire .
in some countries , it is now more lucrative to engage in sports corruption than drug dealing or robbery lord condon year zero for cricket was 2000 .
before then , pakistan batsman salim malik 's reputation was as an elegant stroke-player with such guts that on one occasion he played with a broken arm .
after 2000 , malik was a cricketing pariah , banned for life for his part in alleged match fixing .
at the heart of cricketing 's worst problem is the status of gambling in the subcontinent .
without the option of legitimate betting , gamblers in cricket-mad south asia call on the services of illicit bookmakers .
those bookmakers are often in the pockets of gangsters .
and the sums of money involved are monstrous .
lord condon , former head of the metropolitan police and now the head of the international cricket council 's corruption unit , says up to $ 1bn can be gambled globally on a single one-day international such as a key world cup game .
much of that money will pass through the illicit bookmakers in places like mumbai and karachi , and the temptation to steer the odds in their favour is huge .
hansie is a god-fearing , intense cricketer - he would never succumb to such a thing bob woolmer before cronje admissions malik 's downfall came because australian stars shane warne , tim may and mark waugh accused him of offering them money to play badly during a tour of pakistan in 1994 .
warne and waugh eventually had their own run-ins with the authorities after it emerged they had accepted money from an indian bookmaker in exchange for information during the tour to sri lanka in the same year .
but it was the investigation , led by justice malik muhammad qayyum , into the numerous allegations against malik that was to provide a real body blow to cricket .
after justice qayyum 's report malik and fast bowler ata-ur rehman were banned for life .
he recommended six other players should be fined , including inzamam-ul-haq , waqar younis and wasim akram .
in december 2000 , the board of control for cricket in india completed its investigation of allegations of match fixing by handing life bans to former team captain and flamboyant batsman mohammad azharuddin and fellow test star ajay sharma .
dawood ibrahim accused of 1993 mumbai bombs linked to illegal bookmakers allegedly controls drugs and prostitution thought to be in hiding in pakistan all-rounder manoj prabhakar and batsman ajay jadeja were suspended for five years .
but perhaps the greatest cataclysm in the history of the sport came on 7 april 2000 when delhi police released transcripts of phone conversations between south african captain hansie cronje and businessman sanjay chawla .
the resolute cronje , like azharuddin and malik , was idolised by fans and fellow players alike .
woolmer , who had coached south africa , was one of many to initially defend the born-again christian against the charges .
" hansie is a god-fearing , intense cricketer .
he would never succumb to such a thing .
it beggars belief , " he said .
but within four days , cronje had made a 3am call to ali bacher , the head of south african cricket , to admit to receiving money from a bookmaker for forecasting .
he was sacked as captain .
the guardian summed up the mood of the time when it used the headline " we can no longer say it 's not cricket " .
the times simply said " cronje and cricket stare into abyss " .
in june , judge erwin king started south africa 's investigation into cronje 's corruption and the all-rounder soon admitted taking money to ask team-mates to play badly .
he denied ever fixing or throwing a match .
azharuddin wants to overturn his ban in his evidence both azharuddin and malik were accused of involvement with bookies .
herschelle gibbs admitted taking $ 15,000 from cronje to score under 20 runs in a match in india and accused his captain of offering bribes to get a match thrown .
gibbs and bowler henry williams were given short bans from international cricket , while cronje received a lifetime ban .
in june 2002 he died in an air crash .
in the autumn of 2000 , bookmaker mukesh " mk " gupta accused england wicketkeeper and former captain alec stewart of accepting money for information , something he vehemently denied .
he was later cleared by the england and wales cricket board .
former new zealand captain martin crowe and sri lankans aravinda da silva and arjuna ranatunga were also later cleared .
the same year also saw the appointment of condon as chief corruption investigator and he has become one of the key figures in the fight against match-fixing .
in may 2001 , his first report included allegations of murder , kidnap and drug use and condemned a climate of " silence , apathy , ignorance and fear " in the game .
he traced match fixing back to the 1970s .
speaking to the house of lords recently he said the rise of more varied methods of gambling , such as spread betting had made the opportunities for corruption more varied .
there was no need now for a risky proposition , like attempting to corrupt a whole team .
instead , the byzantine array of options in spread betting means bookmakers only need to get at one player .
malik went rapidly from hero to zero " the betting analogy that i often draw is that the corrupt sportsman creates the equivalent of knowing in advance when the roulette wheel is going to land on red or black , " said condon .
" imagine the betting potential if you knew that .
even better , by fixing a part of a sporting event - say , fixing to bowl two wides in a particular over of a cricket match - he creates the equivalent in betting terms of knowing in advance when the roulette wheel is going to land on an individual number , thus enabling a massive betting coup because of the long odds that you can obtain on such an event . "
the end result was that rather than satisfying themselves that they have stamped out corruption , the cricket authorities must be aware that they may never beat it .
" in some countries , it is now more lucrative to engage in sports corruption than drug dealing or robbery , " he noted .
west indies all-rounder marlon samuels is currently under investigation over allegations he supplied team information to indian bookmaker mukesh kochchar .
police in india believe kochchar may have links to india 's most notorious gangster dawood ibrahim .
the diminutive ibrahim , who is accused of masterminding the 1993 mumbai sectarian bombings that claimed the lives of 257 people , is thought to be a major figure in the world of illegal gambling .
rooting out both players , bookies , middlemen and gangsters has proved difficult over the years .
the bookmakers reportedly use networks of safe houses and constantly changing untraceable mobile phones to deal with customers .
and the gangsters pulling the strings are not above murder to ensure their profits .
a number of bookmakers are believed to have met violent ends , including south africa-based muhammad hanif " cadbury " kodvavi , killed and cut up in may 1999 .
corruption investigations have even affected cricket 's international minnows , with former kenyan captain maurice odumbe banned for five years in august 2004 for accepting a string of blandishments from bookmakers .
and sometimes , the authorities have seemed rather ambivalent in their attitude towards the very people they label cheats .
in november , ata-ur-rehman had his ban lifted by the icc , while azharuddin was feted as a hero of indian cricket by officials .
he has sat in the vip section of matches and also played in a veterans game .
azharuddin and malik both hope to have their bans lifted .
but whatever is proved in the woolmer case , the spectre of corruption will continue to dog the gentleman 's game for some time to come .

the 62-page report reiterated china 's aim to reduce energy use by a fifth before 2010 and increase the amount of renewable energy it produces .
but it also repeated beijing 's view that responsibility for climate change rests with rich westernised countries .
the report comes ahead of a g8 meeting that will focus on global warming .
germany , which is hosting the meeting of industrialised nations , is calling for a new un protocol on climate change to replace the kyoto pact when it expires in 2012 .
china 's role in the debate is crucial , as many analysts believe it could overtake the us this year as the world 's largest emitter of greenhouse gases .
' trailblazer ' china 's new national plan on climate change offered few new targets on reducing greenhouse gas emissions , but outlined how it intended to meet the goals it has already set , analysts say .
this includes the use of more wind , nuclear and hydro power as well as making coal-fired plants more efficient , the document outlined .
china 's emissions between 1994 and 2004 , china 's greenhouse gas emissions grew by 4 % a year china currently depends on coal to meet two-thirds of its energy needs it hopes to raise its use of renewable energy from 7 % to 10 % by 2010 china may overtake the us as the world 's largest emitter of greenhouse gases by the end of this year but it also stressed that the country 's first priority remained " sustainable development and poverty eradication " .
" china is a developing country .
although we do not have the obligation to cut emissions , it does not mean we do not want to shoulder our share of responsibilities , " ma kai , chairman of china 's national development and reform commission , said .
" we must reconcile the need for development with the need for environmental protection , " he said , adding that china wanted to " blaze a new path to industrialisation " .
he said rich countries were responsible for most of the greenhouse gases produced over the past century , and had an " unshirkable responsibility " to do more to tackle the problem .
" the international community should respect the developing countries ' right to develop , " he added .
the plan is a strong declaration of intentions , but so far china has missed almost every environmental target it has set itself , the bbc 's quentin sommerville in shanghai says .
political debate climate change is expected to be fiercely debated when china 's president hu jintao and other industrialised leaders meet in germany for the g8 on wednesday .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon has urged them to agree firm targets for cutting polluting emissions .
president hu will attend the g8 summit this week in a bbc interview , he said it was now up to the richest countries to show leadership on the issue .
" it will be tragic if we do n't take any action , " he said .

the 62-page report reiterated china 's aim to reduce energy use by a fifth before 2010 and increase the amount of renewable energy it produces .
but it also repeated beijing 's view that responsibility for climate change rests with rich westernised countries .
the report comes ahead of a g8 meeting that will focus on global warming .
germany , which is hosting the meeting of industrialised nations , is calling for a new un protocol on climate change to replace the kyoto pact when it expires in 2012 .
china 's role in the debate is crucial , as many analysts believe it could overtake the us this year as the world 's largest emitter of greenhouse gases .
' trailblazer ' china 's new national plan on climate change offered few new targets on reducing greenhouse gas emissions , but outlined how it intended to meet the goals it has already set , analysts say .
this includes the use of more wind , nuclear and hydro power as well as making coal-fired plants more efficient , the document outlined .
china 's emissions between 1994 and 2004 , china 's greenhouse gas emissions grew by 4 % a year china currently depends on coal to meet two-thirds of its energy needs it hopes to raise its use of renewable energy from 7 % to 10 % by 2010 china may overtake the us as the world 's largest emitter of greenhouse gases by the end of this year but it also stressed that the country 's first priority remained " sustainable development and poverty eradication " .
" china is a developing country .
although we do not have the obligation to cut emissions , it does not mean we do not want to shoulder our share of responsibilities , " ma kai , chairman of china 's national development and reform commission , said .
" we must reconcile the need for development with the need for environmental protection , " he said , adding that china wanted to " blaze a new path to industrialisation " .
he said rich countries were responsible for most of the greenhouse gases produced over the past century , and had an " unshirkable responsibility " to do more to tackle the problem .
" the international community should respect the developing countries ' right to develop , " he added .
the plan is a strong declaration of intentions , but so far china has missed almost every environmental target it has set itself , the bbc 's quentin sommerville in shanghai says .
political debate climate change is expected to be fiercely debated when china 's president hu jintao and other industrialised leaders meet in germany for the g8 on wednesday .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon has urged them to agree firm targets for cutting polluting emissions .
president hu will attend the g8 summit this week in a bbc interview , he said it was now up to the richest countries to show leadership on the issue .

this includes the use of more wind , nuclear and hydro power as well as making coal-fired plants more efficient , the document outlined .
china 's emissions between 1994 and 2004 , china 's greenhouse gas emissions grew by 4 % a year china currently depends on coal to meet two-thirds of its energy needs it hopes to raise its use of renewable energy from 7 % to 10 % by 2010 china may overtake the us as the world 's largest emitter of greenhouse gases by the end of this year but it also stressed that the country 's first priority remained " sustainable development and poverty eradication " .
" china is a developing country .
although we do not have the obligation to cut emissions , it does not mean we do not want to shoulder our share of responsibilities , " ma kai , chairman of china 's national development and reform commission , said .
" we must reconcile the need for development with the need for environmental protection , " he said , adding that china wanted to " blaze a new path to industrialisation " .
he said rich countries were responsible for most of the greenhouse gases produced over the past century , and had an " unshirkable responsibility " to do more to tackle the problem .
" the international community should respect the developing countries ' right to develop , " he added .
the plan is a strong declaration of intentions , but so far china has missed almost every environmental target it has set itself , the bbc 's quentin sommerville in shanghai says .
political debate climate change is expected to be fiercely debated when china 's president hu jintao and other industrialised leaders meet in germany for the g8 on wednesday .
un secretary-general ban ki-moon has urged them to agree firm targets for cutting polluting emissions .
in a bbc interview , he said it was now up to the richest countries to show leadership on the issue .
" it will be tragic if we do n't take any action , " he said .
" my main message is that to galvanise this political will at the leaders level so that we can take necessary action . "
the un secretary-general has made tackling climate change one of his top priorities , and called for a meeting of world leaders on the subject in september .
he wants the un to be in the lead when it comes to agreeing what should replace the kyoto protocol , the current agreement curbing greenhouse gases , when it expires in 2012 .
us president george w bush - whose country is the only industrialised nation apart from australia not to ratify the protocol - has proposed uniting a group of big emitters who would set non-binding targets by the end of next year .
but some analysts say this has been interpreted as a way of undercutting other initiatives - for example by the g8 or united nations .

this should include investment for african nations to develop biodiesel and ethanol , president lula told the bbc 's hardtalk programme .
brazil is a pioneer in producing ethanol vehicle fuel from sugar cane .
president lula has been invited to attend a g8 meeting in germany this week that will focus on global warming .
" rich countries have to pay for the poor countries to avoid deforestation so they can adopt clean models for development that do n't cause pollution or greenhouse gas emissions , " president lula said .
" that 's what i 'm going to discuss at the g8 meeting . "
he denied that brazilian plans to devote more land to ethanol production rather than food would put more pressure on the amazon rainforest and cause further deforestation .
" brazil has 440m hectares of land for agriculture .
sugar cane cultivation uses only 1 % of that .
soya bean uses only 4 % and cattle raising 29 % .
so the issue is not land , and it 's not even about the rainforest because the amazon is not a good area for sugar cane production , " he said .
brazil did not want to be the only country to grow sugar cane or biodiesel crops , he said .
rich countries should " start to help african countries to start to produce biodiesel and ethanol so that we can create jobs in africa and wealth " .
chavez criticism in a wide-ranging interview , president lula also spoke about brazil 's insistence on reform of the un security council and its desire for a permanent seat .
" we need to convince the world that there 's no reason latin america should not be represented on the security council , or that africa should not be represented and that important countries like india , germany or japan should not be members . "
the brazilian president also said he was optimistic that the doha round of world trade talks would reach agreement .
he would not be drawn on recent disagreements with venezuelan president hugo chavez .
last week , mr chavez accused the brazilian congress of acting like a " puppet " of the us after the senate in brasilia passed a motion urging him to reconsider his decision to revoke the licence of venezuelan television network rctv .
this prompted president lula on friday to tell his venezuelan counterpart to mind his own business .
but in the bbc interview , president lula insisted that venezuela was a partner of brazil .
" chavez has his own reasons to fight with the us .
and the us have their own reasons to fight with venezuela .
brazil has no reason to fight with the us and no reason to fight with venezuela , " he said .
president lula is currently in delhi for talks on boosting trade and ties between two of the world 's major emerging economies .

after putting the club in administration with debts of £ 35m on 4 may , mr bates required 75 % of creditors ' votes to buy the club back .
the recount showed that 75.2 % of creditors backed his plans to offer them just 1p in the £ 1 of debts owed .
his plan faced strong opposition at friday 's meeting , with some creditors backing rival offers .
" i am satisfied that , in voting to accept this proposal , the creditors have approved a solution that allows the club to plan ahead for next season , reduced uncertainty for all those with an interest in leeds united , provided some return to creditors and avoids liquidation , " said joint administrator richard fleming of kpmg .
relegation the administrators said last week that there were five consortia who had proved they had the funds in place to buy the stricken yorkshire club .
while kpmg refused to say who were mr bates ' rivals , local property developer simon morris and duncan revie , son of former manager don , had lodged an interest .
the football league issued a short statement , " noting the decision " of leeds ' creditors to approve the proposed company voluntary agreement -lrb- cva -rrb- .
" the league has confirmed to the administrator that conditions must be satisfied before the league board can consider transferring the club 's share in the football league to the new company , " it read .
" these conditions include the need for all ' football debts ' to be settled in full . "
the league will make no further comment during the 28 days it will take for the cva to be formalised .
during the 28-day period any creditor who wishes to dispute the sale can pursue the option of taking the matter to court .
" the important thing now is we make progress , " said mr bates .
" there 's been a suggestion of challenging what has happened , but you ca n't challenge for the sake of challenging , you have to have a reason .
" if someone decides to challenge what 's happened they will affect the running of leeds united - and we will take them on because we want to move forward . "
mr bates , formerly owner of chelsea , arrived at leeds utd in january 2005 , when he bought a 50 % stake .
the club went into administration last month , a move that meant it was docked 10 points which ensured its relegation to league one .
leeds utd 's financial problems stretch back several years .
in 2001 , leeds reached the semi-final of the european champions league , however , despite spending millions on players , the club failed to qualify for the competition in the following seasons .

after putting the club in administration with debts of £ 35m on 4 may , mr bates required 75 % of creditors ' votes to buy the club back .
the recount showed that 75.2 % of creditors backed his plans to offer them just 1p in the £ 1 of debts owed .
his plan faced strong opposition at friday 's meeting , with some creditors backing rival offers .
" i am satisfied that , in voting to accept this proposal , the creditors have approved a solution that allows the club to plan ahead for next season , reduced uncertainty for all those with an interest in leeds united , provided some return to creditors and avoids liquidation , " said joint administrator richard fleming of kpmg .
relegation the administrators said last week that there were five consortia who had proved they had the funds in place to buy the stricken yorkshire club .
while kpmg refused to say who were mr bates ' rivals , local property developer simon morris and duncan revie , son of former manager don , had lodged an interest .
the football league issued a short statement , " noting the decision " of leeds ' creditors to approve the proposed company voluntary agreement -lrb- cva -rrb- .
" the league has confirmed to the administrator that conditions must be satisfied before the league board can consider transferring the club 's share in the football league to the new company , " it read .
" these conditions include the need for all ' football debts ' to be settled in full . "
the league will make no further comment during the 28 days it will take for the cva to be formalised .
during the 28-day period any creditor who wishes to dispute the sale can pursue the option of taking the matter to court .
" the important thing now is we make progress , " said mr bates .
" there 's been a suggestion of challenging what has happened , but you ca n't challenge for the sake of challenging , you have to have a reason .
" if someone decides to challenge what 's happened they will affect the running of leeds united - and we will take them on because we want to move forward . "
mr bates , formerly owner of chelsea , arrived at leeds utd in january 2005 , when he bought a 50 % stake .
the club went into administration last month , a move that meant it was docked 10 points which ensured its relegation to league one .
