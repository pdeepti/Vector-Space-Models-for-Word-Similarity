the fact that former communist east germany 's government , with the help of its extensive network of spies and its dreaded stasi secret police , made life a living hell for many of its citizens is well known and documented - both in historic records and on the big screen in hugely successful dramas . but a recent film aired on german public network ard veered away from the fictional to reconstruct the real-life story of a gdr victim whose fight for justice remained a thorn in the side of both west and east germany for years . " the woman from checkpoint charlie " tells the story of jutta gallus , played by german actress veronica ferres .
a young , headstrong mother in east germany , gallus yearned to move to the free world on the other side of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film when jutta gallus , played by ferres , arrives in the west in 1982 , she tried to escape along with her two young daughters by pretending to be taking a vacation to eastern europe , where she hoped to emulate the example of countrymen who had managed to escape to the west through slightly less stringent border controls .
but her flight was foiled by the east german government and the family was forcibly separated .
gallus was thrown into prison , while her two daughters , aged 9 and 11 , were put in a children 's home .
free , but without her kids two years later , gallus was bought free by the west german government , a fairly common practice that earned the gdr regime much-needed hard currency in return for releasing mainly political prisoners .
she was , however , prevented by the regime from taking her children with her to the west . the film centers on gallus ' attempts to petition high-ranking west german politicians and bureaucrats and draw attention to her fight to get her daughters out of east germany .
on oct .
7 , 1984 , the 30th anniversary of the gdr , gallus planted herself at checkpoint charlie , the allied border crossing in berlin , with a placard around her neck reading : " my children have been forcibly given up for adoption !
please help us ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real jutta gallus protesting at checkpoint charlie in the 1980s gallus became a daily fixture at checkpoint charlie , demonstrating from dawn to dusk and inevitably drawing curious tourists and journalists .
her image and the tale of her fight to be with her children went around the world .
" checkpoint charlie was a legend in berlin , " jutta gallus , now jutta fleck , said recently in an interview with berlin daily tagesspiegel , explaining why she chose to demonstrate there .
" besides , there were tons of tourists there - it was just what i needed . "
protesting between kohl and brandt gallus proved untiring in her efforts to be reunited with her children in west germany .
at an event on the 25th anniversary of the division of germany , which was aired live on television , she leapt on stage between chancellor helmut kohl and former chancellor willy brandt and held up a placard .
" i 'm a live example .
i have been separated from my children for four years .
i appeal to you and the german government to do everything so that my children are finally with me , " gallus said in a shaky voice before being nudged aside by kohl .
not surprisingly , her public demonstrations embarrassed and annoyed the two german governments , who were at pains to maintain good diplomatic relations .
but her tactics also helped .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallus with her daughters when they were reunited after six years in 1988 in 1988 , six years after gallus first began protesting at checkpoint charlie , her daughters were allowed to leave and join their mother in the west .
it remains unclear what prompted the east german regime to take the unusual step .
critics say film jazzed up unnecessarily " i simply wanted to show that a normal person without weapons is in a position to change things , " fleck said this week after the film premiered in a berlin movie theater .
hans-dietrich genscher , west germany 's foreign minister from 1974 to 1992 , who met with gallus and heard out her case in the 1980s , said the film was an important contribution to understanding the past .
" it 's a deeply moving film , also because it focuses on the victims for the first time , " he said .
" there were unfortunately too many of these stories . "
but critics in germany were n't as enamored with the two-part drama that earned top television-viewer ratings .
many said the filmmakers should have cut out the gloss and cheese .
" why is the authentic story of suffering of a young mother being jazzed up as a spy thriller ? " a review in on der spiegel magazine 's web site asked .

even so , a surprising number of people seem to have a selective memory of the country 's 40-year division .
as germany celebrates 17 years of unity on wednesday , oct .
3 , 19 percent of the 1,000 people questioned in a survey commissioned by private broadcaster n24 said they 'd like the berlin wall back .
some 21 percent of the country 's easterners polled admitted to feeling nostalgic about the concrete and barbed wire that separated them from the capitalist west , even though the border was patrolled by armed guards with shoot-to-kill orders .
but the repression , censorship and restricted personal freedom that were part of the german democratic republic are not such distant memories for the 75 percent of germans who said they were glad the wall was brought down .
political dissatisfaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall went up in 1961 and stayed up for 28 years the survey also asked eastern germans who they 'd vote for , were there an election this week .

but it has beaten most expectations and become an urban success story . it was late on june 20 , 1991 , when bonn got the blow that most thought would seal the city 's fate .
parliamentarians had been debating whether to move the federal capital back to berlin from the small city on the rhine that had hosted the government since 1949 and were about to vote .
opposition to moving back to germany 's previous capital had been vocal and bonn residents thought that in the end , parliament would decide to stay . but at 9:47 p.m. , bundestag president rita süssmuth announced that parliament had voted 337 to 320 to pack up and move to berlin .
according to dorothea voigtländer , a journalist and author who was in the crowd that had gathered in bonn 's main square to follow the proceedings on a large screen , people were shocked into silence and the tears immediately began to fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster criticizing the government move to berlin reading " berlin republic ?
no thanks ! "
" all you could hear were raindrops on the roofs , as if the sky were crying with us , " she said .
" people said it was the city 's death blow and thought it would sink back into anonymity . " before 1949 , the year the nascent west german government voted to make bonn the provisional capital , bonn had been a pleasant , but unremarkable small city .
after it was catapulted to a new level , residents soon got used to the fringe benefits that came with international fame - visits from luminaries like queen elizabeth and john f. kennedy , prestige , money and jobs . " then suddenly in 1991 , everyone thought the lights had gone out , " said voigtländer .
" but in fact , they did n't . " successful transition today bonn is something of a poster child in germany for a city 's successful management of structural change .
dealt a potentially devastating blow , bonn rallied to attract new institutions and business to fill the void left by the exodus of politicians and many government ministries .
it played to its strengths , and thanks to a combination of factors - smart strategic planning , help from the federal government , and several home-field advantages - bonn , in many respects , was able to come out of the government move healthier than it was before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is a big employer in bonn instead of living off nostalgia , bonn , 17 years after reunification , has become one of germany 's more dynamic cities , with more residents and jobs than it had as the capital .
it has become the headquarters of several of germany 's high-profile , dax-listed firms , such as deutsche telekom , deutsche post and postbank , which have brought around 20,000 jobs to the region . the united nations has also moved to town with 12 of its institutions , including the secretariats on climate change and desertification .
a new international conference center scheduled to open in 2009 that can accommodate 5,000 aims at increasing bonn 's already growing international heft . while the parliament , chancellery and several ministries moved to berlin in 1999 , there is still a strong government presence on the rhine .
in addition to hosting institutions such as the federal anti-trust office and the federal audit office , bonn was able to keep six of germany 's 15 federal ministries and more than half of the 18,000 jobs associated with them . " bonn 's assets were and are political and diplomatic experience , top-qualified experts and the ability to look far beyond the city 's borders , " said bonn mayor bärbel dieckmann in a statement .
she has been widely praised for her stewardship of the city 's transformation . help from the feds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " house of history of the german federal republic , " part of bonn 's " museum mile " the city was helped greatly by the berlin-bonn act of 1994 , in which the federal government promised not to abandon the city entirely .
money was part of the deal , and the agreement resulted in more than 1.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- of federal largesse for bonn . the money has been wisely spent , according to sandra ludwig of the bonn chamber of commerce .
instead of following the watering-can method , officials targeted the funds in accordance with a detailed strategy that included profiling the city as germany 's second government city , marketing it as a location for international dialogue , creating a research and development hub and increasing its cultural offerings . " they were able to cushion the much-feared structural change and even turn things to its favor , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un complex in bonn with unemployment at 7.1 percent , bonn is well under the german average of 8.4 percent and boasts a jobless rate that the current federal capital can only dream of .
it has also been helped by its concentration of highly skilled workers , another magnet for businesses .
in the bonn region , 19.4 percent of people have university degrees compared with the german average of 9.8 percent . bonn gets high scores in many other areas , be it real estate , as a location for industry due to its infrastructure and geographical position , or simply quality of life .
it has become a stop on the tourism circuit thanks to its " museum mile " and international beethoven festival .
its central location and attractive natural surroundings have also gained it many fans . ongoing process but ludwig warns against being too complacent and sitting on any laurels .
the federal incentives have stopped and bonn has to make sure it continues to change with the times and looks at new ways to grow the economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn 's beethoven festival honors the city 's native son " the city is now competing on an international as well as national stage , " she said .
" structural change is a continual process that does n't just stop one day . " dorothea voigtländer , who was born in bonn in 1943 to a belgian mother and french father who were active in the resistance , thinks bonn can pull it off .
she said the city 's recent success story has as much to do with its residents as it does with good government policy . " they 've got a very tolerant , flexible and optimistic mentality , " she said .
" they just said , ' okay , we 'll tackle this problem and it 'll be fine . '

but it has beaten most expectations and become an urban success story . it was late on june 20 , 1991 , when bonn got the blow that most thought would seal the city 's fate .
parliamentarians had been debating whether to move the federal capital back to berlin from the small city on the rhine that had hosted the government since 1949 and were about to vote .
opposition to moving back to germany 's previous capital had been vocal and bonn residents thought that in the end , parliament would decide to stay . but at 9:47 p.m. , bundestag president rita süssmuth announced that parliament had voted 337 to 320 to pack up and move to berlin .
according to dorothea voigtländer , a journalist and author who was in the crowd that had gathered in bonn 's main square to follow the proceedings on a large screen , people were shocked into silence and the tears immediately began to fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster criticizing the government move to berlin reading " berlin republic ?
no thanks ! "
" all you could hear were raindrops on the roofs , as if the sky were crying with us , " she said .
" people said it was the city 's death blow and thought it would sink back into anonymity . " before 1949 , the year the nascent west german government voted to make bonn the provisional capital , bonn had been a pleasant , but unremarkable small city .
after it was catapulted to a new level , residents soon got used to the fringe benefits that came with international fame - visits from luminaries like queen elizabeth and john f. kennedy , prestige , money and jobs . " then suddenly in 1991 , everyone thought the lights had gone out , " said voigtländer .
" but in fact , they did n't . " successful transition today bonn is something of a poster child in germany for a city 's successful management of structural change .
dealt a potentially devastating blow , bonn rallied to attract new institutions and business to fill the void left by the exodus of politicians and many government ministries .
it played to its strengths , and thanks to a combination of factors - smart strategic planning , help from the federal government , and several home-field advantages - bonn , in many respects , was able to come out of the government move healthier than it was before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is a big employer in bonn instead of living off nostalgia , bonn , 17 years after reunification , has become one of germany 's more dynamic cities , with more residents and jobs than it had as the capital .
it has become the headquarters of several of germany 's high-profile , dax-listed firms , such as deutsche telekom , deutsche post and postbank , which have brought around 20,000 jobs to the region . the united nations has also moved to town with 12 of its institutions , including the secretariats on climate change and desertification .
a new international conference center scheduled to open in 2009 that can accommodate 5,000 aims at increasing bonn 's already growing international heft . while the parliament , chancellery and several ministries moved to berlin in 1999 , there is still a strong government presence on the rhine .
in addition to hosting institutions such as the federal anti-trust office and the federal audit office , bonn was able to keep six of germany 's 15 federal ministries and more than half of the 18,000 jobs associated with them . " bonn 's assets were and are political and diplomatic experience , top-qualified experts and the ability to look far beyond the city 's borders , " said bonn mayor bärbel dieckmann in a statement .
she has been widely praised for her stewardship of the city 's transformation . help from the feds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " house of history of the german federal republic , " part of bonn 's " museum mile " the city was helped greatly by the berlin-bonn act of 1994 , in which the federal government promised not to abandon the city entirely .
money was part of the deal , and the agreement resulted in more than 1.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- of federal largesse for bonn . the money has been wisely spent , according to sandra ludwig of the bonn chamber of commerce .
instead of following the watering-can method , officials targeted the funds in accordance with a detailed strategy that included profiling the city as germany 's second government city , marketing it as a location for international dialogue , creating a research and development hub and increasing its cultural offerings . " they were able to cushion the much-feared structural change and even turn things to its favor , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un complex in bonn with unemployment at 7.1 percent , bonn is well under the german average of 8.4 percent and boasts a jobless rate that the current federal capital can only dream of .
it has also been helped by its concentration of highly skilled workers , another magnet for businesses .
in the bonn region , 19.4 percent of people have university degrees compared with the german average of 9.8 percent . bonn gets high scores in many other areas , be it real estate , as a location for industry due to its infrastructure and geographical position , or simply quality of life .
it has become a stop on the tourism circuit thanks to its " museum mile " and international beethoven festival .
its central location and attractive natural surroundings have also gained it many fans . ongoing process but ludwig warns against being too complacent and sitting on any laurels .
the federal incentives have stopped and bonn has to make sure it continues to change with the times and looks at new ways to grow the economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn 's beethoven festival honors the city 's native son " the city is now competing on an international as well as national stage , " she said .
" structural change is a continual process that does n't just stop one day . " dorothea voigtländer , who was born in bonn in 1943 to a belgian mother and french father who were active in the resistance , thinks bonn can pull it off .
she said the city 's recent success story has as much to do with its residents as it does with good government policy . " they 've got a very tolerant , flexible and optimistic mentality , " she said .
" they just said , ' okay , we 'll tackle this problem and it 'll be fine . '

the fact that former communist east germany 's government , with the help of its extensive network of spies and its dreaded stasi secret police , made life a living hell for many of its citizens is well known and documented - both in historic records and on the big screen in hugely successful dramas . but a recent film aired on german public network ard veered away from the fictional to reconstruct the real-life story of a gdr victim whose fight for justice remained a thorn in the side of both west and east germany for years . " the woman from checkpoint charlie " tells the story of jutta gallus , played by german actress veronica ferres .
a young , headstrong mother in east germany , gallus yearned to move to the free world on the other side of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film when jutta gallus , played by ferres , arrives in the west in 1982 , she tried to escape along with her two young daughters by pretending to be taking a vacation to eastern europe , where she hoped to emulate the example of countrymen who had managed to escape to the west through slightly less stringent border controls .
but her flight was foiled by the east german government and the family was forcibly separated .
gallus was thrown into prison , while her two daughters , aged 9 and 11 , were put in a children 's home .
free , but without her kids two years later , gallus was bought free by the west german government , a fairly common practice that earned the gdr regime much-needed hard currency in return for releasing mainly political prisoners .
she was , however , prevented by the regime from taking her children with her to the west . the film centers on gallus ' attempts to petition high-ranking west german politicians and bureaucrats and draw attention to her fight to get her daughters out of east germany .
on oct .
7 , 1984 , the 30th anniversary of the gdr , gallus planted herself at checkpoint charlie , the allied border crossing in berlin , with a placard around her neck reading : " my children have been forcibly given up for adoption !
please help us ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real jutta gallus protesting at checkpoint charlie in the 1980s gallus became a daily fixture at checkpoint charlie , demonstrating from dawn to dusk and inevitably drawing curious tourists and journalists .
her image and the tale of her fight to be with her children went around the world .
" checkpoint charlie was a legend in berlin , " jutta gallus , now jutta fleck , said recently in an interview with berlin daily tagesspiegel , explaining why she chose to demonstrate there .
" besides , there were tons of tourists there - it was just what i needed . "
protesting between kohl and brandt gallus proved untiring in her efforts to be reunited with her children in west germany .
at an event on the 25th anniversary of the division of germany , which was aired live on television , she leapt on stage between chancellor helmut kohl and former chancellor willy brandt and held up a placard .
" i 'm a live example .
i have been separated from my children for four years .
i appeal to you and the german government to do everything so that my children are finally with me , " gallus said in a shaky voice before being nudged aside by kohl .
not surprisingly , her public demonstrations embarrassed and annoyed the two german governments , who were at pains to maintain good diplomatic relations .
but her tactics also helped .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallus with her daughters when they were reunited after six years in 1988 in 1988 , six years after gallus first began protesting at checkpoint charlie , her daughters were allowed to leave and join their mother in the west .
it remains unclear what prompted the east german regime to take the unusual step .
critics say film jazzed up unnecessarily " i simply wanted to show that a normal person without weapons is in a position to change things , " fleck said this week after the film premiered in a berlin movie theater .
hans-dietrich genscher , west germany 's foreign minister from 1974 to 1992 , who met with gallus and heard out her case in the 1980s , said the film was an important contribution to understanding the past .
" it 's a deeply moving film , also because it focuses on the victims for the first time , " he said .
" there were unfortunately too many of these stories . "
but critics in germany were n't as enamored with the two-part drama that earned top television-viewer ratings .
many said the filmmakers should have cut out the gloss and cheese .
" why is the authentic story of suffering of a young mother being jazzed up as a spy thriller ? " a review in on der spiegel magazine 's web site asked .

even so , a surprising number of people seem to have a selective memory of the country 's 40-year division .
as germany celebrates 17 years of unity on wednesday , oct .
3 , 19 percent of the 1,000 people questioned in a survey commissioned by private broadcaster n24 said they 'd like the berlin wall back .
some 21 percent of the country 's easterners polled admitted to feeling nostalgic about the concrete and barbed wire that separated them from the capitalist west , even though the border was patrolled by armed guards with shoot-to-kill orders .
but the repression , censorship and restricted personal freedom that were part of the german democratic republic are not such distant memories for the 75 percent of germans who said they were glad the wall was brought down .
political dissatisfaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall went up in 1961 and stayed up for 28 years the survey also asked eastern germans who they 'd vote for , were there an election this week .
back in december 1990 , when germany elected its first chancellor as a reunited country , some 44 percent of the electorate voted for the christian democrats headed by helmut kohl .
only 2.4 percent stood by the party of democratic socialism , the successor to the east german communist party .
reflecting their disillusionment , 31 percent now say they would give their vote to the left party , which partially consists of the pds as well as some left-leaning former members of the social democratic party .
the poll conducted by independent opinion research firm emnid found that 74 percent of easterners had felt like second-class citizens since germany reunited on oct .
3 , 1990 .
people on the other side of the country had exactly the opposite opinion .
some 73 percent of westerners said their countrymen to the east were no longer at a disadvantage in unified germany .
wall come tumbling down constructed in 1961 , the berlin wall was the communist dictatorship 's last-ditch attempt to stem the flood of refugees to the west and became the definitive symbol of the cold war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans began leaving the east in november 1989 and many continue to do so after mass demonstrations against the government in the fall of 1989 , the politburo led by egon krenz decided on nov .
9 to allow east germans to exit directly through crossing points between east germany and west germany , including in west berlin .
the wall came down in a peaceful revolution , paving the way to national unification 11 months later .
but the optimism of what become known as the wende , which translates to " change " or " turn , " was soon replaced by disappointment for many .
the former communist east continues to lag behind economically , despite the billions of euros in aid paid each year .
in the west , meanwhile , many resent having to contribute to solidarity pact funds , which are paid for with taxpayers ' money and planned to last until at least 2019 .
but while people in the west complain about their poor eastern relations , even today , salaries in the east remain 25 percent lower than in the west , according to the institute for labor market and career research in nuremberg .
unemployment hovers at about 15 percent in the eastern states compared to half that in the west . the economic gap between eastern and western germany , however , is not a indicator that reunification has failed , according to wolfgang thierse , a social democrat and the german parliament 's vice president . " you can not say that unity has failed , " he said , according to the daily tagesspiegel newspaper .

but it has beaten most expectations and become an urban success story . it was late on june 20 , 1991 , when bonn got the blow that most thought would seal the city 's fate .
parliamentarians had been debating whether to move the federal capital back to berlin from the small city on the rhine that had hosted the government since 1949 and were about to vote .
opposition to moving back to germany 's previous capital had been vocal and bonn residents thought that in the end , parliament would decide to stay . but at 9:47 p.m. , bundestag president rita süssmuth announced that parliament had voted 337 to 320 to pack up and move to berlin .
according to dorothea voigtländer , a journalist and author who was in the crowd that had gathered in bonn 's main square to follow the proceedings on a large screen , people were shocked into silence and the tears immediately began to fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster criticizing the government move to berlin reading " berlin republic ?

" people said it was the city 's death blow and thought it would sink back into anonymity . " before 1949 , the year the nascent west german government voted to make bonn the provisional capital , bonn had been a pleasant , but unremarkable small city .
after it was catapulted to a new level , residents soon got used to the fringe benefits that came with international fame - visits from luminaries like queen elizabeth and john f. kennedy , prestige , money and jobs .

instead of following the watering-can method , officials targeted the funds in accordance with a detailed strategy that included profiling the city as germany 's second government city , marketing it as a location for international dialogue , creating a research and development hub and increasing its cultural offerings .

no thanks ! "
" all you could hear were raindrops on the roofs , as if the sky were crying with us , " she said .
" people said it was the city 's death blow and thought it would sink back into anonymity . " before 1949 , the year the nascent west german government voted to make bonn the provisional capital , bonn had been a pleasant , but unremarkable small city .
after it was catapulted to a new level , residents soon got used to the fringe benefits that came with international fame - visits from luminaries like queen elizabeth and john f. kennedy , prestige , money and jobs . " then suddenly in 1991 , everyone thought the lights had gone out , " said voigtländer .
" but in fact , they did n't . " successful transition today bonn is something of a poster child in germany for a city 's successful management of structural change .
dealt a potentially devastating blow , bonn rallied to attract new institutions and business to fill the void left by the exodus of politicians and many government ministries .
it played to its strengths , and thanks to a combination of factors - smart strategic planning , help from the federal government , and several home-field advantages - bonn , in many respects , was able to come out of the government move healthier than it was before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is a big employer in bonn instead of living off nostalgia , bonn , 17 years after reunification , has become one of germany 's more dynamic cities , with more residents and jobs than it had as the capital .
it has become the headquarters of several of germany 's high-profile , dax-listed firms , such as deutsche telekom , deutsche post and postbank , which have brought around 20,000 jobs to the region . the united nations has also moved to town with 12 of its institutions , including the secretariats on climate change and desertification .
a new international conference center scheduled to open in 2009 that can accommodate 5,000 aims at increasing bonn 's already growing international heft . while the parliament , chancellery and several ministries moved to berlin in 1999 , there is still a strong government presence on the rhine .
in addition to hosting institutions such as the federal anti-trust office and the federal audit office , bonn was able to keep six of germany 's 15 federal ministries and more than half of the 18,000 jobs associated with them . " bonn 's assets were and are political and diplomatic experience , top-qualified experts and the ability to look far beyond the city 's borders , " said bonn mayor bärbel dieckmann in a statement .
she has been widely praised for her stewardship of the city 's transformation . help from the feds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " house of history of the german federal republic , " part of bonn 's " museum mile " the city was helped greatly by the berlin-bonn act of 1994 , in which the federal government promised not to abandon the city entirely .
money was part of the deal , and the agreement resulted in more than 1.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- of federal largesse for bonn . the money has been wisely spent , according to sandra ludwig of the bonn chamber of commerce .
instead of following the watering-can method , officials targeted the funds in accordance with a detailed strategy that included profiling the city as germany 's second government city , marketing it as a location for international dialogue , creating a research and development hub and increasing its cultural offerings . " they were able to cushion the much-feared structural change and even turn things to its favor , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un complex in bonn with unemployment at 7.1 percent , bonn is well under the german average of 8.4 percent and boasts a jobless rate that the current federal capital can only dream of .
it has also been helped by its concentration of highly skilled workers , another magnet for businesses .
in the bonn region , 19.4 percent of people have university degrees compared with the german average of 9.8 percent . bonn gets high scores in many other areas , be it real estate , as a location for industry due to its infrastructure and geographical position , or simply quality of life .
it has become a stop on the tourism circuit thanks to its " museum mile " and international beethoven festival .
its central location and attractive natural surroundings have also gained it many fans . ongoing process but ludwig warns against being too complacent and sitting on any laurels .
the federal incentives have stopped and bonn has to make sure it continues to change with the times and looks at new ways to grow the economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn 's beethoven festival honors the city 's native son " the city is now competing on an international as well as national stage , " she said .
" structural change is a continual process that does n't just stop one day . " dorothea voigtländer , who was born in bonn in 1943 to a belgian mother and french father who were active in the resistance , thinks bonn can pull it off .
she said the city 's recent success story has as much to do with its residents as it does with good government policy . " they 've got a very tolerant , flexible and optimistic mentality , " she said .
" they just said , ' okay , we 'll tackle this problem and it 'll be fine . '

their diagnosis : 17 years after unification , germany 's emotional state remains disharmonious .
for , they say , many eastern germans are ashamed of the billion-euro subsidies they have received from the west in the past 17 years .
whether that is indeed the case is beside the point .
what remains is an interesting attempt to investigate the emotional life of us eastern germans , now among some of the best researched living beings on the planet .
educators and criminologists have looked at the consequences of a uniform upbringing .
sexologists have researched the secrets of the easterners ' especially active love lives .
reports that the stasi secret police spies collected about east germans have filled many a newspaper page over the years .
the government 's report on german unity : year after year a report about painstaking economic development in the east with the help of billions from the west .
german unity , it appears , is one-sided , with which western germans have had only one real thing to do over the years : they occupied the leadership roles and shoveled the billions into the new eastern german states .
since the easterner angela merkel became chancellor , they are only left the role of financier .
this admittedly slightly exaggerated characterization outlines a dilemma this unity day : it 's a holiday for all germans , but the event it reflects , aside from the official celebrations , again merely concerns the easterners .
in the east , every part of life has changed ; in the west , money has just become a bit scarcer .
for many , probably most , in the new eastern states , oct .
3 is a reason to celebrate , regardless of everyday worries .
no one wants to do without the freedoms gained , and the individual desire to go back to the gdr is to be taken as seriously as the desire to drive a trabi rather than a volkswagen .
and how is the westerner 's state of mind ?
traveling from berlin far into germany 's west , one gains some insight .
there are those who with gleaming eyes recall their spontaneous trip to berlin when the wall fell .
there are others who want to collect money for the wall to be rebuilt , because they 're fed up with the east .
sorry , it was all really just a joke !
asked how their lives have been changed by german unification , many westerners ' responses are marked by perplexed silence , shrugs of the shoulders .
it 's no wonder : the east has become an extension of the west .
the opportunity unification offered to create something new , together , is long past .
for many , if not most , normal westerners , oct .
3 is a day on which , above all , they are reminded that for 17 years they have been sending money to the east , and that there 's no end in sight .
even if , in the official speeches , no one says it that way .

the fact that former communist east germany 's government , with the help of its extensive network of spies and its dreaded stasi secret police , made life a living hell for many of its citizens is well known and documented - both in historic records and on the big screen in hugely successful dramas . but a recent film aired on german public network ard veered away from the fictional to reconstruct the real-life story of a gdr victim whose fight for justice remained a thorn in the side of both west and east germany for years . " the woman from checkpoint charlie " tells the story of jutta gallus , played by german actress veronica ferres .
a young , headstrong mother in east germany , gallus yearned to move to the free world on the other side of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film when jutta gallus , played by ferres , arrives in the west in 1982 , she tried to escape along with her two young daughters by pretending to be taking a vacation to eastern europe , where she hoped to emulate the example of countrymen who had managed to escape to the west through slightly less stringent border controls .
but her flight was foiled by the east german government and the family was forcibly separated .
gallus was thrown into prison , while her two daughters , aged 9 and 11 , were put in a children 's home .
free , but without her kids two years later , gallus was bought free by the west german government , a fairly common practice that earned the gdr regime much-needed hard currency in return for releasing mainly political prisoners .
she was , however , prevented by the regime from taking her children with her to the west . the film centers on gallus ' attempts to petition high-ranking west german politicians and bureaucrats and draw attention to her fight to get her daughters out of east germany .
on oct .
7 , 1984 , the 30th anniversary of the gdr , gallus planted herself at checkpoint charlie , the allied border crossing in berlin , with a placard around her neck reading : " my children have been forcibly given up for adoption !
please help us ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real jutta gallus protesting at checkpoint charlie in the 1980s gallus became a daily fixture at checkpoint charlie , demonstrating from dawn to dusk and inevitably drawing curious tourists and journalists .
her image and the tale of her fight to be with her children went around the world .
" checkpoint charlie was a legend in berlin , " jutta gallus , now jutta fleck , said recently in an interview with berlin daily tagesspiegel , explaining why she chose to demonstrate there .
" besides , there were tons of tourists there - it was just what i needed . "
protesting between kohl and brandt gallus proved untiring in her efforts to be reunited with her children in west germany .
at an event on the 25th anniversary of the division of germany , which was aired live on television , she leapt on stage between chancellor helmut kohl and former chancellor willy brandt and held up a placard .
" i 'm a live example .
i have been separated from my children for four years .
i appeal to you and the german government to do everything so that my children are finally with me , " gallus said in a shaky voice before being nudged aside by kohl .
not surprisingly , her public demonstrations embarrassed and annoyed the two german governments , who were at pains to maintain good diplomatic relations .
but her tactics also helped .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallus with her daughters when they were reunited after six years in 1988 in 1988 , six years after gallus first began protesting at checkpoint charlie , her daughters were allowed to leave and join their mother in the west .
it remains unclear what prompted the east german regime to take the unusual step .
critics say film jazzed up unnecessarily " i simply wanted to show that a normal person without weapons is in a position to change things , " fleck said this week after the film premiered in a berlin movie theater .
hans-dietrich genscher , west germany 's foreign minister from 1974 to 1992 , who met with gallus and heard out her case in the 1980s , said the film was an important contribution to understanding the past .
" it 's a deeply moving film , also because it focuses on the victims for the first time , " he said .
" there were unfortunately too many of these stories . "
but critics in germany were n't as enamored with the two-part drama that earned top television-viewer ratings .
many said the filmmakers should have cut out the gloss and cheese .

but it has beaten most expectations and become an urban success story . it was late on june 20 , 1991 , when bonn got the blow that most thought would seal the city 's fate .
parliamentarians had been debating whether to move the federal capital back to berlin from the small city on the rhine that had hosted the government since 1949 and were about to vote .
opposition to moving back to germany 's previous capital had been vocal and bonn residents thought that in the end , parliament would decide to stay . but at 9:47 p.m. , bundestag president rita süssmuth announced that parliament had voted 337 to 320 to pack up and move to berlin .
according to dorothea voigtländer , a journalist and author who was in the crowd that had gathered in bonn 's main square to follow the proceedings on a large screen , people were shocked into silence and the tears immediately began to fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster criticizing the government move to berlin reading " berlin republic ?
no thanks ! "
" all you could hear were raindrops on the roofs , as if the sky were crying with us , " she said .
" people said it was the city 's death blow and thought it would sink back into anonymity . " before 1949 , the year the nascent west german government voted to make bonn the provisional capital , bonn had been a pleasant , but unremarkable small city .
after it was catapulted to a new level , residents soon got used to the fringe benefits that came with international fame - visits from luminaries like queen elizabeth and john f. kennedy , prestige , money and jobs . " then suddenly in 1991 , everyone thought the lights had gone out , " said voigtländer .
" but in fact , they did n't . " successful transition today bonn is something of a poster child in germany for a city 's successful management of structural change .
dealt a potentially devastating blow , bonn rallied to attract new institutions and business to fill the void left by the exodus of politicians and many government ministries .
it played to its strengths , and thanks to a combination of factors - smart strategic planning , help from the federal government , and several home-field advantages - bonn , in many respects , was able to come out of the government move healthier than it was before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is a big employer in bonn instead of living off nostalgia , bonn , 17 years after reunification , has become one of germany 's more dynamic cities , with more residents and jobs than it had as the capital .
it has become the headquarters of several of germany 's high-profile , dax-listed firms , such as deutsche telekom , deutsche post and postbank , which have brought around 20,000 jobs to the region . the united nations has also moved to town with 12 of its institutions , including the secretariats on climate change and desertification .
a new international conference center scheduled to open in 2009 that can accommodate 5,000 aims at increasing bonn 's already growing international heft . while the parliament , chancellery and several ministries moved to berlin in 1999 , there is still a strong government presence on the rhine .
in addition to hosting institutions such as the federal anti-trust office and the federal audit office , bonn was able to keep six of germany 's 15 federal ministries and more than half of the 18,000 jobs associated with them . " bonn 's assets were and are political and diplomatic experience , top-qualified experts and the ability to look far beyond the city 's borders , " said bonn mayor bärbel dieckmann in a statement .
she has been widely praised for her stewardship of the city 's transformation . help from the feds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " house of history of the german federal republic , " part of bonn 's " museum mile " the city was helped greatly by the berlin-bonn act of 1994 , in which the federal government promised not to abandon the city entirely .
money was part of the deal , and the agreement resulted in more than 1.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- of federal largesse for bonn . the money has been wisely spent , according to sandra ludwig of the bonn chamber of commerce .
instead of following the watering-can method , officials targeted the funds in accordance with a detailed strategy that included profiling the city as germany 's second government city , marketing it as a location for international dialogue , creating a research and development hub and increasing its cultural offerings . " they were able to cushion the much-feared structural change and even turn things to its favor , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un complex in bonn with unemployment at 7.1 percent , bonn is well under the german average of 8.4 percent and boasts a jobless rate that the current federal capital can only dream of .
it has also been helped by its concentration of highly skilled workers , another magnet for businesses .
in the bonn region , 19.4 percent of people have university degrees compared with the german average of 9.8 percent . bonn gets high scores in many other areas , be it real estate , as a location for industry due to its infrastructure and geographical position , or simply quality of life .
it has become a stop on the tourism circuit thanks to its " museum mile " and international beethoven festival .
its central location and attractive natural surroundings have also gained it many fans . ongoing process but ludwig warns against being too complacent and sitting on any laurels .
the federal incentives have stopped and bonn has to make sure it continues to change with the times and looks at new ways to grow the economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn 's beethoven festival honors the city 's native son " the city is now competing on an international as well as national stage , " she said .
" structural change is a continual process that does n't just stop one day . " dorothea voigtländer , who was born in bonn in 1943 to a belgian mother and french father who were active in the resistance , thinks bonn can pull it off .
she said the city 's recent success story has as much to do with its residents as it does with good government policy . " they 've got a very tolerant , flexible and optimistic mentality , " she said .
" they just said , ' okay , we 'll tackle this problem and it 'll be fine . '

but it has beaten most expectations and become an urban success story . it was late on june 20 , 1991 , when bonn got the blow that most thought would seal the city 's fate .
parliamentarians had been debating whether to move the federal capital back to berlin from the small city on the rhine that had hosted the government since 1949 and were about to vote .
opposition to moving back to germany 's previous capital had been vocal and bonn residents thought that in the end , parliament would decide to stay . but at 9:47 p.m. , bundestag president rita süssmuth announced that parliament had voted 337 to 320 to pack up and move to berlin .
according to dorothea voigtländer , a journalist and author who was in the crowd that had gathered in bonn 's main square to follow the proceedings on a large screen , people were shocked into silence and the tears immediately began to fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster criticizing the government move to berlin reading " berlin republic ?
no thanks ! "
" all you could hear were raindrops on the roofs , as if the sky were crying with us , " she said .
" people said it was the city 's death blow and thought it would sink back into anonymity . " before 1949 , the year the nascent west german government voted to make bonn the provisional capital , bonn had been a pleasant , but unremarkable small city .
after it was catapulted to a new level , residents soon got used to the fringe benefits that came with international fame - visits from luminaries like queen elizabeth and john f. kennedy , prestige , money and jobs . " then suddenly in 1991 , everyone thought the lights had gone out , " said voigtländer .
" but in fact , they did n't . " successful transition today bonn is something of a poster child in germany for a city 's successful management of structural change .
dealt a potentially devastating blow , bonn rallied to attract new institutions and business to fill the void left by the exodus of politicians and many government ministries .
it played to its strengths , and thanks to a combination of factors - smart strategic planning , help from the federal government , and several home-field advantages - bonn , in many respects , was able to come out of the government move healthier than it was before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is a big employer in bonn instead of living off nostalgia , bonn , 17 years after reunification , has become one of germany 's more dynamic cities , with more residents and jobs than it had as the capital .
it has become the headquarters of several of germany 's high-profile , dax-listed firms , such as deutsche telekom , deutsche post and postbank , which have brought around 20,000 jobs to the region . the united nations has also moved to town with 12 of its institutions , including the secretariats on climate change and desertification .
a new international conference center scheduled to open in 2009 that can accommodate 5,000 aims at increasing bonn 's already growing international heft . while the parliament , chancellery and several ministries moved to berlin in 1999 , there is still a strong government presence on the rhine .
in addition to hosting institutions such as the federal anti-trust office and the federal audit office , bonn was able to keep six of germany 's 15 federal ministries and more than half of the 18,000 jobs associated with them . " bonn 's assets were and are political and diplomatic experience , top-qualified experts and the ability to look far beyond the city 's borders , " said bonn mayor bärbel dieckmann in a statement .
she has been widely praised for her stewardship of the city 's transformation . help from the feds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " house of history of the german federal republic , " part of bonn 's " museum mile " the city was helped greatly by the berlin-bonn act of 1994 , in which the federal government promised not to abandon the city entirely .
money was part of the deal , and the agreement resulted in more than 1.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- of federal largesse for bonn . the money has been wisely spent , according to sandra ludwig of the bonn chamber of commerce .
instead of following the watering-can method , officials targeted the funds in accordance with a detailed strategy that included profiling the city as germany 's second government city , marketing it as a location for international dialogue , creating a research and development hub and increasing its cultural offerings . " they were able to cushion the much-feared structural change and even turn things to its favor , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un complex in bonn with unemployment at 7.1 percent , bonn is well under the german average of 8.4 percent and boasts a jobless rate that the current federal capital can only dream of .
it has also been helped by its concentration of highly skilled workers , another magnet for businesses .
in the bonn region , 19.4 percent of people have university degrees compared with the german average of 9.8 percent . bonn gets high scores in many other areas , be it real estate , as a location for industry due to its infrastructure and geographical position , or simply quality of life .
it has become a stop on the tourism circuit thanks to its " museum mile " and international beethoven festival .
its central location and attractive natural surroundings have also gained it many fans . ongoing process but ludwig warns against being too complacent and sitting on any laurels .
the federal incentives have stopped and bonn has to make sure it continues to change with the times and looks at new ways to grow the economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn 's beethoven festival honors the city 's native son " the city is now competing on an international as well as national stage , " she said .
" structural change is a continual process that does n't just stop one day . " dorothea voigtländer , who was born in bonn in 1943 to a belgian mother and french father who were active in the resistance , thinks bonn can pull it off .
she said the city 's recent success story has as much to do with its residents as it does with good government policy . " they 've got a very tolerant , flexible and optimistic mentality , " she said .
" they just said , ' okay , we 'll tackle this problem and it 'll be fine . '

the fact that former communist east germany 's government , with the help of its extensive network of spies and its dreaded stasi secret police , made life a living hell for many of its citizens is well known and documented - both in historic records and on the big screen in hugely successful dramas . but a recent film aired on german public network ard veered away from the fictional to reconstruct the real-life story of a gdr victim whose fight for justice remained a thorn in the side of both west and east germany for years . " the woman from checkpoint charlie " tells the story of jutta gallus , played by german actress veronica ferres .
a young , headstrong mother in east germany , gallus yearned to move to the free world on the other side of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film when jutta gallus , played by ferres , arrives in the west in 1982 , she tried to escape along with her two young daughters by pretending to be taking a vacation to eastern europe , where she hoped to emulate the example of countrymen who had managed to escape to the west through slightly less stringent border controls .
but her flight was foiled by the east german government and the family was forcibly separated .
gallus was thrown into prison , while her two daughters , aged 9 and 11 , were put in a children 's home .
free , but without her kids two years later , gallus was bought free by the west german government , a fairly common practice that earned the gdr regime much-needed hard currency in return for releasing mainly political prisoners .
she was , however , prevented by the regime from taking her children with her to the west . the film centers on gallus ' attempts to petition high-ranking west german politicians and bureaucrats and draw attention to her fight to get her daughters out of east germany .
on oct .

" i 'm a live example .
i have been separated from my children for four years .
i appeal to you and the german government to do everything so that my children are finally with me , " gallus said in a shaky voice before being nudged aside by kohl .

even so , a surprising number of people seem to have a selective memory of the country 's 40-year division .
as germany celebrates 17 years of unity on wednesday , oct .
3 , 19 percent of the 1,000 people questioned in a survey commissioned by private broadcaster n24 said they 'd like the berlin wall back .
some 21 percent of the country 's easterners polled admitted to feeling nostalgic about the concrete and barbed wire that separated them from the capitalist west , even though the border was patrolled by armed guards with shoot-to-kill orders .
but the repression , censorship and restricted personal freedom that were part of the german democratic republic are not such distant memories for the 75 percent of germans who said they were glad the wall was brought down .
political dissatisfaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall went up in 1961 and stayed up for 28 years the survey also asked eastern germans who they 'd vote for , were there an election this week .
back in december 1990 , when germany elected its first chancellor as a reunited country , some 44 percent of the electorate voted for the christian democrats headed by helmut kohl .
only 2.4 percent stood by the party of democratic socialism , the successor to the east german communist party .
reflecting their disillusionment , 31 percent now say they would give their vote to the left party , which partially consists of the pds as well as some left-leaning former members of the social democratic party .
the poll conducted by independent opinion research firm emnid found that 74 percent of easterners had felt like second-class citizens since germany reunited on oct .
3 , 1990 .
people on the other side of the country had exactly the opposite opinion .
some 73 percent of westerners said their countrymen to the east were no longer at a disadvantage in unified germany .
wall come tumbling down constructed in 1961 , the berlin wall was the communist dictatorship 's last-ditch attempt to stem the flood of refugees to the west and became the definitive symbol of the cold war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans began leaving the east in november 1989 and many continue to do so after mass demonstrations against the government in the fall of 1989 , the politburo led by egon krenz decided on nov .
9 to allow east germans to exit directly through crossing points between east germany and west germany , including in west berlin .
the wall came down in a peaceful revolution , paving the way to national unification 11 months later .
but the optimism of what become known as the wende , which translates to " change " or " turn , " was soon replaced by disappointment for many .
the former communist east continues to lag behind economically , despite the billions of euros in aid paid each year .
in the west , meanwhile , many resent having to contribute to solidarity pact funds , which are paid for with taxpayers ' money and planned to last until at least 2019 .
but while people in the west complain about their poor eastern relations , even today , salaries in the east remain 25 percent lower than in the west , according to the institute for labor market and career research in nuremberg .
unemployment hovers at about 15 percent in the eastern states compared to half that in the west . the economic gap between eastern and western germany , however , is not a indicator that reunification has failed , according to wolfgang thierse , a social democrat and the german parliament 's vice president . " you can not say that unity has failed , " he said , according to the daily tagesspiegel newspaper .

even so , a surprising number of people seem to have a selective memory of the country 's 40-year division .
as germany celebrates 17 years of unity on wednesday , oct .
3 , 19 percent of the 1,000 people questioned in a survey commissioned by private broadcaster n24 said they 'd like the berlin wall back .
some 21 percent of the country 's easterners polled admitted to feeling nostalgic about the concrete and barbed wire that separated them from the capitalist west , even though the border was patrolled by armed guards with shoot-to-kill orders .
but the repression , censorship and restricted personal freedom that were part of the german democratic republic are not such distant memories for the 75 percent of germans who said they were glad the wall was brought down .
political dissatisfaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall went up in 1961 and stayed up for 28 years the survey also asked eastern germans who they 'd vote for , were there an election this week .
back in december 1990 , when germany elected its first chancellor as a reunited country , some 44 percent of the electorate voted for the christian democrats headed by helmut kohl .
only 2.4 percent stood by the party of democratic socialism , the successor to the east german communist party .
reflecting their disillusionment , 31 percent now say they would give their vote to the left party , which partially consists of the pds as well as some left-leaning former members of the social democratic party .
the poll conducted by independent opinion research firm emnid found that 74 percent of easterners had felt like second-class citizens since germany reunited on oct .
3 , 1990 .
people on the other side of the country had exactly the opposite opinion .
some 73 percent of westerners said their countrymen to the east were no longer at a disadvantage in unified germany .
wall come tumbling down constructed in 1961 , the berlin wall was the communist dictatorship 's last-ditch attempt to stem the flood of refugees to the west and became the definitive symbol of the cold war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans began leaving the east in november 1989 and many continue to do so after mass demonstrations against the government in the fall of 1989 , the politburo led by egon krenz decided on nov .
9 to allow east germans to exit directly through crossing points between east germany and west germany , including in west berlin .
the wall came down in a peaceful revolution , paving the way to national unification 11 months later .
but the optimism of what become known as the wende , which translates to " change " or " turn , " was soon replaced by disappointment for many .
the former communist east continues to lag behind economically , despite the billions of euros in aid paid each year .
in the west , meanwhile , many resent having to contribute to solidarity pact funds , which are paid for with taxpayers ' money and planned to last until at least 2019 .
but while people in the west complain about their poor eastern relations , even today , salaries in the east remain 25 percent lower than in the west , according to the institute for labor market and career research in nuremberg .
unemployment hovers at about 15 percent in the eastern states compared to half that in the west . the economic gap between eastern and western germany , however , is not a indicator that reunification has failed , according to wolfgang thierse , a social democrat and the german parliament 's vice president . " you can not say that unity has failed , " he said , according to the daily tagesspiegel newspaper .

the fact that former communist east germany 's government , with the help of its extensive network of spies and its dreaded stasi secret police , made life a living hell for many of its citizens is well known and documented - both in historic records and on the big screen in hugely successful dramas . but a recent film aired on german public network ard veered away from the fictional to reconstruct the real-life story of a gdr victim whose fight for justice remained a thorn in the side of both west and east germany for years . " the woman from checkpoint charlie " tells the story of jutta gallus , played by german actress veronica ferres .
a young , headstrong mother in east germany , gallus yearned to move to the free world on the other side of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film when jutta gallus , played by ferres , arrives in the west in 1982 , she tried to escape along with her two young daughters by pretending to be taking a vacation to eastern europe , where she hoped to emulate the example of countrymen who had managed to escape to the west through slightly less stringent border controls .
but her flight was foiled by the east german government and the family was forcibly separated .
gallus was thrown into prison , while her two daughters , aged 9 and 11 , were put in a children 's home .
free , but without her kids two years later , gallus was bought free by the west german government , a fairly common practice that earned the gdr regime much-needed hard currency in return for releasing mainly political prisoners .
she was , however , prevented by the regime from taking her children with her to the west . the film centers on gallus ' attempts to petition high-ranking west german politicians and bureaucrats and draw attention to her fight to get her daughters out of east germany .
on oct .
7 , 1984 , the 30th anniversary of the gdr , gallus planted herself at checkpoint charlie , the allied border crossing in berlin , with a placard around her neck reading : " my children have been forcibly given up for adoption !
please help us ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real jutta gallus protesting at checkpoint charlie in the 1980s gallus became a daily fixture at checkpoint charlie , demonstrating from dawn to dusk and inevitably drawing curious tourists and journalists .
her image and the tale of her fight to be with her children went around the world .
" checkpoint charlie was a legend in berlin , " jutta gallus , now jutta fleck , said recently in an interview with berlin daily tagesspiegel , explaining why she chose to demonstrate there .
" besides , there were tons of tourists there - it was just what i needed . "
protesting between kohl and brandt gallus proved untiring in her efforts to be reunited with her children in west germany .
at an event on the 25th anniversary of the division of germany , which was aired live on television , she leapt on stage between chancellor helmut kohl and former chancellor willy brandt and held up a placard .
" i 'm a live example .
i have been separated from my children for four years .
i appeal to you and the german government to do everything so that my children are finally with me , " gallus said in a shaky voice before being nudged aside by kohl .
not surprisingly , her public demonstrations embarrassed and annoyed the two german governments , who were at pains to maintain good diplomatic relations .
but her tactics also helped .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallus with her daughters when they were reunited after six years in 1988 in 1988 , six years after gallus first began protesting at checkpoint charlie , her daughters were allowed to leave and join their mother in the west .
it remains unclear what prompted the east german regime to take the unusual step .
critics say film jazzed up unnecessarily " i simply wanted to show that a normal person without weapons is in a position to change things , " fleck said this week after the film premiered in a berlin movie theater .
hans-dietrich genscher , west germany 's foreign minister from 1974 to 1992 , who met with gallus and heard out her case in the 1980s , said the film was an important contribution to understanding the past .
" it 's a deeply moving film , also because it focuses on the victims for the first time , " he said .
" there were unfortunately too many of these stories . "
but critics in germany were n't as enamored with the two-part drama that earned top television-viewer ratings .
many said the filmmakers should have cut out the gloss and cheese .
" why is the authentic story of suffering of a young mother being jazzed up as a spy thriller ? " a review in on der spiegel magazine 's web site asked .

but it has beaten most expectations and become an urban success story . it was late on june 20 , 1991 , when bonn got the blow that most thought would seal the city 's fate .
parliamentarians had been debating whether to move the federal capital back to berlin from the small city on the rhine that had hosted the government since 1949 and were about to vote .
opposition to moving back to germany 's previous capital had been vocal and bonn residents thought that in the end , parliament would decide to stay . but at 9:47 p.m. , bundestag president rita süssmuth announced that parliament had voted 337 to 320 to pack up and move to berlin .
according to dorothea voigtländer , a journalist and author who was in the crowd that had gathered in bonn 's main square to follow the proceedings on a large screen , people were shocked into silence and the tears immediately began to fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster criticizing the government move to berlin reading " berlin republic ?
no thanks ! "
" all you could hear were raindrops on the roofs , as if the sky were crying with us , " she said .
" people said it was the city 's death blow and thought it would sink back into anonymity . " before 1949 , the year the nascent west german government voted to make bonn the provisional capital , bonn had been a pleasant , but unremarkable small city .
after it was catapulted to a new level , residents soon got used to the fringe benefits that came with international fame - visits from luminaries like queen elizabeth and john f. kennedy , prestige , money and jobs . " then suddenly in 1991 , everyone thought the lights had gone out , " said voigtländer .

but it has beaten most expectations and become an urban success story . it was late on june 20 , 1991 , when bonn got the blow that most thought would seal the city 's fate .
parliamentarians had been debating whether to move the federal capital back to berlin from the small city on the rhine that had hosted the government since 1949 and were about to vote .
opposition to moving back to germany 's previous capital had been vocal and bonn residents thought that in the end , parliament would decide to stay . but at 9:47 p.m. , bundestag president rita süssmuth announced that parliament had voted 337 to 320 to pack up and move to berlin .
according to dorothea voigtländer , a journalist and author who was in the crowd that had gathered in bonn 's main square to follow the proceedings on a large screen , people were shocked into silence and the tears immediately began to fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster criticizing the government move to berlin reading " berlin republic ?
no thanks ! "
" all you could hear were raindrops on the roofs , as if the sky were crying with us , " she said .
" people said it was the city 's death blow and thought it would sink back into anonymity . " before 1949 , the year the nascent west german government voted to make bonn the provisional capital , bonn had been a pleasant , but unremarkable small city .
after it was catapulted to a new level , residents soon got used to the fringe benefits that came with international fame - visits from luminaries like queen elizabeth and john f. kennedy , prestige , money and jobs . " then suddenly in 1991 , everyone thought the lights had gone out , " said voigtländer .
" but in fact , they did n't . " successful transition today bonn is something of a poster child in germany for a city 's successful management of structural change .

the fact that former communist east germany 's government , with the help of its extensive network of spies and its dreaded stasi secret police , made life a living hell for many of its citizens is well known and documented - both in historic records and on the big screen in hugely successful dramas . but a recent film aired on german public network ard veered away from the fictional to reconstruct the real-life story of a gdr victim whose fight for justice remained a thorn in the side of both west and east germany for years . " the woman from checkpoint charlie " tells the story of jutta gallus , played by german actress veronica ferres .
a young , headstrong mother in east germany , gallus yearned to move to the free world on the other side of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film when jutta gallus , played by ferres , arrives in the west in 1982 , she tried to escape along with her two young daughters by pretending to be taking a vacation to eastern europe , where she hoped to emulate the example of countrymen who had managed to escape to the west through slightly less stringent border controls .
but her flight was foiled by the east german government and the family was forcibly separated .
gallus was thrown into prison , while her two daughters , aged 9 and 11 , were put in a children 's home .
free , but without her kids two years later , gallus was bought free by the west german government , a fairly common practice that earned the gdr regime much-needed hard currency in return for releasing mainly political prisoners .
she was , however , prevented by the regime from taking her children with her to the west . the film centers on gallus ' attempts to petition high-ranking west german politicians and bureaucrats and draw attention to her fight to get her daughters out of east germany .
on oct .
7 , 1984 , the 30th anniversary of the gdr , gallus planted herself at checkpoint charlie , the allied border crossing in berlin , with a placard around her neck reading : " my children have been forcibly given up for adoption !
please help us ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real jutta gallus protesting at checkpoint charlie in the 1980s gallus became a daily fixture at checkpoint charlie , demonstrating from dawn to dusk and inevitably drawing curious tourists and journalists .
her image and the tale of her fight to be with her children went around the world .
" checkpoint charlie was a legend in berlin , " jutta gallus , now jutta fleck , said recently in an interview with berlin daily tagesspiegel , explaining why she chose to demonstrate there .
" besides , there were tons of tourists there - it was just what i needed . "
protesting between kohl and brandt gallus proved untiring in her efforts to be reunited with her children in west germany .
at an event on the 25th anniversary of the division of germany , which was aired live on television , she leapt on stage between chancellor helmut kohl and former chancellor willy brandt and held up a placard .
" i 'm a live example .
i have been separated from my children for four years .
i appeal to you and the german government to do everything so that my children are finally with me , " gallus said in a shaky voice before being nudged aside by kohl .
not surprisingly , her public demonstrations embarrassed and annoyed the two german governments , who were at pains to maintain good diplomatic relations .
but her tactics also helped .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallus with her daughters when they were reunited after six years in 1988 in 1988 , six years after gallus first began protesting at checkpoint charlie , her daughters were allowed to leave and join their mother in the west .
it remains unclear what prompted the east german regime to take the unusual step .
critics say film jazzed up unnecessarily " i simply wanted to show that a normal person without weapons is in a position to change things , " fleck said this week after the film premiered in a berlin movie theater .
hans-dietrich genscher , west germany 's foreign minister from 1974 to 1992 , who met with gallus and heard out her case in the 1980s , said the film was an important contribution to understanding the past .
" it 's a deeply moving film , also because it focuses on the victims for the first time , " he said .

even so , a surprising number of people seem to have a selective memory of the country 's 40-year division .
as germany celebrates 17 years of unity on wednesday , oct .
3 , 19 percent of the 1,000 people questioned in a survey commissioned by private broadcaster n24 said they 'd like the berlin wall back .
some 21 percent of the country 's easterners polled admitted to feeling nostalgic about the concrete and barbed wire that separated them from the capitalist west , even though the border was patrolled by armed guards with shoot-to-kill orders .
but the repression , censorship and restricted personal freedom that were part of the german democratic republic are not such distant memories for the 75 percent of germans who said they were glad the wall was brought down .
political dissatisfaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall went up in 1961 and stayed up for 28 years the survey also asked eastern germans who they 'd vote for , were there an election this week .
back in december 1990 , when germany elected its first chancellor as a reunited country , some 44 percent of the electorate voted for the christian democrats headed by helmut kohl .
only 2.4 percent stood by the party of democratic socialism , the successor to the east german communist party .
reflecting their disillusionment , 31 percent now say they would give their vote to the left party , which partially consists of the pds as well as some left-leaning former members of the social democratic party .
the poll conducted by independent opinion research firm emnid found that 74 percent of easterners had felt like second-class citizens since germany reunited on oct .
3 , 1990 .
people on the other side of the country had exactly the opposite opinion .
some 73 percent of westerners said their countrymen to the east were no longer at a disadvantage in unified germany .
wall come tumbling down constructed in 1961 , the berlin wall was the communist dictatorship 's last-ditch attempt to stem the flood of refugees to the west and became the definitive symbol of the cold war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans began leaving the east in november 1989 and many continue to do so after mass demonstrations against the government in the fall of 1989 , the politburo led by egon krenz decided on nov .
9 to allow east germans to exit directly through crossing points between east germany and west germany , including in west berlin .
the wall came down in a peaceful revolution , paving the way to national unification 11 months later .
but the optimism of what become known as the wende , which translates to " change " or " turn , " was soon replaced by disappointment for many .
the former communist east continues to lag behind economically , despite the billions of euros in aid paid each year .
in the west , meanwhile , many resent having to contribute to solidarity pact funds , which are paid for with taxpayers ' money and planned to last until at least 2019 .
but while people in the west complain about their poor eastern relations , even today , salaries in the east remain 25 percent lower than in the west , according to the institute for labor market and career research in nuremberg .
unemployment hovers at about 15 percent in the eastern states compared to half that in the west . the economic gap between eastern and western germany , however , is not a indicator that reunification has failed , according to wolfgang thierse , a social democrat and the german parliament 's vice president .

but it has beaten most expectations and become an urban success story . it was late on june 20 , 1991 , when bonn got the blow that most thought would seal the city 's fate .
parliamentarians had been debating whether to move the federal capital back to berlin from the small city on the rhine that had hosted the government since 1949 and were about to vote .
opposition to moving back to germany 's previous capital had been vocal and bonn residents thought that in the end , parliament would decide to stay . but at 9:47 p.m. , bundestag president rita süssmuth announced that parliament had voted 337 to 320 to pack up and move to berlin .
according to dorothea voigtländer , a journalist and author who was in the crowd that had gathered in bonn 's main square to follow the proceedings on a large screen , people were shocked into silence and the tears immediately began to fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster criticizing the government move to berlin reading " berlin republic ?
no thanks ! "
" all you could hear were raindrops on the roofs , as if the sky were crying with us , " she said .
" people said it was the city 's death blow and thought it would sink back into anonymity . " before 1949 , the year the nascent west german government voted to make bonn the provisional capital , bonn had been a pleasant , but unremarkable small city .
after it was catapulted to a new level , residents soon got used to the fringe benefits that came with international fame - visits from luminaries like queen elizabeth and john f. kennedy , prestige , money and jobs . " then suddenly in 1991 , everyone thought the lights had gone out , " said voigtländer .
" but in fact , they did n't . " successful transition today bonn is something of a poster child in germany for a city 's successful management of structural change .
dealt a potentially devastating blow , bonn rallied to attract new institutions and business to fill the void left by the exodus of politicians and many government ministries .
it played to its strengths , and thanks to a combination of factors - smart strategic planning , help from the federal government , and several home-field advantages - bonn , in many respects , was able to come out of the government move healthier than it was before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is a big employer in bonn instead of living off nostalgia , bonn , 17 years after reunification , has become one of germany 's more dynamic cities , with more residents and jobs than it had as the capital .
it has become the headquarters of several of germany 's high-profile , dax-listed firms , such as deutsche telekom , deutsche post and postbank , which have brought around 20,000 jobs to the region . the united nations has also moved to town with 12 of its institutions , including the secretariats on climate change and desertification .
a new international conference center scheduled to open in 2009 that can accommodate 5,000 aims at increasing bonn 's already growing international heft . while the parliament , chancellery and several ministries moved to berlin in 1999 , there is still a strong government presence on the rhine .
in addition to hosting institutions such as the federal anti-trust office and the federal audit office , bonn was able to keep six of germany 's 15 federal ministries and more than half of the 18,000 jobs associated with them . " bonn 's assets were and are political and diplomatic experience , top-qualified experts and the ability to look far beyond the city 's borders , " said bonn mayor bärbel dieckmann in a statement .
she has been widely praised for her stewardship of the city 's transformation . help from the feds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " house of history of the german federal republic , " part of bonn 's " museum mile " the city was helped greatly by the berlin-bonn act of 1994 , in which the federal government promised not to abandon the city entirely .
money was part of the deal , and the agreement resulted in more than 1.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- of federal largesse for bonn . the money has been wisely spent , according to sandra ludwig of the bonn chamber of commerce .
instead of following the watering-can method , officials targeted the funds in accordance with a detailed strategy that included profiling the city as germany 's second government city , marketing it as a location for international dialogue , creating a research and development hub and increasing its cultural offerings . " they were able to cushion the much-feared structural change and even turn things to its favor , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un complex in bonn with unemployment at 7.1 percent , bonn is well under the german average of 8.4 percent and boasts a jobless rate that the current federal capital can only dream of .
it has also been helped by its concentration of highly skilled workers , another magnet for businesses .
in the bonn region , 19.4 percent of people have university degrees compared with the german average of 9.8 percent . bonn gets high scores in many other areas , be it real estate , as a location for industry due to its infrastructure and geographical position , or simply quality of life .
it has become a stop on the tourism circuit thanks to its " museum mile " and international beethoven festival .
its central location and attractive natural surroundings have also gained it many fans . ongoing process but ludwig warns against being too complacent and sitting on any laurels .
the federal incentives have stopped and bonn has to make sure it continues to change with the times and looks at new ways to grow the economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn 's beethoven festival honors the city 's native son " the city is now competing on an international as well as national stage , " she said .
" structural change is a continual process that does n't just stop one day . " dorothea voigtländer , who was born in bonn in 1943 to a belgian mother and french father who were active in the resistance , thinks bonn can pull it off .
she said the city 's recent success story has as much to do with its residents as it does with good government policy . " they 've got a very tolerant , flexible and optimistic mentality , " she said .
" they just said , ' okay , we 'll tackle this problem and it 'll be fine . '

even so , a surprising number of people seem to have a selective memory of the country 's 40-year division .
as germany celebrates 17 years of unity on wednesday , oct .
3 , 19 percent of the 1,000 people questioned in a survey commissioned by private broadcaster n24 said they 'd like the berlin wall back .
some 21 percent of the country 's easterners polled admitted to feeling nostalgic about the concrete and barbed wire that separated them from the capitalist west , even though the border was patrolled by armed guards with shoot-to-kill orders .
but the repression , censorship and restricted personal freedom that were part of the german democratic republic are not such distant memories for the 75 percent of germans who said they were glad the wall was brought down .
political dissatisfaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall went up in 1961 and stayed up for 28 years the survey also asked eastern germans who they 'd vote for , were there an election this week .
back in december 1990 , when germany elected its first chancellor as a reunited country , some 44 percent of the electorate voted for the christian democrats headed by helmut kohl .
only 2.4 percent stood by the party of democratic socialism , the successor to the east german communist party .
reflecting their disillusionment , 31 percent now say they would give their vote to the left party , which partially consists of the pds as well as some left-leaning former members of the social democratic party .
the poll conducted by independent opinion research firm emnid found that 74 percent of easterners had felt like second-class citizens since germany reunited on oct .
3 , 1990 .
people on the other side of the country had exactly the opposite opinion .
some 73 percent of westerners said their countrymen to the east were no longer at a disadvantage in unified germany .
wall come tumbling down constructed in 1961 , the berlin wall was the communist dictatorship 's last-ditch attempt to stem the flood of refugees to the west and became the definitive symbol of the cold war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans began leaving the east in november 1989 and many continue to do so after mass demonstrations against the government in the fall of 1989 , the politburo led by egon krenz decided on nov .
9 to allow east germans to exit directly through crossing points between east germany and west germany , including in west berlin .
the wall came down in a peaceful revolution , paving the way to national unification 11 months later .
but the optimism of what become known as the wende , which translates to " change " or " turn , " was soon replaced by disappointment for many .
the former communist east continues to lag behind economically , despite the billions of euros in aid paid each year .
in the west , meanwhile , many resent having to contribute to solidarity pact funds , which are paid for with taxpayers ' money and planned to last until at least 2019 .
but while people in the west complain about their poor eastern relations , even today , salaries in the east remain 25 percent lower than in the west , according to the institute for labor market and career research in nuremberg .
unemployment hovers at about 15 percent in the eastern states compared to half that in the west . the economic gap between eastern and western germany , however , is not a indicator that reunification has failed , according to wolfgang thierse , a social democrat and the german parliament 's vice president .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 03.10.2007 opinion : german unity means freedom to east , money to west großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as germany marks the 17th anniversary of the country 's unification , east and west look at the day in fundamentally different ways , with celebration on one side and resentment on the other , according to dw 's bernd grässl psychologists have had their say just in time for the german unification day .
their diagnosis : 17 years after unification , germany 's emotional state remains disharmonious .
for , they say , many eastern germans are ashamed of the billion-euro subsidies they have received from the west in the past 17 years .
whether that is indeed the case is beside the point .
what remains is an interesting attempt to investigate the emotional life of us eastern germans , now among some of the best researched living beings on the planet .
educators and criminologists have looked at the consequences of a uniform upbringing .
sexologists have researched the secrets of the easterners ' especially active love lives .
reports that the stasi secret police spies collected about east germans have filled many a newspaper page over the years .
the government 's report on german unity : year after year a report about painstaking economic development in the east with the help of billions from the west .
german unity , it appears , is one-sided , with which western germans have had only one real thing to do over the years : they occupied the leadership roles and shoveled the billions into the new eastern german states .
since the easterner angela merkel became chancellor , they are only left the role of financier .
this admittedly slightly exaggerated characterization outlines a dilemma this unity day : it 's a holiday for all germans , but the event it reflects , aside from the official celebrations , again merely concerns the easterners .
in the east , every part of life has changed ; in the west , money has just become a bit scarcer .
for many , probably most , in the new eastern states , oct .
3 is a reason to celebrate , regardless of everyday worries .
no one wants to do without the freedoms gained , and the individual desire to go back to the gdr is to be taken as seriously as the desire to drive a trabi rather than a volkswagen .
and how is the westerner 's state of mind ?
traveling from berlin far into germany 's west , one gains some insight .
there are those who with gleaming eyes recall their spontaneous trip to berlin when the wall fell .
there are others who want to collect money for the wall to be rebuilt , because they 're fed up with the east .
sorry , it was all really just a joke !
asked how their lives have been changed by german unification , many westerners ' responses are marked by perplexed silence , shrugs of the shoulders .
it 's no wonder : the east has become an extension of the west .
the opportunity unification offered to create something new , together , is long past .
for many , if not most , normal westerners , oct .
3 is a day on which , above all , they are reminded that for 17 years they have been sending money to the east , and that there 's no end in sight .
even if , in the official speeches , no one says it that way .

the fact that former communist east germany 's government , with the help of its extensive network of spies and its dreaded stasi secret police , made life a living hell for many of its citizens is well known and documented - both in historic records and on the big screen in hugely successful dramas . but a recent film aired on german public network ard veered away from the fictional to reconstruct the real-life story of a gdr victim whose fight for justice remained a thorn in the side of both west and east germany for years . " the woman from checkpoint charlie " tells the story of jutta gallus , played by german actress veronica ferres .
a young , headstrong mother in east germany , gallus yearned to move to the free world on the other side of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film when jutta gallus , played by ferres , arrives in the west in 1982 , she tried to escape along with her two young daughters by pretending to be taking a vacation to eastern europe , where she hoped to emulate the example of countrymen who had managed to escape to the west through slightly less stringent border controls .
but her flight was foiled by the east german government and the family was forcibly separated .
gallus was thrown into prison , while her two daughters , aged 9 and 11 , were put in a children 's home .
free , but without her kids two years later , gallus was bought free by the west german government , a fairly common practice that earned the gdr regime much-needed hard currency in return for releasing mainly political prisoners .
she was , however , prevented by the regime from taking her children with her to the west . the film centers on gallus ' attempts to petition high-ranking west german politicians and bureaucrats and draw attention to her fight to get her daughters out of east germany .
on oct .
7 , 1984 , the 30th anniversary of the gdr , gallus planted herself at checkpoint charlie , the allied border crossing in berlin , with a placard around her neck reading : " my children have been forcibly given up for adoption !
please help us ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real jutta gallus protesting at checkpoint charlie in the 1980s gallus became a daily fixture at checkpoint charlie , demonstrating from dawn to dusk and inevitably drawing curious tourists and journalists .
her image and the tale of her fight to be with her children went around the world .
" checkpoint charlie was a legend in berlin , " jutta gallus , now jutta fleck , said recently in an interview with berlin daily tagesspiegel , explaining why she chose to demonstrate there .
" besides , there were tons of tourists there - it was just what i needed . "
protesting between kohl and brandt gallus proved untiring in her efforts to be reunited with her children in west germany .
at an event on the 25th anniversary of the division of germany , which was aired live on television , she leapt on stage between chancellor helmut kohl and former chancellor willy brandt and held up a placard .
" i 'm a live example .
i have been separated from my children for four years .
i appeal to you and the german government to do everything so that my children are finally with me , " gallus said in a shaky voice before being nudged aside by kohl .
not surprisingly , her public demonstrations embarrassed and annoyed the two german governments , who were at pains to maintain good diplomatic relations .
but her tactics also helped .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallus with her daughters when they were reunited after six years in 1988 in 1988 , six years after gallus first began protesting at checkpoint charlie , her daughters were allowed to leave and join their mother in the west .
it remains unclear what prompted the east german regime to take the unusual step .
critics say film jazzed up unnecessarily " i simply wanted to show that a normal person without weapons is in a position to change things , " fleck said this week after the film premiered in a berlin movie theater .
hans-dietrich genscher , west germany 's foreign minister from 1974 to 1992 , who met with gallus and heard out her case in the 1980s , said the film was an important contribution to understanding the past .
" it 's a deeply moving film , also because it focuses on the victims for the first time , " he said .
" there were unfortunately too many of these stories . "
but critics in germany were n't as enamored with the two-part drama that earned top television-viewer ratings .
many said the filmmakers should have cut out the gloss and cheese .

" why is the authentic story of suffering of a young mother being jazzed up as a spy thriller ? " a review in on der spiegel magazine 's web site asked .
" the real life of jutta gallus offers enough drama as it is . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

even so , a surprising number of people seem to have a selective memory of the country 's 40-year division .
as germany celebrates 17 years of unity on wednesday , oct .
3 , 19 percent of the 1,000 people questioned in a survey commissioned by private broadcaster n24 said they 'd like the berlin wall back .
some 21 percent of the country 's easterners polled admitted to feeling nostalgic about the concrete and barbed wire that separated them from the capitalist west , even though the border was patrolled by armed guards with shoot-to-kill orders .
but the repression , censorship and restricted personal freedom that were part of the german democratic republic are not such distant memories for the 75 percent of germans who said they were glad the wall was brought down .
political dissatisfaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall went up in 1961 and stayed up for 28 years the survey also asked eastern germans who they 'd vote for , were there an election this week .
back in december 1990 , when germany elected its first chancellor as a reunited country , some 44 percent of the electorate voted for the christian democrats headed by helmut kohl .
only 2.4 percent stood by the party of democratic socialism , the successor to the east german communist party .
reflecting their disillusionment , 31 percent now say they would give their vote to the left party , which partially consists of the pds as well as some left-leaning former members of the social democratic party .
the poll conducted by independent opinion research firm emnid found that 74 percent of easterners had felt like second-class citizens since germany reunited on oct .
3 , 1990 .
people on the other side of the country had exactly the opposite opinion .
some 73 percent of westerners said their countrymen to the east were no longer at a disadvantage in unified germany .
wall come tumbling down constructed in 1961 , the berlin wall was the communist dictatorship 's last-ditch attempt to stem the flood of refugees to the west and became the definitive symbol of the cold war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans began leaving the east in november 1989 and many continue to do so after mass demonstrations against the government in the fall of 1989 , the politburo led by egon krenz decided on nov .
9 to allow east germans to exit directly through crossing points between east germany and west germany , including in west berlin .
the wall came down in a peaceful revolution , paving the way to national unification 11 months later .
but the optimism of what become known as the wende , which translates to " change " or " turn , " was soon replaced by disappointment for many .
the former communist east continues to lag behind economically , despite the billions of euros in aid paid each year .
in the west , meanwhile , many resent having to contribute to solidarity pact funds , which are paid for with taxpayers ' money and planned to last until at least 2019 .
but while people in the west complain about their poor eastern relations , even today , salaries in the east remain 25 percent lower than in the west , according to the institute for labor market and career research in nuremberg .
unemployment hovers at about 15 percent in the eastern states compared to half that in the west . the economic gap between eastern and western germany , however , is not a indicator that reunification has failed , according to wolfgang thierse , a social democrat and the german parliament 's vice president . " you can not say that unity has failed , " he said , according to the daily tagesspiegel newspaper .

opposition to moving back to germany 's previous capital had been vocal and bonn residents thought that in the end , parliament would decide to stay . but at 9:47 p.m. , bundestag president rita süssmuth announced that parliament had voted 337 to 320 to pack up and move to berlin .

their diagnosis : 17 years after unification , germany 's emotional state remains disharmonious .
for , they say , many eastern germans are ashamed of the billion-euro subsidies they have received from the west in the past 17 years .
whether that is indeed the case is beside the point .
what remains is an interesting attempt to investigate the emotional life of us eastern germans , now among some of the best researched living beings on the planet .
educators and criminologists have looked at the consequences of a uniform upbringing .
sexologists have researched the secrets of the easterners ' especially active love lives .
reports that the stasi secret police spies collected about east germans have filled many a newspaper page over the years .
the government 's report on german unity : year after year a report about painstaking economic development in the east with the help of billions from the west .
german unity , it appears , is one-sided , with which western germans have had only one real thing to do over the years : they occupied the leadership roles and shoveled the billions into the new eastern german states .
since the easterner angela merkel became chancellor , they are only left the role of financier .
this admittedly slightly exaggerated characterization outlines a dilemma this unity day : it 's a holiday for all germans , but the event it reflects , aside from the official celebrations , again merely concerns the easterners .
in the east , every part of life has changed ; in the west , money has just become a bit scarcer .
for many , probably most , in the new eastern states , oct .
3 is a reason to celebrate , regardless of everyday worries .
no one wants to do without the freedoms gained , and the individual desire to go back to the gdr is to be taken as seriously as the desire to drive a trabi rather than a volkswagen .
and how is the westerner 's state of mind ?
traveling from berlin far into germany 's west , one gains some insight .
there are those who with gleaming eyes recall their spontaneous trip to berlin when the wall fell .
there are others who want to collect money for the wall to be rebuilt , because they 're fed up with the east .
sorry , it was all really just a joke !
asked how their lives have been changed by german unification , many westerners ' responses are marked by perplexed silence , shrugs of the shoulders .
it 's no wonder : the east has become an extension of the west .
the opportunity unification offered to create something new , together , is long past .
for many , if not most , normal westerners , oct .
3 is a day on which , above all , they are reminded that for 17 years they have been sending money to the east , and that there 's no end in sight .
even if , in the official speeches , no one says it that way .

the fact that former communist east germany 's government , with the help of its extensive network of spies and its dreaded stasi secret police , made life a living hell for many of its citizens is well known and documented - both in historic records and on the big screen in hugely successful dramas . but a recent film aired on german public network ard veered away from the fictional to reconstruct the real-life story of a gdr victim whose fight for justice remained a thorn in the side of both west and east germany for years . " the woman from checkpoint charlie " tells the story of jutta gallus , played by german actress veronica ferres .
a young , headstrong mother in east germany , gallus yearned to move to the free world on the other side of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film when jutta gallus , played by ferres , arrives in the west in 1982 , she tried to escape along with her two young daughters by pretending to be taking a vacation to eastern europe , where she hoped to emulate the example of countrymen who had managed to escape to the west through slightly less stringent border controls .
but her flight was foiled by the east german government and the family was forcibly separated .
gallus was thrown into prison , while her two daughters , aged 9 and 11 , were put in a children 's home .
free , but without her kids two years later , gallus was bought free by the west german government , a fairly common practice that earned the gdr regime much-needed hard currency in return for releasing mainly political prisoners .
she was , however , prevented by the regime from taking her children with her to the west . the film centers on gallus ' attempts to petition high-ranking west german politicians and bureaucrats and draw attention to her fight to get her daughters out of east germany .
on oct .
7 , 1984 , the 30th anniversary of the gdr , gallus planted herself at checkpoint charlie , the allied border crossing in berlin , with a placard around her neck reading : " my children have been forcibly given up for adoption !
please help us ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real jutta gallus protesting at checkpoint charlie in the 1980s gallus became a daily fixture at checkpoint charlie , demonstrating from dawn to dusk and inevitably drawing curious tourists and journalists .
her image and the tale of her fight to be with her children went around the world .
" checkpoint charlie was a legend in berlin , " jutta gallus , now jutta fleck , said recently in an interview with berlin daily tagesspiegel , explaining why she chose to demonstrate there .
" besides , there were tons of tourists there - it was just what i needed . "
protesting between kohl and brandt gallus proved untiring in her efforts to be reunited with her children in west germany .
at an event on the 25th anniversary of the division of germany , which was aired live on television , she leapt on stage between chancellor helmut kohl and former chancellor willy brandt and held up a placard .
" i 'm a live example .
i have been separated from my children for four years .
i appeal to you and the german government to do everything so that my children are finally with me , " gallus said in a shaky voice before being nudged aside by kohl .
not surprisingly , her public demonstrations embarrassed and annoyed the two german governments , who were at pains to maintain good diplomatic relations .
but her tactics also helped .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallus with her daughters when they were reunited after six years in 1988 in 1988 , six years after gallus first began protesting at checkpoint charlie , her daughters were allowed to leave and join their mother in the west .
it remains unclear what prompted the east german regime to take the unusual step .
critics say film jazzed up unnecessarily " i simply wanted to show that a normal person without weapons is in a position to change things , " fleck said this week after the film premiered in a berlin movie theater .
hans-dietrich genscher , west germany 's foreign minister from 1974 to 1992 , who met with gallus and heard out her case in the 1980s , said the film was an important contribution to understanding the past .
" it 's a deeply moving film , also because it focuses on the victims for the first time , " he said .
" there were unfortunately too many of these stories . "
but critics in germany were n't as enamored with the two-part drama that earned top television-viewer ratings .
many said the filmmakers should have cut out the gloss and cheese .

but it has beaten most expectations and become an urban success story . it was late on june 20 , 1991 , when bonn got the blow that most thought would seal the city 's fate .
parliamentarians had been debating whether to move the federal capital back to berlin from the small city on the rhine that had hosted the government since 1949 and were about to vote .
opposition to moving back to germany 's previous capital had been vocal and bonn residents thought that in the end , parliament would decide to stay . but at 9:47 p.m. , bundestag president rita süssmuth announced that parliament had voted 337 to 320 to pack up and move to berlin .
according to dorothea voigtländer , a journalist and author who was in the crowd that had gathered in bonn 's main square to follow the proceedings on a large screen , people were shocked into silence and the tears immediately began to fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster criticizing the government move to berlin reading " berlin republic ?
no thanks ! "
" all you could hear were raindrops on the roofs , as if the sky were crying with us , " she said .
" people said it was the city 's death blow and thought it would sink back into anonymity . " before 1949 , the year the nascent west german government voted to make bonn the provisional capital , bonn had been a pleasant , but unremarkable small city .
after it was catapulted to a new level , residents soon got used to the fringe benefits that came with international fame - visits from luminaries like queen elizabeth and john f. kennedy , prestige , money and jobs . " then suddenly in 1991 , everyone thought the lights had gone out , " said voigtländer .
" but in fact , they did n't . " successful transition today bonn is something of a poster child in germany for a city 's successful management of structural change .
dealt a potentially devastating blow , bonn rallied to attract new institutions and business to fill the void left by the exodus of politicians and many government ministries .
it played to its strengths , and thanks to a combination of factors - smart strategic planning , help from the federal government , and several home-field advantages - bonn , in many respects , was able to come out of the government move healthier than it was before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is a big employer in bonn instead of living off nostalgia , bonn , 17 years after reunification , has become one of germany 's more dynamic cities , with more residents and jobs than it had as the capital .
it has become the headquarters of several of germany 's high-profile , dax-listed firms , such as deutsche telekom , deutsche post and postbank , which have brought around 20,000 jobs to the region . the united nations has also moved to town with 12 of its institutions , including the secretariats on climate change and desertification .
a new international conference center scheduled to open in 2009 that can accommodate 5,000 aims at increasing bonn 's already growing international heft . while the parliament , chancellery and several ministries moved to berlin in 1999 , there is still a strong government presence on the rhine .
in addition to hosting institutions such as the federal anti-trust office and the federal audit office , bonn was able to keep six of germany 's 15 federal ministries and more than half of the 18,000 jobs associated with them . " bonn 's assets were and are political and diplomatic experience , top-qualified experts and the ability to look far beyond the city 's borders , " said bonn mayor bärbel dieckmann in a statement .
she has been widely praised for her stewardship of the city 's transformation . help from the feds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " house of history of the german federal republic , " part of bonn 's " museum mile " the city was helped greatly by the berlin-bonn act of 1994 , in which the federal government promised not to abandon the city entirely .
money was part of the deal , and the agreement resulted in more than 1.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- of federal largesse for bonn . the money has been wisely spent , according to sandra ludwig of the bonn chamber of commerce .
instead of following the watering-can method , officials targeted the funds in accordance with a detailed strategy that included profiling the city as germany 's second government city , marketing it as a location for international dialogue , creating a research and development hub and increasing its cultural offerings . " they were able to cushion the much-feared structural change and even turn things to its favor , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un complex in bonn with unemployment at 7.1 percent , bonn is well under the german average of 8.4 percent and boasts a jobless rate that the current federal capital can only dream of .
it has also been helped by its concentration of highly skilled workers , another magnet for businesses .
in the bonn region , 19.4 percent of people have university degrees compared with the german average of 9.8 percent . bonn gets high scores in many other areas , be it real estate , as a location for industry due to its infrastructure and geographical position , or simply quality of life .
it has become a stop on the tourism circuit thanks to its " museum mile " and international beethoven festival .
its central location and attractive natural surroundings have also gained it many fans . ongoing process but ludwig warns against being too complacent and sitting on any laurels .
the federal incentives have stopped and bonn has to make sure it continues to change with the times and looks at new ways to grow the economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn 's beethoven festival honors the city 's native son " the city is now competing on an international as well as national stage , " she said .
" structural change is a continual process that does n't just stop one day . " dorothea voigtländer , who was born in bonn in 1943 to a belgian mother and french father who were active in the resistance , thinks bonn can pull it off .
she said the city 's recent success story has as much to do with its residents as it does with good government policy . " they 've got a very tolerant , flexible and optimistic mentality , " she said .
" they just said , ' okay , we 'll tackle this problem and it 'll be fine . '

the fact that former communist east germany 's government , with the help of its extensive network of spies and its dreaded stasi secret police , made life a living hell for many of its citizens is well known and documented - both in historic records and on the big screen in hugely successful dramas . but a recent film aired on german public network ard veered away from the fictional to reconstruct the real-life story of a gdr victim whose fight for justice remained a thorn in the side of both west and east germany for years . " the woman from checkpoint charlie " tells the story of jutta gallus , played by german actress veronica ferres .
a young , headstrong mother in east germany , gallus yearned to move to the free world on the other side of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film when jutta gallus , played by ferres , arrives in the west in 1982 , she tried to escape along with her two young daughters by pretending to be taking a vacation to eastern europe , where she hoped to emulate the example of countrymen who had managed to escape to the west through slightly less stringent border controls .
but her flight was foiled by the east german government and the family was forcibly separated .
gallus was thrown into prison , while her two daughters , aged 9 and 11 , were put in a children 's home .
free , but without her kids two years later , gallus was bought free by the west german government , a fairly common practice that earned the gdr regime much-needed hard currency in return for releasing mainly political prisoners .
she was , however , prevented by the regime from taking her children with her to the west . the film centers on gallus ' attempts to petition high-ranking west german politicians and bureaucrats and draw attention to her fight to get her daughters out of east germany .
on oct .
7 , 1984 , the 30th anniversary of the gdr , gallus planted herself at checkpoint charlie , the allied border crossing in berlin , with a placard around her neck reading : " my children have been forcibly given up for adoption !
please help us ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real jutta gallus protesting at checkpoint charlie in the 1980s gallus became a daily fixture at checkpoint charlie , demonstrating from dawn to dusk and inevitably drawing curious tourists and journalists .
her image and the tale of her fight to be with her children went around the world .
" checkpoint charlie was a legend in berlin , " jutta gallus , now jutta fleck , said recently in an interview with berlin daily tagesspiegel , explaining why she chose to demonstrate there .
" besides , there were tons of tourists there - it was just what i needed . "
protesting between kohl and brandt gallus proved untiring in her efforts to be reunited with her children in west germany .
at an event on the 25th anniversary of the division of germany , which was aired live on television , she leapt on stage between chancellor helmut kohl and former chancellor willy brandt and held up a placard .
" i 'm a live example .
i have been separated from my children for four years .
i appeal to you and the german government to do everything so that my children are finally with me , " gallus said in a shaky voice before being nudged aside by kohl .
not surprisingly , her public demonstrations embarrassed and annoyed the two german governments , who were at pains to maintain good diplomatic relations .
but her tactics also helped .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallus with her daughters when they were reunited after six years in 1988 in 1988 , six years after gallus first began protesting at checkpoint charlie , her daughters were allowed to leave and join their mother in the west .
it remains unclear what prompted the east german regime to take the unusual step .
critics say film jazzed up unnecessarily " i simply wanted to show that a normal person without weapons is in a position to change things , " fleck said this week after the film premiered in a berlin movie theater .
hans-dietrich genscher , west germany 's foreign minister from 1974 to 1992 , who met with gallus and heard out her case in the 1980s , said the film was an important contribution to understanding the past .
" it 's a deeply moving film , also because it focuses on the victims for the first time , " he said .
" there were unfortunately too many of these stories . "
but critics in germany were n't as enamored with the two-part drama that earned top television-viewer ratings .
many said the filmmakers should have cut out the gloss and cheese .

even so , a surprising number of people seem to have a selective memory of the country 's 40-year division .
as germany celebrates 17 years of unity on wednesday , oct .
3 , 19 percent of the 1,000 people questioned in a survey commissioned by private broadcaster n24 said they 'd like the berlin wall back .
some 21 percent of the country 's easterners polled admitted to feeling nostalgic about the concrete and barbed wire that separated them from the capitalist west , even though the border was patrolled by armed guards with shoot-to-kill orders .
but the repression , censorship and restricted personal freedom that were part of the german democratic republic are not such distant memories for the 75 percent of germans who said they were glad the wall was brought down .
political dissatisfaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall went up in 1961 and stayed up for 28 years the survey also asked eastern germans who they 'd vote for , were there an election this week .
back in december 1990 , when germany elected its first chancellor as a reunited country , some 44 percent of the electorate voted for the christian democrats headed by helmut kohl .
only 2.4 percent stood by the party of democratic socialism , the successor to the east german communist party .
reflecting their disillusionment , 31 percent now say they would give their vote to the left party , which partially consists of the pds as well as some left-leaning former members of the social democratic party .
the poll conducted by independent opinion research firm emnid found that 74 percent of easterners had felt like second-class citizens since germany reunited on oct .
3 , 1990 .
people on the other side of the country had exactly the opposite opinion .
some 73 percent of westerners said their countrymen to the east were no longer at a disadvantage in unified germany .
wall come tumbling down constructed in 1961 , the berlin wall was the communist dictatorship 's last-ditch attempt to stem the flood of refugees to the west and became the definitive symbol of the cold war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans began leaving the east in november 1989 and many continue to do so after mass demonstrations against the government in the fall of 1989 , the politburo led by egon krenz decided on nov .
9 to allow east germans to exit directly through crossing points between east germany and west germany , including in west berlin .
the wall came down in a peaceful revolution , paving the way to national unification 11 months later .
but the optimism of what become known as the wende , which translates to " change " or " turn , " was soon replaced by disappointment for many .
the former communist east continues to lag behind economically , despite the billions of euros in aid paid each year .
in the west , meanwhile , many resent having to contribute to solidarity pact funds , which are paid for with taxpayers ' money and planned to last until at least 2019 .
but while people in the west complain about their poor eastern relations , even today , salaries in the east remain 25 percent lower than in the west , according to the institute for labor market and career research in nuremberg .
unemployment hovers at about 15 percent in the eastern states compared to half that in the west . the economic gap between eastern and western germany , however , is not a indicator that reunification has failed , according to wolfgang thierse , a social democrat and the german parliament 's vice president . " you can not say that unity has failed , " he said , according to the daily tagesspiegel newspaper .

but it has beaten most expectations and become an urban success story . it was late on june 20 , 1991 , when bonn got the blow that most thought would seal the city 's fate .
parliamentarians had been debating whether to move the federal capital back to berlin from the small city on the rhine that had hosted the government since 1949 and were about to vote .
opposition to moving back to germany 's previous capital had been vocal and bonn residents thought that in the end , parliament would decide to stay . but at 9:47 p.m. , bundestag president rita süssmuth announced that parliament had voted 337 to 320 to pack up and move to berlin .
according to dorothea voigtländer , a journalist and author who was in the crowd that had gathered in bonn 's main square to follow the proceedings on a large screen , people were shocked into silence and the tears immediately began to fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster criticizing the government move to berlin reading " berlin republic ?

the fact that former communist east germany 's government , with the help of its extensive network of spies and its dreaded stasi secret police , made life a living hell for many of its citizens is well known and documented - both in historic records and on the big screen in hugely successful dramas . but a recent film aired on german public network ard veered away from the fictional to reconstruct the real-life story of a gdr victim whose fight for justice remained a thorn in the side of both west and east germany for years . " the woman from checkpoint charlie " tells the story of jutta gallus , played by german actress veronica ferres .
a young , headstrong mother in east germany , gallus yearned to move to the free world on the other side of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film when jutta gallus , played by ferres , arrives in the west in 1982 , she tried to escape along with her two young daughters by pretending to be taking a vacation to eastern europe , where she hoped to emulate the example of countrymen who had managed to escape to the west through slightly less stringent border controls .
but her flight was foiled by the east german government and the family was forcibly separated .
gallus was thrown into prison , while her two daughters , aged 9 and 11 , were put in a children 's home .
free , but without her kids two years later , gallus was bought free by the west german government , a fairly common practice that earned the gdr regime much-needed hard currency in return for releasing mainly political prisoners .
she was , however , prevented by the regime from taking her children with her to the west . the film centers on gallus ' attempts to petition high-ranking west german politicians and bureaucrats and draw attention to her fight to get her daughters out of east germany .
on oct .
7 , 1984 , the 30th anniversary of the gdr , gallus planted herself at checkpoint charlie , the allied border crossing in berlin , with a placard around her neck reading : " my children have been forcibly given up for adoption !
please help us ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real jutta gallus protesting at checkpoint charlie in the 1980s gallus became a daily fixture at checkpoint charlie , demonstrating from dawn to dusk and inevitably drawing curious tourists and journalists .
her image and the tale of her fight to be with her children went around the world .
" checkpoint charlie was a legend in berlin , " jutta gallus , now jutta fleck , said recently in an interview with berlin daily tagesspiegel , explaining why she chose to demonstrate there .
" besides , there were tons of tourists there - it was just what i needed . "
protesting between kohl and brandt gallus proved untiring in her efforts to be reunited with her children in west germany .
at an event on the 25th anniversary of the division of germany , which was aired live on television , she leapt on stage between chancellor helmut kohl and former chancellor willy brandt and held up a placard .
" i 'm a live example .
i have been separated from my children for four years .
i appeal to you and the german government to do everything so that my children are finally with me , " gallus said in a shaky voice before being nudged aside by kohl .

" it 's a deeply moving film , also because it focuses on the victims for the first time , " he said .

but critics in germany were n't as enamored with the two-part drama that earned top television-viewer ratings .

but it has beaten most expectations and become an urban success story . it was late on june 20 , 1991 , when bonn got the blow that most thought would seal the city 's fate .
parliamentarians had been debating whether to move the federal capital back to berlin from the small city on the rhine that had hosted the government since 1949 and were about to vote .
opposition to moving back to germany 's previous capital had been vocal and bonn residents thought that in the end , parliament would decide to stay . but at 9:47 p.m. , bundestag president rita süssmuth announced that parliament had voted 337 to 320 to pack up and move to berlin .
according to dorothea voigtländer , a journalist and author who was in the crowd that had gathered in bonn 's main square to follow the proceedings on a large screen , people were shocked into silence and the tears immediately began to fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster criticizing the government move to berlin reading " berlin republic ?
no thanks ! "
" all you could hear were raindrops on the roofs , as if the sky were crying with us , " she said .
" people said it was the city 's death blow and thought it would sink back into anonymity . " before 1949 , the year the nascent west german government voted to make bonn the provisional capital , bonn had been a pleasant , but unremarkable small city .
after it was catapulted to a new level , residents soon got used to the fringe benefits that came with international fame - visits from luminaries like queen elizabeth and john f. kennedy , prestige , money and jobs . " then suddenly in 1991 , everyone thought the lights had gone out , " said voigtländer .
" but in fact , they did n't . " successful transition today bonn is something of a poster child in germany for a city 's successful management of structural change .
dealt a potentially devastating blow , bonn rallied to attract new institutions and business to fill the void left by the exodus of politicians and many government ministries .
it played to its strengths , and thanks to a combination of factors - smart strategic planning , help from the federal government , and several home-field advantages - bonn , in many respects , was able to come out of the government move healthier than it was before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is a big employer in bonn instead of living off nostalgia , bonn , 17 years after reunification , has become one of germany 's more dynamic cities , with more residents and jobs than it had as the capital .
it has become the headquarters of several of germany 's high-profile , dax-listed firms , such as deutsche telekom , deutsche post and postbank , which have brought around 20,000 jobs to the region . the united nations has also moved to town with 12 of its institutions , including the secretariats on climate change and desertification .
a new international conference center scheduled to open in 2009 that can accommodate 5,000 aims at increasing bonn 's already growing international heft . while the parliament , chancellery and several ministries moved to berlin in 1999 , there is still a strong government presence on the rhine .
in addition to hosting institutions such as the federal anti-trust office and the federal audit office , bonn was able to keep six of germany 's 15 federal ministries and more than half of the 18,000 jobs associated with them . " bonn 's assets were and are political and diplomatic experience , top-qualified experts and the ability to look far beyond the city 's borders , " said bonn mayor bärbel dieckmann in a statement .
she has been widely praised for her stewardship of the city 's transformation . help from the feds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " house of history of the german federal republic , " part of bonn 's " museum mile " the city was helped greatly by the berlin-bonn act of 1994 , in which the federal government promised not to abandon the city entirely .
money was part of the deal , and the agreement resulted in more than 1.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- of federal largesse for bonn . the money has been wisely spent , according to sandra ludwig of the bonn chamber of commerce .
instead of following the watering-can method , officials targeted the funds in accordance with a detailed strategy that included profiling the city as germany 's second government city , marketing it as a location for international dialogue , creating a research and development hub and increasing its cultural offerings . " they were able to cushion the much-feared structural change and even turn things to its favor , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un complex in bonn with unemployment at 7.1 percent , bonn is well under the german average of 8.4 percent and boasts a jobless rate that the current federal capital can only dream of .
it has also been helped by its concentration of highly skilled workers , another magnet for businesses .
in the bonn region , 19.4 percent of people have university degrees compared with the german average of 9.8 percent . bonn gets high scores in many other areas , be it real estate , as a location for industry due to its infrastructure and geographical position , or simply quality of life .
it has become a stop on the tourism circuit thanks to its " museum mile " and international beethoven festival .
its central location and attractive natural surroundings have also gained it many fans . ongoing process but ludwig warns against being too complacent and sitting on any laurels .
the federal incentives have stopped and bonn has to make sure it continues to change with the times and looks at new ways to grow the economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn 's beethoven festival honors the city 's native son " the city is now competing on an international as well as national stage , " she said .
" structural change is a continual process that does n't just stop one day . " dorothea voigtländer , who was born in bonn in 1943 to a belgian mother and french father who were active in the resistance , thinks bonn can pull it off .
she said the city 's recent success story has as much to do with its residents as it does with good government policy . " they 've got a very tolerant , flexible and optimistic mentality , " she said .
" they just said , ' okay , we 'll tackle this problem and it 'll be fine . '

the fact that former communist east germany 's government , with the help of its extensive network of spies and its dreaded stasi secret police , made life a living hell for many of its citizens is well known and documented - both in historic records and on the big screen in hugely successful dramas . but a recent film aired on german public network ard veered away from the fictional to reconstruct the real-life story of a gdr victim whose fight for justice remained a thorn in the side of both west and east germany for years . " the woman from checkpoint charlie " tells the story of jutta gallus , played by german actress veronica ferres .
a young , headstrong mother in east germany , gallus yearned to move to the free world on the other side of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film when jutta gallus , played by ferres , arrives in the west in 1982 , she tried to escape along with her two young daughters by pretending to be taking a vacation to eastern europe , where she hoped to emulate the example of countrymen who had managed to escape to the west through slightly less stringent border controls .
but her flight was foiled by the east german government and the family was forcibly separated .
gallus was thrown into prison , while her two daughters , aged 9 and 11 , were put in a children 's home .
free , but without her kids two years later , gallus was bought free by the west german government , a fairly common practice that earned the gdr regime much-needed hard currency in return for releasing mainly political prisoners .
she was , however , prevented by the regime from taking her children with her to the west . the film centers on gallus ' attempts to petition high-ranking west german politicians and bureaucrats and draw attention to her fight to get her daughters out of east germany .
on oct .
7 , 1984 , the 30th anniversary of the gdr , gallus planted herself at checkpoint charlie , the allied border crossing in berlin , with a placard around her neck reading : " my children have been forcibly given up for adoption !
please help us ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real jutta gallus protesting at checkpoint charlie in the 1980s gallus became a daily fixture at checkpoint charlie , demonstrating from dawn to dusk and inevitably drawing curious tourists and journalists .
her image and the tale of her fight to be with her children went around the world .
" checkpoint charlie was a legend in berlin , " jutta gallus , now jutta fleck , said recently in an interview with berlin daily tagesspiegel , explaining why she chose to demonstrate there .
" besides , there were tons of tourists there - it was just what i needed . "
protesting between kohl and brandt gallus proved untiring in her efforts to be reunited with her children in west germany .
at an event on the 25th anniversary of the division of germany , which was aired live on television , she leapt on stage between chancellor helmut kohl and former chancellor willy brandt and held up a placard .
" i 'm a live example .
i have been separated from my children for four years .
i appeal to you and the german government to do everything so that my children are finally with me , " gallus said in a shaky voice before being nudged aside by kohl .
not surprisingly , her public demonstrations embarrassed and annoyed the two german governments , who were at pains to maintain good diplomatic relations .
but her tactics also helped .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallus with her daughters when they were reunited after six years in 1988 in 1988 , six years after gallus first began protesting at checkpoint charlie , her daughters were allowed to leave and join their mother in the west .
it remains unclear what prompted the east german regime to take the unusual step .
critics say film jazzed up unnecessarily " i simply wanted to show that a normal person without weapons is in a position to change things , " fleck said this week after the film premiered in a berlin movie theater .
hans-dietrich genscher , west germany 's foreign minister from 1974 to 1992 , who met with gallus and heard out her case in the 1980s , said the film was an important contribution to understanding the past .
" it 's a deeply moving film , also because it focuses on the victims for the first time , " he said .
" there were unfortunately too many of these stories . "
but critics in germany were n't as enamored with the two-part drama that earned top television-viewer ratings .
many said the filmmakers should have cut out the gloss and cheese .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 03.10.2007 opinion : german unity means freedom to east , money to west großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as germany marks the 17th anniversary of the country 's unification , east and west look at the day in fundamentally different ways , with celebration on one side and resentment on the other , according to dw 's bernd grässl psychologists have had their say just in time for the german unification day .
their diagnosis : 17 years after unification , germany 's emotional state remains disharmonious .
for , they say , many eastern germans are ashamed of the billion-euro subsidies they have received from the west in the past 17 years .
whether that is indeed the case is beside the point .
what remains is an interesting attempt to investigate the emotional life of us eastern germans , now among some of the best researched living beings on the planet .
educators and criminologists have looked at the consequences of a uniform upbringing .
sexologists have researched the secrets of the easterners ' especially active love lives .
reports that the stasi secret police spies collected about east germans have filled many a newspaper page over the years .
the government 's report on german unity : year after year a report about painstaking economic development in the east with the help of billions from the west .
german unity , it appears , is one-sided , with which western germans have had only one real thing to do over the years : they occupied the leadership roles and shoveled the billions into the new eastern german states .
since the easterner angela merkel became chancellor , they are only left the role of financier .
this admittedly slightly exaggerated characterization outlines a dilemma this unity day : it 's a holiday for all germans , but the event it reflects , aside from the official celebrations , again merely concerns the easterners .
in the east , every part of life has changed ; in the west , money has just become a bit scarcer .
for many , probably most , in the new eastern states , oct .
3 is a reason to celebrate , regardless of everyday worries .
no one wants to do without the freedoms gained , and the individual desire to go back to the gdr is to be taken as seriously as the desire to drive a trabi rather than a volkswagen .
and how is the westerner 's state of mind ?
traveling from berlin far into germany 's west , one gains some insight .
there are those who with gleaming eyes recall their spontaneous trip to berlin when the wall fell .
there are others who want to collect money for the wall to be rebuilt , because they 're fed up with the east .
sorry , it was all really just a joke !
asked how their lives have been changed by german unification , many westerners ' responses are marked by perplexed silence , shrugs of the shoulders .
it 's no wonder : the east has become an extension of the west .
the opportunity unification offered to create something new , together , is long past .
for many , if not most , normal westerners , oct .
3 is a day on which , above all , they are reminded that for 17 years they have been sending money to the east , and that there 's no end in sight .
even if , in the official speeches , no one says it that way .

even so , a surprising number of people seem to have a selective memory of the country 's 40-year division .
as germany celebrates 17 years of unity on wednesday , oct .
3 , 19 percent of the 1,000 people questioned in a survey commissioned by private broadcaster n24 said they 'd like the berlin wall back .
some 21 percent of the country 's easterners polled admitted to feeling nostalgic about the concrete and barbed wire that separated them from the capitalist west , even though the border was patrolled by armed guards with shoot-to-kill orders .
but the repression , censorship and restricted personal freedom that were part of the german democratic republic are not such distant memories for the 75 percent of germans who said they were glad the wall was brought down .
political dissatisfaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall went up in 1961 and stayed up for 28 years the survey also asked eastern germans who they 'd vote for , were there an election this week .
back in december 1990 , when germany elected its first chancellor as a reunited country , some 44 percent of the electorate voted for the christian democrats headed by helmut kohl .
only 2.4 percent stood by the party of democratic socialism , the successor to the east german communist party .
reflecting their disillusionment , 31 percent now say they would give their vote to the left party , which partially consists of the pds as well as some left-leaning former members of the social democratic party .
the poll conducted by independent opinion research firm emnid found that 74 percent of easterners had felt like second-class citizens since germany reunited on oct .
3 , 1990 .
people on the other side of the country had exactly the opposite opinion .
some 73 percent of westerners said their countrymen to the east were no longer at a disadvantage in unified germany .
wall come tumbling down constructed in 1961 , the berlin wall was the communist dictatorship 's last-ditch attempt to stem the flood of refugees to the west and became the definitive symbol of the cold war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans began leaving the east in november 1989 and many continue to do so after mass demonstrations against the government in the fall of 1989 , the politburo led by egon krenz decided on nov .
9 to allow east germans to exit directly through crossing points between east germany and west germany , including in west berlin .
the wall came down in a peaceful revolution , paving the way to national unification 11 months later .
but the optimism of what become known as the wende , which translates to " change " or " turn , " was soon replaced by disappointment for many .
the former communist east continues to lag behind economically , despite the billions of euros in aid paid each year .
in the west , meanwhile , many resent having to contribute to solidarity pact funds , which are paid for with taxpayers ' money and planned to last until at least 2019 .
but while people in the west complain about their poor eastern relations , even today , salaries in the east remain 25 percent lower than in the west , according to the institute for labor market and career research in nuremberg .
unemployment hovers at about 15 percent in the eastern states compared to half that in the west . the economic gap between eastern and western germany , however , is not a indicator that reunification has failed , according to wolfgang thierse , a social democrat and the german parliament 's vice president .

but it has beaten most expectations and become an urban success story . it was late on june 20 , 1991 , when bonn got the blow that most thought would seal the city 's fate .
parliamentarians had been debating whether to move the federal capital back to berlin from the small city on the rhine that had hosted the government since 1949 and were about to vote .
opposition to moving back to germany 's previous capital had been vocal and bonn residents thought that in the end , parliament would decide to stay . but at 9:47 p.m. , bundestag president rita süssmuth announced that parliament had voted 337 to 320 to pack up and move to berlin .
according to dorothea voigtländer , a journalist and author who was in the crowd that had gathered in bonn 's main square to follow the proceedings on a large screen , people were shocked into silence and the tears immediately began to fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster criticizing the government move to berlin reading " berlin republic ?
no thanks ! "
" all you could hear were raindrops on the roofs , as if the sky were crying with us , " she said .
" people said it was the city 's death blow and thought it would sink back into anonymity . " before 1949 , the year the nascent west german government voted to make bonn the provisional capital , bonn had been a pleasant , but unremarkable small city .
after it was catapulted to a new level , residents soon got used to the fringe benefits that came with international fame - visits from luminaries like queen elizabeth and john f. kennedy , prestige , money and jobs . " then suddenly in 1991 , everyone thought the lights had gone out , " said voigtländer .
" but in fact , they did n't . " successful transition today bonn is something of a poster child in germany for a city 's successful management of structural change .
dealt a potentially devastating blow , bonn rallied to attract new institutions and business to fill the void left by the exodus of politicians and many government ministries .
it played to its strengths , and thanks to a combination of factors - smart strategic planning , help from the federal government , and several home-field advantages - bonn , in many respects , was able to come out of the government move healthier than it was before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is a big employer in bonn instead of living off nostalgia , bonn , 17 years after reunification , has become one of germany 's more dynamic cities , with more residents and jobs than it had as the capital .
it has become the headquarters of several of germany 's high-profile , dax-listed firms , such as deutsche telekom , deutsche post and postbank , which have brought around 20,000 jobs to the region . the united nations has also moved to town with 12 of its institutions , including the secretariats on climate change and desertification .
a new international conference center scheduled to open in 2009 that can accommodate 5,000 aims at increasing bonn 's already growing international heft . while the parliament , chancellery and several ministries moved to berlin in 1999 , there is still a strong government presence on the rhine .
in addition to hosting institutions such as the federal anti-trust office and the federal audit office , bonn was able to keep six of germany 's 15 federal ministries and more than half of the 18,000 jobs associated with them . " bonn 's assets were and are political and diplomatic experience , top-qualified experts and the ability to look far beyond the city 's borders , " said bonn mayor bärbel dieckmann in a statement .
she has been widely praised for her stewardship of the city 's transformation . help from the feds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " house of history of the german federal republic , " part of bonn 's " museum mile " the city was helped greatly by the berlin-bonn act of 1994 , in which the federal government promised not to abandon the city entirely .
money was part of the deal , and the agreement resulted in more than 1.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- of federal largesse for bonn . the money has been wisely spent , according to sandra ludwig of the bonn chamber of commerce .
instead of following the watering-can method , officials targeted the funds in accordance with a detailed strategy that included profiling the city as germany 's second government city , marketing it as a location for international dialogue , creating a research and development hub and increasing its cultural offerings . " they were able to cushion the much-feared structural change and even turn things to its favor , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un complex in bonn with unemployment at 7.1 percent , bonn is well under the german average of 8.4 percent and boasts a jobless rate that the current federal capital can only dream of .
it has also been helped by its concentration of highly skilled workers , another magnet for businesses .
in the bonn region , 19.4 percent of people have university degrees compared with the german average of 9.8 percent . bonn gets high scores in many other areas , be it real estate , as a location for industry due to its infrastructure and geographical position , or simply quality of life .
it has become a stop on the tourism circuit thanks to its " museum mile " and international beethoven festival .
its central location and attractive natural surroundings have also gained it many fans . ongoing process but ludwig warns against being too complacent and sitting on any laurels .
the federal incentives have stopped and bonn has to make sure it continues to change with the times and looks at new ways to grow the economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn 's beethoven festival honors the city 's native son " the city is now competing on an international as well as national stage , " she said .
" structural change is a continual process that does n't just stop one day . " dorothea voigtländer , who was born in bonn in 1943 to a belgian mother and french father who were active in the resistance , thinks bonn can pull it off .
she said the city 's recent success story has as much to do with its residents as it does with good government policy . " they 've got a very tolerant , flexible and optimistic mentality , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 03.10.2007 opinion : german unity means freedom to east , money to west großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as germany marks the 17th anniversary of the country 's unification , east and west look at the day in fundamentally different ways , with celebration on one side and resentment on the other , according to dw 's bernd grässl psychologists have had their say just in time for the german unification day .
their diagnosis : 17 years after unification , germany 's emotional state remains disharmonious .
for , they say , many eastern germans are ashamed of the billion-euro subsidies they have received from the west in the past 17 years .
whether that is indeed the case is beside the point .
what remains is an interesting attempt to investigate the emotional life of us eastern germans , now among some of the best researched living beings on the planet .
educators and criminologists have looked at the consequences of a uniform upbringing .
sexologists have researched the secrets of the easterners ' especially active love lives .
reports that the stasi secret police spies collected about east germans have filled many a newspaper page over the years .
the government 's report on german unity : year after year a report about painstaking economic development in the east with the help of billions from the west .
german unity , it appears , is one-sided , with which western germans have had only one real thing to do over the years : they occupied the leadership roles and shoveled the billions into the new eastern german states .
since the easterner angela merkel became chancellor , they are only left the role of financier .
this admittedly slightly exaggerated characterization outlines a dilemma this unity day : it 's a holiday for all germans , but the event it reflects , aside from the official celebrations , again merely concerns the easterners .
in the east , every part of life has changed ; in the west , money has just become a bit scarcer .
for many , probably most , in the new eastern states , oct .
3 is a reason to celebrate , regardless of everyday worries .
no one wants to do without the freedoms gained , and the individual desire to go back to the gdr is to be taken as seriously as the desire to drive a trabi rather than a volkswagen .
and how is the westerner 's state of mind ?
traveling from berlin far into germany 's west , one gains some insight .
there are those who with gleaming eyes recall their spontaneous trip to berlin when the wall fell .
there are others who want to collect money for the wall to be rebuilt , because they 're fed up with the east .
sorry , it was all really just a joke !
asked how their lives have been changed by german unification , many westerners ' responses are marked by perplexed silence , shrugs of the shoulders .
it 's no wonder : the east has become an extension of the west .
the opportunity unification offered to create something new , together , is long past .
for many , if not most , normal westerners , oct .
3 is a day on which , above all , they are reminded that for 17 years they have been sending money to the east , and that there 's no end in sight .
even if , in the official speeches , no one says it that way .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 03.10.2007 film recounts story of family split by divided germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress veronica ferres plays the demonstrating mother at checkpoint charlie a film on the real-life story of a woman 's long struggle in the 1980s to get her children from east germany to join her in the west has drawn renewed attention to the brutality of the former communist regime . the theme is n't new .
the fact that former communist east germany 's government , with the help of its extensive network of spies and its dreaded stasi secret police , made life a living hell for many of its citizens is well known and documented - both in historic records and on the big screen in hugely successful dramas . but a recent film aired on german public network ard veered away from the fictional to reconstruct the real-life story of a gdr victim whose fight for justice remained a thorn in the side of both west and east germany for years . " the woman from checkpoint charlie " tells the story of jutta gallus , played by german actress veronica ferres .
a young , headstrong mother in east germany , gallus yearned to move to the free world on the other side of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film when jutta gallus , played by ferres , arrives in the west in 1982 , she tried to escape along with her two young daughters by pretending to be taking a vacation to eastern europe , where she hoped to emulate the example of countrymen who had managed to escape to the west through slightly less stringent border controls .
but her flight was foiled by the east german government and the family was forcibly separated .
gallus was thrown into prison , while her two daughters , aged 9 and 11 , were put in a children 's home .
free , but without her kids two years later , gallus was bought free by the west german government , a fairly common practice that earned the gdr regime much-needed hard currency in return for releasing mainly political prisoners .
she was , however , prevented by the regime from taking her children with her to the west . the film centers on gallus ' attempts to petition high-ranking west german politicians and bureaucrats and draw attention to her fight to get her daughters out of east germany .
on oct .
7 , 1984 , the 30th anniversary of the gdr , gallus planted herself at checkpoint charlie , the allied border crossing in berlin , with a placard around her neck reading : " my children have been forcibly given up for adoption !
please help us ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real jutta gallus protesting at checkpoint charlie in the 1980s gallus became a daily fixture at checkpoint charlie , demonstrating from dawn to dusk and inevitably drawing curious tourists and journalists .
her image and the tale of her fight to be with her children went around the world .
" checkpoint charlie was a legend in berlin , " jutta gallus , now jutta fleck , said recently in an interview with berlin daily tagesspiegel , explaining why she chose to demonstrate there .
" besides , there were tons of tourists there - it was just what i needed . "
protesting between kohl and brandt gallus proved untiring in her efforts to be reunited with her children in west germany .
at an event on the 25th anniversary of the division of germany , which was aired live on television , she leapt on stage between chancellor helmut kohl and former chancellor willy brandt and held up a placard .
" i 'm a live example .
i have been separated from my children for four years .
i appeal to you and the german government to do everything so that my children are finally with me , " gallus said in a shaky voice before being nudged aside by kohl .
not surprisingly , her public demonstrations embarrassed and annoyed the two german governments , who were at pains to maintain good diplomatic relations .
but her tactics also helped .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallus with her daughters when they were reunited after six years in 1988 in 1988 , six years after gallus first began protesting at checkpoint charlie , her daughters were allowed to leave and join their mother in the west .
it remains unclear what prompted the east german regime to take the unusual step .
critics say film jazzed up unnecessarily " i simply wanted to show that a normal person without weapons is in a position to change things , " fleck said this week after the film premiered in a berlin movie theater .
hans-dietrich genscher , west germany 's foreign minister from 1974 to 1992 , who met with gallus and heard out her case in the 1980s , said the film was an important contribution to understanding the past .
" it 's a deeply moving film , also because it focuses on the victims for the first time , " he said .
" there were unfortunately too many of these stories . "
but critics in germany were n't as enamored with the two-part drama that earned top television-viewer ratings .
many said the filmmakers should have cut out the gloss and cheese .
" why is the authentic story of suffering of a young mother being jazzed up as a spy thriller ? " a review in on der spiegel magazine 's web site asked .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 03.10.2007 film recounts story of family split by divided germany großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : actress veronica ferres plays the demonstrating mother at checkpoint charlie a film on the real-life story of a woman 's long struggle in the 1980s to get her children from east germany to join her in the west has drawn renewed attention to the brutality of the former communist regime . the theme is n't new .
the fact that former communist east germany 's government , with the help of its extensive network of spies and its dreaded stasi secret police , made life a living hell for many of its citizens is well known and documented - both in historic records and on the big screen in hugely successful dramas . but a recent film aired on german public network ard veered away from the fictional to reconstruct the real-life story of a gdr victim whose fight for justice remained a thorn in the side of both west and east germany for years . " the woman from checkpoint charlie " tells the story of jutta gallus , played by german actress veronica ferres .
a young , headstrong mother in east germany , gallus yearned to move to the free world on the other side of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film when jutta gallus , played by ferres , arrives in the west in 1982 , she tried to escape along with her two young daughters by pretending to be taking a vacation to eastern europe , where she hoped to emulate the example of countrymen who had managed to escape to the west through slightly less stringent border controls .
but her flight was foiled by the east german government and the family was forcibly separated .
gallus was thrown into prison , while her two daughters , aged 9 and 11 , were put in a children 's home .
free , but without her kids two years later , gallus was bought free by the west german government , a fairly common practice that earned the gdr regime much-needed hard currency in return for releasing mainly political prisoners .
she was , however , prevented by the regime from taking her children with her to the west . the film centers on gallus ' attempts to petition high-ranking west german politicians and bureaucrats and draw attention to her fight to get her daughters out of east germany .
on oct .
7 , 1984 , the 30th anniversary of the gdr , gallus planted herself at checkpoint charlie , the allied border crossing in berlin , with a placard around her neck reading : " my children have been forcibly given up for adoption !
please help us ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real jutta gallus protesting at checkpoint charlie in the 1980s gallus became a daily fixture at checkpoint charlie , demonstrating from dawn to dusk and inevitably drawing curious tourists and journalists .
her image and the tale of her fight to be with her children went around the world .
" checkpoint charlie was a legend in berlin , " jutta gallus , now jutta fleck , said recently in an interview with berlin daily tagesspiegel , explaining why she chose to demonstrate there .
" besides , there were tons of tourists there - it was just what i needed . "
protesting between kohl and brandt gallus proved untiring in her efforts to be reunited with her children in west germany .
at an event on the 25th anniversary of the division of germany , which was aired live on television , she leapt on stage between chancellor helmut kohl and former chancellor willy brandt and held up a placard .
" i 'm a live example .
i have been separated from my children for four years .
i appeal to you and the german government to do everything so that my children are finally with me , " gallus said in a shaky voice before being nudged aside by kohl .
not surprisingly , her public demonstrations embarrassed and annoyed the two german governments , who were at pains to maintain good diplomatic relations .
but her tactics also helped .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallus with her daughters when they were reunited after six years in 1988 in 1988 , six years after gallus first began protesting at checkpoint charlie , her daughters were allowed to leave and join their mother in the west .
it remains unclear what prompted the east german regime to take the unusual step .
critics say film jazzed up unnecessarily " i simply wanted to show that a normal person without weapons is in a position to change things , " fleck said this week after the film premiered in a berlin movie theater .
hans-dietrich genscher , west germany 's foreign minister from 1974 to 1992 , who met with gallus and heard out her case in the 1980s , said the film was an important contribution to understanding the past .

the fact that former communist east germany 's government , with the help of its extensive network of spies and its dreaded stasi secret police , made life a living hell for many of its citizens is well known and documented - both in historic records and on the big screen in hugely successful dramas . but a recent film aired on german public network ard veered away from the fictional to reconstruct the real-life story of a gdr victim whose fight for justice remained a thorn in the side of both west and east germany for years . " the woman from checkpoint charlie " tells the story of jutta gallus , played by german actress veronica ferres .
a young , headstrong mother in east germany , gallus yearned to move to the free world on the other side of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film when jutta gallus , played by ferres , arrives in the west in 1982 , she tried to escape along with her two young daughters by pretending to be taking a vacation to eastern europe , where she hoped to emulate the example of countrymen who had managed to escape to the west through slightly less stringent border controls .
but her flight was foiled by the east german government and the family was forcibly separated .
gallus was thrown into prison , while her two daughters , aged 9 and 11 , were put in a children 's home .
free , but without her kids two years later , gallus was bought free by the west german government , a fairly common practice that earned the gdr regime much-needed hard currency in return for releasing mainly political prisoners .
she was , however , prevented by the regime from taking her children with her to the west . the film centers on gallus ' attempts to petition high-ranking west german politicians and bureaucrats and draw attention to her fight to get her daughters out of east germany .
on oct .
7 , 1984 , the 30th anniversary of the gdr , gallus planted herself at checkpoint charlie , the allied border crossing in berlin , with a placard around her neck reading : " my children have been forcibly given up for adoption !
please help us ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real jutta gallus protesting at checkpoint charlie in the 1980s gallus became a daily fixture at checkpoint charlie , demonstrating from dawn to dusk and inevitably drawing curious tourists and journalists .
her image and the tale of her fight to be with her children went around the world .
" checkpoint charlie was a legend in berlin , " jutta gallus , now jutta fleck , said recently in an interview with berlin daily tagesspiegel , explaining why she chose to demonstrate there .
" besides , there were tons of tourists there - it was just what i needed . "
protesting between kohl and brandt gallus proved untiring in her efforts to be reunited with her children in west germany .
at an event on the 25th anniversary of the division of germany , which was aired live on television , she leapt on stage between chancellor helmut kohl and former chancellor willy brandt and held up a placard .
" i 'm a live example .
i have been separated from my children for four years .
i appeal to you and the german government to do everything so that my children are finally with me , " gallus said in a shaky voice before being nudged aside by kohl .
not surprisingly , her public demonstrations embarrassed and annoyed the two german governments , who were at pains to maintain good diplomatic relations .
but her tactics also helped .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallus with her daughters when they were reunited after six years in 1988 in 1988 , six years after gallus first began protesting at checkpoint charlie , her daughters were allowed to leave and join their mother in the west .
it remains unclear what prompted the east german regime to take the unusual step .
critics say film jazzed up unnecessarily " i simply wanted to show that a normal person without weapons is in a position to change things , " fleck said this week after the film premiered in a berlin movie theater .
hans-dietrich genscher , west germany 's foreign minister from 1974 to 1992 , who met with gallus and heard out her case in the 1980s , said the film was an important contribution to understanding the past .
" it 's a deeply moving film , also because it focuses on the victims for the first time , " he said .
" there were unfortunately too many of these stories . "
but critics in germany were n't as enamored with the two-part drama that earned top television-viewer ratings .
many said the filmmakers should have cut out the gloss and cheese .
" why is the authentic story of suffering of a young mother being jazzed up as a spy thriller ? " a review in on der spiegel magazine 's web site asked .
" the real life of jutta gallus offers enough drama as it is . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 03.10.2007 opinion : german unity means freedom to east , money to west großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : as germany marks the 17th anniversary of the country 's unification , east and west look at the day in fundamentally different ways , with celebration on one side and resentment on the other , according to dw 's bernd grässl psychologists have had their say just in time for the german unification day .
their diagnosis : 17 years after unification , germany 's emotional state remains disharmonious .
for , they say , many eastern germans are ashamed of the billion-euro subsidies they have received from the west in the past 17 years .
whether that is indeed the case is beside the point .
what remains is an interesting attempt to investigate the emotional life of us eastern germans , now among some of the best researched living beings on the planet .
educators and criminologists have looked at the consequences of a uniform upbringing .
sexologists have researched the secrets of the easterners ' especially active love lives .
reports that the stasi secret police spies collected about east germans have filled many a newspaper page over the years .
the government 's report on german unity : year after year a report about painstaking economic development in the east with the help of billions from the west .
german unity , it appears , is one-sided , with which western germans have had only one real thing to do over the years : they occupied the leadership roles and shoveled the billions into the new eastern german states .
since the easterner angela merkel became chancellor , they are only left the role of financier .
this admittedly slightly exaggerated characterization outlines a dilemma this unity day : it 's a holiday for all germans , but the event it reflects , aside from the official celebrations , again merely concerns the easterners .
in the east , every part of life has changed ; in the west , money has just become a bit scarcer .
for many , probably most , in the new eastern states , oct .
3 is a reason to celebrate , regardless of everyday worries .
no one wants to do without the freedoms gained , and the individual desire to go back to the gdr is to be taken as seriously as the desire to drive a trabi rather than a volkswagen .
and how is the westerner 's state of mind ?
traveling from berlin far into germany 's west , one gains some insight .
there are those who with gleaming eyes recall their spontaneous trip to berlin when the wall fell .
there are others who want to collect money for the wall to be rebuilt , because they 're fed up with the east .
sorry , it was all really just a joke !
asked how their lives have been changed by german unification , many westerners ' responses are marked by perplexed silence , shrugs of the shoulders .
it 's no wonder : the east has become an extension of the west .
the opportunity unification offered to create something new , together , is long past .
for many , if not most , normal westerners , oct .
3 is a day on which , above all , they are reminded that for 17 years they have been sending money to the east , and that there 's no end in sight .
even if , in the official speeches , no one says it that way .

but it has beaten most expectations and become an urban success story . it was late on june 20 , 1991 , when bonn got the blow that most thought would seal the city 's fate .
parliamentarians had been debating whether to move the federal capital back to berlin from the small city on the rhine that had hosted the government since 1949 and were about to vote .
opposition to moving back to germany 's previous capital had been vocal and bonn residents thought that in the end , parliament would decide to stay . but at 9:47 p.m. , bundestag president rita süssmuth announced that parliament had voted 337 to 320 to pack up and move to berlin .
according to dorothea voigtländer , a journalist and author who was in the crowd that had gathered in bonn 's main square to follow the proceedings on a large screen , people were shocked into silence and the tears immediately began to fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster criticizing the government move to berlin reading " berlin republic ?

" people said it was the city 's death blow and thought it would sink back into anonymity . " before 1949 , the year the nascent west german government voted to make bonn the provisional capital , bonn had been a pleasant , but unremarkable small city .
after it was catapulted to a new level , residents soon got used to the fringe benefits that came with international fame - visits from luminaries like queen elizabeth and john f. kennedy , prestige , money and jobs .

a new international conference center scheduled to open in 2009 that can accommodate 5,000 aims at increasing bonn 's already growing international heft . while the parliament , chancellery and several ministries moved to berlin in 1999 , there is still a strong government presence on the rhine .
in addition to hosting institutions such as the federal anti-trust office and the federal audit office , bonn was able to keep six of germany 's 15 federal ministries and more than half of the 18,000 jobs associated with them . " bonn 's assets were and are political and diplomatic experience , top-qualified experts and the ability to look far beyond the city 's borders , " said bonn mayor bärbel dieckmann in a statement .

money was part of the deal , and the agreement resulted in more than 1.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- of federal largesse for bonn . the money has been wisely spent , according to sandra ludwig of the bonn chamber of commerce .
instead of following the watering-can method , officials targeted the funds in accordance with a detailed strategy that included profiling the city as germany 's second government city , marketing it as a location for international dialogue , creating a research and development hub and increasing its cultural offerings .

it has become a stop on the tourism circuit thanks to its " museum mile " and international beethoven festival .
its central location and attractive natural surroundings have also gained it many fans . ongoing process but ludwig warns against being too complacent and sitting on any laurels .

she said the city 's recent success story has as much to do with its residents as it does with good government policy . " they 've got a very tolerant , flexible and optimistic mentality , " she said .

political dissatisfaction bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the wall went up in 1961 and stayed up for 28 years the survey also asked eastern germans who they 'd vote for , were there an election this week .
back in december 1990 , when germany elected its first chancellor as a reunited country , some 44 percent of the electorate voted for the christian democrats headed by helmut kohl .
only 2.4 percent stood by the party of democratic socialism , the successor to the east german communist party .
reflecting their disillusionment , 31 percent now say they would give their vote to the left party , which partially consists of the pds as well as some left-leaning former members of the social democratic party .
the poll conducted by independent opinion research firm emnid found that 74 percent of easterners had felt like second-class citizens since germany reunited on oct .
3 , 1990 .
people on the other side of the country had exactly the opposite opinion .
some 73 percent of westerners said their countrymen to the east were no longer at a disadvantage in unified germany .
wall come tumbling down constructed in 1961 , the berlin wall was the communist dictatorship 's last-ditch attempt to stem the flood of refugees to the west and became the definitive symbol of the cold war . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans began leaving the east in november 1989 and many continue to do so after mass demonstrations against the government in the fall of 1989 , the politburo led by egon krenz decided on nov .
9 to allow east germans to exit directly through crossing points between east germany and west germany , including in west berlin .
the wall came down in a peaceful revolution , paving the way to national unification 11 months later .
but the optimism of what become known as the wende , which translates to " change " or " turn , " was soon replaced by disappointment for many .
the former communist east continues to lag behind economically , despite the billions of euros in aid paid each year .
in the west , meanwhile , many resent having to contribute to solidarity pact funds , which are paid for with taxpayers ' money and planned to last until at least 2019 .
but while people in the west complain about their poor eastern relations , even today , salaries in the east remain 25 percent lower than in the west , according to the institute for labor market and career research in nuremberg .
unemployment hovers at about 15 percent in the eastern states compared to half that in the west . the economic gap between eastern and western germany , however , is not a indicator that reunification has failed , according to wolfgang thierse , a social democrat and the german parliament 's vice president . " you can not say that unity has failed , " he said , according to the daily tagesspiegel newspaper .

but it has beaten most expectations and become an urban success story . it was late on june 20 , 1991 , when bonn got the blow that most thought would seal the city 's fate .
parliamentarians had been debating whether to move the federal capital back to berlin from the small city on the rhine that had hosted the government since 1949 and were about to vote .
opposition to moving back to germany 's previous capital had been vocal and bonn residents thought that in the end , parliament would decide to stay . but at 9:47 p.m. , bundestag president rita süssmuth announced that parliament had voted 337 to 320 to pack up and move to berlin .
according to dorothea voigtländer , a journalist and author who was in the crowd that had gathered in bonn 's main square to follow the proceedings on a large screen , people were shocked into silence and the tears immediately began to fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster criticizing the government move to berlin reading " berlin republic ?
no thanks ! "
" all you could hear were raindrops on the roofs , as if the sky were crying with us , " she said .
" people said it was the city 's death blow and thought it would sink back into anonymity . " before 1949 , the year the nascent west german government voted to make bonn the provisional capital , bonn had been a pleasant , but unremarkable small city .
after it was catapulted to a new level , residents soon got used to the fringe benefits that came with international fame - visits from luminaries like queen elizabeth and john f. kennedy , prestige , money and jobs . " then suddenly in 1991 , everyone thought the lights had gone out , " said voigtländer .
" but in fact , they did n't . " successful transition today bonn is something of a poster child in germany for a city 's successful management of structural change .
dealt a potentially devastating blow , bonn rallied to attract new institutions and business to fill the void left by the exodus of politicians and many government ministries .
it played to its strengths , and thanks to a combination of factors - smart strategic planning , help from the federal government , and several home-field advantages - bonn , in many respects , was able to come out of the government move healthier than it was before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is a big employer in bonn instead of living off nostalgia , bonn , 17 years after reunification , has become one of germany 's more dynamic cities , with more residents and jobs than it had as the capital .
it has become the headquarters of several of germany 's high-profile , dax-listed firms , such as deutsche telekom , deutsche post and postbank , which have brought around 20,000 jobs to the region . the united nations has also moved to town with 12 of its institutions , including the secretariats on climate change and desertification .
a new international conference center scheduled to open in 2009 that can accommodate 5,000 aims at increasing bonn 's already growing international heft . while the parliament , chancellery and several ministries moved to berlin in 1999 , there is still a strong government presence on the rhine .
in addition to hosting institutions such as the federal anti-trust office and the federal audit office , bonn was able to keep six of germany 's 15 federal ministries and more than half of the 18,000 jobs associated with them . " bonn 's assets were and are political and diplomatic experience , top-qualified experts and the ability to look far beyond the city 's borders , " said bonn mayor bärbel dieckmann in a statement .
she has been widely praised for her stewardship of the city 's transformation . help from the feds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " house of history of the german federal republic , " part of bonn 's " museum mile " the city was helped greatly by the berlin-bonn act of 1994 , in which the federal government promised not to abandon the city entirely .
money was part of the deal , and the agreement resulted in more than 1.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- of federal largesse for bonn . the money has been wisely spent , according to sandra ludwig of the bonn chamber of commerce .
instead of following the watering-can method , officials targeted the funds in accordance with a detailed strategy that included profiling the city as germany 's second government city , marketing it as a location for international dialogue , creating a research and development hub and increasing its cultural offerings . " they were able to cushion the much-feared structural change and even turn things to its favor , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un complex in bonn with unemployment at 7.1 percent , bonn is well under the german average of 8.4 percent and boasts a jobless rate that the current federal capital can only dream of .
it has also been helped by its concentration of highly skilled workers , another magnet for businesses .
in the bonn region , 19.4 percent of people have university degrees compared with the german average of 9.8 percent . bonn gets high scores in many other areas , be it real estate , as a location for industry due to its infrastructure and geographical position , or simply quality of life .
it has become a stop on the tourism circuit thanks to its " museum mile " and international beethoven festival .
its central location and attractive natural surroundings have also gained it many fans . ongoing process but ludwig warns against being too complacent and sitting on any laurels .
the federal incentives have stopped and bonn has to make sure it continues to change with the times and looks at new ways to grow the economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn 's beethoven festival honors the city 's native son " the city is now competing on an international as well as national stage , " she said .
" structural change is a continual process that does n't just stop one day . " dorothea voigtländer , who was born in bonn in 1943 to a belgian mother and french father who were active in the resistance , thinks bonn can pull it off .
she said the city 's recent success story has as much to do with its residents as it does with good government policy . " they 've got a very tolerant , flexible and optimistic mentality , " she said .
" they just said , ' okay , we 'll tackle this problem and it 'll be fine . '

their diagnosis : 17 years after unification , germany 's emotional state remains disharmonious .
for , they say , many eastern germans are ashamed of the billion-euro subsidies they have received from the west in the past 17 years .
whether that is indeed the case is beside the point .
what remains is an interesting attempt to investigate the emotional life of us eastern germans , now among some of the best researched living beings on the planet .
educators and criminologists have looked at the consequences of a uniform upbringing .
sexologists have researched the secrets of the easterners ' especially active love lives .
reports that the stasi secret police spies collected about east germans have filled many a newspaper page over the years .
the government 's report on german unity : year after year a report about painstaking economic development in the east with the help of billions from the west .
german unity , it appears , is one-sided , with which western germans have had only one real thing to do over the years : they occupied the leadership roles and shoveled the billions into the new eastern german states .
since the easterner angela merkel became chancellor , they are only left the role of financier .
this admittedly slightly exaggerated characterization outlines a dilemma this unity day : it 's a holiday for all germans , but the event it reflects , aside from the official celebrations , again merely concerns the easterners .

asked how their lives have been changed by german unification , many westerners ' responses are marked by perplexed silence , shrugs of the shoulders .
it 's no wonder : the east has become an extension of the west .
the opportunity unification offered to create something new , together , is long past .

the fact that former communist east germany 's government , with the help of its extensive network of spies and its dreaded stasi secret police , made life a living hell for many of its citizens is well known and documented - both in historic records and on the big screen in hugely successful dramas . but a recent film aired on german public network ard veered away from the fictional to reconstruct the real-life story of a gdr victim whose fight for justice remained a thorn in the side of both west and east germany for years . " the woman from checkpoint charlie " tells the story of jutta gallus , played by german actress veronica ferres .
a young , headstrong mother in east germany , gallus yearned to move to the free world on the other side of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film when jutta gallus , played by ferres , arrives in the west in 1982 , she tried to escape along with her two young daughters by pretending to be taking a vacation to eastern europe , where she hoped to emulate the example of countrymen who had managed to escape to the west through slightly less stringent border controls .
but her flight was foiled by the east german government and the family was forcibly separated .
gallus was thrown into prison , while her two daughters , aged 9 and 11 , were put in a children 's home .
free , but without her kids two years later , gallus was bought free by the west german government , a fairly common practice that earned the gdr regime much-needed hard currency in return for releasing mainly political prisoners .
she was , however , prevented by the regime from taking her children with her to the west . the film centers on gallus ' attempts to petition high-ranking west german politicians and bureaucrats and draw attention to her fight to get her daughters out of east germany .
on oct .
7 , 1984 , the 30th anniversary of the gdr , gallus planted herself at checkpoint charlie , the allied border crossing in berlin , with a placard around her neck reading : " my children have been forcibly given up for adoption !
please help us ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real jutta gallus protesting at checkpoint charlie in the 1980s gallus became a daily fixture at checkpoint charlie , demonstrating from dawn to dusk and inevitably drawing curious tourists and journalists .
her image and the tale of her fight to be with her children went around the world .
" checkpoint charlie was a legend in berlin , " jutta gallus , now jutta fleck , said recently in an interview with berlin daily tagesspiegel , explaining why she chose to demonstrate there .
" besides , there were tons of tourists there - it was just what i needed . "
protesting between kohl and brandt gallus proved untiring in her efforts to be reunited with her children in west germany .
at an event on the 25th anniversary of the division of germany , which was aired live on television , she leapt on stage between chancellor helmut kohl and former chancellor willy brandt and held up a placard .
" i 'm a live example .
i have been separated from my children for four years .
i appeal to you and the german government to do everything so that my children are finally with me , " gallus said in a shaky voice before being nudged aside by kohl .
not surprisingly , her public demonstrations embarrassed and annoyed the two german governments , who were at pains to maintain good diplomatic relations .
but her tactics also helped .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallus with her daughters when they were reunited after six years in 1988 in 1988 , six years after gallus first began protesting at checkpoint charlie , her daughters were allowed to leave and join their mother in the west .
it remains unclear what prompted the east german regime to take the unusual step .
critics say film jazzed up unnecessarily " i simply wanted to show that a normal person without weapons is in a position to change things , " fleck said this week after the film premiered in a berlin movie theater .
hans-dietrich genscher , west germany 's foreign minister from 1974 to 1992 , who met with gallus and heard out her case in the 1980s , said the film was an important contribution to understanding the past .
" it 's a deeply moving film , also because it focuses on the victims for the first time , " he said .
" there were unfortunately too many of these stories . "
but critics in germany were n't as enamored with the two-part drama that earned top television-viewer ratings .
many said the filmmakers should have cut out the gloss and cheese .
" why is the authentic story of suffering of a young mother being jazzed up as a spy thriller ? " a review in on der spiegel magazine 's web site asked .

the fact that former communist east germany 's government , with the help of its extensive network of spies and its dreaded stasi secret police , made life a living hell for many of its citizens is well known and documented - both in historic records and on the big screen in hugely successful dramas . but a recent film aired on german public network ard veered away from the fictional to reconstruct the real-life story of a gdr victim whose fight for justice remained a thorn in the side of both west and east germany for years . " the woman from checkpoint charlie " tells the story of jutta gallus , played by german actress veronica ferres .
a young , headstrong mother in east germany , gallus yearned to move to the free world on the other side of the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a scene from the film when jutta gallus , played by ferres , arrives in the west in 1982 , she tried to escape along with her two young daughters by pretending to be taking a vacation to eastern europe , where she hoped to emulate the example of countrymen who had managed to escape to the west through slightly less stringent border controls .
but her flight was foiled by the east german government and the family was forcibly separated .
gallus was thrown into prison , while her two daughters , aged 9 and 11 , were put in a children 's home .
free , but without her kids two years later , gallus was bought free by the west german government , a fairly common practice that earned the gdr regime much-needed hard currency in return for releasing mainly political prisoners .
she was , however , prevented by the regime from taking her children with her to the west . the film centers on gallus ' attempts to petition high-ranking west german politicians and bureaucrats and draw attention to her fight to get her daughters out of east germany .
on oct .
7 , 1984 , the 30th anniversary of the gdr , gallus planted herself at checkpoint charlie , the allied border crossing in berlin , with a placard around her neck reading : " my children have been forcibly given up for adoption !
please help us ! "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the real jutta gallus protesting at checkpoint charlie in the 1980s gallus became a daily fixture at checkpoint charlie , demonstrating from dawn to dusk and inevitably drawing curious tourists and journalists .
her image and the tale of her fight to be with her children went around the world .
" checkpoint charlie was a legend in berlin , " jutta gallus , now jutta fleck , said recently in an interview with berlin daily tagesspiegel , explaining why she chose to demonstrate there .
" besides , there were tons of tourists there - it was just what i needed . "
protesting between kohl and brandt gallus proved untiring in her efforts to be reunited with her children in west germany .
at an event on the 25th anniversary of the division of germany , which was aired live on television , she leapt on stage between chancellor helmut kohl and former chancellor willy brandt and held up a placard .
" i 'm a live example .
i have been separated from my children for four years .
i appeal to you and the german government to do everything so that my children are finally with me , " gallus said in a shaky voice before being nudged aside by kohl .
not surprisingly , her public demonstrations embarrassed and annoyed the two german governments , who were at pains to maintain good diplomatic relations .
but her tactics also helped .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gallus with her daughters when they were reunited after six years in 1988 in 1988 , six years after gallus first began protesting at checkpoint charlie , her daughters were allowed to leave and join their mother in the west .
it remains unclear what prompted the east german regime to take the unusual step .
critics say film jazzed up unnecessarily " i simply wanted to show that a normal person without weapons is in a position to change things , " fleck said this week after the film premiered in a berlin movie theater .
hans-dietrich genscher , west germany 's foreign minister from 1974 to 1992 , who met with gallus and heard out her case in the 1980s , said the film was an important contribution to understanding the past .
" it 's a deeply moving film , also because it focuses on the victims for the first time , " he said .
" there were unfortunately too many of these stories . "
but critics in germany were n't as enamored with the two-part drama that earned top television-viewer ratings .

but it has beaten most expectations and become an urban success story . it was late on june 20 , 1991 , when bonn got the blow that most thought would seal the city 's fate .
parliamentarians had been debating whether to move the federal capital back to berlin from the small city on the rhine that had hosted the government since 1949 and were about to vote .
opposition to moving back to germany 's previous capital had been vocal and bonn residents thought that in the end , parliament would decide to stay . but at 9:47 p.m. , bundestag president rita süssmuth announced that parliament had voted 337 to 320 to pack up and move to berlin .
according to dorothea voigtländer , a journalist and author who was in the crowd that had gathered in bonn 's main square to follow the proceedings on a large screen , people were shocked into silence and the tears immediately began to fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster criticizing the government move to berlin reading " berlin republic ?
no thanks ! "
" all you could hear were raindrops on the roofs , as if the sky were crying with us , " she said .
" people said it was the city 's death blow and thought it would sink back into anonymity . " before 1949 , the year the nascent west german government voted to make bonn the provisional capital , bonn had been a pleasant , but unremarkable small city .
after it was catapulted to a new level , residents soon got used to the fringe benefits that came with international fame - visits from luminaries like queen elizabeth and john f. kennedy , prestige , money and jobs . " then suddenly in 1991 , everyone thought the lights had gone out , " said voigtländer .
" but in fact , they did n't . " successful transition today bonn is something of a poster child in germany for a city 's successful management of structural change .
dealt a potentially devastating blow , bonn rallied to attract new institutions and business to fill the void left by the exodus of politicians and many government ministries .
it played to its strengths , and thanks to a combination of factors - smart strategic planning , help from the federal government , and several home-field advantages - bonn , in many respects , was able to come out of the government move healthier than it was before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is a big employer in bonn instead of living off nostalgia , bonn , 17 years after reunification , has become one of germany 's more dynamic cities , with more residents and jobs than it had as the capital .
it has become the headquarters of several of germany 's high-profile , dax-listed firms , such as deutsche telekom , deutsche post and postbank , which have brought around 20,000 jobs to the region . the united nations has also moved to town with 12 of its institutions , including the secretariats on climate change and desertification .
a new international conference center scheduled to open in 2009 that can accommodate 5,000 aims at increasing bonn 's already growing international heft . while the parliament , chancellery and several ministries moved to berlin in 1999 , there is still a strong government presence on the rhine .
in addition to hosting institutions such as the federal anti-trust office and the federal audit office , bonn was able to keep six of germany 's 15 federal ministries and more than half of the 18,000 jobs associated with them . " bonn 's assets were and are political and diplomatic experience , top-qualified experts and the ability to look far beyond the city 's borders , " said bonn mayor bärbel dieckmann in a statement .
she has been widely praised for her stewardship of the city 's transformation . help from the feds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " house of history of the german federal republic , " part of bonn 's " museum mile " the city was helped greatly by the berlin-bonn act of 1994 , in which the federal government promised not to abandon the city entirely .
money was part of the deal , and the agreement resulted in more than 1.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- of federal largesse for bonn . the money has been wisely spent , according to sandra ludwig of the bonn chamber of commerce .
instead of following the watering-can method , officials targeted the funds in accordance with a detailed strategy that included profiling the city as germany 's second government city , marketing it as a location for international dialogue , creating a research and development hub and increasing its cultural offerings . " they were able to cushion the much-feared structural change and even turn things to its favor , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un complex in bonn with unemployment at 7.1 percent , bonn is well under the german average of 8.4 percent and boasts a jobless rate that the current federal capital can only dream of .
it has also been helped by its concentration of highly skilled workers , another magnet for businesses .
in the bonn region , 19.4 percent of people have university degrees compared with the german average of 9.8 percent . bonn gets high scores in many other areas , be it real estate , as a location for industry due to its infrastructure and geographical position , or simply quality of life .

but it has beaten most expectations and become an urban success story . it was late on june 20 , 1991 , when bonn got the blow that most thought would seal the city 's fate .
parliamentarians had been debating whether to move the federal capital back to berlin from the small city on the rhine that had hosted the government since 1949 and were about to vote .
opposition to moving back to germany 's previous capital had been vocal and bonn residents thought that in the end , parliament would decide to stay . but at 9:47 p.m. , bundestag president rita süssmuth announced that parliament had voted 337 to 320 to pack up and move to berlin .
according to dorothea voigtländer , a journalist and author who was in the crowd that had gathered in bonn 's main square to follow the proceedings on a large screen , people were shocked into silence and the tears immediately began to fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster criticizing the government move to berlin reading " berlin republic ?

" people said it was the city 's death blow and thought it would sink back into anonymity . " before 1949 , the year the nascent west german government voted to make bonn the provisional capital , bonn had been a pleasant , but unremarkable small city .
after it was catapulted to a new level , residents soon got used to the fringe benefits that came with international fame - visits from luminaries like queen elizabeth and john f. kennedy , prestige , money and jobs . " then suddenly in 1991 , everyone thought the lights had gone out , " said voigtländer .

dealt a potentially devastating blow , bonn rallied to attract new institutions and business to fill the void left by the exodus of politicians and many government ministries .

it has become the headquarters of several of germany 's high-profile , dax-listed firms , such as deutsche telekom , deutsche post and postbank , which have brought around 20,000 jobs to the region . the united nations has also moved to town with 12 of its institutions , including the secretariats on climate change and desertification .
a new international conference center scheduled to open in 2009 that can accommodate 5,000 aims at increasing bonn 's already growing international heft . while the parliament , chancellery and several ministries moved to berlin in 1999 , there is still a strong government presence on the rhine .
in addition to hosting institutions such as the federal anti-trust office and the federal audit office , bonn was able to keep six of germany 's 15 federal ministries and more than half of the 18,000 jobs associated with them . " bonn 's assets were and are political and diplomatic experience , top-qualified experts and the ability to look far beyond the city 's borders , " said bonn mayor bärbel dieckmann in a statement .

money was part of the deal , and the agreement resulted in more than 1.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- of federal largesse for bonn . the money has been wisely spent , according to sandra ludwig of the bonn chamber of commerce .
instead of following the watering-can method , officials targeted the funds in accordance with a detailed strategy that included profiling the city as germany 's second government city , marketing it as a location for international dialogue , creating a research and development hub and increasing its cultural offerings .

but it has beaten most expectations and become an urban success story . it was late on june 20 , 1991 , when bonn got the blow that most thought would seal the city 's fate .
parliamentarians had been debating whether to move the federal capital back to berlin from the small city on the rhine that had hosted the government since 1949 and were about to vote .
opposition to moving back to germany 's previous capital had been vocal and bonn residents thought that in the end , parliament would decide to stay . but at 9:47 p.m. , bundestag president rita süssmuth announced that parliament had voted 337 to 320 to pack up and move to berlin .
according to dorothea voigtländer , a journalist and author who was in the crowd that had gathered in bonn 's main square to follow the proceedings on a large screen , people were shocked into silence and the tears immediately began to fall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a poster criticizing the government move to berlin reading " berlin republic ?
no thanks ! "
" all you could hear were raindrops on the roofs , as if the sky were crying with us , " she said .
" people said it was the city 's death blow and thought it would sink back into anonymity . " before 1949 , the year the nascent west german government voted to make bonn the provisional capital , bonn had been a pleasant , but unremarkable small city .
after it was catapulted to a new level , residents soon got used to the fringe benefits that came with international fame - visits from luminaries like queen elizabeth and john f. kennedy , prestige , money and jobs . " then suddenly in 1991 , everyone thought the lights had gone out , " said voigtländer .
" but in fact , they did n't . " successful transition today bonn is something of a poster child in germany for a city 's successful management of structural change .
dealt a potentially devastating blow , bonn rallied to attract new institutions and business to fill the void left by the exodus of politicians and many government ministries .
it played to its strengths , and thanks to a combination of factors - smart strategic planning , help from the federal government , and several home-field advantages - bonn , in many respects , was able to come out of the government move healthier than it was before . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deutsche telekom is a big employer in bonn instead of living off nostalgia , bonn , 17 years after reunification , has become one of germany 's more dynamic cities , with more residents and jobs than it had as the capital .
it has become the headquarters of several of germany 's high-profile , dax-listed firms , such as deutsche telekom , deutsche post and postbank , which have brought around 20,000 jobs to the region . the united nations has also moved to town with 12 of its institutions , including the secretariats on climate change and desertification .
a new international conference center scheduled to open in 2009 that can accommodate 5,000 aims at increasing bonn 's already growing international heft . while the parliament , chancellery and several ministries moved to berlin in 1999 , there is still a strong government presence on the rhine .
in addition to hosting institutions such as the federal anti-trust office and the federal audit office , bonn was able to keep six of germany 's 15 federal ministries and more than half of the 18,000 jobs associated with them . " bonn 's assets were and are political and diplomatic experience , top-qualified experts and the ability to look far beyond the city 's borders , " said bonn mayor bärbel dieckmann in a statement .
she has been widely praised for her stewardship of the city 's transformation . help from the feds bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the " house of history of the german federal republic , " part of bonn 's " museum mile " the city was helped greatly by the berlin-bonn act of 1994 , in which the federal government promised not to abandon the city entirely .
money was part of the deal , and the agreement resulted in more than 1.4 billion euros -lrb- $ 1.9 billion -rrb- of federal largesse for bonn . the money has been wisely spent , according to sandra ludwig of the bonn chamber of commerce .
instead of following the watering-can method , officials targeted the funds in accordance with a detailed strategy that included profiling the city as germany 's second government city , marketing it as a location for international dialogue , creating a research and development hub and increasing its cultural offerings . " they were able to cushion the much-feared structural change and even turn things to its favor , " she said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un complex in bonn with unemployment at 7.1 percent , bonn is well under the german average of 8.4 percent and boasts a jobless rate that the current federal capital can only dream of .
it has also been helped by its concentration of highly skilled workers , another magnet for businesses .
in the bonn region , 19.4 percent of people have university degrees compared with the german average of 9.8 percent . bonn gets high scores in many other areas , be it real estate , as a location for industry due to its infrastructure and geographical position , or simply quality of life .
it has become a stop on the tourism circuit thanks to its " museum mile " and international beethoven festival .
its central location and attractive natural surroundings have also gained it many fans . ongoing process but ludwig warns against being too complacent and sitting on any laurels .
the federal incentives have stopped and bonn has to make sure it continues to change with the times and looks at new ways to grow the economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bonn 's beethoven festival honors the city 's native son " the city is now competing on an international as well as national stage , " she said .
" structural change is a continual process that does n't just stop one day . " dorothea voigtländer , who was born in bonn in 1943 to a belgian mother and french father who were active in the resistance , thinks bonn can pull it off .
she said the city 's recent success story has as much to do with its residents as it does with good government policy . " they 've got a very tolerant , flexible and optimistic mentality , " she said .
" they just said , ' okay , we 'll tackle this problem and it 'll be fine . '
and it was . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

gazprom said ukraine had taken no action despite repeated requests and warned it would be forced to decrease deliveries if the debt was not settled .
the european commission called for a " speedy solution " to the dispute .
prices rise state-controlled gazprom said it had informed european clients .
gazprom 's threat comes two days after parliamentary elections in ukraine .
no clear winner has emerged as rival parties claim victory .
" bearing in mind the approaching winter season and higher demand for gas , as well as the ukrainian repeated failures to fulfil gas contracts , gazprom will have to reduce gas deliveries to ukrainian consumers if the debt is not settled in october , " the company said .
in august , gazprom said it would halve supplies to belarus because of a $ 500m debt after minsk failed to pay in full for previous shipments .
the russian firm later postponed the deadline for belarus to repay the debt after a first instalment was paid .
like belarus , ukraine was forced to start paying more for its russian gas in 2006 , but not before gazprom reduced its supplies , leading to a knock-on reduction in gas passing through the country to western europe .
this dispute sparked concern within european union nations about their energy security and the future reliably of russian gas , which now accounts for much of european requirements .
moscow denies accusations that it uses gas supplies to bully its neighbours .
instead , it insists that price rises last year for belarus , ukraine and georgia merely reflect the end of soviet-era subsidies .

goncalo amaral was apparently removed after suggesting british police were working to her parents ' agenda .
madeleine 's parents , kate and gerry , of rothley , leics , are official suspects in the case but have not been charged .
their spokesman called for the inquiry to refocus on the hunt for madeleine , last seen on 3 may in the algarve .
the mccanns ' spokesman , clarence mitchell , told gmtv the detective 's comments suggesting the couple were calling the shots were " ludicrous " .
mccanns ' co-operating ' " it 's an absolutely ridiculous suggestion .
it is a portuguese-led inquiry and will remain so .
" and of course from time to time there is communication with gerry and kate as there would be in any police investigation .
" it is ludicrous to suggest that they have done anything like that . "
" surely it is now time to for all of that nonsense -lsb- media speculation -rsb- to end and for the search for madeleine to be re-energised " clarence mitchell the mccanns ' spokesman mr mitchell said mr and mrs mccann were " more than happy to cooperate " with portuguese authorities " whoever that might be " .
this included going back to the algarve for more interviews , he said .
but he called on whoever took over the portuguese inquiry from mr amaral to " refocus " on the search for madeleine , who disappeared from the resort of praia da luz .
he also called for an end to " unsubstantiated allegations " printed in newspapers in portugal and britain .
" surely it is now time to for all of that nonsense to end and for the search for madeleine to be re-energised , " he added .
british media mr amaral , who heads the regional policia judiciaria -lrb- pj -rrb- in portimao , was reported in the diario de noticias as saying : " the british police have been working solely on what the mccanns want and what suits them . "
the police removed him after the comments were published , but reportedly gave no reason .
the pj 's national director , alipio ribeiro , told journalists at a conference in lisbon that mr amaral 's " commission of service has ceased " .
the bbc 's special correspondent richard bilton said the detective made his comments at the end of an interview in which he talked about the coverage of madeleine 's case by the british media .
the newspaper said he was reacting to a story which appeared on tuesday claiming that leicestershire police were investigating an email sent anonymously to prince charles 's official website alleging that a disgruntled former employee had abducted madeleine .
mr amaral reportedly accused the mccanns of releasing new information each day in a bid to distract and confuse the inquiry , our correspondent said .
the mccanns ' lawyer , carlos pinto de abreu , told a portuguese radio station that mr amaral 's reported comments were " chauvinistic " .
british police have worked with the portuguese authorities for parts of their inquiry .

goncalo amaral was apparently removed after suggesting british police were working to her parents ' agenda .
madeleine 's parents , kate and gerry , of rothley , leics , are official suspects in the case but have not been charged .
their spokesman called for the inquiry to refocus on the hunt for madeleine , last seen on 3 may in the algarve .
the mccanns ' spokesman , clarence mitchell , told gmtv the detective 's comments suggesting the couple were calling the shots were " ludicrous " .
mccanns ' co-operating ' " it 's an absolutely ridiculous suggestion .
it is a portuguese-led inquiry and will remain so .
" and of course from time to time there is communication with gerry and kate as there would be in any police investigation .
" it is ludicrous to suggest that they have done anything like that . "
surely it is now time to for all of that nonsense -lsb- media speculation -rsb- to end and for the search for madeleine to be re-energised clarence mitchell the mccanns ' spokesman mr mitchell said mr and mrs mccann were " more than happy to cooperate " with portuguese authorities " whoever that might be " .
this included going back to the algarve for more interviews , he said .
but he called on whoever took over the portuguese inquiry from mr amaral to " refocus " on the search for madeleine , who disappeared from the resort of praia da luz .
he also called for an end to " unsubstantiated allegations " printed in newspapers in portugal and britain .
" surely it is now time to for all of that nonsense to end and for the search for madeleine to be re-energised , " he added .
british media mr amaral , who heads the regional policia judiciaria -lrb- pj -rrb- in portimao , was reported in the diario de noticias as saying : " the british police have been working solely on what the mccanns want and what suits them . "
the police removed him after the comments were published , but reportedly gave no reason .
the pj 's national director , alipio ribeiro , told journalists at a conference in lisbon that mr amaral 's " commission of service has ceased " .
madeleine went missing on 3 may in portugal the bbc 's special correspondent richard bilton said the detective made his comments at the end of an interview in which he talked about the coverage of madeleine 's case by the british media .
the newspaper said he was reacting to a story which appeared on tuesday claiming that leicestershire police were investigating an email sent anonymously to prince charles 's official website alleging that a disgruntled former employee had abducted madeleine .
mr amaral reportedly accused the mccanns of releasing new information each day in a bid to distract and confuse the inquiry , our correspondent said .
the mccanns ' lawyer , carlos pinto de abreu , told a portuguese radio station that mr amaral 's reported comments were " chauvinistic " .
british police have worked with the portuguese authorities for parts of their inquiry .

goncalo amaral was apparently removed after suggesting british police were working to her parents ' agenda .
madeleine 's parents , kate and gerry , of rothley , leics , are official suspects in the case but have not been charged .
their spokesman called for the inquiry to refocus on the hunt for madeleine , last seen on 3 may in the algarve .
the mccanns ' spokesman , clarence mitchell , told gmtv the detective 's comments suggesting the couple were calling the shots were " ludicrous " .
mccanns ' co-operating ' " it 's an absolutely ridiculous suggestion .
it is a portuguese-led inquiry and will remain so .
" and of course from time to time there is communication with gerry and kate as there would be in any police investigation .
" it is ludicrous to suggest that they have done anything like that . "
surely it is now time to for all of that nonsense -lsb- media speculation -rsb- to end and for the search for madeleine to be re-energised clarence mitchell the mccanns ' spokesman mr mitchell said mr and mrs mccann were " more than happy to cooperate " with portuguese authorities " whoever that might be " .
this included going back to the algarve for more interviews , he said .
but he called on whoever took over the portuguese inquiry from mr amaral to " refocus " on the search for madeleine , who disappeared from the resort of praia da luz .
he also called for an end to " unsubstantiated allegations " printed in newspapers in portugal and britain .
" surely it is now time to for all of that nonsense to end and for the search for madeleine to be re-energised , " he added .
british media mr amaral , who heads the regional policia judiciaria -lrb- pj -rrb- in portimao , was reported in the diario de noticias as saying : " the british police have been working solely on what the mccanns want and what suits them . "
the police removed him after the comments were published , but reportedly gave no reason .
the pj 's national director , alipio ribeiro , told journalists at a conference in lisbon that mr amaral 's " commission of service has ceased " .
madeleine went missing on 3 may in portugal the bbc 's special correspondent richard bilton said the detective made his comments at the end of an interview in which he talked about the coverage of madeleine 's case by the british media .
the newspaper said he was reacting to a story which appeared on tuesday claiming that leicestershire police were investigating an email sent anonymously to prince charles 's official website alleging that a disgruntled former employee had abducted madeleine .
mr amaral reportedly accused the mccanns of releasing new information each day in a bid to distract and confuse the inquiry , our correspondent said .
the mccanns ' lawyer , carlos pinto de abreu , told a portuguese radio station that mr amaral 's reported comments were " chauvinistic " .
british police have worked with the portuguese authorities for parts of their inquiry .

straight runs , less traffic and fewer pedestrians can make drivers think it is safe to speed , the government says .
last year 1,256 people died on rural uk roads , with 325 deaths caused by driving too fast for the conditions .
the statistics show the south east had most rural road fatalities , with 188 deaths , followed by eastern england -lrb- 165 -rrb- and the east midlands -lrb- 158 -rrb- .

this made it likely that drivers had been tempted to push themselves or their car beyond their limits , the dft said .
road safety minister jim fitzpatrick said : " driving on rural roads can be deceiving .
" it is important that motorists drive with as much care on a rural road as they would in a more built-up area .
" the ' national ' 60mph speed limit is a maximum , not an expectation , and drivers must match their speed to the road characteristics and weather conditions they are experiencing . "
one-fifth of the country 's rural roads are in the south west .
cornwall 's road safety unit warned : " conditions and characteristics can be unpredictable . "

straight runs , less traffic and fewer pedestrians can make drivers think it is safe to speed , the government says .
last year 1,256 people died on rural uk roads , with 325 deaths caused by driving too fast for the conditions .

this made it likely that drivers had been tempted to push themselves or their car beyond their limits , the dft said .
road safety minister jim fitzpatrick said : " driving on rural roads can be deceiving .
" it is important that motorists drive with as much care on a rural road as they would in a more built-up area .
" the ' national ' 60mph speed limit is a maximum , not an expectation , and drivers must match their speed to the road characteristics and weather conditions they are experiencing . "
one-fifth of the country 's rural roads are in the south west .
cornwall 's road safety unit warned : " conditions and characteristics can be unpredictable . "

the joseph rowntree foundation said the numbers of homeless households in rural areas rose by 300 % between 1978 and 2005 .
in urban areas they rose 160 % .
there are concerns housing is becoming less affordable in rural wales .
the charity has launched a commission to take evidence from experts and the public over the next five months .
the study , being launched in cardiff , will look at property prices , affordability and availability of social housing outside of the major towns and cities .
the foundation 's report looked at house prices compared to household income and found the " affordability ratio " had risen by 40 % in two years .
it said the ratio - the average house price divided by mean household income - rose to 5.92 in 2005 , when two years earlier it stood at 4.21 .
' sparse and expensive ' the charity said the commission on rural housing in wales will have an " independent insight into the issue of housing need in rural wales " .
a consultation paper and questionnaire has already been sent to organisations across wales .
in addition to looking at existing research , the commission will also hold four " evidence sessions " over the next five months to hear from policy experts , officials and the public .
the commission 's chairman professor derec llwyd morgan , a former vice-chancellor of the aberystwyth university , said it would consider rural housing to be " everything outside the main cities and towns " .
he said : " levels of salary are quite low and house prices are quite high .
" if they ca n't afford to pay a mortgage , the difficulty of social housing is that it is sparse and very expensive . "
craig read and mary anne young from penycae , near wrexham , who have an 11-month-old son , were homeless for over a year .
they said they had to stay in a homeless centre before recently being housed through the wrexham housing alliance .
" it was horrible , it really was .
not knowing where you were going to sleep the next night .
we did look around but there was just nowhere we could afford , " mr reed said .
in june , two housing bodies said wales was short of around 40,000 affordable homes .
the home builders federation and the chartered institute of housing cymru said fewer new homes were being built in wales than at any time since wwii .
' first-time buyers ' in a statement , deputy minister for housing jocelyn davies said the assembly government had made a number of commitments to increase affordable housing .
" there is specific help for first time buyers through our homebuy programme and in rural communities we will look at broadening the scope and definition of agricultural worker , " she said .
" i am also looking at extending the support for the rural housing enablers , currently jointly funded , who are already in post across rural wales . "

the study , being launched in cardiff , will look at property prices , affordability and availability of social housing outside of the major towns and cities .
the foundation 's report looked at house prices compared to household income and found the " affordability ratio " had risen by 40 % in two years .
it said the ratio - the average house price divided by mean household income - rose to 5.92 in 2005 , when two years earlier it stood at 4.21 .
' sparse and expensive ' the charity said the commission on rural housing in wales will have an " independent insight into the issue of housing need in rural wales " .
a consultation paper and questionnaire has already been sent to organisations across wales .
in addition to looking at existing research , the commission will also hold four " evidence sessions " over the next five months to hear from policy experts , officials and the public .
the commission 's chairman professor derec llwyd morgan , a former vice-chancellor of the aberystwyth university , said it would consider rural housing to be " everything outside the main cities and towns " .
he said : " levels of salary are quite low and house prices are quite high .
" if they ca n't afford to pay a mortgage , the difficulty of social housing is that it is sparse and very expensive . "
craig read and mary anne young from penycae , near wrexham , who have an 11-month-old son , were homeless for over a year .
they said they had to stay in a homeless centre before recently being housed through the wrexham housing alliance .
" it was horrible , it really was .
not knowing where you were going to sleep the next night .
we did look around but there was just nowhere we could afford , " mr reed said .
in june , two housing bodies said wales was short of around 40,000 affordable homes .
the home builders federation and the chartered institute of housing cymru said fewer new homes were being built in wales than at any time since wwii .
' first-time buyers ' in a statement , deputy minister for housing jocelyn davies said the assembly government had made a number of commitments to increase affordable housing .
" there is specific help for first time buyers through our homebuy programme and in rural communities we will look at broadening the scope and definition of agricultural worker , " she said .
" i am also looking at extending the support for the rural housing enablers , currently jointly funded , who are already in post across rural wales . "

sputnik was the world 's first artificial satellite , launched by the ussr on 4 october 1957 .
timeline : space flight profile : sergei korolev it was a major technical achievement and propaganda coup for the soviets .
the event marked the beginning of the space age and also the space race between the us and the ussr .
after blasting off on an r-7 rocket from the tyuratam missile range in kazakhstan , sputnik took 98 minutes to orbit earth on an elliptical path .
in the early 1950s , soviet rocket engineer sergei korolev had campaigned for an artificial satellite to be launched before the start of international geophysical year -lrb- igy -rrb- - guaranteeing a first place finish ahead of america . "
whoever controls space controls the world " senator lyndon johnson designated to begin in july 1957 , the igy was timed to coincide with a period when the sun would be emitting a large amount of radiation .
western scientists were planning a variety of experiments to study earth 's upper atmosphere during this period .
a satellite equipped with an array of scientific instruments was intended to form the centrepiece of proceedings .
in january 1956 , korolev got his wish .
the soviet government approved his plan after hearing the us was preparing for its own satellite launch .
did sputnik carry experiments into space ?
sputnik was able to transmit some temperature and density measurements to the ground , demonstrating that spacecraft could supply valuable information from space .
but it was a very rudimentary satellite and did not contain any specific experiments .
it consisted of a polished sphere measuring 58.5cm -lrb- 22.8in -rrb- in diameter and weighing 84kg -lrb- 184lb -rrb- with trailing , whip-like antennas .
inside sputnik 1 .
polished thermal shield -lrb- 1mm thick -rrb- 2 .
long , trailing antenna -lrb- one of four -rrb- to transmit signal 3 .
aluminium hemisphere with two radio transmitters 4 .
three silver-zinc batteries to power transmitters 5 .
ventilator fan inside were two one-watt radio transmitters and three silver-zinc batteries - two for powering the radio beacons and one for a ventilation fan .
the sphere was filled with nitrogen gas pressurised to 130 kilopascals -lrb- 1.3 atmospheres -rrb- .
korolev 's team of engineers had originally planned to launch a more complex satellite weighing over 1,000kg and carrying an array of scientific instruments .
this was known as object d. by mid-1956 , this project was lagging behind schedule and korolev was beginning to worry that the americans would beat him to space .
the soviet team decided to scrub the original plan and opt for a lighter , simpler design .
korolev ordered his team to work around the clock on the new project , called ps-1 .
at 1928 gmt , on 4 october 1957 , an r-7 rocket blasted off from the remote kazakh steppe carrying ps-1 on board .
hours later , the satellite engineers heard the " beep , beep , beep " of sputnik 's signal coming in over the radio , confirming the satellite had entered orbit around the earth .
what were the immediate effects ?
soviet state media were slow to recognise the significance of the launch .
pravda devoted only a few paragraphs on its front page to " sputnik " -lrb- the russian word for satellite -rrb- . "
only four or five days later did we realize that it was a turning point in the history of civilization " boris chertok , korolev 's deputy the rest of the world was stunned by the launch ; before sputnik , the us had been widely expected to win the satellite race .
the news provoked mass hysteria in the united states .
many americans linked the sputnik launch with a soviet capability to deliver ballistic missiles to targets in the us .
the new york times declared that america was in a race for survival .
senator lyndon johnson warned : " whoever controls space controls the world " .
according to sergei khrushchev , son of sputnik-era soviet premier nikita , the relatively nonchalant reaction in the ussr was due to a general belief that , step-by-step , their country would edge ahead of america as a world power .
boris chertok , 95 , who was korolev 's deputy , said : " at that moment we could n't fully understand what we had done .
" we felt ecstatic about it only later , when the entire world ran amok .
only four or five days later did we realize that it was a turning point in the history of civilization . "
how were us satellite projects doing ?
in 1955 , the white house had solicited proposals from government agencies to undertake development of an artificial satellite .
a us army proposal , spearheaded by german-born rocket scientist wernher von braun , was eventually rejected in favour of the us navy 's project vanguard .
von braun had designed the v-2 missiles for nazi germany during wwii , but surrendered to american forces in 1945 .
he was transported to the us - along with many other v-2 engineers - to develop missiles for america .
the german rocket designer , who had long harboured dreams of working on space vehicles , refused to give up after the initial rejection of his proposal .
he continued to seek approval for launching his own satellite ; but his repeated pleas fell on deaf ears , even as project vanguard slipped behind schedule .
then , in november 1957 , the soviet union rubbed salt in america 's wounds by launching sputnik 2 , carrying a female dog called laika on board .
the pentagon gave into von braun and allowed him to join the satellite race .
vanguard made it to the launch pad first .
on 6 december 1957 , the navy rocket climbed into the air from cape canaveral , florida , in a televised launch .
unfortunately , it only climbed a few feet before losing thrust and exploding on the launch pad .
the us was spared further humiliation when von braun successfully launched his explorer i satellite on 29 january 1958 .
the space race had begun in earnest .

sputnik was the world 's first artificial satellite , launched by the ussr on 4 october 1957 .
timeline : space flight profile : sergei korolev engineer 's memories it was a major technical achievement and propaganda coup for the soviets .
the event marked the beginning of the space age and also the space race between the us and the ussr .
after blasting off on an r-7 rocket from the tyuratam missile range in kazakhstan , sputnik took 98 minutes to orbit earth on an elliptical path .
in the early 1950s , soviet rocket engineer sergei korolev had campaigned for an artificial satellite to be launched before the start of international geophysical year -lrb- igy -rrb- - guaranteeing a first place finish ahead of america .
whoever controls space controls the world senator lyndon johnson 1980 's cosmonaut designated to begin in july 1957 , the igy was timed to coincide with a period when the sun would be emitting a large amount of radiation .
western scientists were planning a variety of experiments to study earth 's upper atmosphere during this period .
a satellite equipped with an array of scientific instruments was intended to form the centrepiece of proceedings .
in january 1956 , korolev got his wish .
the soviet government approved his plan after hearing the us was preparing for its own satellite launch .
did sputnik carry experiments into space ?
sputnik was able to transmit some temperature and density measurements to the ground , demonstrating that spacecraft could supply valuable information from space .
but it was a very rudimentary satellite and did not contain any specific experiments .
it consisted of a polished sphere measuring 58.5cm -lrb- 22.8in -rrb- in diameter and weighing 84kg -lrb- 184lb -rrb- with trailing , whip-like antennas .
inside sputnik 1 .
polished thermal shield -lrb- 1mm thick -rrb- 2 .
long , trailing antenna -lrb- one of four -rrb- to transmit signal 3 .
aluminium hemisphere with two radio transmitters 4 .
three silver-zinc batteries to power transmitters 5 .
ventilator fan sputnik 's launch inside were two one-watt radio transmitters and three silver-zinc batteries - two for powering the radio beacons and one for a ventilation fan .
the sphere was filled with nitrogen gas pressurised to 130 kilopascals -lrb- 1.3 atmospheres -rrb- .
korolev 's team of engineers had originally planned to launch a more complex satellite weighing over 1,000kg and carrying an array of scientific instruments .
this was known as object d. by mid-1956 , this project was lagging behind schedule and korolev was beginning to worry that the americans would beat him to space .
the soviet team decided to scrub the original plan and opt for a lighter , simpler design .
korolev ordered his team to work around the clock on the new project , called ps-1 .
at 1928 gmt , on 4 october 1957 , an r-7 rocket blasted off from the remote kazakh steppe carrying ps-1 on board .
hours later , the satellite engineers heard the " beep , beep , beep " of sputnik 's signal coming in over the radio , confirming the satellite had entered orbit around the earth .
what were the immediate effects ?
soviet state media were slow to recognise the significance of the launch .
pravda devoted only a few paragraphs on its front page to " sputnik " -lrb- the russian word for satellite -rrb- .
only four or five days later did we realize that it was a turning point in the history of civilization boris chertok , korolev 's deputy the rest of the world was stunned by the launch ; before sputnik , the us had been widely expected to win the satellite race .
the news provoked mass hysteria in the united states .
many americans linked the sputnik launch with a soviet capability to deliver ballistic missiles to targets in the us .
the new york times declared that america was in a race for survival .
senator lyndon johnson warned : " whoever controls space controls the world " .
according to sergei khrushchev , son of sputnik-era soviet premier nikita , the relatively nonchalant reaction in the ussr was due to a general belief that , step-by-step , their country would edge ahead of america as a world power .
boris chertok , 95 , who was korolev 's deputy , said : " at that moment we could n't fully understand what we had done .
" we felt ecstatic about it only later , when the entire world ran amok .
only four or five days later did we realize that it was a turning point in the history of civilization . "
how were us satellite projects doing ?
in 1955 , the white house had solicited proposals from government agencies to undertake development of an artificial satellite .
wernher von braun 's satellite proposal was originally rejected a us army proposal , spearheaded by german-born rocket scientist wernher von braun , was eventually rejected in favour of the us navy 's project vanguard .
von braun had designed the v-2 missiles for nazi germany during wwii , but surrendered to american forces in 1945 .
he was transported to the us - along with many other v-2 engineers - to develop missiles for america .
the german rocket designer , who had long harboured dreams of working on space vehicles , refused to give up after the initial rejection of his proposal .
he continued to seek approval for launching his own satellite ; but his repeated pleas fell on deaf ears , even as project vanguard slipped behind schedule .
then , in november 1957 , the soviet union rubbed salt in america 's wounds by launching sputnik 2 , carrying a female dog called laika on board .
the pentagon gave into von braun and allowed him to join the satellite race .
vanguard made it to the launch pad first .
on 6 december 1957 , the navy rocket climbed into the air from cape canaveral , florida , in a televised launch .
unfortunately , it only climbed a few feet before losing thrust and exploding on the launch pad .
the us was spared further humiliation when von braun successfully launched his explorer i satellite on 29 january 1958 .
the space race had begun in earnest .

for korolev , who had launched the first satellite and the first man into space , recognition was to come only after his death .
as an engineering graduate in moscow during the 1930s , he co-founded an amateur rocket society with a colleague , fridrikh tsander , who , like korolev , was inspired by ideas of space travel .
their experiments with liquid fuelled rockets soon caught the eye of the military .

he was arrested on trumped-up charges of sabotaging work for defence installations and membership of anti-soviet groups .
hard labour his jaw broken by interrogators , he was sent to one of the most feared parts of the gulag network of labour camps , the kolyma region of eastern siberia .
thousands of prisoners died each month in the freezing gold mine camps .
sputnik 's launch korolev was worn down by 12-hour days of back-breaking work , a poor diet , the harsh climate and abuse at the hands of guards and genuine criminals .
he was later transferred to a special engineering design office for prisoners - a move which marked the rebirth of his career .
by this time , he had lost all his teeth to scurvy and was given potato juice to drink in an effort to nurse him back to health .
freed in 1946 , korolev spent his first night at home telling the adult members of his family about the ordeal .
his daughter natalya koroleva told russian newspaper rossiyskaya gazeta that he finished the night by saying : " never ask me about it again - i want to forget it all like a horrible dream . "

but korolev did not lose his passion for space flight .
in 1952 , a scientific organisation called for artificial satellites to be launched during international geophysical year , designated to begin in 1957 .
korolev saw his chance and campaigned for a soviet satellite launch .
in 1956 , the government approved korolev 's proposal after hearing of us plans to launch their own satellite .
the soviet ' moon ' built in a hurry to beat the us into space , sputnik 1 blasted off atop a modified r-7 missile in october 1957 .
the launch of the world 's first artificial satellite by the soviet union sent shock waves around the world .
soviet premier nikita khrushchev demanded more spectacular launches from korolev 's team .
gagarin was the face behind space efforts , korolev the brains 1980 's cosmonaut sputnik 1 was followed by the first animal in space , the first man in space , the first woman , the first three-person mission and the first spacewalk .
by this time , korolev commanded enormous authority .
yet , despite the grand title of chief designer , he was only a part of a large space and weapons industry .
throughout his career , korolev faced competition and jealousy , both from rival spacecraft and missile designers and from within his own team of engineers .
when sweden 's nobel committee decided to award their prize to the chief designer , and asked to know his name , premier khrushchev told them the entire soviet people deserved the award .
according to khrushchev 's son sergei , nikita knew that if korolev was singled out for a nobel , precarious co-operative efforts between the chief designer and his rivals would collapse .
lunar programme there were also notable failures under korolev 's leadership .
his early version of the soyuz spacecraft , which first flew a few months after his death , killed its cosmonaut .
the soviets eventually tried to compete with the us in the race to be first to land humans on the moon .
korolev began work on an immense rocket called the n-1 , intended to carry cosmonauts on a lunar venture ; but the chief designer died before he could see this plan to fruition .
after the n-1 failed several times in tests , and following nasa 's successful touchdown in the moon 's sea of tranquility , the soviet lunar programme was quietly cancelled .
korolev had been suffering from health problems for years , some stemming from his time in the gulag .
accounts of his death differ : he either died during surgery on an intestinal tumour , or during a botched haemorrhoid operation .
a few days after korolev passed away , his accomplishments were revealed to the world when his obituary was published in the pages of official newspaper pravda .
in a final twist , the need for secrecy about korolev 's identity was probably a sham .
sergei khrushchev recalls a kgb chief telling him " the enemy 's resources were limited , so we let them waste their efforts trying to uncover ' non-secret ' secrets " .
today , korolev has a town named after him in russia .
craters on the moon and mars , and an asteroid , also bear his name .
korolev 's place in history as one of the fathers of space exploration has at last been recognised .

for korolev , who had launched the first satellite and the first man into space , recognition was to come only after his death .
as an engineering graduate in moscow during the 1930s , he co-founded an amateur rocket society with a colleague , fridrikh tsander , who , like korolev , was inspired by ideas of space travel .
their experiments with liquid fuelled rockets soon caught the eye of the military .

he was arrested on trumped-up charges of sabotaging work for defence installations and membership of anti-soviet groups .

thousands of prisoners died each month in the freezing gold mine camps .
sputnik 's launch korolev was worn down by 12-hour days of back-breaking work , a poor diet , the harsh climate and abuse at the hands of guards and genuine criminals .
he was later transferred to a special engineering design office for prisoners - a move which marked the rebirth of his career .

his daughter natalya koroleva told russian newspaper rossiyskaya gazeta that he finished the night by saying : " never ask me about it again - i want to forget it all like a horrible dream . "

yet , despite the grand title of chief designer , he was only a part of a large space and weapons industry .
throughout his career , korolev faced competition and jealousy , both from rival spacecraft and missile designers and from within his own team of engineers .
when sweden 's nobel committee decided to award their prize to the chief designer , and asked to know his name , premier khrushchev told them the entire soviet people deserved the award .

by mark ward technology correspondent , bbc news website the cgs aims to turn games into a pro-sport it has often been said that the reason computer and video games are more popular then ever is because they look better than ever .
add to those good looks the action , explosions and fast-paced action in the most popular game titles and you might be forgiven for thinking that they would be a natural fit for tv .
however , the history of competitive computer games is littered with attempts that have tried , and largely failed , to put games and gamers on the goggle box .
the latest attempt came to the uk in september in the form of the championship gaming series -lrb- cgs -rrb- .
this aims to put pro-gaming on prime time tv on channels run by its main sponsors sky and direct tv .
live matches and footage of cgs tournaments will be shown on sky one .
the cgs is not the only league to be shown on tv .
xleague.tv shows regular tournaments on cable and satellite channels and run its own , smaller scale , league .
the cgs models itself on us pro-sports and it owns the leagues and teams playing under its banner .
counterstrike has been hugely popular for years the cgs has created teams on five continents and runs its own leagues in which the teams will compete for a substantial prize pot .
all the members of the cgs teams get paid a monthly wage and each team of ten has players who excel at one of the four competition games : counterstrike source , project gotham racing 3 , dead or alive 4 and fifa soccer 07 .
serious play andy reif , commissioner of the cgs , believes that this time around video games have the best chance of making it as a pro-sport that can attract big audiences .
prior to taking on the job of cgs boss , mr reif was part of the team that owned the rights to beach volleyball .
" when we took that over it was kind of damaged goods , " said mr reif .
" it did not have many fans , sponsors or media platforms . "
by the time mr reif left to take on the cgs beach volleyball had become hugely popular , had major sponsors and plenty of tv coverage .
" i moved to the cgs because i thought video games were a bigger opportunity and its already global , " he said .
the important change that the cgs has made is to create its own teams , said mr reif .
before now the world of pro-gaming has been fractured - divided by the games people play and the tournaments they enter .
the cgs hopes to make gaming as big as beach volleyball the field was also hard to penetrate for those not heavily involved , he said .
to get over these obstacles the cgs had changed the rules in some of the games it ha adopted , developed special software to make it easy to follow the action in fast-moving games and makes the success of a team depend on all players winning at their chosen game .
for michael o 'dell , a former manager of uk pro-gaming group team dignitas and now a cgs team manager , the competition is what the gaming world has been waiting for .
" it 's taking gaming as it is now to the level of e-sports we have been trying and hoping we would achieve , " he said .
by giving players a salary the cgs has , at a stroke , boosted the numbers of people that make a modest living out of it .
before now , said mr o 'dell , the problem pro-players faced was the uncertainty of their winnings .
although there were plenty of tournaments that offer cash prizes there were no guarantees that pro-players would end up in the money .
few gamers manage to make a living from playing but said philip wride , a former manager of uk pro-gamers 4kings and now a game industry consultant , the arrival of the cgs has not been welcomed in all corners of the gaming world .
" a lot of european top teams did not bother getting involved with the cgs , " said mr wride .
some did not want to lose top players to the cgs or lose the chance to take part in tournaments , such as the world cyber games or the e-sports world cup , that offer potentially larger cash prizes than are available in cgs events .
culturally , he added , europeans were not used to sports in which the leagues own and run teams .
this too , he said , may have been a barrier to people getting involved .
for his part mr reif is convinced that video games are poised to become hugely popular and that the players of today will become well-known tomorrow .
" the audience will continue to grow and grow . " he said .
" i 've bet my career on it . "

by mark ward technology correspondent , bbc news website the cgs aims to turn games into a pro-sport it has often been said that the reason computer and video games are more popular then ever is because they look better than ever .
add to those good looks the action , explosions and fast-paced action in the most popular game titles and you might be forgiven for thinking that they would be a natural fit for tv .
however , the history of competitive computer games is littered with attempts that have tried , and largely failed , to put games and gamers on the goggle box .
the latest attempt came to the uk in september in the form of the championship gaming series -lrb- cgs -rrb- .
this aims to put pro-gaming on prime time tv on channels run by its main sponsors sky and direct tv .
live matches and footage of cgs tournaments will be shown on sky one .
the cgs is not the only league to be shown on tv .
xleague.tv shows regular tournaments on cable and satellite channels and run its own , smaller scale , league .
the cgs models itself on us pro-sports and it owns the leagues and teams playing under its banner .
counterstrike has been hugely popular for years the cgs has created teams on five continents and runs its own leagues in which the teams will compete for a substantial prize pot .
all the members of the cgs teams get paid a monthly wage and each team of ten has players who excel at one of the four competition games : counterstrike source , project gotham racing 3 , dead or alive 4 and fifa soccer 07 .
serious play andy reif , commissioner of the cgs , believes that this time around video games have the best chance of making it as a pro-sport that can attract big audiences .
prior to taking on the job of cgs boss , mr reif was part of the team that owned the rights to beach volleyball .
" when we took that over it was kind of damaged goods , " said mr reif .
" it did not have many fans , sponsors or media platforms . "
by the time mr reif left to take on the cgs beach volleyball had become hugely popular , had major sponsors and plenty of tv coverage .
" i moved to the cgs because i thought video games were a bigger opportunity and its already global , " he said .
the important change that the cgs has made is to create its own teams , said mr reif .
before now the world of pro-gaming has been fractured - divided by the games people play and the tournaments they enter .
the cgs hopes to make gaming as big as beach volleyball the field was also hard to penetrate for those not heavily involved , he said .
to get over these obstacles the cgs had changed the rules in some of the games it ha adopted , developed special software to make it easy to follow the action in fast-moving games and makes the success of a team depend on all players winning at their chosen game .
for michael o 'dell , a former manager of uk pro-gaming group team dignitas and now a cgs team manager , the competition is what the gaming world has been waiting for .
" it 's taking gaming as it is now to the level of e-sports we have been trying and hoping we would achieve , " he said .
by giving players a salary the cgs has , at a stroke , boosted the numbers of people that make a modest living out of it .
before now , said mr o 'dell , the problem pro-players faced was the uncertainty of their winnings .
although there were plenty of tournaments that offer cash prizes there were no guarantees that pro-players would end up in the money .
few gamers manage to make a living from playing but said philip wride , a former manager of uk pro-gamers 4kings and now a game industry consultant , the arrival of the cgs has not been welcomed in all corners of the gaming world .
" a lot of european top teams did not bother getting involved with the cgs , " said mr wride .
some did not want to lose top players to the cgs or lose the chance to take part in tournaments , such as the world cyber games or the e-sports world cup , that offer potentially larger cash prizes than are available in cgs events .
culturally , he added , europeans were not used to sports in which the leagues own and run teams .
this too , he said , may have been a barrier to people getting involved .
for his part mr reif is convinced that video games are poised to become hugely popular and that the players of today will become well-known tomorrow .
" the audience will continue to grow and grow . " he said .
" i 've bet my career on it . "

by mark ward technology correspondent , bbc news website the cgs aims to turn games into a pro-sport it has often been said that the reason computer and video games are more popular then ever is because they look better than ever .
add to those good looks the action , explosions and fast-paced action in the most popular game titles and you might be forgiven for thinking that they would be a natural fit for tv .
however , the history of competitive computer games is littered with attempts that have tried , and largely failed , to put games and gamers on the goggle box .
the latest attempt came to the uk in september in the form of the championship gaming series -lrb- cgs -rrb- .
this aims to put pro-gaming on prime time tv on channels run by its main sponsors sky and direct tv .
live matches and footage of cgs tournaments will be shown on sky one .
the cgs is not the only league to be shown on tv .
xleague.tv shows regular tournaments on cable and satellite channels and run its own , smaller scale , league .
the cgs models itself on us pro-sports and it owns the leagues and teams playing under its banner .
counterstrike has been hugely popular for years the cgs has created teams on five continents and runs its own leagues in which the teams will compete for a substantial prize pot .
all the members of the cgs teams get paid a monthly wage and each team of ten has players who excel at one of the four competition games : counterstrike source , project gotham racing 3 , dead or alive 4 and fifa soccer 07 .
serious play andy reif , commissioner of the cgs , believes that this time around video games have the best chance of making it as a pro-sport that can attract big audiences .
prior to taking on the job of cgs boss , mr reif was part of the team that owned the rights to beach volleyball .
" when we took that over it was kind of damaged goods , " said mr reif .
" it did not have many fans , sponsors or media platforms . "
by the time mr reif left to take on the cgs beach volleyball had become hugely popular , had major sponsors and plenty of tv coverage .
" i moved to the cgs because i thought video games were a bigger opportunity and its already global , " he said .
the important change that the cgs has made is to create its own teams , said mr reif .
before now the world of pro-gaming has been fractured - divided by the games people play and the tournaments they enter .
the cgs hopes to make gaming as big as beach volleyball the field was also hard to penetrate for those not heavily involved , he said .
to get over these obstacles the cgs had changed the rules in some of the games it ha adopted , developed special software to make it easy to follow the action in fast-moving games and makes the success of a team depend on all players winning at their chosen game .
for michael o 'dell , a former manager of uk pro-gaming group team dignitas and now a cgs team manager , the competition is what the gaming world has been waiting for .
" it 's taking gaming as it is now to the level of e-sports we have been trying and hoping we would achieve , " he said .
by giving players a salary the cgs has , at a stroke , boosted the numbers of people that make a modest living out of it .
before now , said mr o 'dell , the problem pro-players faced was the uncertainty of their winnings .
although there were plenty of tournaments that offer cash prizes there were no guarantees that pro-players would end up in the money .
few gamers manage to make a living from playing but said philip wride , a former manager of uk pro-gamers 4kings and now a game industry consultant , the arrival of the cgs has not been welcomed in all corners of the gaming world .
" a lot of european top teams did not bother getting involved with the cgs , " said mr wride .
some did not want to lose top players to the cgs or lose the chance to take part in tournaments , such as the world cyber games or the e-sports world cup , that offer potentially larger cash prizes than are available in cgs events .
culturally , he added , europeans were not used to sports in which the leagues own and run teams .
this too , he said , may have been a barrier to people getting involved .
for his part mr reif is convinced that video games are poised to become hugely popular and that the players of today will become well-known tomorrow .
" the audience will continue to grow and grow . " he said .
" i 've bet my career on it . "
