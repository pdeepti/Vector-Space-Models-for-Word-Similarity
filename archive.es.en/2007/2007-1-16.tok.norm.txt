pressure is growing on the conservative bavarian premier to step down and the repercussions could be felt in the german capital as well . the usual snow may be missing this year at the remote bavarian resort of wildbad kreuth .
but an icy wind is blowing at the closed retreat of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- currently meeting there .
the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is meeting in kreuth to discuss the future of the csu and , more importantly , its veteran state premier , edmund stoiber . stoiber is under mounting pressure to either resign or not seek re-election in 2008 .
the csu has held an absolute majority in the bavarian parliament for over 30 years .
yet support for the conservatives has dipped below 50 percent in state-wide opinion polls after it became known that his top aide had pried into the private life of csu rival and staunch stoiber critic gabriele pauli . " the consensus in the party leadership is that he must go before bavarian local elections in the spring of 2008 , " the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung said in an editorial on monday .
" it 's just that nobody wants to tell him this . " according to the opposition , it 's time for a change . " bavaria deserves better than this , " said franz maget , head of bavaria 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , who has called for immediate early elections .
" that 's why it 's time for the premier to hand in his resignation . " but stoiber put on a brave face as he arrived in kreuth on monday . " i 'm fighting for my goals , for bavaria 's success , and for the success of the csu , " stoiber said . the cdu in berlin depends on bavaria 's csu the csu holds a unique position in germany 's political landscape .
under a longtime power-sharing pact , the csu confines itself to bavaria and merkel 's cdu never seeks office inside the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel had happier days during the 2005 campaign the csu is a party outside of the cdu 's control , yet both make up a common group in the federal parliament .
this means merkel needs csu support to push through her party 's platform . but stoiber 's recent opposition to government reform plans , in particular to the healthcare system , has hurt merkel 's popularity and the two have a strained relationship .
stoiber has also been a loud critic of germany 's federalism reform , which regulates berlin 's authority over the country 's 16 states . many cdu allies have been angered by stoiber 's public criticism of merkel while she was struggling to keep a coalition with the spd on an even keel .
fears are growing in his own party that he would drag down csu candidates at local polls , as well . a bavarian premier enjoys royal benefits a state premier in munich is all but a successor to the former kings of bavaria , enjoying the use of royal palaces , dominating every aspect of administration and basking in the acclaim of the mainly catholic population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber gave pope benedict xvi the royal treatment during his visit when bavarian-born pope benedict xvi visited bavaria in september 2006 , stoiber played host at the king 's palace in munich , posing his children and grandchildren with the pontiff for an official photo . stoiber has been running bavaria - one of germany 's most prosperous regions - for almost 14 years .
in 2002 , he failed in his bid to become german chancellor , losing out to incumbent gerhard schröder in one of the narrowest votes in post-war history . then in 2005 , he wavered over joining the new coalition government in berlin as economics minister before opting to stay in bavaria .
many critics interpreted this decision to be based on stoiber 's inability to operate as freely in the big city capital as he could in his " royal surroundings " in munich . the push for power is turning into a dirty fight although the csu faction has yet to make an official decision on stoiber , several leading party politicians have been named as possible successors .
bavaria 's interior minister , günther beckstein , could become premier , with german agriculture minister horst seehofer as party chief .
but rumors of seehofer having an extramarital affair hit the german mass-circulation tabloid bild on monday , with a tuesday report claiming his girlfriend was expecting a child . bild quoted an unnamed csu functionary as its source .
now , politicians are asking who out of their own ranks would spread this rumor . the speculations about seehofer 's private life are reminiscent of similar events back in 1993 , when stoiber was battling bavaria 's premier at the time , theo waigel .
stoiber was able to win , after waigel 's affair with the professional skier irene epple was leaked to the press .

while many topics will eventually get an eu airing , not all issues are created equal . " every eu presidency presents a comprehensive program , but only a small amount of the content is actually new or actually written by the respective government , " said roman maruhn of munich 's center for applied policy research , explaining why the official program lists such a range of topics . but there 's one issue that is on everyone 's mind and which will likely get the much of the attention over the next six months - the moribund eu constitution .
germany 's progress on finding a compromise regarding the rejected eu constitution will be a major benchmark used to judge berlin 's success , he added . the c word bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters rejected the constitution draft in a referendum vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 , the constitutional treaty had been put on ice for a yearlong " period of reflection " and the controversial issue has begun to reappear on the european agenda as germany takes the eu 's reigns . " expectations toward the german presidency , and angela merkel in particular , are incredibly high , " said katinka barysch of the center for european reform .
" she seems to be very good at listening to people and bringing everybody on board , but whether she is really good at forging consensus - that remains to be seen . " hammering out a constitutional deal will be particularly difficult for germany as it is among the treaty 's strongest supporters and is likely to be viewed as a biased mediator .

" things can go quickly if they are well orchestrated , and i think the ambition of the german presidency to get a clear roadmap for the constitution is a realistic goal , " guerot said . germany 's geopolitical location in the middle of europe predestines the country for a role as a leader and mediator , especially since it has added european integration to its national interests since the reunification of east and west germany , maruhn said . germany is n't alone on european stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has to convince 26 other national leaders to build a consensus but when it comes to forging compromises on a european level , countries that have expressed skepticism about the treaty , including the netherlands , france , the uk and poland , also have to be willing to negotiate for any progress to be made , according to guerot . " it 's not just about what germany wants to achieve , " she added .
" germany is a key player and a big country so there are big chances to bring things together , but one should not expect germany will fix everything . " but even if germany proves unable to bridge both sides of the constitutional debate , there is a chance for berlin to book a successful presidency by concentrating on endearing the eu to its citizens by reminding them of the peace the eu brought to a war-torn continent , barysch said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de german eu presidency -pipe- 16.01.2007 eu constitution could make or break german eu presidency großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel 's presidency will largely be judged by her success in negotiating an eu constitution compromise german chancellor angela merkel is scheduled to announce germany 's goals for its six-month eu presidency wednesday in strasbourg , but experts says it will be her plans for the eu constitution that get the most attention . germany has set numerous goals in its 25-page program for the eu presidency that include everything from securing europe 's energy supplies to outlawing holocaust denial across the eu to improving europeans ' image of the bloc and getting serious about climate change . it 's an ambitious agenda and it will be discussed extensively in roughly 4,000 eu internal meetings and 40 additional conferences with non-eu countries over the next six months before germany passes the presidential baton to portugal in june .
while many topics will eventually get an eu airing , not all issues are created equal . " every eu presidency presents a comprehensive program , but only a small amount of the content is actually new or actually written by the respective government , " said roman maruhn of munich 's center for applied policy research , explaining why the official program lists such a range of topics . but there 's one issue that is on everyone 's mind and which will likely get the much of the attention over the next six months - the moribund eu constitution .
germany 's progress on finding a compromise regarding the rejected eu constitution will be a major benchmark used to judge berlin 's success , he added . the c word bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters rejected the constitution draft in a referendum vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 , the constitutional treaty had been put on ice for a yearlong " period of reflection " and the controversial issue has begun to reappear on the european agenda as germany takes the eu 's reigns . " expectations toward the german presidency , and angela merkel in particular , are incredibly high , " said katinka barysch of the center for european reform .
" she seems to be very good at listening to people and bringing everybody on board , but whether she is really good at forging consensus - that remains to be seen . " hammering out a constitutional deal will be particularly difficult for germany as it is among the treaty 's strongest supporters and is likely to be viewed as a biased mediator .
french elections , scheduled to be held shortly before the german presidency comes to a close , will also complicate negotiations , barysch added . a natural mediator bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if merkel will be able to unite the eu again merkel , who surprised many at her first european summit as german chancellor by brokering a deal on the bloc 's budget , could make some headway on deciding which parts of the constitution eu members are in favor of saving , according to the german marshall fund 's ulrike guerot . " things can go quickly if they are well orchestrated , and i think the ambition of the german presidency to get a clear roadmap for the constitution is a realistic goal , " guerot said . germany 's geopolitical location in the middle of europe predestines the country for a role as a leader and mediator , especially since it has added european integration to its national interests since the reunification of east and west germany , maruhn said . germany is n't alone on european stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has to convince 26 other national leaders to build a consensus but when it comes to forging compromises on a european level , countries that have expressed skepticism about the treaty , including the netherlands , france , the uk and poland , also have to be willing to negotiate for any progress to be made , according to guerot . " it 's not just about what germany wants to achieve , " she added .
" germany is a key player and a big country so there are big chances to bring things together , but one should not expect germany will fix everything . " but even if germany proves unable to bridge both sides of the constitutional debate , there is a chance for berlin to book a successful presidency by concentrating on endearing the eu to its citizens by reminding them of the peace the eu brought to a war-torn continent , barysch said . " what the germans could achieve is a turnaround in the atmospherics in the eu , " she said .

while many topics will eventually get an eu airing , not all issues are created equal . " every eu presidency presents a comprehensive program , but only a small amount of the content is actually new or actually written by the respective government , " said roman maruhn of munich 's center for applied policy research , explaining why the official program lists such a range of topics . but there 's one issue that is on everyone 's mind and which will likely get the much of the attention over the next six months - the moribund eu constitution .
germany 's progress on finding a compromise regarding the rejected eu constitution will be a major benchmark used to judge berlin 's success , he added . the c word bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters rejected the constitution draft in a referendum vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 , the constitutional treaty had been put on ice for a yearlong " period of reflection " and the controversial issue has begun to reappear on the european agenda as germany takes the eu 's reigns . " expectations toward the german presidency , and angela merkel in particular , are incredibly high , " said katinka barysch of the center for european reform .
" she seems to be very good at listening to people and bringing everybody on board , but whether she is really good at forging consensus - that remains to be seen . " hammering out a constitutional deal will be particularly difficult for germany as it is among the treaty 's strongest supporters and is likely to be viewed as a biased mediator .

" things can go quickly if they are well orchestrated , and i think the ambition of the german presidency to get a clear roadmap for the constitution is a realistic goal , " guerot said . germany 's geopolitical location in the middle of europe predestines the country for a role as a leader and mediator , especially since it has added european integration to its national interests since the reunification of east and west germany , maruhn said . germany is n't alone on european stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has to convince 26 other national leaders to build a consensus but when it comes to forging compromises on a european level , countries that have expressed skepticism about the treaty , including the netherlands , france , the uk and poland , also have to be willing to negotiate for any progress to be made , according to guerot . " it 's not just about what germany wants to achieve , " she added .
" germany is a key player and a big country so there are big chances to bring things together , but one should not expect germany will fix everything . " but even if germany proves unable to bridge both sides of the constitutional debate , there is a chance for berlin to book a successful presidency by concentrating on endearing the eu to its citizens by reminding them of the peace the eu brought to a war-torn continent , barysch said .

while many topics will eventually get an eu airing , not all issues are created equal . " every eu presidency presents a comprehensive program , but only a small amount of the content is actually new or actually written by the respective government , " said roman maruhn of munich 's center for applied policy research , explaining why the official program lists such a range of topics . but there 's one issue that is on everyone 's mind and which will likely get the much of the attention over the next six months - the moribund eu constitution .
germany 's progress on finding a compromise regarding the rejected eu constitution will be a major benchmark used to judge berlin 's success , he added . the c word bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters rejected the constitution draft in a referendum vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 , the constitutional treaty had been put on ice for a yearlong " period of reflection " and the controversial issue has begun to reappear on the european agenda as germany takes the eu 's reigns . " expectations toward the german presidency , and angela merkel in particular , are incredibly high , " said katinka barysch of the center for european reform .
" she seems to be very good at listening to people and bringing everybody on board , but whether she is really good at forging consensus - that remains to be seen . " hammering out a constitutional deal will be particularly difficult for germany as it is among the treaty 's strongest supporters and is likely to be viewed as a biased mediator .
french elections , scheduled to be held shortly before the german presidency comes to a close , will also complicate negotiations , barysch added . a natural mediator bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if merkel will be able to unite the eu again merkel , who surprised many at her first european summit as german chancellor by brokering a deal on the bloc 's budget , could make some headway on deciding which parts of the constitution eu members are in favor of saving , according to the german marshall fund 's ulrike guerot . " things can go quickly if they are well orchestrated , and i think the ambition of the german presidency to get a clear roadmap for the constitution is a realistic goal , " guerot said . germany 's geopolitical location in the middle of europe predestines the country for a role as a leader and mediator , especially since it has added european integration to its national interests since the reunification of east and west germany , maruhn said . germany is n't alone on european stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has to convince 26 other national leaders to build a consensus but when it comes to forging compromises on a european level , countries that have expressed skepticism about the treaty , including the netherlands , france , the uk and poland , also have to be willing to negotiate for any progress to be made , according to guerot . " it 's not just about what germany wants to achieve , " she added .
" germany is a key player and a big country so there are big chances to bring things together , but one should not expect germany will fix everything . " but even if germany proves unable to bridge both sides of the constitutional debate , there is a chance for berlin to book a successful presidency by concentrating on endearing the eu to its citizens by reminding them of the peace the eu brought to a war-torn continent , barysch said . " what the germans could achieve is a turnaround in the atmospherics in the eu , " she said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de political parties -pipe- 16.01.2007 top german politician facing pressure to resign as state premier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's days as an attack dog of german politics appear numbered the chair of long-time german powerbroker edmund stoiber is wobbling .
pressure is growing on the conservative bavarian premier to step down and the repercussions could be felt in the german capital as well . the usual snow may be missing this year at the remote bavarian resort of wildbad kreuth .
but an icy wind is blowing at the closed retreat of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- currently meeting there .
the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is meeting in kreuth to discuss the future of the csu and , more importantly , its veteran state premier , edmund stoiber . stoiber is under mounting pressure to either resign or not seek re-election in 2008 .
the csu has held an absolute majority in the bavarian parliament for over 30 years .
yet support for the conservatives has dipped below 50 percent in state-wide opinion polls after it became known that his top aide had pried into the private life of csu rival and staunch stoiber critic gabriele pauli . " the consensus in the party leadership is that he must go before bavarian local elections in the spring of 2008 , " the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung said in an editorial on monday .
" it 's just that nobody wants to tell him this . " according to the opposition , it 's time for a change . " bavaria deserves better than this , " said franz maget , head of bavaria 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , who has called for immediate early elections .
" that 's why it 's time for the premier to hand in his resignation . " but stoiber put on a brave face as he arrived in kreuth on monday . " i 'm fighting for my goals , for bavaria 's success , and for the success of the csu , " stoiber said . the cdu in berlin depends on bavaria 's csu the csu holds a unique position in germany 's political landscape .
under a longtime power-sharing pact , the csu confines itself to bavaria and merkel 's cdu never seeks office inside the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel had happier days during the 2005 campaign the csu is a party outside of the cdu 's control , yet both make up a common group in the federal parliament .
this means merkel needs csu support to push through her party 's platform . but stoiber 's recent opposition to government reform plans , in particular to the healthcare system , has hurt merkel 's popularity and the two have a strained relationship .
stoiber has also been a loud critic of germany 's federalism reform , which regulates berlin 's authority over the country 's 16 states . many cdu allies have been angered by stoiber 's public criticism of merkel while she was struggling to keep a coalition with the spd on an even keel .
fears are growing in his own party that he would drag down csu candidates at local polls , as well . a bavarian premier enjoys royal benefits a state premier in munich is all but a successor to the former kings of bavaria , enjoying the use of royal palaces , dominating every aspect of administration and basking in the acclaim of the mainly catholic population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber gave pope benedict xvi the royal treatment during his visit when bavarian-born pope benedict xvi visited bavaria in september 2006 , stoiber played host at the king 's palace in munich , posing his children and grandchildren with the pontiff for an official photo . stoiber has been running bavaria - one of germany 's most prosperous regions - for almost 14 years .
in 2002 , he failed in his bid to become german chancellor , losing out to incumbent gerhard schröder in one of the narrowest votes in post-war history . then in 2005 , he wavered over joining the new coalition government in berlin as economics minister before opting to stay in bavaria .
many critics interpreted this decision to be based on stoiber 's inability to operate as freely in the big city capital as he could in his " royal surroundings " in munich . the push for power is turning into a dirty fight although the csu faction has yet to make an official decision on stoiber , several leading party politicians have been named as possible successors .
bavaria 's interior minister , günther beckstein , could become premier , with german agriculture minister horst seehofer as party chief .
but rumors of seehofer having an extramarital affair hit the german mass-circulation tabloid bild on monday , with a tuesday report claiming his girlfriend was expecting a child . bild quoted an unnamed csu functionary as its source .
now , politicians are asking who out of their own ranks would spread this rumor . the speculations about seehofer 's private life are reminiscent of similar events back in 1993 , when stoiber was battling bavaria 's premier at the time , theo waigel .
stoiber was able to win , after waigel 's affair with the professional skier irene epple was leaked to the press .
waigel married epple in 1994 and they have one son . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties set political agendas for 2007 the new year is the time when germany 's political parties meet to map out their strategies for the coming year and health and labor reforms look set to dominate the political agenda in 2007 .

the city-state 's purchase would help meet aims to keep the shares in german hands . the bremen government is prepared to spend 30 million euros -lrb- $ 38.7 million -rrb- to acquire part of the european aeronautics defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- .
the northern german city-state would then hold 2 percent of the 7.5 percent stake daimlerchrysler has put up for sale . mayor jens böhrnsen and his deputy thomas röwekamp agreed on the sum monday and will make a proposal to the regional government on tuesday , a spokesman said . other german local governments over the weekend hinted that they were also interested in acquiring part of the daimlerchrysler stake , as part of a bid to keep it in german hands .
these include the city state of hamburg and the northwestern state of lower saxony .
both are , like bremen , home to eads factories or offices . support from berlin for new shareholder structure after months of protracted negotiations , german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in a newspaper interview last week that a solution had been found with regard to eads ' shareholder structure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg is home to eads company airbus berlin has long feared that france could gain the upper hand in the long-running power struggle at eads when german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler cuts its stake from 22.5 percent to 15 percent . such concerns gained more urgency from eads ' financial crisis , triggered by problems at aircraft maker airbus .
there has been speculation that france could seek to increase its stake in eads via a possible capital hike . keeping stake in german hands a top priority berlin is adamant that the 7.5-percent stake being put up for sale by daimlerchrysler remain in german hands and must not be allowed to fall under french or even russian control . but moscow is also keen to increase its say in eads after state-owned bank vneshtorgbank bought a 5.02 percent stake in september 2006 .
spanish interests are represented by the holding group sepi , which owns 5.48 percent . daimlerchrysler effectively represents german interests in the company , while france is represented via a 30 percent stake shared by the state holding company sogeade and media group lagardere . lagardere has committed itself to cutting its stake to put french interests back on a par with germany 's .
but the balance of power would be upset again if daimlerchrysler were to reduce its stake further . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deal reportedly reached on daimlerchrysler 's stake in eads agreement has finally been reached regarding the sale of part of daimlerchrysler 's stake in european aerospace giant eads , with a deal to be announced in the next two weeks , according to a german government spokesman .
-lrb- 10.01.2007 -rrb- for eads and airbus , 2006 was a year to forget the head of european aerospace giant eads said 2006 had been a very bad year indeed .
especially difficult will be getting its airplane unit , airbus , back on track in 2007 .
-lrb- 06.12.2006 -rrb- germany , daimlerchrysler close to deal on eads stake the german government and daimlerchrysler have reached agreement on " broad outlines " of a deal to allow the carmaker to sell part of its stake in european aerospace giant eads , according to a government spokesman .

both are , like bremen , home to eads factories or offices . support from berlin for new shareholder structure after months of protracted negotiations , german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in a newspaper interview last week that a solution had been found with regard to eads ' shareholder structure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg is home to eads company airbus berlin has long feared that france could gain the upper hand in the long-running power struggle at eads when german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler cuts its stake from 22.5 percent to 15 percent . such concerns gained more urgency from eads ' financial crisis , triggered by problems at aircraft maker airbus .
there has been speculation that france could seek to increase its stake in eads via a possible capital hike . keeping stake in german hands a top priority berlin is adamant that the 7.5-percent stake being put up for sale by daimlerchrysler remain in german hands and must not be allowed to fall under french or even russian control . but moscow is also keen to increase its say in eads after state-owned bank vneshtorgbank bought a 5.02 percent stake in september 2006 .
spanish interests are represented by the holding group sepi , which owns 5.48 percent . daimlerchrysler effectively represents german interests in the company , while france is represented via a 30 percent stake shared by the state holding company sogeade and media group lagardere . lagardere has committed itself to cutting its stake to put french interests back on a par with germany 's .
but the balance of power would be upset again if daimlerchrysler were to reduce its stake further . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deal reportedly reached on daimlerchrysler 's stake in eads agreement has finally been reached regarding the sale of part of daimlerchrysler 's stake in european aerospace giant eads , with a deal to be announced in the next two weeks , according to a german government spokesman .

" it 's not an overnight decision .
i have thought about it for some time , " deisler said at a news conference in munich . deisler told bayern munich general manager uli hoeness of his decision monday evening . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honess convinced deisler , center , to stay at bayern 's winter training camp " we fought for sebastian , " said hoeness .
" he is one of the best players there have ever been in germany .
i hoped to the last that it was all a nightmare . " deisler was regarded as the best player in the country of his generation , but he missed both the 2002 and 2006 world cups as a result of knee surgery . he was also absent from the soccer pitch in november 2003 and october 2004 when treated for depression . one of the outstanding players in the germany side that reached the 2005 confederations cup semi-finals , former germany coach jürgen klinsmann had planned to play him on the right of midfield at the 2006 world cup until another knee injury sidelined him for the tournament and most of the current bundesliga season . short comeback at bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deisler played in 36 national team matches deisler , who was under contract with bayern until 2009 , had made his comeback in the bundesliga before the winter break after suffering cartilage damage in his right knee in training last march . he had just played for germany in a 4-1 defeat against italy in florence on march 1 , the last of his 36 international appearances . during bayern 's training camp in dubai this month he admitted he had been close to quitting the game but said he was now fit . hoeness revealed the player had considered leaving the bayern training camp several times , finally taking the decision to quit on the return to munich . munich leaves door open " should he decide differently at some point , in several months , in a year , he has the option in his contract to return , " hoeness said .

pressure is growing on the conservative bavarian premier to step down and the repercussions could be felt in the german capital as well . the usual snow may be missing this year at the remote bavarian resort of wildbad kreuth .
but an icy wind is blowing at the closed retreat of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- currently meeting there .
the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is meeting in kreuth to discuss the future of the csu and , more importantly , its veteran state premier , edmund stoiber . stoiber is under mounting pressure to either resign or not seek re-election in 2008 .
the csu has held an absolute majority in the bavarian parliament for over 30 years .
yet support for the conservatives has dipped below 50 percent in state-wide opinion polls after it became known that his top aide had pried into the private life of csu rival and staunch stoiber critic gabriele pauli . " the consensus in the party leadership is that he must go before bavarian local elections in the spring of 2008 , " the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung said in an editorial on monday .
" it 's just that nobody wants to tell him this . " according to the opposition , it 's time for a change . " bavaria deserves better than this , " said franz maget , head of bavaria 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , who has called for immediate early elections .
" that 's why it 's time for the premier to hand in his resignation . " but stoiber put on a brave face as he arrived in kreuth on monday . " i 'm fighting for my goals , for bavaria 's success , and for the success of the csu , " stoiber said . the cdu in berlin depends on bavaria 's csu the csu holds a unique position in germany 's political landscape .
under a longtime power-sharing pact , the csu confines itself to bavaria and merkel 's cdu never seeks office inside the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel had happier days during the 2005 campaign the csu is a party outside of the cdu 's control , yet both make up a common group in the federal parliament .
this means merkel needs csu support to push through her party 's platform . but stoiber 's recent opposition to government reform plans , in particular to the healthcare system , has hurt merkel 's popularity and the two have a strained relationship .
stoiber has also been a loud critic of germany 's federalism reform , which regulates berlin 's authority over the country 's 16 states . many cdu allies have been angered by stoiber 's public criticism of merkel while she was struggling to keep a coalition with the spd on an even keel .
fears are growing in his own party that he would drag down csu candidates at local polls , as well . a bavarian premier enjoys royal benefits a state premier in munich is all but a successor to the former kings of bavaria , enjoying the use of royal palaces , dominating every aspect of administration and basking in the acclaim of the mainly catholic population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber gave pope benedict xvi the royal treatment during his visit when bavarian-born pope benedict xvi visited bavaria in september 2006 , stoiber played host at the king 's palace in munich , posing his children and grandchildren with the pontiff for an official photo . stoiber has been running bavaria - one of germany 's most prosperous regions - for almost 14 years .
in 2002 , he failed in his bid to become german chancellor , losing out to incumbent gerhard schröder in one of the narrowest votes in post-war history . then in 2005 , he wavered over joining the new coalition government in berlin as economics minister before opting to stay in bavaria .
many critics interpreted this decision to be based on stoiber 's inability to operate as freely in the big city capital as he could in his " royal surroundings " in munich . the push for power is turning into a dirty fight although the csu faction has yet to make an official decision on stoiber , several leading party politicians have been named as possible successors .
bavaria 's interior minister , günther beckstein , could become premier , with german agriculture minister horst seehofer as party chief .
but rumors of seehofer having an extramarital affair hit the german mass-circulation tabloid bild on monday , with a tuesday report claiming his girlfriend was expecting a child . bild quoted an unnamed csu functionary as its source .
now , politicians are asking who out of their own ranks would spread this rumor . the speculations about seehofer 's private life are reminiscent of similar events back in 1993 , when stoiber was battling bavaria 's premier at the time , theo waigel .
stoiber was able to win , after waigel 's affair with the professional skier irene epple was leaked to the press .
waigel married epple in 1994 and they have one son . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties set political agendas for 2007 the new year is the time when germany 's political parties meet to map out their strategies for the coming year and health and labor reforms look set to dominate the political agenda in 2007 .

pressure is growing on the conservative bavarian premier to step down and the repercussions could be felt in the german capital as well . the usual snow may be missing this year at the remote bavarian resort of wildbad kreuth .
but an icy wind is blowing at the closed retreat of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- currently meeting there .
the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is meeting in kreuth to discuss the future of the csu and , more importantly , its veteran state premier , edmund stoiber . stoiber is under mounting pressure to either resign or not seek re-election in 2008 .
the csu has held an absolute majority in the bavarian parliament for over 30 years .
yet support for the conservatives has dipped below 50 percent in state-wide opinion polls after it became known that his top aide had pried into the private life of csu rival and staunch stoiber critic gabriele pauli . " the consensus in the party leadership is that he must go before bavarian local elections in the spring of 2008 , " the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung said in an editorial on monday .
" it 's just that nobody wants to tell him this . " according to the opposition , it 's time for a change . " bavaria deserves better than this , " said franz maget , head of bavaria 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , who has called for immediate early elections .
" that 's why it 's time for the premier to hand in his resignation . " but stoiber put on a brave face as he arrived in kreuth on monday . " i 'm fighting for my goals , for bavaria 's success , and for the success of the csu , " stoiber said . the cdu in berlin depends on bavaria 's csu the csu holds a unique position in germany 's political landscape .
under a longtime power-sharing pact , the csu confines itself to bavaria and merkel 's cdu never seeks office inside the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel had happier days during the 2005 campaign the csu is a party outside of the cdu 's control , yet both make up a common group in the federal parliament .
this means merkel needs csu support to push through her party 's platform . but stoiber 's recent opposition to government reform plans , in particular to the healthcare system , has hurt merkel 's popularity and the two have a strained relationship .
stoiber has also been a loud critic of germany 's federalism reform , which regulates berlin 's authority over the country 's 16 states . many cdu allies have been angered by stoiber 's public criticism of merkel while she was struggling to keep a coalition with the spd on an even keel .
fears are growing in his own party that he would drag down csu candidates at local polls , as well . a bavarian premier enjoys royal benefits a state premier in munich is all but a successor to the former kings of bavaria , enjoying the use of royal palaces , dominating every aspect of administration and basking in the acclaim of the mainly catholic population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber gave pope benedict xvi the royal treatment during his visit when bavarian-born pope benedict xvi visited bavaria in september 2006 , stoiber played host at the king 's palace in munich , posing his children and grandchildren with the pontiff for an official photo . stoiber has been running bavaria - one of germany 's most prosperous regions - for almost 14 years .
in 2002 , he failed in his bid to become german chancellor , losing out to incumbent gerhard schröder in one of the narrowest votes in post-war history . then in 2005 , he wavered over joining the new coalition government in berlin as economics minister before opting to stay in bavaria .
many critics interpreted this decision to be based on stoiber 's inability to operate as freely in the big city capital as he could in his " royal surroundings " in munich . the push for power is turning into a dirty fight although the csu faction has yet to make an official decision on stoiber , several leading party politicians have been named as possible successors .
bavaria 's interior minister , günther beckstein , could become premier , with german agriculture minister horst seehofer as party chief .
but rumors of seehofer having an extramarital affair hit the german mass-circulation tabloid bild on monday , with a tuesday report claiming his girlfriend was expecting a child . bild quoted an unnamed csu functionary as its source .
now , politicians are asking who out of their own ranks would spread this rumor . the speculations about seehofer 's private life are reminiscent of similar events back in 1993 , when stoiber was battling bavaria 's premier at the time , theo waigel .

while environmental rights groups are concerned , german airports are eagerly awaiting a deal . it 's no longer surprising for european passengers to play cut-rate prices - sometimes under one euro -lrb- $ 1.30 -rrb- - for an international flight , and the discount airlines offering them , including ryanair , easyjet and germanwings , have managed to take over 30 percent of air traffic market share , accounting for a large part of the increase in international traffic . though pakistan , china and india are all likely to see an average passenger increase of eight percent , discount airlines make up just 10 percent of the asian market and are tightly regulated by national governments , according to the international air transport association . while other asian markets are only beginning to open their airports to regional competition , the airlines , including malaysia 's air asia x , are finding a warmer welcome in europe . 160 euros from london to hong kong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most european discounters said there is no money to be made with long-haul flights germany 's cologne / bonn airport is particularly interested in attracting the asia 's intercontinental flights . " naturally we want be in a position to become the largest ' low-cost ' airport in continental europe and become a european hub for the new ' low-cost ' long-distance carriers , " said michael garvens , head of the cologne / bonn airport . discount airline oasis , which has offered flights from london to hong kong for 160 euros , is likely to offer similarly priced cologne-hong kong fares this year , garvens added . " we have had intensive talks with oasis for two years , " he said .

pressure is growing on the conservative bavarian premier to step down and the repercussions could be felt in the german capital as well . the usual snow may be missing this year at the remote bavarian resort of wildbad kreuth .
but an icy wind is blowing at the closed retreat of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- currently meeting there .
the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is meeting in kreuth to discuss the future of the csu and , more importantly , its veteran state premier , edmund stoiber . stoiber is under mounting pressure to either resign or not seek re-election in 2008 .
the csu has held an absolute majority in the bavarian parliament for over 30 years .
yet support for the conservatives has dipped below 50 percent in state-wide opinion polls after it became known that his top aide had pried into the private life of csu rival and staunch stoiber critic gabriele pauli . " the consensus in the party leadership is that he must go before bavarian local elections in the spring of 2008 , " the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung said in an editorial on monday .
" it 's just that nobody wants to tell him this . " according to the opposition , it 's time for a change . " bavaria deserves better than this , " said franz maget , head of bavaria 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , who has called for immediate early elections .
" that 's why it 's time for the premier to hand in his resignation . " but stoiber put on a brave face as he arrived in kreuth on monday . " i 'm fighting for my goals , for bavaria 's success , and for the success of the csu , " stoiber said . the cdu in berlin depends on bavaria 's csu the csu holds a unique position in germany 's political landscape .
under a longtime power-sharing pact , the csu confines itself to bavaria and merkel 's cdu never seeks office inside the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel had happier days during the 2005 campaign the csu is a party outside of the cdu 's control , yet both make up a common group in the federal parliament .
this means merkel needs csu support to push through her party 's platform . but stoiber 's recent opposition to government reform plans , in particular to the healthcare system , has hurt merkel 's popularity and the two have a strained relationship .
stoiber has also been a loud critic of germany 's federalism reform , which regulates berlin 's authority over the country 's 16 states . many cdu allies have been angered by stoiber 's public criticism of merkel while she was struggling to keep a coalition with the spd on an even keel .

in 2002 , he failed in his bid to become german chancellor , losing out to incumbent gerhard schröder in one of the narrowest votes in post-war history . then in 2005 , he wavered over joining the new coalition government in berlin as economics minister before opting to stay in bavaria .
many critics interpreted this decision to be based on stoiber 's inability to operate as freely in the big city capital as he could in his " royal surroundings " in munich . the push for power is turning into a dirty fight although the csu faction has yet to make an official decision on stoiber , several leading party politicians have been named as possible successors .
bavaria 's interior minister , günther beckstein , could become premier , with german agriculture minister horst seehofer as party chief .
but rumors of seehofer having an extramarital affair hit the german mass-circulation tabloid bild on monday , with a tuesday report claiming his girlfriend was expecting a child . bild quoted an unnamed csu functionary as its source .
now , politicians are asking who out of their own ranks would spread this rumor . the speculations about seehofer 's private life are reminiscent of similar events back in 1993 , when stoiber was battling bavaria 's premier at the time , theo waigel .

pressure is growing on the conservative bavarian premier to step down and the repercussions could be felt in the german capital as well . the usual snow may be missing this year at the remote bavarian resort of wildbad kreuth .
but an icy wind is blowing at the closed retreat of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- currently meeting there .
the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is meeting in kreuth to discuss the future of the csu and , more importantly , its veteran state premier , edmund stoiber . stoiber is under mounting pressure to either resign or not seek re-election in 2008 .
the csu has held an absolute majority in the bavarian parliament for over 30 years .
yet support for the conservatives has dipped below 50 percent in state-wide opinion polls after it became known that his top aide had pried into the private life of csu rival and staunch stoiber critic gabriele pauli . " the consensus in the party leadership is that he must go before bavarian local elections in the spring of 2008 , " the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung said in an editorial on monday .
" it 's just that nobody wants to tell him this . " according to the opposition , it 's time for a change . " bavaria deserves better than this , " said franz maget , head of bavaria 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , who has called for immediate early elections .
" that 's why it 's time for the premier to hand in his resignation . " but stoiber put on a brave face as he arrived in kreuth on monday . " i 'm fighting for my goals , for bavaria 's success , and for the success of the csu , " stoiber said . the cdu in berlin depends on bavaria 's csu the csu holds a unique position in germany 's political landscape .
under a longtime power-sharing pact , the csu confines itself to bavaria and merkel 's cdu never seeks office inside the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel had happier days during the 2005 campaign the csu is a party outside of the cdu 's control , yet both make up a common group in the federal parliament .
this means merkel needs csu support to push through her party 's platform . but stoiber 's recent opposition to government reform plans , in particular to the healthcare system , has hurt merkel 's popularity and the two have a strained relationship .
stoiber has also been a loud critic of germany 's federalism reform , which regulates berlin 's authority over the country 's 16 states . many cdu allies have been angered by stoiber 's public criticism of merkel while she was struggling to keep a coalition with the spd on an even keel .
fears are growing in his own party that he would drag down csu candidates at local polls , as well . a bavarian premier enjoys royal benefits a state premier in munich is all but a successor to the former kings of bavaria , enjoying the use of royal palaces , dominating every aspect of administration and basking in the acclaim of the mainly catholic population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber gave pope benedict xvi the royal treatment during his visit when bavarian-born pope benedict xvi visited bavaria in september 2006 , stoiber played host at the king 's palace in munich , posing his children and grandchildren with the pontiff for an official photo . stoiber has been running bavaria - one of germany 's most prosperous regions - for almost 14 years .
in 2002 , he failed in his bid to become german chancellor , losing out to incumbent gerhard schröder in one of the narrowest votes in post-war history . then in 2005 , he wavered over joining the new coalition government in berlin as economics minister before opting to stay in bavaria .
many critics interpreted this decision to be based on stoiber 's inability to operate as freely in the big city capital as he could in his " royal surroundings " in munich . the push for power is turning into a dirty fight although the csu faction has yet to make an official decision on stoiber , several leading party politicians have been named as possible successors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aerospace -pipe- 16.01.2007 german city-state set to buy eads stake großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads has been having a bumpy ride in the past year bremen has said it is ready to buy part of the stake in european aerospace giant eads being offloaded by carmaker daimlerchrysler .
the city-state 's purchase would help meet aims to keep the shares in german hands . the bremen government is prepared to spend 30 million euros -lrb- $ 38.7 million -rrb- to acquire part of the european aeronautics defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- .
the northern german city-state would then hold 2 percent of the 7.5 percent stake daimlerchrysler has put up for sale . mayor jens böhrnsen and his deputy thomas röwekamp agreed on the sum monday and will make a proposal to the regional government on tuesday , a spokesman said . other german local governments over the weekend hinted that they were also interested in acquiring part of the daimlerchrysler stake , as part of a bid to keep it in german hands .
these include the city state of hamburg and the northwestern state of lower saxony .
both are , like bremen , home to eads factories or offices . support from berlin for new shareholder structure after months of protracted negotiations , german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in a newspaper interview last week that a solution had been found with regard to eads ' shareholder structure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg is home to eads company airbus berlin has long feared that france could gain the upper hand in the long-running power struggle at eads when german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler cuts its stake from 22.5 percent to 15 percent . such concerns gained more urgency from eads ' financial crisis , triggered by problems at aircraft maker airbus .
there has been speculation that france could seek to increase its stake in eads via a possible capital hike . keeping stake in german hands a top priority berlin is adamant that the 7.5-percent stake being put up for sale by daimlerchrysler remain in german hands and must not be allowed to fall under french or even russian control . but moscow is also keen to increase its say in eads after state-owned bank vneshtorgbank bought a 5.02 percent stake in september 2006 .
spanish interests are represented by the holding group sepi , which owns 5.48 percent . daimlerchrysler effectively represents german interests in the company , while france is represented via a 30 percent stake shared by the state holding company sogeade and media group lagardere . lagardere has committed itself to cutting its stake to put french interests back on a par with germany 's .
but the balance of power would be upset again if daimlerchrysler were to reduce its stake further . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deal reportedly reached on daimlerchrysler 's stake in eads agreement has finally been reached regarding the sale of part of daimlerchrysler 's stake in european aerospace giant eads , with a deal to be announced in the next two weeks , according to a german government spokesman .
-lrb- 10.01.2007 -rrb- for eads and airbus , 2006 was a year to forget the head of european aerospace giant eads said 2006 had been a very bad year indeed .
especially difficult will be getting its airplane unit , airbus , back on track in 2007 .
-lrb- 06.12.2006 -rrb- germany , daimlerchrysler close to deal on eads stake the german government and daimlerchrysler have reached agreement on " broad outlines " of a deal to allow the carmaker to sell part of its stake in european aerospace giant eads , according to a government spokesman .

while environmental rights groups are concerned , german airports are eagerly awaiting a deal . it 's no longer surprising for european passengers to play cut-rate prices - sometimes under one euro -lrb- $ 1.30 -rrb- - for an international flight , and the discount airlines offering them , including ryanair , easyjet and germanwings , have managed to take over 30 percent of air traffic market share , accounting for a large part of the increase in international traffic . though pakistan , china and india are all likely to see an average passenger increase of eight percent , discount airlines make up just 10 percent of the asian market and are tightly regulated by national governments , according to the international air transport association . while other asian markets are only beginning to open their airports to regional competition , the airlines , including malaysia 's air asia x , are finding a warmer welcome in europe . 160 euros from london to hong kong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most european discounters said there is no money to be made with long-haul flights germany 's cologne / bonn airport is particularly interested in attracting the asia 's intercontinental flights . " naturally we want be in a position to become the largest ' low-cost ' airport in continental europe and become a european hub for the new ' low-cost ' long-distance carriers , " said michael garvens , head of the cologne / bonn airport . discount airline oasis , which has offered flights from london to hong kong for 160 euros , is likely to offer similarly priced cologne-hong kong fares this year , garvens added . " we have had intensive talks with oasis for two years , " he said .
" it 's in place .
now the only factor is how fast oasis can get the additional airplanes . " can cheap fares be profitable ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne / bonn airport will soon host at least one asian low-cost airline still , some experts are skeptical whether the discount airlines ' business model will also make a profit when it comes to long-haul flights since the low-cost model 's profitability depends on keeping planes in the air , taking off again as soon as possible after an arrival . even though it takes longer to prepare a plane for take off after a 10-hour flight , garvens said he can still see plenty of ways for discount airlines to make a profit with long-distance flights . " the expensive costs for the large , worldwide reservation programs as well as lounges and mileage programs " all represent costs discounters would save , he said , adding that major airlines use profits on their intercontinental flights to make up for losses in continental profits that the discounters would not incur . good for the wallet , bad for the environment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are no exact figures on how much airplanes contribute to greenhouse gas emissions however , a profusion of low-cost intercontinental flights would be a nightmare scenario for environmental protection groups . already critical of growing air traffic , which is a heavy contributor to greenhouse gas emissions , sven harmeling from germanwatch , a group which looks at environmental issues , said measuring the exact effects air traffic has on the climate is difficult but that it is likely to make up between four and nine percent of man-made greenhouse emissions and is sharply increasing . he also said low-cost airlines are sending the wrong signal by implying that there is little cost involved in flying anywhere and everywhere . " we you look at the trend to introduce low-cost flights on long-distance flights , you also have to assume an increase in air traffic - that will be an extremely big climate policy problem , " he said . thomas bärthlein -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de planned berlin airport runs into rough weather again days before work begins on berlin 's long-planned international airport , a few discount carriers have strongly criticized the venture for fear they would face exorbitantly higher costs .

a berlin author is out to find the most beautiful " endangered " word in the german language - and to save other dying words from a morbid fate . new words enter the german language every day .
many of them are borrowed from english , like " blockbuster " and " brunch . "
others - like " cool " and its more german-sounding equivalent " geil " - belong to an ever changing youth culture . omissions are just as common as additions .

a berlin author is out to find the most beautiful " endangered " word in the german language - and to save other dying words from a morbid fate . new words enter the german language every day .
many of them are borrowed from english , like " blockbuster " and " brunch . "
others - like " cool " and its more german-sounding equivalent " geil " - belong to an ever changing youth culture . omissions are just as common as additions .
some words simply fall into the black hole of disuse .
some are forgotten because they no longer apply to modern life .
still others are eventually rejected for sounding old-fashioned or out-of-date . the older , and more literal " schutzmann " -lrb- protection man -rrb- has been updated as " polizist " -lrb- police officer -rrb- , for example , while " spielautomat " -lrb- slot machine -rrb- has replaced " groschengrab , " which refers to the same thing , but in a more colorful manner .
it literally means " penny grave . " endangered word list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " word doctor " mrozek has published his own lexicon of endangered words bodo mrozek , a 38-year-old author from berlin , has taken on the sisyphean task of rescuing endangered words and even trying to reinstate some of them into modern german speech . " if you grew up in the 1980s then you heard about forests being cut down and whales becoming extinct , " said mrozek in an interview with the tageszeitung .
" but no one lobbied for words and that 's why i think it 's important to take on this underestimated threat . " in his quest to find the most beautiful endangered german word , mrozek has invited the public to suggest their favorites through feb .

while many topics will eventually get an eu airing , not all issues are created equal . " every eu presidency presents a comprehensive program , but only a small amount of the content is actually new or actually written by the respective government , " said roman maruhn of munich 's center for applied policy research , explaining why the official program lists such a range of topics . but there 's one issue that is on everyone 's mind and which will likely get the much of the attention over the next six months - the moribund eu constitution .
germany 's progress on finding a compromise regarding the rejected eu constitution will be a major benchmark used to judge berlin 's success , he added . the c word bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters rejected the constitution draft in a referendum vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 , the constitutional treaty had been put on ice for a yearlong " period of reflection " and the controversial issue has begun to reappear on the european agenda as germany takes the eu 's reigns . " expectations toward the german presidency , and angela merkel in particular , are incredibly high , " said katinka barysch of the center for european reform .
" she seems to be very good at listening to people and bringing everybody on board , but whether she is really good at forging consensus - that remains to be seen .

" things can go quickly if they are well orchestrated , and i think the ambition of the german presidency to get a clear roadmap for the constitution is a realistic goal , " guerot said . germany 's geopolitical location in the middle of europe predestines the country for a role as a leader and mediator , especially since it has added european integration to its national interests since the reunification of east and west germany , maruhn said . germany is n't alone on european stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has to convince 26 other national leaders to build a consensus but when it comes to forging compromises on a european level , countries that have expressed skepticism about the treaty , including the netherlands , france , the uk and poland , also have to be willing to negotiate for any progress to be made , according to guerot . " it 's not just about what germany wants to achieve , " she added .
" germany is a key player and a big country so there are big chances to bring things together , but one should not expect germany will fix everything . " but even if germany proves unable to bridge both sides of the constitutional debate , there is a chance for berlin to book a successful presidency by concentrating on endearing the eu to its citizens by reminding them of the peace the eu brought to a war-torn continent , barysch said .

" we all believe that the death penalty is something that should be rejected , " her colleague , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , told reporters after informal talks with his and zypries ' eu counterparts in the eastern german city of dresden .
" the eu will continue to campaign for a worldwide abolition , " he stressed . italy has been pushing for a global moratorium on capital punishment since iraq executed former dictator saddam hussein two and a half weeks ago .
rome , which is currently a member of the 15-member un security council , says the 27-member eu should try to increase international support for the diplomatic bid .
botched execution a botched hanging in iraq on monday , which was condemned by european leaders , may have rallied more eu states to the cause . two of saddam hussein 's aides , his half-brother barzan ibrahim al-tikriti and former judge awad hamed al-bandar , were executed for crimes against humanity .
al-tikriti 's head was accidentally ripped off his body by the noose that hanged him .
" reports on the gruesome circumstances of -lrb- monday 's -rrb- executions are very disturbing , " said irish foreign minister dermot ahern .
" i believe it is in the interests of justice and reconciliation in iraq that the iraqi authorities now take the step of ending executions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy plans to take advantage of its seat on the un security council hours after the execution , european commission president jose manuel barroso said he backed italy 's campaign to put a stop to capital punishment .

" it 's not an overnight decision .
i have thought about it for some time , " deisler said at a news conference in munich . deisler told bayern munich general manager uli hoeness of his decision monday evening . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honess convinced deisler , center , to stay at bayern 's winter training camp " we fought for sebastian , " said hoeness .
" he is one of the best players there have ever been in germany .
i hoped to the last that it was all a nightmare . " deisler was regarded as the best player in the country of his generation , but he missed both the 2002 and 2006 world cups as a result of knee surgery . he was also absent from the soccer pitch in november 2003 and october 2004 when treated for depression . one of the outstanding players in the germany side that reached the 2005 confederations cup semi-finals , former germany coach jürgen klinsmann had planned to play him on the right of midfield at the 2006 world cup until another knee injury sidelined him for the tournament and most of the current bundesliga season . short comeback at bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deisler played in 36 national team matches deisler , who was under contract with bayern until 2009 , had made his comeback in the bundesliga before the winter break after suffering cartilage damage in his right knee in training last march . he had just played for germany in a 4-1 defeat against italy in florence on march 1 , the last of his 36 international appearances . during bayern 's training camp in dubai this month he admitted he had been close to quitting the game but said he was now fit . hoeness revealed the player had considered leaving the bayern training camp several times , finally taking the decision to quit on the return to munich . munich leaves door open " should he decide differently at some point , in several months , in a year , he has the option in his contract to return , " hoeness said .
" we have n't had a situation like this before .

while environmental rights groups are concerned , german airports are eagerly awaiting a deal . it 's no longer surprising for european passengers to play cut-rate prices - sometimes under one euro -lrb- $ 1.30 -rrb- - for an international flight , and the discount airlines offering them , including ryanair , easyjet and germanwings , have managed to take over 30 percent of air traffic market share , accounting for a large part of the increase in international traffic . though pakistan , china and india are all likely to see an average passenger increase of eight percent , discount airlines make up just 10 percent of the asian market and are tightly regulated by national governments , according to the international air transport association . while other asian markets are only beginning to open their airports to regional competition , the airlines , including malaysia 's air asia x , are finding a warmer welcome in europe . 160 euros from london to hong kong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most european discounters said there is no money to be made with long-haul flights germany 's cologne / bonn airport is particularly interested in attracting the asia 's intercontinental flights . " naturally we want be in a position to become the largest ' low-cost ' airport in continental europe and become a european hub for the new ' low-cost ' long-distance carriers , " said michael garvens , head of the cologne / bonn airport . discount airline oasis , which has offered flights from london to hong kong for 160 euros , is likely to offer similarly priced cologne-hong kong fares this year , garvens added . " we have had intensive talks with oasis for two years , " he said .
" it 's in place .
now the only factor is how fast oasis can get the additional airplanes . " can cheap fares be profitable ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne / bonn airport will soon host at least one asian low-cost airline still , some experts are skeptical whether the discount airlines ' business model will also make a profit when it comes to long-haul flights since the low-cost model 's profitability depends on keeping planes in the air , taking off again as soon as possible after an arrival . even though it takes longer to prepare a plane for take off after a 10-hour flight , garvens said he can still see plenty of ways for discount airlines to make a profit with long-distance flights . " the expensive costs for the large , worldwide reservation programs as well as lounges and mileage programs " all represent costs discounters would save , he said , adding that major airlines use profits on their intercontinental flights to make up for losses in continental profits that the discounters would not incur . good for the wallet , bad for the environment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are no exact figures on how much airplanes contribute to greenhouse gas emissions however , a profusion of low-cost intercontinental flights would be a nightmare scenario for environmental protection groups . already critical of growing air traffic , which is a heavy contributor to greenhouse gas emissions , sven harmeling from germanwatch , a group which looks at environmental issues , said measuring the exact effects air traffic has on the climate is difficult but that it is likely to make up between four and nine percent of man-made greenhouse emissions and is sharply increasing . he also said low-cost airlines are sending the wrong signal by implying that there is little cost involved in flying anywhere and everywhere . " we you look at the trend to introduce low-cost flights on long-distance flights , you also have to assume an increase in air traffic - that will be an extremely big climate policy problem , " he said . thomas bärthlein -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de planned berlin airport runs into rough weather again days before work begins on berlin 's long-planned international airport , a few discount carriers have strongly criticized the venture for fear they would face exorbitantly higher costs .

the city-state 's purchase would help meet aims to keep the shares in german hands . the bremen government is prepared to spend 30 million euros -lrb- $ 38.7 million -rrb- to acquire part of the european aeronautics defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- .
the northern german city-state would then hold 2 percent of the 7.5 percent stake daimlerchrysler has put up for sale . mayor jens böhrnsen and his deputy thomas röwekamp agreed on the sum monday and will make a proposal to the regional government on tuesday , a spokesman said . other german local governments over the weekend hinted that they were also interested in acquiring part of the daimlerchrysler stake , as part of a bid to keep it in german hands .
these include the city state of hamburg and the northwestern state of lower saxony .
both are , like bremen , home to eads factories or offices . support from berlin for new shareholder structure after months of protracted negotiations , german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in a newspaper interview last week that a solution had been found with regard to eads ' shareholder structure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg is home to eads company airbus berlin has long feared that france could gain the upper hand in the long-running power struggle at eads when german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler cuts its stake from 22.5 percent to 15 percent . such concerns gained more urgency from eads ' financial crisis , triggered by problems at aircraft maker airbus .
there has been speculation that france could seek to increase its stake in eads via a possible capital hike . keeping stake in german hands a top priority berlin is adamant that the 7.5-percent stake being put up for sale by daimlerchrysler remain in german hands and must not be allowed to fall under french or even russian control . but moscow is also keen to increase its say in eads after state-owned bank vneshtorgbank bought a 5.02 percent stake in september 2006 .
spanish interests are represented by the holding group sepi , which owns 5.48 percent . daimlerchrysler effectively represents german interests in the company , while france is represented via a 30 percent stake shared by the state holding company sogeade and media group lagardere . lagardere has committed itself to cutting its stake to put french interests back on a par with germany 's .
but the balance of power would be upset again if daimlerchrysler were to reduce its stake further . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deal reportedly reached on daimlerchrysler 's stake in eads agreement has finally been reached regarding the sale of part of daimlerchrysler 's stake in european aerospace giant eads , with a deal to be announced in the next two weeks , according to a german government spokesman .

the formal setting up of the bloc allows it various rights including receiving official funding of around one million euros -lrb- $ 770,000 -rrb- and certain speaking rights . french national front mep bruno gollnisch will lead the new far right bloc , whose founding principles include recognizing " national interests , sovereignties , identities and differences , " and opposing a " unitary , bureaucratic , european superstate . " its platform also includes commitments to christian and traditional family values . new members made it possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the eu parliament have been called upon to prevent the new group from getting senior positions the membership includes seven members of the french national front , including le pen and his daughter marine le pen .
its formation was made possible by the accession of romania and bulgaria to the eu on jan.1 , as five romanian meps have signed up as well as a bulgarian . there are also three belgian deputies from the flemish nationalist vlaams belang party , including its president franck vanhecke . the membership list also includes austrian andreas molzer , british mep ashley mote and alessandra mussolini , the granddaughter of italian wartime dictator benito mussolini . socialist group leader martin schulz immediately questioned the group 's legitimacy , asking whether it adhered to the rules of parliament which stipulate that the members of a group must share a political position . but borrell rejected the call for an enquiry into the group 's legitimacy , noting that the 20 members had all signed a political declaration . defensive moves schulz , nonetheless , called on meps to prevent the new far-right group from securing senior positions in the european parliament . immediately after the announcement of the 20-member group 's formation , schulz wrote to fellow leaders of the parliament 's democratic groups , urging them to deny the new group posts under the proportional system of appointment . " we must not abandon this parliament , which symbolizes the integration of europe , to those who deny all european values , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's most famous far-right politician , jean-marie le pen , is a member after reports that he had been described as a " totalitarian " by gollnisch , schulz said : " to be attacked by a man who is a holocaust denier and who represents the neo-fascist movement is an honor for me . " in his letter to other group leaders , schulz said that while the new group would enjoy the privileges and staffing normally given to a political group they should not be approved as vice-presidents of parliamentary committees . it is not the first time that the far-right has had a bloc in the assembly .
le pen led the group of the european right from 1984 to 1989 , and the technical group of the european right from 1989 to 1994 . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new group of eu leaders to push far-right agenda the accession of romania and bulgaria to the eu on jan .

while many topics will eventually get an eu airing , not all issues are created equal . " every eu presidency presents a comprehensive program , but only a small amount of the content is actually new or actually written by the respective government , " said roman maruhn of munich 's center for applied policy research , explaining why the official program lists such a range of topics . but there 's one issue that is on everyone 's mind and which will likely get the much of the attention over the next six months - the moribund eu constitution .
germany 's progress on finding a compromise regarding the rejected eu constitution will be a major benchmark used to judge berlin 's success , he added . the c word bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters rejected the constitution draft in a referendum vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 , the constitutional treaty had been put on ice for a yearlong " period of reflection " and the controversial issue has begun to reappear on the european agenda as germany takes the eu 's reigns . " expectations toward the german presidency , and angela merkel in particular , are incredibly high , " said katinka barysch of the center for european reform .
" she seems to be very good at listening to people and bringing everybody on board , but whether she is really good at forging consensus - that remains to be seen . " hammering out a constitutional deal will be particularly difficult for germany as it is among the treaty 's strongest supporters and is likely to be viewed as a biased mediator .

" things can go quickly if they are well orchestrated , and i think the ambition of the german presidency to get a clear roadmap for the constitution is a realistic goal , " guerot said . germany 's geopolitical location in the middle of europe predestines the country for a role as a leader and mediator , especially since it has added european integration to its national interests since the reunification of east and west germany , maruhn said . germany is n't alone on european stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has to convince 26 other national leaders to build a consensus but when it comes to forging compromises on a european level , countries that have expressed skepticism about the treaty , including the netherlands , france , the uk and poland , also have to be willing to negotiate for any progress to be made , according to guerot . " it 's not just about what germany wants to achieve , " she added .
" germany is a key player and a big country so there are big chances to bring things together , but one should not expect germany will fix everything . " but even if germany proves unable to bridge both sides of the constitutional debate , there is a chance for berlin to book a successful presidency by concentrating on endearing the eu to its citizens by reminding them of the peace the eu brought to a war-torn continent , barysch said .

while many topics will eventually get an eu airing , not all issues are created equal . " every eu presidency presents a comprehensive program , but only a small amount of the content is actually new or actually written by the respective government , " said roman maruhn of munich 's center for applied policy research , explaining why the official program lists such a range of topics . but there 's one issue that is on everyone 's mind and which will likely get the much of the attention over the next six months - the moribund eu constitution .
germany 's progress on finding a compromise regarding the rejected eu constitution will be a major benchmark used to judge berlin 's success , he added . the c word bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters rejected the constitution draft in a referendum vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 , the constitutional treaty had been put on ice for a yearlong " period of reflection " and the controversial issue has begun to reappear on the european agenda as germany takes the eu 's reigns . " expectations toward the german presidency , and angela merkel in particular , are incredibly high , " said katinka barysch of the center for european reform .
" she seems to be very good at listening to people and bringing everybody on board , but whether she is really good at forging consensus - that remains to be seen . " hammering out a constitutional deal will be particularly difficult for germany as it is among the treaty 's strongest supporters and is likely to be viewed as a biased mediator .
french elections , scheduled to be held shortly before the german presidency comes to a close , will also complicate negotiations , barysch added . a natural mediator bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if merkel will be able to unite the eu again merkel , who surprised many at her first european summit as german chancellor by brokering a deal on the bloc 's budget , could make some headway on deciding which parts of the constitution eu members are in favor of saving , according to the german marshall fund 's ulrike guerot . " things can go quickly if they are well orchestrated , and i think the ambition of the german presidency to get a clear roadmap for the constitution is a realistic goal , " guerot said . germany 's geopolitical location in the middle of europe predestines the country for a role as a leader and mediator , especially since it has added european integration to its national interests since the reunification of east and west germany , maruhn said . germany is n't alone on european stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has to convince 26 other national leaders to build a consensus but when it comes to forging compromises on a european level , countries that have expressed skepticism about the treaty , including the netherlands , france , the uk and poland , also have to be willing to negotiate for any progress to be made , according to guerot . " it 's not just about what germany wants to achieve , " she added .
" germany is a key player and a big country so there are big chances to bring things together , but one should not expect germany will fix everything . " but even if germany proves unable to bridge both sides of the constitutional debate , there is a chance for berlin to book a successful presidency by concentrating on endearing the eu to its citizens by reminding them of the peace the eu brought to a war-torn continent , barysch said .

the city-state 's purchase would help meet aims to keep the shares in german hands . the bremen government is prepared to spend 30 million euros -lrb- $ 38.7 million -rrb- to acquire part of the european aeronautics defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- .
the northern german city-state would then hold 2 percent of the 7.5 percent stake daimlerchrysler has put up for sale . mayor jens böhrnsen and his deputy thomas röwekamp agreed on the sum monday and will make a proposal to the regional government on tuesday , a spokesman said . other german local governments over the weekend hinted that they were also interested in acquiring part of the daimlerchrysler stake , as part of a bid to keep it in german hands .
these include the city state of hamburg and the northwestern state of lower saxony .
both are , like bremen , home to eads factories or offices . support from berlin for new shareholder structure after months of protracted negotiations , german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in a newspaper interview last week that a solution had been found with regard to eads ' shareholder structure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg is home to eads company airbus berlin has long feared that france could gain the upper hand in the long-running power struggle at eads when german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler cuts its stake from 22.5 percent to 15 percent . such concerns gained more urgency from eads ' financial crisis , triggered by problems at aircraft maker airbus .
there has been speculation that france could seek to increase its stake in eads via a possible capital hike . keeping stake in german hands a top priority berlin is adamant that the 7.5-percent stake being put up for sale by daimlerchrysler remain in german hands and must not be allowed to fall under french or even russian control . but moscow is also keen to increase its say in eads after state-owned bank vneshtorgbank bought a 5.02 percent stake in september 2006 .
spanish interests are represented by the holding group sepi , which owns 5.48 percent . daimlerchrysler effectively represents german interests in the company , while france is represented via a 30 percent stake shared by the state holding company sogeade and media group lagardere . lagardere has committed itself to cutting its stake to put french interests back on a par with germany 's .
but the balance of power would be upset again if daimlerchrysler were to reduce its stake further . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deal reportedly reached on daimlerchrysler 's stake in eads agreement has finally been reached regarding the sale of part of daimlerchrysler 's stake in european aerospace giant eads , with a deal to be announced in the next two weeks , according to a german government spokesman .

pressure is growing on the conservative bavarian premier to step down and the repercussions could be felt in the german capital as well . the usual snow may be missing this year at the remote bavarian resort of wildbad kreuth .
but an icy wind is blowing at the closed retreat of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- currently meeting there .
the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is meeting in kreuth to discuss the future of the csu and , more importantly , its veteran state premier , edmund stoiber . stoiber is under mounting pressure to either resign or not seek re-election in 2008 .
the csu has held an absolute majority in the bavarian parliament for over 30 years .
yet support for the conservatives has dipped below 50 percent in state-wide opinion polls after it became known that his top aide had pried into the private life of csu rival and staunch stoiber critic gabriele pauli . " the consensus in the party leadership is that he must go before bavarian local elections in the spring of 2008 , " the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung said in an editorial on monday .
" it 's just that nobody wants to tell him this . " according to the opposition , it 's time for a change . " bavaria deserves better than this , " said franz maget , head of bavaria 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , who has called for immediate early elections .
" that 's why it 's time for the premier to hand in his resignation . " but stoiber put on a brave face as he arrived in kreuth on monday . " i 'm fighting for my goals , for bavaria 's success , and for the success of the csu , " stoiber said . the cdu in berlin depends on bavaria 's csu the csu holds a unique position in germany 's political landscape .
under a longtime power-sharing pact , the csu confines itself to bavaria and merkel 's cdu never seeks office inside the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel had happier days during the 2005 campaign the csu is a party outside of the cdu 's control , yet both make up a common group in the federal parliament .
this means merkel needs csu support to push through her party 's platform . but stoiber 's recent opposition to government reform plans , in particular to the healthcare system , has hurt merkel 's popularity and the two have a strained relationship .
stoiber has also been a loud critic of germany 's federalism reform , which regulates berlin 's authority over the country 's 16 states . many cdu allies have been angered by stoiber 's public criticism of merkel while she was struggling to keep a coalition with the spd on an even keel .
fears are growing in his own party that he would drag down csu candidates at local polls , as well . a bavarian premier enjoys royal benefits a state premier in munich is all but a successor to the former kings of bavaria , enjoying the use of royal palaces , dominating every aspect of administration and basking in the acclaim of the mainly catholic population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber gave pope benedict xvi the royal treatment during his visit when bavarian-born pope benedict xvi visited bavaria in september 2006 , stoiber played host at the king 's palace in munich , posing his children and grandchildren with the pontiff for an official photo . stoiber has been running bavaria - one of germany 's most prosperous regions - for almost 14 years .
in 2002 , he failed in his bid to become german chancellor , losing out to incumbent gerhard schröder in one of the narrowest votes in post-war history . then in 2005 , he wavered over joining the new coalition government in berlin as economics minister before opting to stay in bavaria .
many critics interpreted this decision to be based on stoiber 's inability to operate as freely in the big city capital as he could in his " royal surroundings " in munich . the push for power is turning into a dirty fight although the csu faction has yet to make an official decision on stoiber , several leading party politicians have been named as possible successors .
bavaria 's interior minister , günther beckstein , could become premier , with german agriculture minister horst seehofer as party chief .
but rumors of seehofer having an extramarital affair hit the german mass-circulation tabloid bild on monday , with a tuesday report claiming his girlfriend was expecting a child . bild quoted an unnamed csu functionary as its source .
now , politicians are asking who out of their own ranks would spread this rumor . the speculations about seehofer 's private life are reminiscent of similar events back in 1993 , when stoiber was battling bavaria 's premier at the time , theo waigel .
stoiber was able to win , after waigel 's affair with the professional skier irene epple was leaked to the press .

the formal setting up of the bloc allows it various rights including receiving official funding of around one million euros -lrb- $ 770,000 -rrb- and certain speaking rights . french national front mep bruno gollnisch will lead the new far right bloc , whose founding principles include recognizing " national interests , sovereignties , identities and differences , " and opposing a " unitary , bureaucratic , european superstate .

" its platform also includes commitments to christian and traditional family values . new members made it possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the eu parliament have been called upon to prevent the new group from getting senior positions the membership includes seven members of the french national front , including le pen and his daughter marine le pen .
its formation was made possible by the accession of romania and bulgaria to the eu on jan.1 , as five romanian meps have signed up as well as a bulgarian . there are also three belgian deputies from the flemish nationalist vlaams belang party , including its president franck vanhecke . the membership list also includes austrian andreas molzer , british mep ashley mote and alessandra mussolini , the granddaughter of italian wartime dictator benito mussolini . socialist group leader martin schulz immediately questioned the group 's legitimacy , asking whether it adhered to the rules of parliament which stipulate that the members of a group must share a political position . but borrell rejected the call for an enquiry into the group 's legitimacy , noting that the 20 members had all signed a political declaration . defensive moves schulz , nonetheless , called on meps to prevent the new far-right group from securing senior positions in the european parliament . immediately after the announcement of the 20-member group 's formation , schulz wrote to fellow leaders of the parliament 's democratic groups , urging them to deny the new group posts under the proportional system of appointment . " we must not abandon this parliament , which symbolizes the integration of europe , to those who deny all european values , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's most famous far-right politician , jean-marie le pen , is a member after reports that he had been described as a " totalitarian " by gollnisch , schulz said : " to be attacked by a man who is a holocaust denier and who represents the neo-fascist movement is an honor for me . " in his letter to other group leaders , schulz said that while the new group would enjoy the privileges and staffing normally given to a political group they should not be approved as vice-presidents of parliamentary committees . it is not the first time that the far-right has had a bloc in the assembly .

pressure is growing on the conservative bavarian premier to step down and the repercussions could be felt in the german capital as well . the usual snow may be missing this year at the remote bavarian resort of wildbad kreuth .
but an icy wind is blowing at the closed retreat of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- currently meeting there .
the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is meeting in kreuth to discuss the future of the csu and , more importantly , its veteran state premier , edmund stoiber . stoiber is under mounting pressure to either resign or not seek re-election in 2008 .
the csu has held an absolute majority in the bavarian parliament for over 30 years .
yet support for the conservatives has dipped below 50 percent in state-wide opinion polls after it became known that his top aide had pried into the private life of csu rival and staunch stoiber critic gabriele pauli . " the consensus in the party leadership is that he must go before bavarian local elections in the spring of 2008 , " the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung said in an editorial on monday .
" it 's just that nobody wants to tell him this . " according to the opposition , it 's time for a change . " bavaria deserves better than this , " said franz maget , head of bavaria 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , who has called for immediate early elections .
" that 's why it 's time for the premier to hand in his resignation . " but stoiber put on a brave face as he arrived in kreuth on monday . " i 'm fighting for my goals , for bavaria 's success , and for the success of the csu , " stoiber said . the cdu in berlin depends on bavaria 's csu the csu holds a unique position in germany 's political landscape .
under a longtime power-sharing pact , the csu confines itself to bavaria and merkel 's cdu never seeks office inside the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel had happier days during the 2005 campaign the csu is a party outside of the cdu 's control , yet both make up a common group in the federal parliament .
this means merkel needs csu support to push through her party 's platform . but stoiber 's recent opposition to government reform plans , in particular to the healthcare system , has hurt merkel 's popularity and the two have a strained relationship .
stoiber has also been a loud critic of germany 's federalism reform , which regulates berlin 's authority over the country 's 16 states . many cdu allies have been angered by stoiber 's public criticism of merkel while she was struggling to keep a coalition with the spd on an even keel .
fears are growing in his own party that he would drag down csu candidates at local polls , as well . a bavarian premier enjoys royal benefits a state premier in munich is all but a successor to the former kings of bavaria , enjoying the use of royal palaces , dominating every aspect of administration and basking in the acclaim of the mainly catholic population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber gave pope benedict xvi the royal treatment during his visit when bavarian-born pope benedict xvi visited bavaria in september 2006 , stoiber played host at the king 's palace in munich , posing his children and grandchildren with the pontiff for an official photo . stoiber has been running bavaria - one of germany 's most prosperous regions - for almost 14 years .
in 2002 , he failed in his bid to become german chancellor , losing out to incumbent gerhard schröder in one of the narrowest votes in post-war history . then in 2005 , he wavered over joining the new coalition government in berlin as economics minister before opting to stay in bavaria .
many critics interpreted this decision to be based on stoiber 's inability to operate as freely in the big city capital as he could in his " royal surroundings " in munich . the push for power is turning into a dirty fight although the csu faction has yet to make an official decision on stoiber , several leading party politicians have been named as possible successors .
bavaria 's interior minister , günther beckstein , could become premier , with german agriculture minister horst seehofer as party chief .
but rumors of seehofer having an extramarital affair hit the german mass-circulation tabloid bild on monday , with a tuesday report claiming his girlfriend was expecting a child . bild quoted an unnamed csu functionary as its source .

while environmental rights groups are concerned , german airports are eagerly awaiting a deal . it 's no longer surprising for european passengers to play cut-rate prices - sometimes under one euro -lrb- $ 1.30 -rrb- - for an international flight , and the discount airlines offering them , including ryanair , easyjet and germanwings , have managed to take over 30 percent of air traffic market share , accounting for a large part of the increase in international traffic . though pakistan , china and india are all likely to see an average passenger increase of eight percent , discount airlines make up just 10 percent of the asian market and are tightly regulated by national governments , according to the international air transport association . while other asian markets are only beginning to open their airports to regional competition , the airlines , including malaysia 's air asia x , are finding a warmer welcome in europe . 160 euros from london to hong kong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most european discounters said there is no money to be made with long-haul flights germany 's cologne / bonn airport is particularly interested in attracting the asia 's intercontinental flights .

" we have had intensive talks with oasis for two years , " he said .

now the only factor is how fast oasis can get the additional airplanes .

" the expensive costs for the large , worldwide reservation programs as well as lounges and mileage programs " all represent costs discounters would save , he said , adding that major airlines use profits on their intercontinental flights to make up for losses in continental profits that the discounters would not incur . good for the wallet , bad for the environment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are no exact figures on how much airplanes contribute to greenhouse gas emissions however , a profusion of low-cost intercontinental flights would be a nightmare scenario for environmental protection groups . already critical of growing air traffic , which is a heavy contributor to greenhouse gas emissions , sven harmeling from germanwatch , a group which looks at environmental issues , said measuring the exact effects air traffic has on the climate is difficult but that it is likely to make up between four and nine percent of man-made greenhouse emissions and is sharply increasing . he also said low-cost airlines are sending the wrong signal by implying that there is little cost involved in flying anywhere and everywhere .

" it 's not an overnight decision .
i have thought about it for some time , " deisler said at a news conference in munich . deisler told bayern munich general manager uli hoeness of his decision monday evening . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honess convinced deisler , center , to stay at bayern 's winter training camp " we fought for sebastian , " said hoeness .
" he is one of the best players there have ever been in germany .
i hoped to the last that it was all a nightmare . " deisler was regarded as the best player in the country of his generation , but he missed both the 2002 and 2006 world cups as a result of knee surgery . he was also absent from the soccer pitch in november 2003 and october 2004 when treated for depression . one of the outstanding players in the germany side that reached the 2005 confederations cup semi-finals , former germany coach jürgen klinsmann had planned to play him on the right of midfield at the 2006 world cup until another knee injury sidelined him for the tournament and most of the current bundesliga season . short comeback at bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deisler played in 36 national team matches deisler , who was under contract with bayern until 2009 , had made his comeback in the bundesliga before the winter break after suffering cartilage damage in his right knee in training last march . he had just played for germany in a 4-1 defeat against italy in florence on march 1 , the last of his 36 international appearances . during bayern 's training camp in dubai this month he admitted he had been close to quitting the game but said he was now fit . hoeness revealed the player had considered leaving the bayern training camp several times , finally taking the decision to quit on the return to munich . munich leaves door open " should he decide differently at some point , in several months , in a year , he has the option in his contract to return , " hoeness said .

" we are going to make an inventory of our laws ... to come up with the best policy examples , " said german justice minister brigitte zypries on tuesday , following a meeting with her eu colleagues in dresden , eastern germany . " each member state will decide which video games are violent , " said eu justice commissioner franco frattini .
" it 's not up to brussels to decide . "
" but the protection of children can not have borders , " he added , calling for action from the creators and producers of violent video games .
" prevention is better than repression . " frattini said the current self-regulating system used by the industry to classify videos according to levels of sex and violence was failing .
it has been in effect in 14 eu countries since 2003 . " the weakness of the self-control system is the lack of control when selling video games .
it is very difficult to check the identity -lrb- and age -rrb- of the young people who are buying the video games .
retailers should be liable to punitive measures , " he added , calling on the 27 eu nations to increase their controls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : games sold over the counter can be controlled to some extent frattini said he remained convinced there was a link between violent videos and violence in society , though he admitted experts remained divided on the subject .
" like banning rain " last november , frattini highlighted one newly available video game , " the rule of rose , " as an example of why action was required .
the game depicted physical and psychological violence meted out on a young girl .
controversy in britain led the games publisher , 505 games , to keep it off store shelves . during their debate the justice ministers watched an extract of " manhunt , " a violent game for adults which has been a big hit on the internet . the debate came to life again in germany in late november after an 18-year-old , said to be an avid computer game player , opened fire at his old school and injured several people before killing himself . the german state of bavaria is now seeking to modify federal law , already one of the strongest in europe , to explicitly ban violent computer games , even on the internet . but the federal justice minister said that a ban on web-based games was very unlikely to happen .

a berlin author is out to find the most beautiful " endangered " word in the german language - and to save other dying words from a morbid fate . new words enter the german language every day .
many of them are borrowed from english , like " blockbuster " and " brunch . "
others - like " cool " and its more german-sounding equivalent " geil " - belong to an ever changing youth culture . omissions are just as common as additions .
some words simply fall into the black hole of disuse .
some are forgotten because they no longer apply to modern life .
still others are eventually rejected for sounding old-fashioned or out-of-date . the older , and more literal " schutzmann " -lrb- protection man -rrb- has been updated as " polizist " -lrb- police officer -rrb- , for example , while " spielautomat " -lrb- slot machine -rrb- has replaced " groschengrab , " which refers to the same thing , but in a more colorful manner .
it literally means " penny grave . " endangered word list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " word doctor " mrozek has published his own lexicon of endangered words bodo mrozek , a 38-year-old author from berlin , has taken on the sisyphean task of rescuing endangered words and even trying to reinstate some of them into modern german speech . " if you grew up in the 1980s then you heard about forests being cut down and whales becoming extinct , " said mrozek in an interview with the tageszeitung .
" but no one lobbied for words and that 's why i think it 's important to take on this underestimated threat . " in his quest to find the most beautiful endangered german word , mrozek has invited the public to suggest their favorites through feb .
28 , 2007 . the person who submits the winning word , selected by a panel of five well-known german authors , will receive a trophy shaped like a cheeseball adorned with toothpicks .
in german this party appetizer is called a " käseigel , " which literally means " cheese hedgehog " and , appropriately , is among the many endangered words mrozek is lobbying for . so far , 25,000 words have been submitted , 800 of which have made it to mrozek 's so-called red list of endangered words . english less threatened according to mrozek , german words are in greater danger than their english counterparts . germany 's authoritative duden lexicon is content to let words slip through the linguistic cracks .
it simply omits those that have fallen out of use , mrozek told tageszeitung . the oxford english dictionary , on the other hand , sees itself as a documenter of the english language and still contains words from shakespeare 's time , added the author . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does old have to mean old-fashioned ?
trend-setting with old-fashioned words mrozek says he hopes that lost words can be rejuvenated if people overcome feelings of being " uncool " and start using them again . while mrozek 's efforts to solicit submissions has met with success , it will likely be more difficult to convince people to invite their friends to " gabelsfrüstück " -lrb- literally , fork breakfast -rrb- instead of " brunch " or to come along to the local cinema on friday night for the lastest hollywood " kassenschlager " -lrb- literally , cash register hitter -rrb- instead of a " blockbuster . " to some , the older german version sounds a bit too folksy .
in a country where patriotism is still equated with nationalism , some german-speakers are concerned about sounding too german - even right-wing - and not international enough . for those words that ca n't be resuscitated , a graveyard could be constructed , said mrozek .
it would have to be in an endangered area , such as in a derelict town in eastern germany or a run-down industrial park in western germany .
and the craftsmen , whose professions are likewise endangered , would use endangered tools to fashion gravestones for the words that have passed out of the standard vocabulary and into word heaven . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when german words travel , our zeitgeist goes oom-pah-pah why do finnish buses take coffee breaks ?

it 's because they use words of german origin , sometimes without even realizing it .

the formal setting up of the bloc allows it various rights including receiving official funding of around one million euros -lrb- $ 770,000 -rrb- and certain speaking rights . french national front mep bruno gollnisch will lead the new far right bloc , whose founding principles include recognizing " national interests , sovereignties , identities and differences , " and opposing a " unitary , bureaucratic , european superstate . " its platform also includes commitments to christian and traditional family values . new members made it possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the eu parliament have been called upon to prevent the new group from getting senior positions the membership includes seven members of the french national front , including le pen and his daughter marine le pen .
its formation was made possible by the accession of romania and bulgaria to the eu on jan.1 , as five romanian meps have signed up as well as a bulgarian . there are also three belgian deputies from the flemish nationalist vlaams belang party , including its president franck vanhecke . the membership list also includes austrian andreas molzer , british mep ashley mote and alessandra mussolini , the granddaughter of italian wartime dictator benito mussolini . socialist group leader martin schulz immediately questioned the group 's legitimacy , asking whether it adhered to the rules of parliament which stipulate that the members of a group must share a political position . but borrell rejected the call for an enquiry into the group 's legitimacy , noting that the 20 members had all signed a political declaration . defensive moves schulz , nonetheless , called on meps to prevent the new far-right group from securing senior positions in the european parliament . immediately after the announcement of the 20-member group 's formation , schulz wrote to fellow leaders of the parliament 's democratic groups , urging them to deny the new group posts under the proportional system of appointment . " we must not abandon this parliament , which symbolizes the integration of europe , to those who deny all european values , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's most famous far-right politician , jean-marie le pen , is a member after reports that he had been described as a " totalitarian " by gollnisch , schulz said : " to be attacked by a man who is a holocaust denier and who represents the neo-fascist movement is an honor for me . " in his letter to other group leaders , schulz said that while the new group would enjoy the privileges and staffing normally given to a political group they should not be approved as vice-presidents of parliamentary committees . it is not the first time that the far-right has had a bloc in the assembly .
le pen led the group of the european right from 1984 to 1989 , and the technical group of the european right from 1989 to 1994 . dw staff / afp -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de new group of eu leaders to push far-right agenda the accession of romania and bulgaria to the eu on jan .

28 , 2007 . the person who submits the winning word , selected by a panel of five well-known german authors , will receive a trophy shaped like a cheeseball adorned with toothpicks .
in german this party appetizer is called a " käseigel , " which literally means " cheese hedgehog " and , appropriately , is among the many endangered words mrozek is lobbying for . so far , 25,000 words have been submitted , 800 of which have made it to mrozek 's so-called red list of endangered words . english less threatened according to mrozek , german words are in greater danger than their english counterparts . germany 's authoritative duden lexicon is content to let words slip through the linguistic cracks .
it simply omits those that have fallen out of use , mrozek told tageszeitung . the oxford english dictionary , on the other hand , sees itself as a documenter of the english language and still contains words from shakespeare 's time , added the author . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does old have to mean old-fashioned ?
trend-setting with old-fashioned words mrozek says he hopes that lost words can be rejuvenated if people overcome feelings of being " uncool " and start using them again . while mrozek 's efforts to solicit submissions has met with success , it will likely be more difficult to convince people to invite their friends to " gabelsfrüstück " -lrb- literally , fork breakfast -rrb- instead of " brunch " or to come along to the local cinema on friday night for the lastest hollywood " kassenschlager " -lrb- literally , cash register hitter -rrb- instead of a " blockbuster . " to some , the older german version sounds a bit too folksy .
in a country where patriotism is still equated with nationalism , some german-speakers are concerned about sounding too german - even right-wing - and not international enough . for those words that ca n't be resuscitated , a graveyard could be constructed , said mrozek .
it would have to be in an endangered area , such as in a derelict town in eastern germany or a run-down industrial park in western germany .
and the craftsmen , whose professions are likewise endangered , would use endangered tools to fashion gravestones for the words that have passed out of the standard vocabulary and into word heaven . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when german words travel , our zeitgeist goes oom-pah-pah why do finnish buses take coffee breaks ?

" it 's not an overnight decision .
i have thought about it for some time , " deisler said at a news conference in munich . deisler told bayern munich general manager uli hoeness of his decision monday evening . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honess convinced deisler , center , to stay at bayern 's winter training camp " we fought for sebastian , " said hoeness .
" he is one of the best players there have ever been in germany .
i hoped to the last that it was all a nightmare . " deisler was regarded as the best player in the country of his generation , but he missed both the 2002 and 2006 world cups as a result of knee surgery . he was also absent from the soccer pitch in november 2003 and october 2004 when treated for depression . one of the outstanding players in the germany side that reached the 2005 confederations cup semi-finals , former germany coach jürgen klinsmann had planned to play him on the right of midfield at the 2006 world cup until another knee injury sidelined him for the tournament and most of the current bundesliga season . short comeback at bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deisler played in 36 national team matches deisler , who was under contract with bayern until 2009 , had made his comeback in the bundesliga before the winter break after suffering cartilage damage in his right knee in training last march . he had just played for germany in a 4-1 defeat against italy in florence on march 1 , the last of his 36 international appearances . during bayern 's training camp in dubai this month he admitted he had been close to quitting the game but said he was now fit . hoeness revealed the player had considered leaving the bayern training camp several times , finally taking the decision to quit on the return to munich . munich leaves door open " should he decide differently at some point , in several months , in a year , he has the option in his contract to return , " hoeness said .
" we have n't had a situation like this before .
now we have to assume that sebastian is quitting soccer .
that 's a fact . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann hoped deisler could have been a bigger part of the world cup team deisler played just 135 bundesliga games , for borussia mönchengladbach , where his career began , hertha berlin and bayern munich .
there were just 62 league games for bayern since joining the club for some nine million euros -lrb- $ 11.6 million -rrb- after the 2002 world cup . his only major tournament was the 2000 european championships at which he appeared after making his international debut in february of that year against holland . his decision to turn his back on the game is now likely to intensify bayern 's activities in the transfer market .
the german champions are reported to be interested in signing the french midfielder franck ribery from olympique marseille . bayern were also linked earlier this week with chelsea 's dutch winger arjen robben , but hoeness has so far refused to confirm the reports . germany taken by surprise soccer personalities in germany reacted with surprise and sorrow at deisler 's decision . germany coach joachim löw said : " i am extremely sorry that a player of his outstanding abilities has had to end his career in this way .
it is very regrettable for german soccer . " former germany coach rudi völler , who took charge of the national team after the 2000 european championships until stepping down after euro 2004 , said he was shocked at the decision . " i can hardly believe it .

" we all believe that the death penalty is something that should be rejected , " her colleague , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , told reporters after informal talks with his and zypries ' eu counterparts in the eastern german city of dresden .
" the eu will continue to campaign for a worldwide abolition , " he stressed . italy has been pushing for a global moratorium on capital punishment since iraq executed former dictator saddam hussein two and a half weeks ago .
rome , which is currently a member of the 15-member un security council , says the 27-member eu should try to increase international support for the diplomatic bid .
botched execution a botched hanging in iraq on monday , which was condemned by european leaders , may have rallied more eu states to the cause . two of saddam hussein 's aides , his half-brother barzan ibrahim al-tikriti and former judge awad hamed al-bandar , were executed for crimes against humanity .
al-tikriti 's head was accidentally ripped off his body by the noose that hanged him .
" reports on the gruesome circumstances of -lrb- monday 's -rrb- executions are very disturbing , " said irish foreign minister dermot ahern .
" i believe it is in the interests of justice and reconciliation in iraq that the iraqi authorities now take the step of ending executions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy plans to take advantage of its seat on the un security council hours after the execution , european commission president jose manuel barroso said he backed italy 's campaign to put a stop to capital punishment .
" i believe in our european values and i take this occasion to thank italy for all the initiatives that it announced so that , in the framework of the united nations , we can work together to put an end to the death penalty . " the hangings in iraq were carried out despite international appeals to halt them , including from un secretary general ban ki-moon , the eu and human rights groups that argued the trial was flawed and unfair . experts say influential eu members , such as germany , will be unwilling to irk the united states and other commercial partners such as iran and china , which back the death penalty . capital punishment is banned in the eu , but continues to be permitted in 68 other countries . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stiff eu opposition to death penalty ahead of iraq executions as the eu underlined its opposition to the death penalty in the wake of the botched killing of saddam hussein , a pan-european human rights watchdog has appealed to iraq to stop all further executions .

" we are going to make an inventory of our laws ... to come up with the best policy examples , " said german justice minister brigitte zypries on tuesday , following a meeting with her eu colleagues in dresden , eastern germany . " each member state will decide which video games are violent , " said eu justice commissioner franco frattini .
" it 's not up to brussels to decide . "
" but the protection of children can not have borders , " he added , calling for action from the creators and producers of violent video games .
" prevention is better than repression . " frattini said the current self-regulating system used by the industry to classify videos according to levels of sex and violence was failing .
it has been in effect in 14 eu countries since 2003 . " the weakness of the self-control system is the lack of control when selling video games .
it is very difficult to check the identity -lrb- and age -rrb- of the young people who are buying the video games .
retailers should be liable to punitive measures , " he added , calling on the 27 eu nations to increase their controls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : games sold over the counter can be controlled to some extent frattini said he remained convinced there was a link between violent videos and violence in society , though he admitted experts remained divided on the subject .
" like banning rain " last november , frattini highlighted one newly available video game , " the rule of rose , " as an example of why action was required .
the game depicted physical and psychological violence meted out on a young girl .
controversy in britain led the games publisher , 505 games , to keep it off store shelves . during their debate the justice ministers watched an extract of " manhunt , " a violent game for adults which has been a big hit on the internet . the debate came to life again in germany in late november after an 18-year-old , said to be an avid computer game player , opened fire at his old school and injured several people before killing himself . the german state of bavaria is now seeking to modify federal law , already one of the strongest in europe , to explicitly ban violent computer games , even on the internet . but the federal justice minister said that a ban on web-based games was very unlikely to happen . " you ca n't ban games on the internet , " said zypries on tuesday .
" it 's like trying to ban the rain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de political parties -pipe- 16.01.2007 top german politician facing pressure to resign as state premier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's days as an attack dog of german politics appear numbered the chair of long-time german powerbroker edmund stoiber is wobbling .
pressure is growing on the conservative bavarian premier to step down and the repercussions could be felt in the german capital as well . the usual snow may be missing this year at the remote bavarian resort of wildbad kreuth .
but an icy wind is blowing at the closed retreat of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- currently meeting there .
the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is meeting in kreuth to discuss the future of the csu and , more importantly , its veteran state premier , edmund stoiber . stoiber is under mounting pressure to either resign or not seek re-election in 2008 .
the csu has held an absolute majority in the bavarian parliament for over 30 years .
yet support for the conservatives has dipped below 50 percent in state-wide opinion polls after it became known that his top aide had pried into the private life of csu rival and staunch stoiber critic gabriele pauli . " the consensus in the party leadership is that he must go before bavarian local elections in the spring of 2008 , " the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung said in an editorial on monday .
" it 's just that nobody wants to tell him this . " according to the opposition , it 's time for a change . " bavaria deserves better than this , " said franz maget , head of bavaria 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , who has called for immediate early elections .
" that 's why it 's time for the premier to hand in his resignation . " but stoiber put on a brave face as he arrived in kreuth on monday . " i 'm fighting for my goals , for bavaria 's success , and for the success of the csu , " stoiber said . the cdu in berlin depends on bavaria 's csu the csu holds a unique position in germany 's political landscape .
under a longtime power-sharing pact , the csu confines itself to bavaria and merkel 's cdu never seeks office inside the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel had happier days during the 2005 campaign the csu is a party outside of the cdu 's control , yet both make up a common group in the federal parliament .
this means merkel needs csu support to push through her party 's platform . but stoiber 's recent opposition to government reform plans , in particular to the healthcare system , has hurt merkel 's popularity and the two have a strained relationship .
stoiber has also been a loud critic of germany 's federalism reform , which regulates berlin 's authority over the country 's 16 states . many cdu allies have been angered by stoiber 's public criticism of merkel while she was struggling to keep a coalition with the spd on an even keel .
fears are growing in his own party that he would drag down csu candidates at local polls , as well . a bavarian premier enjoys royal benefits a state premier in munich is all but a successor to the former kings of bavaria , enjoying the use of royal palaces , dominating every aspect of administration and basking in the acclaim of the mainly catholic population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber gave pope benedict xvi the royal treatment during his visit when bavarian-born pope benedict xvi visited bavaria in september 2006 , stoiber played host at the king 's palace in munich , posing his children and grandchildren with the pontiff for an official photo . stoiber has been running bavaria - one of germany 's most prosperous regions - for almost 14 years .
in 2002 , he failed in his bid to become german chancellor , losing out to incumbent gerhard schröder in one of the narrowest votes in post-war history . then in 2005 , he wavered over joining the new coalition government in berlin as economics minister before opting to stay in bavaria .
many critics interpreted this decision to be based on stoiber 's inability to operate as freely in the big city capital as he could in his " royal surroundings " in munich . the push for power is turning into a dirty fight although the csu faction has yet to make an official decision on stoiber , several leading party politicians have been named as possible successors .
bavaria 's interior minister , günther beckstein , could become premier , with german agriculture minister horst seehofer as party chief .
but rumors of seehofer having an extramarital affair hit the german mass-circulation tabloid bild on monday , with a tuesday report claiming his girlfriend was expecting a child . bild quoted an unnamed csu functionary as its source .

the city-state 's purchase would help meet aims to keep the shares in german hands . the bremen government is prepared to spend 30 million euros -lrb- $ 38.7 million -rrb- to acquire part of the european aeronautics defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- .
the northern german city-state would then hold 2 percent of the 7.5 percent stake daimlerchrysler has put up for sale . mayor jens böhrnsen and his deputy thomas röwekamp agreed on the sum monday and will make a proposal to the regional government on tuesday , a spokesman said . other german local governments over the weekend hinted that they were also interested in acquiring part of the daimlerchrysler stake , as part of a bid to keep it in german hands .
these include the city state of hamburg and the northwestern state of lower saxony .
both are , like bremen , home to eads factories or offices . support from berlin for new shareholder structure after months of protracted negotiations , german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in a newspaper interview last week that a solution had been found with regard to eads ' shareholder structure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg is home to eads company airbus berlin has long feared that france could gain the upper hand in the long-running power struggle at eads when german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler cuts its stake from 22.5 percent to 15 percent . such concerns gained more urgency from eads ' financial crisis , triggered by problems at aircraft maker airbus .
there has been speculation that france could seek to increase its stake in eads via a possible capital hike . keeping stake in german hands a top priority berlin is adamant that the 7.5-percent stake being put up for sale by daimlerchrysler remain in german hands and must not be allowed to fall under french or even russian control . but moscow is also keen to increase its say in eads after state-owned bank vneshtorgbank bought a 5.02 percent stake in september 2006 .
spanish interests are represented by the holding group sepi , which owns 5.48 percent . daimlerchrysler effectively represents german interests in the company , while france is represented via a 30 percent stake shared by the state holding company sogeade and media group lagardere . lagardere has committed itself to cutting its stake to put french interests back on a par with germany 's .
but the balance of power would be upset again if daimlerchrysler were to reduce its stake further . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deal reportedly reached on daimlerchrysler 's stake in eads agreement has finally been reached regarding the sale of part of daimlerchrysler 's stake in european aerospace giant eads , with a deal to be announced in the next two weeks , according to a german government spokesman .

" but we wanted to put some life in the numbers and present viewers with what is coming for our society when a stop is not put to this negative trend . " the series has been hailed as a success by german mass-market daily bild , which called the docu-thriller an " outcry " and " the most impressive television series of the year because it , unfortunately , could become true . " while praising the broadcaster for making germany 's demographic debate more appetizing with the help of a conspiracy plot and healthy dose of science fiction , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung criticized the film for taking into account changes in the elderly population but presenting younger generations exactly as they are today .
" -lrb- the youth -rrb- will be different , " the daily wrote .
" the unification of family and work will be among the key questions for companies since in the next decade women will be desperately needed at the workplace . "
the paper added that an " evolutionary , not revolutionary " process is more likely to take place in german society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most elderly in the series struggle just to survive but die tageszeitung questions whether the division of retirees who are forced to rob pharmacies for drugs that are n't covered by meager insurance polices while others live in luxurious health center penthouses is actually a realistic vision of the future .
" ' the uprising of the elderly ' is a success as a movie ; it 's exciting , entertaining and brings to mind science fiction classics like ' solvent green ' with shocking twists , " the paper wrote .
" but zdf wants more .
the film should ' enlighten , ' ' awaken ' and ' show what is waiting for us , ' but it does n't do that as the film 's political dimensions range from polemic to flat . " munich 's süddeutsche zeitung reported that zdf 's decision to portray the series as a documentary instead of a film is an attempt to prove the producers ' view of the future is true .
" the really curious part is then at the end the documentary has become less believable than the movie could have been , " the paper wrote . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german population plunge expected germany 's population will drop by as much as 12 million by 2050 due to low birth rates , according to an official forecast released tuesday .

while many topics will eventually get an eu airing , not all issues are created equal . " every eu presidency presents a comprehensive program , but only a small amount of the content is actually new or actually written by the respective government , " said roman maruhn of munich 's center for applied policy research , explaining why the official program lists such a range of topics . but there 's one issue that is on everyone 's mind and which will likely get the much of the attention over the next six months - the moribund eu constitution .
germany 's progress on finding a compromise regarding the rejected eu constitution will be a major benchmark used to judge berlin 's success , he added . the c word bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters rejected the constitution draft in a referendum vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 , the constitutional treaty had been put on ice for a yearlong " period of reflection " and the controversial issue has begun to reappear on the european agenda as germany takes the eu 's reigns . " expectations toward the german presidency , and angela merkel in particular , are incredibly high , " said katinka barysch of the center for european reform .
" she seems to be very good at listening to people and bringing everybody on board , but whether she is really good at forging consensus - that remains to be seen . " hammering out a constitutional deal will be particularly difficult for germany as it is among the treaty 's strongest supporters and is likely to be viewed as a biased mediator .
french elections , scheduled to be held shortly before the german presidency comes to a close , will also complicate negotiations , barysch added . a natural mediator bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if merkel will be able to unite the eu again merkel , who surprised many at her first european summit as german chancellor by brokering a deal on the bloc 's budget , could make some headway on deciding which parts of the constitution eu members are in favor of saving , according to the german marshall fund 's ulrike guerot . " things can go quickly if they are well orchestrated , and i think the ambition of the german presidency to get a clear roadmap for the constitution is a realistic goal , " guerot said . germany 's geopolitical location in the middle of europe predestines the country for a role as a leader and mediator , especially since it has added european integration to its national interests since the reunification of east and west germany , maruhn said . germany is n't alone on european stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has to convince 26 other national leaders to build a consensus but when it comes to forging compromises on a european level , countries that have expressed skepticism about the treaty , including the netherlands , france , the uk and poland , also have to be willing to negotiate for any progress to be made , according to guerot . " it 's not just about what germany wants to achieve , " she added .
" germany is a key player and a big country so there are big chances to bring things together , but one should not expect germany will fix everything . " but even if germany proves unable to bridge both sides of the constitutional debate , there is a chance for berlin to book a successful presidency by concentrating on endearing the eu to its citizens by reminding them of the peace the eu brought to a war-torn continent , barysch said . " what the germans could achieve is a turnaround in the atmospherics in the eu , " she said .

while many topics will eventually get an eu airing , not all issues are created equal . " every eu presidency presents a comprehensive program , but only a small amount of the content is actually new or actually written by the respective government , " said roman maruhn of munich 's center for applied policy research , explaining why the official program lists such a range of topics . but there 's one issue that is on everyone 's mind and which will likely get the much of the attention over the next six months - the moribund eu constitution .
germany 's progress on finding a compromise regarding the rejected eu constitution will be a major benchmark used to judge berlin 's success , he added . the c word bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters rejected the constitution draft in a referendum vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 , the constitutional treaty had been put on ice for a yearlong " period of reflection " and the controversial issue has begun to reappear on the european agenda as germany takes the eu 's reigns . " expectations toward the german presidency , and angela merkel in particular , are incredibly high , " said katinka barysch of the center for european reform .
" she seems to be very good at listening to people and bringing everybody on board , but whether she is really good at forging consensus - that remains to be seen . " hammering out a constitutional deal will be particularly difficult for germany as it is among the treaty 's strongest supporters and is likely to be viewed as a biased mediator .
french elections , scheduled to be held shortly before the german presidency comes to a close , will also complicate negotiations , barysch added . a natural mediator bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if merkel will be able to unite the eu again merkel , who surprised many at her first european summit as german chancellor by brokering a deal on the bloc 's budget , could make some headway on deciding which parts of the constitution eu members are in favor of saving , according to the german marshall fund 's ulrike guerot . " things can go quickly if they are well orchestrated , and i think the ambition of the german presidency to get a clear roadmap for the constitution is a realistic goal , " guerot said . germany 's geopolitical location in the middle of europe predestines the country for a role as a leader and mediator , especially since it has added european integration to its national interests since the reunification of east and west germany , maruhn said . germany is n't alone on european stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has to convince 26 other national leaders to build a consensus but when it comes to forging compromises on a european level , countries that have expressed skepticism about the treaty , including the netherlands , france , the uk and poland , also have to be willing to negotiate for any progress to be made , according to guerot . " it 's not just about what germany wants to achieve , " she added .
" germany is a key player and a big country so there are big chances to bring things together , but one should not expect germany will fix everything . " but even if germany proves unable to bridge both sides of the constitutional debate , there is a chance for berlin to book a successful presidency by concentrating on endearing the eu to its citizens by reminding them of the peace the eu brought to a war-torn continent , barysch said . " what the germans could achieve is a turnaround in the atmospherics in the eu , " she said .
" away from talk about crisis and about the eu being unpopular and unloved and just showing that the eu is still a great club and has achieved so much .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de political parties -pipe- 16.01.2007 top german politician facing pressure to resign as state premier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's days as an attack dog of german politics appear numbered the chair of long-time german powerbroker edmund stoiber is wobbling .
pressure is growing on the conservative bavarian premier to step down and the repercussions could be felt in the german capital as well . the usual snow may be missing this year at the remote bavarian resort of wildbad kreuth .
but an icy wind is blowing at the closed retreat of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- currently meeting there .
the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is meeting in kreuth to discuss the future of the csu and , more importantly , its veteran state premier , edmund stoiber . stoiber is under mounting pressure to either resign or not seek re-election in 2008 .
the csu has held an absolute majority in the bavarian parliament for over 30 years .
yet support for the conservatives has dipped below 50 percent in state-wide opinion polls after it became known that his top aide had pried into the private life of csu rival and staunch stoiber critic gabriele pauli . " the consensus in the party leadership is that he must go before bavarian local elections in the spring of 2008 , " the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung said in an editorial on monday .
" it 's just that nobody wants to tell him this . " according to the opposition , it 's time for a change . " bavaria deserves better than this , " said franz maget , head of bavaria 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , who has called for immediate early elections .
" that 's why it 's time for the premier to hand in his resignation . " but stoiber put on a brave face as he arrived in kreuth on monday . " i 'm fighting for my goals , for bavaria 's success , and for the success of the csu , " stoiber said . the cdu in berlin depends on bavaria 's csu the csu holds a unique position in germany 's political landscape .

the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is meeting in kreuth to discuss the future of the csu and , more importantly , its veteran state premier , edmund stoiber . stoiber is under mounting pressure to either resign or not seek re-election in 2008 .
the csu has held an absolute majority in the bavarian parliament for over 30 years .

while environmental rights groups are concerned , german airports are eagerly awaiting a deal . it 's no longer surprising for european passengers to play cut-rate prices - sometimes under one euro -lrb- $ 1.30 -rrb- - for an international flight , and the discount airlines offering them , including ryanair , easyjet and germanwings , have managed to take over 30 percent of air traffic market share , accounting for a large part of the increase in international traffic . though pakistan , china and india are all likely to see an average passenger increase of eight percent , discount airlines make up just 10 percent of the asian market and are tightly regulated by national governments , according to the international air transport association . while other asian markets are only beginning to open their airports to regional competition , the airlines , including malaysia 's air asia x , are finding a warmer welcome in europe . 160 euros from london to hong kong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most european discounters said there is no money to be made with long-haul flights germany 's cologne / bonn airport is particularly interested in attracting the asia 's intercontinental flights . " naturally we want be in a position to become the largest ' low-cost ' airport in continental europe and become a european hub for the new ' low-cost ' long-distance carriers , " said michael garvens , head of the cologne / bonn airport . discount airline oasis , which has offered flights from london to hong kong for 160 euros , is likely to offer similarly priced cologne-hong kong fares this year , garvens added . " we have had intensive talks with oasis for two years , " he said .
" it 's in place .
now the only factor is how fast oasis can get the additional airplanes . " can cheap fares be profitable ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne / bonn airport will soon host at least one asian low-cost airline still , some experts are skeptical whether the discount airlines ' business model will also make a profit when it comes to long-haul flights since the low-cost model 's profitability depends on keeping planes in the air , taking off again as soon as possible after an arrival . even though it takes longer to prepare a plane for take off after a 10-hour flight , garvens said he can still see plenty of ways for discount airlines to make a profit with long-distance flights . " the expensive costs for the large , worldwide reservation programs as well as lounges and mileage programs " all represent costs discounters would save , he said , adding that major airlines use profits on their intercontinental flights to make up for losses in continental profits that the discounters would not incur . good for the wallet , bad for the environment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are no exact figures on how much airplanes contribute to greenhouse gas emissions however , a profusion of low-cost intercontinental flights would be a nightmare scenario for environmental protection groups . already critical of growing air traffic , which is a heavy contributor to greenhouse gas emissions , sven harmeling from germanwatch , a group which looks at environmental issues , said measuring the exact effects air traffic has on the climate is difficult but that it is likely to make up between four and nine percent of man-made greenhouse emissions and is sharply increasing . he also said low-cost airlines are sending the wrong signal by implying that there is little cost involved in flying anywhere and everywhere . " we you look at the trend to introduce low-cost flights on long-distance flights , you also have to assume an increase in air traffic - that will be an extremely big climate policy problem , " he said . thomas bärthlein -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de planned berlin airport runs into rough weather again days before work begins on berlin 's long-planned international airport , a few discount carriers have strongly criticized the venture for fear they would face exorbitantly higher costs .

" we are going to make an inventory of our laws ... to come up with the best policy examples , " said german justice minister brigitte zypries on tuesday , following a meeting with her eu colleagues in dresden , eastern germany . " each member state will decide which video games are violent , " said eu justice commissioner franco frattini .
" it 's not up to brussels to decide . "
" but the protection of children can not have borders , " he added , calling for action from the creators and producers of violent video games .
" prevention is better than repression . " frattini said the current self-regulating system used by the industry to classify videos according to levels of sex and violence was failing .
it has been in effect in 14 eu countries since 2003 . " the weakness of the self-control system is the lack of control when selling video games .
it is very difficult to check the identity -lrb- and age -rrb- of the young people who are buying the video games .
retailers should be liable to punitive measures , " he added , calling on the 27 eu nations to increase their controls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : games sold over the counter can be controlled to some extent frattini said he remained convinced there was a link between violent videos and violence in society , though he admitted experts remained divided on the subject .
" like banning rain " last november , frattini highlighted one newly available video game , " the rule of rose , " as an example of why action was required .
the game depicted physical and psychological violence meted out on a young girl .
controversy in britain led the games publisher , 505 games , to keep it off store shelves . during their debate the justice ministers watched an extract of " manhunt , " a violent game for adults which has been a big hit on the internet . the debate came to life again in germany in late november after an 18-year-old , said to be an avid computer game player , opened fire at his old school and injured several people before killing himself . the german state of bavaria is now seeking to modify federal law , already one of the strongest in europe , to explicitly ban violent computer games , even on the internet . but the federal justice minister said that a ban on web-based games was very unlikely to happen . " you ca n't ban games on the internet , " said zypries on tuesday .

" we all believe that the death penalty is something that should be rejected , " her colleague , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , told reporters after informal talks with his and zypries ' eu counterparts in the eastern german city of dresden .
" the eu will continue to campaign for a worldwide abolition , " he stressed . italy has been pushing for a global moratorium on capital punishment since iraq executed former dictator saddam hussein two and a half weeks ago .
rome , which is currently a member of the 15-member un security council , says the 27-member eu should try to increase international support for the diplomatic bid .
botched execution a botched hanging in iraq on monday , which was condemned by european leaders , may have rallied more eu states to the cause . two of saddam hussein 's aides , his half-brother barzan ibrahim al-tikriti and former judge awad hamed al-bandar , were executed for crimes against humanity .
al-tikriti 's head was accidentally ripped off his body by the noose that hanged him .
" reports on the gruesome circumstances of -lrb- monday 's -rrb- executions are very disturbing , " said irish foreign minister dermot ahern .
" i believe it is in the interests of justice and reconciliation in iraq that the iraqi authorities now take the step of ending executions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy plans to take advantage of its seat on the un security council hours after the execution , european commission president jose manuel barroso said he backed italy 's campaign to put a stop to capital punishment .
" i believe in our european values and i take this occasion to thank italy for all the initiatives that it announced so that , in the framework of the united nations , we can work together to put an end to the death penalty . " the hangings in iraq were carried out despite international appeals to halt them , including from un secretary general ban ki-moon , the eu and human rights groups that argued the trial was flawed and unfair . experts say influential eu members , such as germany , will be unwilling to irk the united states and other commercial partners such as iran and china , which back the death penalty . capital punishment is banned in the eu , but continues to be permitted in 68 other countries . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stiff eu opposition to death penalty ahead of iraq executions as the eu underlined its opposition to the death penalty in the wake of the botched killing of saddam hussein , a pan-european human rights watchdog has appealed to iraq to stop all further executions .
-lrb- 05.01.2007 -rrb- italy calls for united european front against death penalty the italian government has said it will campaign to abolish the death penalty worldwide , using its position as one of 15 un security council members .
it wants the european union to support its efforts .
-lrb- 04.01.2007 -rrb- europe says saddam 's execution solves no problems for iraq as european nations criticized the execution of saddam hussein out of opposition to the death penalty , sunday newspapers across the continent were pessimistic as to whether the hanging would solve any of iraq 's problems .

while many topics will eventually get an eu airing , not all issues are created equal . " every eu presidency presents a comprehensive program , but only a small amount of the content is actually new or actually written by the respective government , " said roman maruhn of munich 's center for applied policy research , explaining why the official program lists such a range of topics . but there 's one issue that is on everyone 's mind and which will likely get the much of the attention over the next six months - the moribund eu constitution .
germany 's progress on finding a compromise regarding the rejected eu constitution will be a major benchmark used to judge berlin 's success , he added . the c word bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters rejected the constitution draft in a referendum vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 , the constitutional treaty had been put on ice for a yearlong " period of reflection " and the controversial issue has begun to reappear on the european agenda as germany takes the eu 's reigns . " expectations toward the german presidency , and angela merkel in particular , are incredibly high , " said katinka barysch of the center for european reform .
" she seems to be very good at listening to people and bringing everybody on board , but whether she is really good at forging consensus - that remains to be seen . " hammering out a constitutional deal will be particularly difficult for germany as it is among the treaty 's strongest supporters and is likely to be viewed as a biased mediator .
french elections , scheduled to be held shortly before the german presidency comes to a close , will also complicate negotiations , barysch added . a natural mediator bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if merkel will be able to unite the eu again merkel , who surprised many at her first european summit as german chancellor by brokering a deal on the bloc 's budget , could make some headway on deciding which parts of the constitution eu members are in favor of saving , according to the german marshall fund 's ulrike guerot . " things can go quickly if they are well orchestrated , and i think the ambition of the german presidency to get a clear roadmap for the constitution is a realistic goal , " guerot said . germany 's geopolitical location in the middle of europe predestines the country for a role as a leader and mediator , especially since it has added european integration to its national interests since the reunification of east and west germany , maruhn said . germany is n't alone on european stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has to convince 26 other national leaders to build a consensus but when it comes to forging compromises on a european level , countries that have expressed skepticism about the treaty , including the netherlands , france , the uk and poland , also have to be willing to negotiate for any progress to be made , according to guerot . " it 's not just about what germany wants to achieve , " she added .
" germany is a key player and a big country so there are big chances to bring things together , but one should not expect germany will fix everything . " but even if germany proves unable to bridge both sides of the constitutional debate , there is a chance for berlin to book a successful presidency by concentrating on endearing the eu to its citizens by reminding them of the peace the eu brought to a war-torn continent , barysch said . " what the germans could achieve is a turnaround in the atmospherics in the eu , " she said .

while many topics will eventually get an eu airing , not all issues are created equal . " every eu presidency presents a comprehensive program , but only a small amount of the content is actually new or actually written by the respective government , " said roman maruhn of munich 's center for applied policy research , explaining why the official program lists such a range of topics . but there 's one issue that is on everyone 's mind and which will likely get the much of the attention over the next six months - the moribund eu constitution .
germany 's progress on finding a compromise regarding the rejected eu constitution will be a major benchmark used to judge berlin 's success , he added . the c word bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters rejected the constitution draft in a referendum vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 , the constitutional treaty had been put on ice for a yearlong " period of reflection " and the controversial issue has begun to reappear on the european agenda as germany takes the eu 's reigns . " expectations toward the german presidency , and angela merkel in particular , are incredibly high , " said katinka barysch of the center for european reform .
" she seems to be very good at listening to people and bringing everybody on board , but whether she is really good at forging consensus - that remains to be seen .

while environmental rights groups are concerned , german airports are eagerly awaiting a deal . it 's no longer surprising for european passengers to play cut-rate prices - sometimes under one euro -lrb- $ 1.30 -rrb- - for an international flight , and the discount airlines offering them , including ryanair , easyjet and germanwings , have managed to take over 30 percent of air traffic market share , accounting for a large part of the increase in international traffic . though pakistan , china and india are all likely to see an average passenger increase of eight percent , discount airlines make up just 10 percent of the asian market and are tightly regulated by national governments , according to the international air transport association . while other asian markets are only beginning to open their airports to regional competition , the airlines , including malaysia 's air asia x , are finding a warmer welcome in europe . 160 euros from london to hong kong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most european discounters said there is no money to be made with long-haul flights germany 's cologne / bonn airport is particularly interested in attracting the asia 's intercontinental flights . " naturally we want be in a position to become the largest ' low-cost ' airport in continental europe and become a european hub for the new ' low-cost ' long-distance carriers , " said michael garvens , head of the cologne / bonn airport . discount airline oasis , which has offered flights from london to hong kong for 160 euros , is likely to offer similarly priced cologne-hong kong fares this year , garvens added . " we have had intensive talks with oasis for two years , " he said .
" it 's in place .
now the only factor is how fast oasis can get the additional airplanes . " can cheap fares be profitable ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne / bonn airport will soon host at least one asian low-cost airline still , some experts are skeptical whether the discount airlines ' business model will also make a profit when it comes to long-haul flights since the low-cost model 's profitability depends on keeping planes in the air , taking off again as soon as possible after an arrival . even though it takes longer to prepare a plane for take off after a 10-hour flight , garvens said he can still see plenty of ways for discount airlines to make a profit with long-distance flights . " the expensive costs for the large , worldwide reservation programs as well as lounges and mileage programs " all represent costs discounters would save , he said , adding that major airlines use profits on their intercontinental flights to make up for losses in continental profits that the discounters would not incur . good for the wallet , bad for the environment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are no exact figures on how much airplanes contribute to greenhouse gas emissions however , a profusion of low-cost intercontinental flights would be a nightmare scenario for environmental protection groups . already critical of growing air traffic , which is a heavy contributor to greenhouse gas emissions , sven harmeling from germanwatch , a group which looks at environmental issues , said measuring the exact effects air traffic has on the climate is difficult but that it is likely to make up between four and nine percent of man-made greenhouse emissions and is sharply increasing . he also said low-cost airlines are sending the wrong signal by implying that there is little cost involved in flying anywhere and everywhere . " we you look at the trend to introduce low-cost flights on long-distance flights , you also have to assume an increase in air traffic - that will be an extremely big climate policy problem , " he said . thomas bärthlein -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de planned berlin airport runs into rough weather again days before work begins on berlin 's long-planned international airport , a few discount carriers have strongly criticized the venture for fear they would face exorbitantly higher costs .

" every eu presidency presents a comprehensive program , but only a small amount of the content is actually new or actually written by the respective government , " said roman maruhn of munich 's center for applied policy research , explaining why the official program lists such a range of topics . but there 's one issue that is on everyone 's mind and which will likely get the much of the attention over the next six months - the moribund eu constitution .
germany 's progress on finding a compromise regarding the rejected eu constitution will be a major benchmark used to judge berlin 's success , he added . the c word bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters rejected the constitution draft in a referendum vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 , the constitutional treaty had been put on ice for a yearlong " period of reflection " and the controversial issue has begun to reappear on the european agenda as germany takes the eu 's reigns . " expectations toward the german presidency , and angela merkel in particular , are incredibly high , " said katinka barysch of the center for european reform .
" she seems to be very good at listening to people and bringing everybody on board , but whether she is really good at forging consensus - that remains to be seen . " hammering out a constitutional deal will be particularly difficult for germany as it is among the treaty 's strongest supporters and is likely to be viewed as a biased mediator .
french elections , scheduled to be held shortly before the german presidency comes to a close , will also complicate negotiations , barysch added . a natural mediator bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if merkel will be able to unite the eu again merkel , who surprised many at her first european summit as german chancellor by brokering a deal on the bloc 's budget , could make some headway on deciding which parts of the constitution eu members are in favor of saving , according to the german marshall fund 's ulrike guerot . " things can go quickly if they are well orchestrated , and i think the ambition of the german presidency to get a clear roadmap for the constitution is a realistic goal , " guerot said . germany 's geopolitical location in the middle of europe predestines the country for a role as a leader and mediator , especially since it has added european integration to its national interests since the reunification of east and west germany , maruhn said . germany is n't alone on european stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has to convince 26 other national leaders to build a consensus but when it comes to forging compromises on a european level , countries that have expressed skepticism about the treaty , including the netherlands , france , the uk and poland , also have to be willing to negotiate for any progress to be made , according to guerot . " it 's not just about what germany wants to achieve , " she added .
" germany is a key player and a big country so there are big chances to bring things together , but one should not expect germany will fix everything . " but even if germany proves unable to bridge both sides of the constitutional debate , there is a chance for berlin to book a successful presidency by concentrating on endearing the eu to its citizens by reminding them of the peace the eu brought to a war-torn continent , barysch said . " what the germans could achieve is a turnaround in the atmospherics in the eu , " she said .
" away from talk about crisis and about the eu being unpopular and unloved and just showing that the eu is still a great club and has achieved so much .

while environmental rights groups are concerned , german airports are eagerly awaiting a deal . it 's no longer surprising for european passengers to play cut-rate prices - sometimes under one euro -lrb- $ 1.30 -rrb- - for an international flight , and the discount airlines offering them , including ryanair , easyjet and germanwings , have managed to take over 30 percent of air traffic market share , accounting for a large part of the increase in international traffic . though pakistan , china and india are all likely to see an average passenger increase of eight percent , discount airlines make up just 10 percent of the asian market and are tightly regulated by national governments , according to the international air transport association . while other asian markets are only beginning to open their airports to regional competition , the airlines , including malaysia 's air asia x , are finding a warmer welcome in europe . 160 euros from london to hong kong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most european discounters said there is no money to be made with long-haul flights germany 's cologne / bonn airport is particularly interested in attracting the asia 's intercontinental flights . " naturally we want be in a position to become the largest ' low-cost ' airport in continental europe and become a european hub for the new ' low-cost ' long-distance carriers , " said michael garvens , head of the cologne / bonn airport . discount airline oasis , which has offered flights from london to hong kong for 160 euros , is likely to offer similarly priced cologne-hong kong fares this year , garvens added . " we have had intensive talks with oasis for two years , " he said .
" it 's in place .
now the only factor is how fast oasis can get the additional airplanes . " can cheap fares be profitable ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne / bonn airport will soon host at least one asian low-cost airline still , some experts are skeptical whether the discount airlines ' business model will also make a profit when it comes to long-haul flights since the low-cost model 's profitability depends on keeping planes in the air , taking off again as soon as possible after an arrival . even though it takes longer to prepare a plane for take off after a 10-hour flight , garvens said he can still see plenty of ways for discount airlines to make a profit with long-distance flights . " the expensive costs for the large , worldwide reservation programs as well as lounges and mileage programs " all represent costs discounters would save , he said , adding that major airlines use profits on their intercontinental flights to make up for losses in continental profits that the discounters would not incur . good for the wallet , bad for the environment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are no exact figures on how much airplanes contribute to greenhouse gas emissions however , a profusion of low-cost intercontinental flights would be a nightmare scenario for environmental protection groups . already critical of growing air traffic , which is a heavy contributor to greenhouse gas emissions , sven harmeling from germanwatch , a group which looks at environmental issues , said measuring the exact effects air traffic has on the climate is difficult but that it is likely to make up between four and nine percent of man-made greenhouse emissions and is sharply increasing . he also said low-cost airlines are sending the wrong signal by implying that there is little cost involved in flying anywhere and everywhere . " we you look at the trend to introduce low-cost flights on long-distance flights , you also have to assume an increase in air traffic - that will be an extremely big climate policy problem , " he said . thomas bärthlein -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de planned berlin airport runs into rough weather again days before work begins on berlin 's long-planned international airport , a few discount carriers have strongly criticized the venture for fear they would face exorbitantly higher costs .

pressure is growing on the conservative bavarian premier to step down and the repercussions could be felt in the german capital as well . the usual snow may be missing this year at the remote bavarian resort of wildbad kreuth .
but an icy wind is blowing at the closed retreat of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- currently meeting there .
the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is meeting in kreuth to discuss the future of the csu and , more importantly , its veteran state premier , edmund stoiber . stoiber is under mounting pressure to either resign or not seek re-election in 2008 .
the csu has held an absolute majority in the bavarian parliament for over 30 years .
yet support for the conservatives has dipped below 50 percent in state-wide opinion polls after it became known that his top aide had pried into the private life of csu rival and staunch stoiber critic gabriele pauli . " the consensus in the party leadership is that he must go before bavarian local elections in the spring of 2008 , " the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung said in an editorial on monday .

the formal setting up of the bloc allows it various rights including receiving official funding of around one million euros -lrb- $ 770,000 -rrb- and certain speaking rights . french national front mep bruno gollnisch will lead the new far right bloc , whose founding principles include recognizing " national interests , sovereignties , identities and differences , " and opposing a " unitary , bureaucratic , european superstate . " its platform also includes commitments to christian and traditional family values . new members made it possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the eu parliament have been called upon to prevent the new group from getting senior positions the membership includes seven members of the french national front , including le pen and his daughter marine le pen .
its formation was made possible by the accession of romania and bulgaria to the eu on jan.1 , as five romanian meps have signed up as well as a bulgarian . there are also three belgian deputies from the flemish nationalist vlaams belang party , including its president franck vanhecke . the membership list also includes austrian andreas molzer , british mep ashley mote and alessandra mussolini , the granddaughter of italian wartime dictator benito mussolini . socialist group leader martin schulz immediately questioned the group 's legitimacy , asking whether it adhered to the rules of parliament which stipulate that the members of a group must share a political position . but borrell rejected the call for an enquiry into the group 's legitimacy , noting that the 20 members had all signed a political declaration . defensive moves schulz , nonetheless , called on meps to prevent the new far-right group from securing senior positions in the european parliament . immediately after the announcement of the 20-member group 's formation , schulz wrote to fellow leaders of the parliament 's democratic groups , urging them to deny the new group posts under the proportional system of appointment . " we must not abandon this parliament , which symbolizes the integration of europe , to those who deny all european values , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's most famous far-right politician , jean-marie le pen , is a member after reports that he had been described as a " totalitarian " by gollnisch , schulz said : " to be attacked by a man who is a holocaust denier and who represents the neo-fascist movement is an honor for me . " in his letter to other group leaders , schulz said that while the new group would enjoy the privileges and staffing normally given to a political group they should not be approved as vice-presidents of parliamentary committees . it is not the first time that the far-right has had a bloc in the assembly .

" we are going to make an inventory of our laws ... to come up with the best policy examples , " said german justice minister brigitte zypries on tuesday , following a meeting with her eu colleagues in dresden , eastern germany . " each member state will decide which video games are violent , " said eu justice commissioner franco frattini .
" it 's not up to brussels to decide . "
" but the protection of children can not have borders , " he added , calling for action from the creators and producers of violent video games .
" prevention is better than repression . " frattini said the current self-regulating system used by the industry to classify videos according to levels of sex and violence was failing .
it has been in effect in 14 eu countries since 2003 . " the weakness of the self-control system is the lack of control when selling video games .
it is very difficult to check the identity -lrb- and age -rrb- of the young people who are buying the video games .
retailers should be liable to punitive measures , " he added , calling on the 27 eu nations to increase their controls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : games sold over the counter can be controlled to some extent frattini said he remained convinced there was a link between violent videos and violence in society , though he admitted experts remained divided on the subject .
" like banning rain " last november , frattini highlighted one newly available video game , " the rule of rose , " as an example of why action was required .
the game depicted physical and psychological violence meted out on a young girl .
controversy in britain led the games publisher , 505 games , to keep it off store shelves . during their debate the justice ministers watched an extract of " manhunt , " a violent game for adults which has been a big hit on the internet . the debate came to life again in germany in late november after an 18-year-old , said to be an avid computer game player , opened fire at his old school and injured several people before killing himself . the german state of bavaria is now seeking to modify federal law , already one of the strongest in europe , to explicitly ban violent computer games , even on the internet . but the federal justice minister said that a ban on web-based games was very unlikely to happen . " you ca n't ban games on the internet , " said zypries on tuesday .
" it 's like trying to ban the rain .

while environmental rights groups are concerned , german airports are eagerly awaiting a deal . it 's no longer surprising for european passengers to play cut-rate prices - sometimes under one euro -lrb- $ 1.30 -rrb- - for an international flight , and the discount airlines offering them , including ryanair , easyjet and germanwings , have managed to take over 30 percent of air traffic market share , accounting for a large part of the increase in international traffic . though pakistan , china and india are all likely to see an average passenger increase of eight percent , discount airlines make up just 10 percent of the asian market and are tightly regulated by national governments , according to the international air transport association . while other asian markets are only beginning to open their airports to regional competition , the airlines , including malaysia 's air asia x , are finding a warmer welcome in europe . 160 euros from london to hong kong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most european discounters said there is no money to be made with long-haul flights germany 's cologne / bonn airport is particularly interested in attracting the asia 's intercontinental flights . " naturally we want be in a position to become the largest ' low-cost ' airport in continental europe and become a european hub for the new ' low-cost ' long-distance carriers , " said michael garvens , head of the cologne / bonn airport . discount airline oasis , which has offered flights from london to hong kong for 160 euros , is likely to offer similarly priced cologne-hong kong fares this year , garvens added . " we have had intensive talks with oasis for two years , " he said .
" it 's in place .
now the only factor is how fast oasis can get the additional airplanes . " can cheap fares be profitable ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne / bonn airport will soon host at least one asian low-cost airline still , some experts are skeptical whether the discount airlines ' business model will also make a profit when it comes to long-haul flights since the low-cost model 's profitability depends on keeping planes in the air , taking off again as soon as possible after an arrival . even though it takes longer to prepare a plane for take off after a 10-hour flight , garvens said he can still see plenty of ways for discount airlines to make a profit with long-distance flights . " the expensive costs for the large , worldwide reservation programs as well as lounges and mileage programs " all represent costs discounters would save , he said , adding that major airlines use profits on their intercontinental flights to make up for losses in continental profits that the discounters would not incur . good for the wallet , bad for the environment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are no exact figures on how much airplanes contribute to greenhouse gas emissions however , a profusion of low-cost intercontinental flights would be a nightmare scenario for environmental protection groups . already critical of growing air traffic , which is a heavy contributor to greenhouse gas emissions , sven harmeling from germanwatch , a group which looks at environmental issues , said measuring the exact effects air traffic has on the climate is difficult but that it is likely to make up between four and nine percent of man-made greenhouse emissions and is sharply increasing . he also said low-cost airlines are sending the wrong signal by implying that there is little cost involved in flying anywhere and everywhere . " we you look at the trend to introduce low-cost flights on long-distance flights , you also have to assume an increase in air traffic - that will be an extremely big climate policy problem , " he said . thomas bärthlein -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de planned berlin airport runs into rough weather again days before work begins on berlin 's long-planned international airport , a few discount carriers have strongly criticized the venture for fear they would face exorbitantly higher costs .

a berlin author is out to find the most beautiful " endangered " word in the german language - and to save other dying words from a morbid fate . new words enter the german language every day .
many of them are borrowed from english , like " blockbuster " and " brunch . "
others - like " cool " and its more german-sounding equivalent " geil " - belong to an ever changing youth culture . omissions are just as common as additions .
some words simply fall into the black hole of disuse .
some are forgotten because they no longer apply to modern life .
still others are eventually rejected for sounding old-fashioned or out-of-date . the older , and more literal " schutzmann " -lrb- protection man -rrb- has been updated as " polizist " -lrb- police officer -rrb- , for example , while " spielautomat " -lrb- slot machine -rrb- has replaced " groschengrab , " which refers to the same thing , but in a more colorful manner .
it literally means " penny grave . " endangered word list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " word doctor " mrozek has published his own lexicon of endangered words bodo mrozek , a 38-year-old author from berlin , has taken on the sisyphean task of rescuing endangered words and even trying to reinstate some of them into modern german speech . " if you grew up in the 1980s then you heard about forests being cut down and whales becoming extinct , " said mrozek in an interview with the tageszeitung .
" but no one lobbied for words and that 's why i think it 's important to take on this underestimated threat . " in his quest to find the most beautiful endangered german word , mrozek has invited the public to suggest their favorites through feb .
28 , 2007 . the person who submits the winning word , selected by a panel of five well-known german authors , will receive a trophy shaped like a cheeseball adorned with toothpicks .
in german this party appetizer is called a " käseigel , " which literally means " cheese hedgehog " and , appropriately , is among the many endangered words mrozek is lobbying for . so far , 25,000 words have been submitted , 800 of which have made it to mrozek 's so-called red list of endangered words . english less threatened according to mrozek , german words are in greater danger than their english counterparts . germany 's authoritative duden lexicon is content to let words slip through the linguistic cracks .
it simply omits those that have fallen out of use , mrozek told tageszeitung . the oxford english dictionary , on the other hand , sees itself as a documenter of the english language and still contains words from shakespeare 's time , added the author . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does old have to mean old-fashioned ?
trend-setting with old-fashioned words mrozek says he hopes that lost words can be rejuvenated if people overcome feelings of being " uncool " and start using them again . while mrozek 's efforts to solicit submissions has met with success , it will likely be more difficult to convince people to invite their friends to " gabelsfrüstück " -lrb- literally , fork breakfast -rrb- instead of " brunch " or to come along to the local cinema on friday night for the lastest hollywood " kassenschlager " -lrb- literally , cash register hitter -rrb- instead of a " blockbuster . " to some , the older german version sounds a bit too folksy .
in a country where patriotism is still equated with nationalism , some german-speakers are concerned about sounding too german - even right-wing - and not international enough . for those words that ca n't be resuscitated , a graveyard could be constructed , said mrozek .
it would have to be in an endangered area , such as in a derelict town in eastern germany or a run-down industrial park in western germany .
and the craftsmen , whose professions are likewise endangered , would use endangered tools to fashion gravestones for the words that have passed out of the standard vocabulary and into word heaven . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when german words travel , our zeitgeist goes oom-pah-pah why do finnish buses take coffee breaks ?
and why are the french always puzzled when they look at a skylight ?
it 's because they use words of german origin , sometimes without even realizing it .
-lrb- 10.12.2006 -rrb- spreading the word the german way to the romantic ear , the german language might sound cumbersome and perfunctory , yet beyond its tonal harshness , it is as efficient as its native speakers are reputed to be .

the formal setting up of the bloc allows it various rights including receiving official funding of around one million euros -lrb- $ 770,000 -rrb- and certain speaking rights . french national front mep bruno gollnisch will lead the new far right bloc , whose founding principles include recognizing " national interests , sovereignties , identities and differences , " and opposing a " unitary , bureaucratic , european superstate .

its formation was made possible by the accession of romania and bulgaria to the eu on jan.1 , as five romanian meps have signed up as well as a bulgarian . there are also three belgian deputies from the flemish nationalist vlaams belang party , including its president franck vanhecke . the membership list also includes austrian andreas molzer , british mep ashley mote and alessandra mussolini , the granddaughter of italian wartime dictator benito mussolini . socialist group leader martin schulz immediately questioned the group 's legitimacy , asking whether it adhered to the rules of parliament which stipulate that the members of a group must share a political position . but borrell rejected the call for an enquiry into the group 's legitimacy , noting that the 20 members had all signed a political declaration . defensive moves schulz , nonetheless , called on meps to prevent the new far-right group from securing senior positions in the european parliament . immediately after the announcement of the 20-member group 's formation , schulz wrote to fellow leaders of the parliament 's democratic groups , urging them to deny the new group posts under the proportional system of appointment . " we must not abandon this parliament , which symbolizes the integration of europe , to those who deny all european values , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's most famous far-right politician , jean-marie le pen , is a member after reports that he had been described as a " totalitarian " by gollnisch , schulz said : " to be attacked by a man who is a holocaust denier and who represents the neo-fascist movement is an honor for me . " in his letter to other group leaders , schulz said that while the new group would enjoy the privileges and staffing normally given to a political group they should not be approved as vice-presidents of parliamentary committees . it is not the first time that the far-right has had a bloc in the assembly .

" its platform also includes commitments to christian and traditional family values . new members made it possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the eu parliament have been called upon to prevent the new group from getting senior positions the membership includes seven members of the french national front , including le pen and his daughter marine le pen .
its formation was made possible by the accession of romania and bulgaria to the eu on jan.1 , as five romanian meps have signed up as well as a bulgarian . there are also three belgian deputies from the flemish nationalist vlaams belang party , including its president franck vanhecke . the membership list also includes austrian andreas molzer , british mep ashley mote and alessandra mussolini , the granddaughter of italian wartime dictator benito mussolini . socialist group leader martin schulz immediately questioned the group 's legitimacy , asking whether it adhered to the rules of parliament which stipulate that the members of a group must share a political position . but borrell rejected the call for an enquiry into the group 's legitimacy , noting that the 20 members had all signed a political declaration . defensive moves schulz , nonetheless , called on meps to prevent the new far-right group from securing senior positions in the european parliament . immediately after the announcement of the 20-member group 's formation , schulz wrote to fellow leaders of the parliament 's democratic groups , urging them to deny the new group posts under the proportional system of appointment . " we must not abandon this parliament , which symbolizes the integration of europe , to those who deny all european values , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's most famous far-right politician , jean-marie le pen , is a member after reports that he had been described as a " totalitarian " by gollnisch , schulz said : " to be attacked by a man who is a holocaust denier and who represents the neo-fascist movement is an honor for me . " in his letter to other group leaders , schulz said that while the new group would enjoy the privileges and staffing normally given to a political group they should not be approved as vice-presidents of parliamentary committees . it is not the first time that the far-right has had a bloc in the assembly .

the city-state 's purchase would help meet aims to keep the shares in german hands . the bremen government is prepared to spend 30 million euros -lrb- $ 38.7 million -rrb- to acquire part of the european aeronautics defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- .
the northern german city-state would then hold 2 percent of the 7.5 percent stake daimlerchrysler has put up for sale . mayor jens böhrnsen and his deputy thomas röwekamp agreed on the sum monday and will make a proposal to the regional government on tuesday , a spokesman said . other german local governments over the weekend hinted that they were also interested in acquiring part of the daimlerchrysler stake , as part of a bid to keep it in german hands .
these include the city state of hamburg and the northwestern state of lower saxony .

" but we wanted to put some life in the numbers and present viewers with what is coming for our society when a stop is not put to this negative trend . " the series has been hailed as a success by german mass-market daily bild , which called the docu-thriller an " outcry " and " the most impressive television series of the year because it , unfortunately , could become true . " while praising the broadcaster for making germany 's demographic debate more appetizing with the help of a conspiracy plot and healthy dose of science fiction , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung criticized the film for taking into account changes in the elderly population but presenting younger generations exactly as they are today .
" -lrb- the youth -rrb- will be different , " the daily wrote .
" the unification of family and work will be among the key questions for companies since in the next decade women will be desperately needed at the workplace . "
the paper added that an " evolutionary , not revolutionary " process is more likely to take place in german society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most elderly in the series struggle just to survive but die tageszeitung questions whether the division of retirees who are forced to rob pharmacies for drugs that are n't covered by meager insurance polices while others live in luxurious health center penthouses is actually a realistic vision of the future .
" ' the uprising of the elderly ' is a success as a movie ; it 's exciting , entertaining and brings to mind science fiction classics like ' solvent green ' with shocking twists , " the paper wrote .
" but zdf wants more .
the film should ' enlighten , ' ' awaken ' and ' show what is waiting for us , ' but it does n't do that as the film 's political dimensions range from polemic to flat . " munich 's süddeutsche zeitung reported that zdf 's decision to portray the series as a documentary instead of a film is an attempt to prove the producers ' view of the future is true .
" the really curious part is then at the end the documentary has become less believable than the movie could have been , " the paper wrote . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german population plunge expected germany 's population will drop by as much as 12 million by 2050 due to low birth rates , according to an official forecast released tuesday .

" while praising the broadcaster for making germany 's demographic debate more appetizing with the help of a conspiracy plot and healthy dose of science fiction , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung criticized the film for taking into account changes in the elderly population but presenting younger generations exactly as they are today .
" -lrb- the youth -rrb- will be different , " the daily wrote .
" the unification of family and work will be among the key questions for companies since in the next decade women will be desperately needed at the workplace . "
the paper added that an " evolutionary , not revolutionary " process is more likely to take place in german society . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most elderly in the series struggle just to survive but die tageszeitung questions whether the division of retirees who are forced to rob pharmacies for drugs that are n't covered by meager insurance polices while others live in luxurious health center penthouses is actually a realistic vision of the future .
" ' the uprising of the elderly ' is a success as a movie ; it 's exciting , entertaining and brings to mind science fiction classics like ' solvent green ' with shocking twists , " the paper wrote .
" but zdf wants more .
the film should ' enlighten , ' ' awaken ' and ' show what is waiting for us , ' but it does n't do that as the film 's political dimensions range from polemic to flat . " munich 's süddeutsche zeitung reported that zdf 's decision to portray the series as a documentary instead of a film is an attempt to prove the producers ' view of the future is true .
" the really curious part is then at the end the documentary has become less believable than the movie could have been , " the paper wrote . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german population plunge expected germany 's population will drop by as much as 12 million by 2050 due to low birth rates , according to an official forecast released tuesday .
-lrb- 07.11.2006 -rrb- eu prepares strategy to tackle demographic change the european union commission on thursday agreed on a strategy paper to address demographic change in the 25-member bloc , including support for balancing the demands of both family and career .
-lrb- 12.10.2006 -rrb- labor policies need changes as germans live longer a shift in demographics means germany should alter its labor policies to encourage more older people to continue working as the average life span grows and the birth rate stagnates , according to some experts .

the city-state 's purchase would help meet aims to keep the shares in german hands . the bremen government is prepared to spend 30 million euros -lrb- $ 38.7 million -rrb- to acquire part of the european aeronautics defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- .
the northern german city-state would then hold 2 percent of the 7.5 percent stake daimlerchrysler has put up for sale . mayor jens böhrnsen and his deputy thomas röwekamp agreed on the sum monday and will make a proposal to the regional government on tuesday , a spokesman said . other german local governments over the weekend hinted that they were also interested in acquiring part of the daimlerchrysler stake , as part of a bid to keep it in german hands .
these include the city state of hamburg and the northwestern state of lower saxony .
both are , like bremen , home to eads factories or offices . support from berlin for new shareholder structure after months of protracted negotiations , german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in a newspaper interview last week that a solution had been found with regard to eads ' shareholder structure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg is home to eads company airbus berlin has long feared that france could gain the upper hand in the long-running power struggle at eads when german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler cuts its stake from 22.5 percent to 15 percent . such concerns gained more urgency from eads ' financial crisis , triggered by problems at aircraft maker airbus .
there has been speculation that france could seek to increase its stake in eads via a possible capital hike . keeping stake in german hands a top priority berlin is adamant that the 7.5-percent stake being put up for sale by daimlerchrysler remain in german hands and must not be allowed to fall under french or even russian control . but moscow is also keen to increase its say in eads after state-owned bank vneshtorgbank bought a 5.02 percent stake in september 2006 .
spanish interests are represented by the holding group sepi , which owns 5.48 percent . daimlerchrysler effectively represents german interests in the company , while france is represented via a 30 percent stake shared by the state holding company sogeade and media group lagardere . lagardere has committed itself to cutting its stake to put french interests back on a par with germany 's .

" we all believe that the death penalty is something that should be rejected , " her colleague , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , told reporters after informal talks with his and zypries ' eu counterparts in the eastern german city of dresden .
" the eu will continue to campaign for a worldwide abolition , " he stressed . italy has been pushing for a global moratorium on capital punishment since iraq executed former dictator saddam hussein two and a half weeks ago .
rome , which is currently a member of the 15-member un security council , says the 27-member eu should try to increase international support for the diplomatic bid .
botched execution a botched hanging in iraq on monday , which was condemned by european leaders , may have rallied more eu states to the cause . two of saddam hussein 's aides , his half-brother barzan ibrahim al-tikriti and former judge awad hamed al-bandar , were executed for crimes against humanity .
al-tikriti 's head was accidentally ripped off his body by the noose that hanged him .
" reports on the gruesome circumstances of -lrb- monday 's -rrb- executions are very disturbing , " said irish foreign minister dermot ahern .
" i believe it is in the interests of justice and reconciliation in iraq that the iraqi authorities now take the step of ending executions . "

" we all believe that the death penalty is something that should be rejected , " her colleague , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , told reporters after informal talks with his and zypries ' eu counterparts in the eastern german city of dresden .
" the eu will continue to campaign for a worldwide abolition , " he stressed . italy has been pushing for a global moratorium on capital punishment since iraq executed former dictator saddam hussein two and a half weeks ago .
rome , which is currently a member of the 15-member un security council , says the 27-member eu should try to increase international support for the diplomatic bid .
botched execution a botched hanging in iraq on monday , which was condemned by european leaders , may have rallied more eu states to the cause . two of saddam hussein 's aides , his half-brother barzan ibrahim al-tikriti and former judge awad hamed al-bandar , were executed for crimes against humanity .
al-tikriti 's head was accidentally ripped off his body by the noose that hanged him .
" reports on the gruesome circumstances of -lrb- monday 's -rrb- executions are very disturbing , " said irish foreign minister dermot ahern .
" i believe it is in the interests of justice and reconciliation in iraq that the iraqi authorities now take the step of ending executions . "

" but we wanted to put some life in the numbers and present viewers with what is coming for our society when a stop is not put to this negative trend . " the series has been hailed as a success by german mass-market daily bild , which called the docu-thriller an " outcry " and " the most impressive television series of the year because it , unfortunately , could become true . " while praising the broadcaster for making germany 's demographic debate more appetizing with the help of a conspiracy plot and healthy dose of science fiction , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung criticized the film for taking into account changes in the elderly population but presenting younger generations exactly as they are today .

the formal setting up of the bloc allows it various rights including receiving official funding of around one million euros -lrb- $ 770,000 -rrb- and certain speaking rights . french national front mep bruno gollnisch will lead the new far right bloc , whose founding principles include recognizing " national interests , sovereignties , identities and differences , " and opposing a " unitary , bureaucratic , european superstate . " its platform also includes commitments to christian and traditional family values . new members made it possible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : members of the eu parliament have been called upon to prevent the new group from getting senior positions the membership includes seven members of the french national front , including le pen and his daughter marine le pen .
its formation was made possible by the accession of romania and bulgaria to the eu on jan.1 , as five romanian meps have signed up as well as a bulgarian . there are also three belgian deputies from the flemish nationalist vlaams belang party , including its president franck vanhecke . the membership list also includes austrian andreas molzer , british mep ashley mote and alessandra mussolini , the granddaughter of italian wartime dictator benito mussolini . socialist group leader martin schulz immediately questioned the group 's legitimacy , asking whether it adhered to the rules of parliament which stipulate that the members of a group must share a political position . but borrell rejected the call for an enquiry into the group 's legitimacy , noting that the 20 members had all signed a political declaration . defensive moves schulz , nonetheless , called on meps to prevent the new far-right group from securing senior positions in the european parliament . immediately after the announcement of the 20-member group 's formation , schulz wrote to fellow leaders of the parliament 's democratic groups , urging them to deny the new group posts under the proportional system of appointment . " we must not abandon this parliament , which symbolizes the integration of europe , to those who deny all european values , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's most famous far-right politician , jean-marie le pen , is a member after reports that he had been described as a " totalitarian " by gollnisch , schulz said : " to be attacked by a man who is a holocaust denier and who represents the neo-fascist movement is an honor for me . " in his letter to other group leaders , schulz said that while the new group would enjoy the privileges and staffing normally given to a political group they should not be approved as vice-presidents of parliamentary committees . it is not the first time that the far-right has had a bloc in the assembly .

while many topics will eventually get an eu airing , not all issues are created equal . " every eu presidency presents a comprehensive program , but only a small amount of the content is actually new or actually written by the respective government , " said roman maruhn of munich 's center for applied policy research , explaining why the official program lists such a range of topics . but there 's one issue that is on everyone 's mind and which will likely get the much of the attention over the next six months - the moribund eu constitution .
germany 's progress on finding a compromise regarding the rejected eu constitution will be a major benchmark used to judge berlin 's success , he added . the c word bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters rejected the constitution draft in a referendum vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 , the constitutional treaty had been put on ice for a yearlong " period of reflection " and the controversial issue has begun to reappear on the european agenda as germany takes the eu 's reigns . " expectations toward the german presidency , and angela merkel in particular , are incredibly high , " said katinka barysch of the center for european reform .
" she seems to be very good at listening to people and bringing everybody on board , but whether she is really good at forging consensus - that remains to be seen . " hammering out a constitutional deal will be particularly difficult for germany as it is among the treaty 's strongest supporters and is likely to be viewed as a biased mediator .
french elections , scheduled to be held shortly before the german presidency comes to a close , will also complicate negotiations , barysch added . a natural mediator bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if merkel will be able to unite the eu again merkel , who surprised many at her first european summit as german chancellor by brokering a deal on the bloc 's budget , could make some headway on deciding which parts of the constitution eu members are in favor of saving , according to the german marshall fund 's ulrike guerot . " things can go quickly if they are well orchestrated , and i think the ambition of the german presidency to get a clear roadmap for the constitution is a realistic goal , " guerot said . germany 's geopolitical location in the middle of europe predestines the country for a role as a leader and mediator , especially since it has added european integration to its national interests since the reunification of east and west germany , maruhn said . germany is n't alone on european stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has to convince 26 other national leaders to build a consensus but when it comes to forging compromises on a european level , countries that have expressed skepticism about the treaty , including the netherlands , france , the uk and poland , also have to be willing to negotiate for any progress to be made , according to guerot . " it 's not just about what germany wants to achieve , " she added .
" germany is a key player and a big country so there are big chances to bring things together , but one should not expect germany will fix everything . " but even if germany proves unable to bridge both sides of the constitutional debate , there is a chance for berlin to book a successful presidency by concentrating on endearing the eu to its citizens by reminding them of the peace the eu brought to a war-torn continent , barysch said . " what the germans could achieve is a turnaround in the atmospherics in the eu , " she said .

" we all believe that the death penalty is something that should be rejected , " her colleague , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble , told reporters after informal talks with his and zypries ' eu counterparts in the eastern german city of dresden .
" the eu will continue to campaign for a worldwide abolition , " he stressed . italy has been pushing for a global moratorium on capital punishment since iraq executed former dictator saddam hussein two and a half weeks ago .
rome , which is currently a member of the 15-member un security council , says the 27-member eu should try to increase international support for the diplomatic bid .
botched execution a botched hanging in iraq on monday , which was condemned by european leaders , may have rallied more eu states to the cause . two of saddam hussein 's aides , his half-brother barzan ibrahim al-tikriti and former judge awad hamed al-bandar , were executed for crimes against humanity .
al-tikriti 's head was accidentally ripped off his body by the noose that hanged him .
" reports on the gruesome circumstances of -lrb- monday 's -rrb- executions are very disturbing , " said irish foreign minister dermot ahern .
" i believe it is in the interests of justice and reconciliation in iraq that the iraqi authorities now take the step of ending executions . "

" i believe in our european values and i take this occasion to thank italy for all the initiatives that it announced so that , in the framework of the united nations , we can work together to put an end to the death penalty . " the hangings in iraq were carried out despite international appeals to halt them , including from un secretary general ban ki-moon , the eu and human rights groups that argued the trial was flawed and unfair . experts say influential eu members , such as germany , will be unwilling to irk the united states and other commercial partners such as iran and china , which back the death penalty . capital punishment is banned in the eu , but continues to be permitted in 68 other countries . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stiff eu opposition to death penalty ahead of iraq executions as the eu underlined its opposition to the death penalty in the wake of the botched killing of saddam hussein , a pan-european human rights watchdog has appealed to iraq to stop all further executions .

botched execution a botched hanging in iraq on monday , which was condemned by european leaders , may have rallied more eu states to the cause . two of saddam hussein 's aides , his half-brother barzan ibrahim al-tikriti and former judge awad hamed al-bandar , were executed for crimes against humanity .
al-tikriti 's head was accidentally ripped off his body by the noose that hanged him .
" reports on the gruesome circumstances of -lrb- monday 's -rrb- executions are very disturbing , " said irish foreign minister dermot ahern .
" i believe it is in the interests of justice and reconciliation in iraq that the iraqi authorities now take the step of ending executions . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : italy plans to take advantage of its seat on the un security council hours after the execution , european commission president jose manuel barroso said he backed italy 's campaign to put a stop to capital punishment .
" i believe in our european values and i take this occasion to thank italy for all the initiatives that it announced so that , in the framework of the united nations , we can work together to put an end to the death penalty . " the hangings in iraq were carried out despite international appeals to halt them , including from un secretary general ban ki-moon , the eu and human rights groups that argued the trial was flawed and unfair . experts say influential eu members , such as germany , will be unwilling to irk the united states and other commercial partners such as iran and china , which back the death penalty . capital punishment is banned in the eu , but continues to be permitted in 68 other countries . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de stiff eu opposition to death penalty ahead of iraq executions as the eu underlined its opposition to the death penalty in the wake of the botched killing of saddam hussein , a pan-european human rights watchdog has appealed to iraq to stop all further executions .

" it 's not an overnight decision .
i have thought about it for some time , " deisler said at a news conference in munich . deisler told bayern munich general manager uli hoeness of his decision monday evening . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : honess convinced deisler , center , to stay at bayern 's winter training camp " we fought for sebastian , " said hoeness .
" he is one of the best players there have ever been in germany .
i hoped to the last that it was all a nightmare . " deisler was regarded as the best player in the country of his generation , but he missed both the 2002 and 2006 world cups as a result of knee surgery . he was also absent from the soccer pitch in november 2003 and october 2004 when treated for depression . one of the outstanding players in the germany side that reached the 2005 confederations cup semi-finals , former germany coach jürgen klinsmann had planned to play him on the right of midfield at the 2006 world cup until another knee injury sidelined him for the tournament and most of the current bundesliga season . short comeback at bayern bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : deisler played in 36 national team matches deisler , who was under contract with bayern until 2009 , had made his comeback in the bundesliga before the winter break after suffering cartilage damage in his right knee in training last march . he had just played for germany in a 4-1 defeat against italy in florence on march 1 , the last of his 36 international appearances . during bayern 's training camp in dubai this month he admitted he had been close to quitting the game but said he was now fit . hoeness revealed the player had considered leaving the bayern training camp several times , finally taking the decision to quit on the return to munich . munich leaves door open " should he decide differently at some point , in several months , in a year , he has the option in his contract to return , " hoeness said .
" we have n't had a situation like this before .
now we have to assume that sebastian is quitting soccer .
that 's a fact . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klinsmann hoped deisler could have been a bigger part of the world cup team deisler played just 135 bundesliga games , for borussia mönchengladbach , where his career began , hertha berlin and bayern munich .
there were just 62 league games for bayern since joining the club for some nine million euros -lrb- $ 11.6 million -rrb- after the 2002 world cup . his only major tournament was the 2000 european championships at which he appeared after making his international debut in february of that year against holland . his decision to turn his back on the game is now likely to intensify bayern 's activities in the transfer market .
the german champions are reported to be interested in signing the french midfielder franck ribery from olympique marseille . bayern were also linked earlier this week with chelsea 's dutch winger arjen robben , but hoeness has so far refused to confirm the reports . germany taken by surprise soccer personalities in germany reacted with surprise and sorrow at deisler 's decision . germany coach joachim löw said : " i am extremely sorry that a player of his outstanding abilities has had to end his career in this way .
it is very regrettable for german soccer . " former germany coach rudi völler , who took charge of the national team after the 2000 european championships until stepping down after euro 2004 , said he was shocked at the decision . " i can hardly believe it .

while many topics will eventually get an eu airing , not all issues are created equal . " every eu presidency presents a comprehensive program , but only a small amount of the content is actually new or actually written by the respective government , " said roman maruhn of munich 's center for applied policy research , explaining why the official program lists such a range of topics . but there 's one issue that is on everyone 's mind and which will likely get the much of the attention over the next six months - the moribund eu constitution .
germany 's progress on finding a compromise regarding the rejected eu constitution will be a major benchmark used to judge berlin 's success , he added . the c word bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters rejected the constitution draft in a referendum vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 , the constitutional treaty had been put on ice for a yearlong " period of reflection " and the controversial issue has begun to reappear on the european agenda as germany takes the eu 's reigns . " expectations toward the german presidency , and angela merkel in particular , are incredibly high , " said katinka barysch of the center for european reform .
" she seems to be very good at listening to people and bringing everybody on board , but whether she is really good at forging consensus - that remains to be seen . " hammering out a constitutional deal will be particularly difficult for germany as it is among the treaty 's strongest supporters and is likely to be viewed as a biased mediator .
french elections , scheduled to be held shortly before the german presidency comes to a close , will also complicate negotiations , barysch added . a natural mediator bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if merkel will be able to unite the eu again merkel , who surprised many at her first european summit as german chancellor by brokering a deal on the bloc 's budget , could make some headway on deciding which parts of the constitution eu members are in favor of saving , according to the german marshall fund 's ulrike guerot . " things can go quickly if they are well orchestrated , and i think the ambition of the german presidency to get a clear roadmap for the constitution is a realistic goal , " guerot said . germany 's geopolitical location in the middle of europe predestines the country for a role as a leader and mediator , especially since it has added european integration to its national interests since the reunification of east and west germany , maruhn said . germany is n't alone on european stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has to convince 26 other national leaders to build a consensus but when it comes to forging compromises on a european level , countries that have expressed skepticism about the treaty , including the netherlands , france , the uk and poland , also have to be willing to negotiate for any progress to be made , according to guerot . " it 's not just about what germany wants to achieve , " she added .
" germany is a key player and a big country so there are big chances to bring things together , but one should not expect germany will fix everything . " but even if germany proves unable to bridge both sides of the constitutional debate , there is a chance for berlin to book a successful presidency by concentrating on endearing the eu to its citizens by reminding them of the peace the eu brought to a war-torn continent , barysch said . " what the germans could achieve is a turnaround in the atmospherics in the eu , " she said .

while environmental rights groups are concerned , german airports are eagerly awaiting a deal . it 's no longer surprising for european passengers to play cut-rate prices - sometimes under one euro -lrb- $ 1.30 -rrb- - for an international flight , and the discount airlines offering them , including ryanair , easyjet and germanwings , have managed to take over 30 percent of air traffic market share , accounting for a large part of the increase in international traffic . though pakistan , china and india are all likely to see an average passenger increase of eight percent , discount airlines make up just 10 percent of the asian market and are tightly regulated by national governments , according to the international air transport association . while other asian markets are only beginning to open their airports to regional competition , the airlines , including malaysia 's air asia x , are finding a warmer welcome in europe . 160 euros from london to hong kong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most european discounters said there is no money to be made with long-haul flights germany 's cologne / bonn airport is particularly interested in attracting the asia 's intercontinental flights . " naturally we want be in a position to become the largest ' low-cost ' airport in continental europe and become a european hub for the new ' low-cost ' long-distance carriers , " said michael garvens , head of the cologne / bonn airport . discount airline oasis , which has offered flights from london to hong kong for 160 euros , is likely to offer similarly priced cologne-hong kong fares this year , garvens added . " we have had intensive talks with oasis for two years , " he said .
" it 's in place .
now the only factor is how fast oasis can get the additional airplanes . " can cheap fares be profitable ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne / bonn airport will soon host at least one asian low-cost airline still , some experts are skeptical whether the discount airlines ' business model will also make a profit when it comes to long-haul flights since the low-cost model 's profitability depends on keeping planes in the air , taking off again as soon as possible after an arrival . even though it takes longer to prepare a plane for take off after a 10-hour flight , garvens said he can still see plenty of ways for discount airlines to make a profit with long-distance flights . " the expensive costs for the large , worldwide reservation programs as well as lounges and mileage programs " all represent costs discounters would save , he said , adding that major airlines use profits on their intercontinental flights to make up for losses in continental profits that the discounters would not incur . good for the wallet , bad for the environment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are no exact figures on how much airplanes contribute to greenhouse gas emissions however , a profusion of low-cost intercontinental flights would be a nightmare scenario for environmental protection groups . already critical of growing air traffic , which is a heavy contributor to greenhouse gas emissions , sven harmeling from germanwatch , a group which looks at environmental issues , said measuring the exact effects air traffic has on the climate is difficult but that it is likely to make up between four and nine percent of man-made greenhouse emissions and is sharply increasing . he also said low-cost airlines are sending the wrong signal by implying that there is little cost involved in flying anywhere and everywhere . " we you look at the trend to introduce low-cost flights on long-distance flights , you also have to assume an increase in air traffic - that will be an extremely big climate policy problem , " he said . thomas bärthlein -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de planned berlin airport runs into rough weather again days before work begins on berlin 's long-planned international airport , a few discount carriers have strongly criticized the venture for fear they would face exorbitantly higher costs .

a berlin author is out to find the most beautiful " endangered " word in the german language - and to save other dying words from a morbid fate . new words enter the german language every day .
many of them are borrowed from english , like " blockbuster " and " brunch . "
others - like " cool " and its more german-sounding equivalent " geil " - belong to an ever changing youth culture . omissions are just as common as additions .
some words simply fall into the black hole of disuse .
some are forgotten because they no longer apply to modern life .
still others are eventually rejected for sounding old-fashioned or out-of-date . the older , and more literal " schutzmann " -lrb- protection man -rrb- has been updated as " polizist " -lrb- police officer -rrb- , for example , while " spielautomat " -lrb- slot machine -rrb- has replaced " groschengrab , " which refers to the same thing , but in a more colorful manner .
it literally means " penny grave . " endangered word list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " word doctor " mrozek has published his own lexicon of endangered words bodo mrozek , a 38-year-old author from berlin , has taken on the sisyphean task of rescuing endangered words and even trying to reinstate some of them into modern german speech . " if you grew up in the 1980s then you heard about forests being cut down and whales becoming extinct , " said mrozek in an interview with the tageszeitung .
" but no one lobbied for words and that 's why i think it 's important to take on this underestimated threat . " in his quest to find the most beautiful endangered german word , mrozek has invited the public to suggest their favorites through feb .
28 , 2007 . the person who submits the winning word , selected by a panel of five well-known german authors , will receive a trophy shaped like a cheeseball adorned with toothpicks .
in german this party appetizer is called a " käseigel , " which literally means " cheese hedgehog " and , appropriately , is among the many endangered words mrozek is lobbying for . so far , 25,000 words have been submitted , 800 of which have made it to mrozek 's so-called red list of endangered words . english less threatened according to mrozek , german words are in greater danger than their english counterparts . germany 's authoritative duden lexicon is content to let words slip through the linguistic cracks .
it simply omits those that have fallen out of use , mrozek told tageszeitung . the oxford english dictionary , on the other hand , sees itself as a documenter of the english language and still contains words from shakespeare 's time , added the author . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : does old have to mean old-fashioned ?
trend-setting with old-fashioned words mrozek says he hopes that lost words can be rejuvenated if people overcome feelings of being " uncool " and start using them again . while mrozek 's efforts to solicit submissions has met with success , it will likely be more difficult to convince people to invite their friends to " gabelsfrüstück " -lrb- literally , fork breakfast -rrb- instead of " brunch " or to come along to the local cinema on friday night for the lastest hollywood " kassenschlager " -lrb- literally , cash register hitter -rrb- instead of a " blockbuster . " to some , the older german version sounds a bit too folksy .
in a country where patriotism is still equated with nationalism , some german-speakers are concerned about sounding too german - even right-wing - and not international enough . for those words that ca n't be resuscitated , a graveyard could be constructed , said mrozek .
it would have to be in an endangered area , such as in a derelict town in eastern germany or a run-down industrial park in western germany .
and the craftsmen , whose professions are likewise endangered , would use endangered tools to fashion gravestones for the words that have passed out of the standard vocabulary and into word heaven . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de when german words travel , our zeitgeist goes oom-pah-pah why do finnish buses take coffee breaks ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de political parties -pipe- 16.01.2007 top german politician facing pressure to resign as state premier großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber 's days as an attack dog of german politics appear numbered the chair of long-time german powerbroker edmund stoiber is wobbling .
pressure is growing on the conservative bavarian premier to step down and the repercussions could be felt in the german capital as well . the usual snow may be missing this year at the remote bavarian resort of wildbad kreuth .
but an icy wind is blowing at the closed retreat of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- currently meeting there .
the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is meeting in kreuth to discuss the future of the csu and , more importantly , its veteran state premier , edmund stoiber . stoiber is under mounting pressure to either resign or not seek re-election in 2008 .
the csu has held an absolute majority in the bavarian parliament for over 30 years .
yet support for the conservatives has dipped below 50 percent in state-wide opinion polls after it became known that his top aide had pried into the private life of csu rival and staunch stoiber critic gabriele pauli . " the consensus in the party leadership is that he must go before bavarian local elections in the spring of 2008 , " the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung said in an editorial on monday .
" it 's just that nobody wants to tell him this . " according to the opposition , it 's time for a change . " bavaria deserves better than this , " said franz maget , head of bavaria 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , who has called for immediate early elections .
" that 's why it 's time for the premier to hand in his resignation . " but stoiber put on a brave face as he arrived in kreuth on monday . " i 'm fighting for my goals , for bavaria 's success , and for the success of the csu , " stoiber said . the cdu in berlin depends on bavaria 's csu the csu holds a unique position in germany 's political landscape .
under a longtime power-sharing pact , the csu confines itself to bavaria and merkel 's cdu never seeks office inside the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel had happier days during the 2005 campaign the csu is a party outside of the cdu 's control , yet both make up a common group in the federal parliament .
this means merkel needs csu support to push through her party 's platform . but stoiber 's recent opposition to government reform plans , in particular to the healthcare system , has hurt merkel 's popularity and the two have a strained relationship .
stoiber has also been a loud critic of germany 's federalism reform , which regulates berlin 's authority over the country 's 16 states . many cdu allies have been angered by stoiber 's public criticism of merkel while she was struggling to keep a coalition with the spd on an even keel .
fears are growing in his own party that he would drag down csu candidates at local polls , as well . a bavarian premier enjoys royal benefits a state premier in munich is all but a successor to the former kings of bavaria , enjoying the use of royal palaces , dominating every aspect of administration and basking in the acclaim of the mainly catholic population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber gave pope benedict xvi the royal treatment during his visit when bavarian-born pope benedict xvi visited bavaria in september 2006 , stoiber played host at the king 's palace in munich , posing his children and grandchildren with the pontiff for an official photo . stoiber has been running bavaria - one of germany 's most prosperous regions - for almost 14 years .
in 2002 , he failed in his bid to become german chancellor , losing out to incumbent gerhard schröder in one of the narrowest votes in post-war history . then in 2005 , he wavered over joining the new coalition government in berlin as economics minister before opting to stay in bavaria .
many critics interpreted this decision to be based on stoiber 's inability to operate as freely in the big city capital as he could in his " royal surroundings " in munich . the push for power is turning into a dirty fight although the csu faction has yet to make an official decision on stoiber , several leading party politicians have been named as possible successors .
bavaria 's interior minister , günther beckstein , could become premier , with german agriculture minister horst seehofer as party chief .
but rumors of seehofer having an extramarital affair hit the german mass-circulation tabloid bild on monday , with a tuesday report claiming his girlfriend was expecting a child . bild quoted an unnamed csu functionary as its source .
now , politicians are asking who out of their own ranks would spread this rumor . the speculations about seehofer 's private life are reminiscent of similar events back in 1993 , when stoiber was battling bavaria 's premier at the time , theo waigel .
stoiber was able to win , after waigel 's affair with the professional skier irene epple was leaked to the press .
waigel married epple in 1994 and they have one son . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties set political agendas for 2007 the new year is the time when germany 's political parties meet to map out their strategies for the coming year and health and labor reforms look set to dominate the political agenda in 2007 .

the city-state 's purchase would help meet aims to keep the shares in german hands . the bremen government is prepared to spend 30 million euros -lrb- $ 38.7 million -rrb- to acquire part of the european aeronautics defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- .
the northern german city-state would then hold 2 percent of the 7.5 percent stake daimlerchrysler has put up for sale . mayor jens böhrnsen and his deputy thomas röwekamp agreed on the sum monday and will make a proposal to the regional government on tuesday , a spokesman said . other german local governments over the weekend hinted that they were also interested in acquiring part of the daimlerchrysler stake , as part of a bid to keep it in german hands .
these include the city state of hamburg and the northwestern state of lower saxony .
both are , like bremen , home to eads factories or offices . support from berlin for new shareholder structure after months of protracted negotiations , german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in a newspaper interview last week that a solution had been found with regard to eads ' shareholder structure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg is home to eads company airbus berlin has long feared that france could gain the upper hand in the long-running power struggle at eads when german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler cuts its stake from 22.5 percent to 15 percent . such concerns gained more urgency from eads ' financial crisis , triggered by problems at aircraft maker airbus .
there has been speculation that france could seek to increase its stake in eads via a possible capital hike . keeping stake in german hands a top priority berlin is adamant that the 7.5-percent stake being put up for sale by daimlerchrysler remain in german hands and must not be allowed to fall under french or even russian control . but moscow is also keen to increase its say in eads after state-owned bank vneshtorgbank bought a 5.02 percent stake in september 2006 .
spanish interests are represented by the holding group sepi , which owns 5.48 percent . daimlerchrysler effectively represents german interests in the company , while france is represented via a 30 percent stake shared by the state holding company sogeade and media group lagardere . lagardere has committed itself to cutting its stake to put french interests back on a par with germany 's .
but the balance of power would be upset again if daimlerchrysler were to reduce its stake further . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deal reportedly reached on daimlerchrysler 's stake in eads agreement has finally been reached regarding the sale of part of daimlerchrysler 's stake in european aerospace giant eads , with a deal to be announced in the next two weeks , according to a german government spokesman .

a berlin author is out to find the most beautiful " endangered " word in the german language - and to save other dying words from a morbid fate . new words enter the german language every day .
many of them are borrowed from english , like " blockbuster " and " brunch . "
others - like " cool " and its more german-sounding equivalent " geil " - belong to an ever changing youth culture . omissions are just as common as additions .
some words simply fall into the black hole of disuse .
some are forgotten because they no longer apply to modern life .
still others are eventually rejected for sounding old-fashioned or out-of-date . the older , and more literal " schutzmann " -lrb- protection man -rrb- has been updated as " polizist " -lrb- police officer -rrb- , for example , while " spielautomat " -lrb- slot machine -rrb- has replaced " groschengrab , " which refers to the same thing , but in a more colorful manner .
it literally means " penny grave . " endangered word list bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " word doctor " mrozek has published his own lexicon of endangered words bodo mrozek , a 38-year-old author from berlin , has taken on the sisyphean task of rescuing endangered words and even trying to reinstate some of them into modern german speech . " if you grew up in the 1980s then you heard about forests being cut down and whales becoming extinct , " said mrozek in an interview with the tageszeitung .

" we are going to make an inventory of our laws ... to come up with the best policy examples , " said german justice minister brigitte zypries on tuesday , following a meeting with her eu colleagues in dresden , eastern germany . " each member state will decide which video games are violent , " said eu justice commissioner franco frattini .
" it 's not up to brussels to decide . "
" but the protection of children can not have borders , " he added , calling for action from the creators and producers of violent video games .
" prevention is better than repression . " frattini said the current self-regulating system used by the industry to classify videos according to levels of sex and violence was failing .
it has been in effect in 14 eu countries since 2003 . " the weakness of the self-control system is the lack of control when selling video games .
it is very difficult to check the identity -lrb- and age -rrb- of the young people who are buying the video games .
retailers should be liable to punitive measures , " he added , calling on the 27 eu nations to increase their controls .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : games sold over the counter can be controlled to some extent frattini said he remained convinced there was a link between violent videos and violence in society , though he admitted experts remained divided on the subject .
" like banning rain " last november , frattini highlighted one newly available video game , " the rule of rose , " as an example of why action was required .
the game depicted physical and psychological violence meted out on a young girl .
controversy in britain led the games publisher , 505 games , to keep it off store shelves . during their debate the justice ministers watched an extract of " manhunt , " a violent game for adults which has been a big hit on the internet . the debate came to life again in germany in late november after an 18-year-old , said to be an avid computer game player , opened fire at his old school and injured several people before killing himself . the german state of bavaria is now seeking to modify federal law , already one of the strongest in europe , to explicitly ban violent computer games , even on the internet . but the federal justice minister said that a ban on web-based games was very unlikely to happen . " you ca n't ban games on the internet , " said zypries on tuesday .

the city-state 's purchase would help meet aims to keep the shares in german hands . the bremen government is prepared to spend 30 million euros -lrb- $ 38.7 million -rrb- to acquire part of the european aeronautics defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- .
the northern german city-state would then hold 2 percent of the 7.5 percent stake daimlerchrysler has put up for sale . mayor jens böhrnsen and his deputy thomas röwekamp agreed on the sum monday and will make a proposal to the regional government on tuesday , a spokesman said . other german local governments over the weekend hinted that they were also interested in acquiring part of the daimlerchrysler stake , as part of a bid to keep it in german hands .
these include the city state of hamburg and the northwestern state of lower saxony .
both are , like bremen , home to eads factories or offices . support from berlin for new shareholder structure after months of protracted negotiations , german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in a newspaper interview last week that a solution had been found with regard to eads ' shareholder structure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg is home to eads company airbus berlin has long feared that france could gain the upper hand in the long-running power struggle at eads when german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler cuts its stake from 22.5 percent to 15 percent . such concerns gained more urgency from eads ' financial crisis , triggered by problems at aircraft maker airbus .
there has been speculation that france could seek to increase its stake in eads via a possible capital hike . keeping stake in german hands a top priority berlin is adamant that the 7.5-percent stake being put up for sale by daimlerchrysler remain in german hands and must not be allowed to fall under french or even russian control . but moscow is also keen to increase its say in eads after state-owned bank vneshtorgbank bought a 5.02 percent stake in september 2006 .
spanish interests are represented by the holding group sepi , which owns 5.48 percent . daimlerchrysler effectively represents german interests in the company , while france is represented via a 30 percent stake shared by the state holding company sogeade and media group lagardere . lagardere has committed itself to cutting its stake to put french interests back on a par with germany 's .
but the balance of power would be upset again if daimlerchrysler were to reduce its stake further . dw staff / afp -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de deal reportedly reached on daimlerchrysler 's stake in eads agreement has finally been reached regarding the sale of part of daimlerchrysler 's stake in european aerospace giant eads , with a deal to be announced in the next two weeks , according to a german government spokesman .

while environmental rights groups are concerned , german airports are eagerly awaiting a deal . it 's no longer surprising for european passengers to play cut-rate prices - sometimes under one euro -lrb- $ 1.30 -rrb- - for an international flight , and the discount airlines offering them , including ryanair , easyjet and germanwings , have managed to take over 30 percent of air traffic market share , accounting for a large part of the increase in international traffic . though pakistan , china and india are all likely to see an average passenger increase of eight percent , discount airlines make up just 10 percent of the asian market and are tightly regulated by national governments , according to the international air transport association . while other asian markets are only beginning to open their airports to regional competition , the airlines , including malaysia 's air asia x , are finding a warmer welcome in europe . 160 euros from london to hong kong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most european discounters said there is no money to be made with long-haul flights germany 's cologne / bonn airport is particularly interested in attracting the asia 's intercontinental flights . " naturally we want be in a position to become the largest ' low-cost ' airport in continental europe and become a european hub for the new ' low-cost ' long-distance carriers , " said michael garvens , head of the cologne / bonn airport . discount airline oasis , which has offered flights from london to hong kong for 160 euros , is likely to offer similarly priced cologne-hong kong fares this year , garvens added . " we have had intensive talks with oasis for two years , " he said .
" it 's in place .
now the only factor is how fast oasis can get the additional airplanes . " can cheap fares be profitable ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne / bonn airport will soon host at least one asian low-cost airline still , some experts are skeptical whether the discount airlines ' business model will also make a profit when it comes to long-haul flights since the low-cost model 's profitability depends on keeping planes in the air , taking off again as soon as possible after an arrival . even though it takes longer to prepare a plane for take off after a 10-hour flight , garvens said he can still see plenty of ways for discount airlines to make a profit with long-distance flights . " the expensive costs for the large , worldwide reservation programs as well as lounges and mileage programs " all represent costs discounters would save , he said , adding that major airlines use profits on their intercontinental flights to make up for losses in continental profits that the discounters would not incur . good for the wallet , bad for the environment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are no exact figures on how much airplanes contribute to greenhouse gas emissions however , a profusion of low-cost intercontinental flights would be a nightmare scenario for environmental protection groups . already critical of growing air traffic , which is a heavy contributor to greenhouse gas emissions , sven harmeling from germanwatch , a group which looks at environmental issues , said measuring the exact effects air traffic has on the climate is difficult but that it is likely to make up between four and nine percent of man-made greenhouse emissions and is sharply increasing . he also said low-cost airlines are sending the wrong signal by implying that there is little cost involved in flying anywhere and everywhere . " we you look at the trend to introduce low-cost flights on long-distance flights , you also have to assume an increase in air traffic - that will be an extremely big climate policy problem , " he said . thomas bärthlein -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de planned berlin airport runs into rough weather again days before work begins on berlin 's long-planned international airport , a few discount carriers have strongly criticized the venture for fear they would face exorbitantly higher costs .

the formal setting up of the bloc allows it various rights including receiving official funding of around one million euros -lrb- $ 770,000 -rrb- and certain speaking rights . french national front mep bruno gollnisch will lead the new far right bloc , whose founding principles include recognizing " national interests , sovereignties , identities and differences , " and opposing a " unitary , bureaucratic , european superstate .

its formation was made possible by the accession of romania and bulgaria to the eu on jan.1 , as five romanian meps have signed up as well as a bulgarian . there are also three belgian deputies from the flemish nationalist vlaams belang party , including its president franck vanhecke . the membership list also includes austrian andreas molzer , british mep ashley mote and alessandra mussolini , the granddaughter of italian wartime dictator benito mussolini . socialist group leader martin schulz immediately questioned the group 's legitimacy , asking whether it adhered to the rules of parliament which stipulate that the members of a group must share a political position . but borrell rejected the call for an enquiry into the group 's legitimacy , noting that the 20 members had all signed a political declaration . defensive moves schulz , nonetheless , called on meps to prevent the new far-right group from securing senior positions in the european parliament . immediately after the announcement of the 20-member group 's formation , schulz wrote to fellow leaders of the parliament 's democratic groups , urging them to deny the new group posts under the proportional system of appointment . " we must not abandon this parliament , which symbolizes the integration of europe , to those who deny all european values , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's most famous far-right politician , jean-marie le pen , is a member after reports that he had been described as a " totalitarian " by gollnisch , schulz said : " to be attacked by a man who is a holocaust denier and who represents the neo-fascist movement is an honor for me .

pressure is growing on the conservative bavarian premier to step down and the repercussions could be felt in the german capital as well . the usual snow may be missing this year at the remote bavarian resort of wildbad kreuth .
but an icy wind is blowing at the closed retreat of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- currently meeting there .
the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is meeting in kreuth to discuss the future of the csu and , more importantly , its veteran state premier , edmund stoiber . stoiber is under mounting pressure to either resign or not seek re-election in 2008 .
the csu has held an absolute majority in the bavarian parliament for over 30 years .
yet support for the conservatives has dipped below 50 percent in state-wide opinion polls after it became known that his top aide had pried into the private life of csu rival and staunch stoiber critic gabriele pauli . " the consensus in the party leadership is that he must go before bavarian local elections in the spring of 2008 , " the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung said in an editorial on monday .
" it 's just that nobody wants to tell him this . " according to the opposition , it 's time for a change . " bavaria deserves better than this , " said franz maget , head of bavaria 's social democratic party -lrb- spd -rrb- , who has called for immediate early elections .
" that 's why it 's time for the premier to hand in his resignation . " but stoiber put on a brave face as he arrived in kreuth on monday . " i 'm fighting for my goals , for bavaria 's success , and for the success of the csu , " stoiber said . the cdu in berlin depends on bavaria 's csu the csu holds a unique position in germany 's political landscape .
under a longtime power-sharing pact , the csu confines itself to bavaria and merkel 's cdu never seeks office inside the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel had happier days during the 2005 campaign the csu is a party outside of the cdu 's control , yet both make up a common group in the federal parliament .
this means merkel needs csu support to push through her party 's platform . but stoiber 's recent opposition to government reform plans , in particular to the healthcare system , has hurt merkel 's popularity and the two have a strained relationship .
stoiber has also been a loud critic of germany 's federalism reform , which regulates berlin 's authority over the country 's 16 states . many cdu allies have been angered by stoiber 's public criticism of merkel while she was struggling to keep a coalition with the spd on an even keel .
fears are growing in his own party that he would drag down csu candidates at local polls , as well . a bavarian premier enjoys royal benefits a state premier in munich is all but a successor to the former kings of bavaria , enjoying the use of royal palaces , dominating every aspect of administration and basking in the acclaim of the mainly catholic population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber gave pope benedict xvi the royal treatment during his visit when bavarian-born pope benedict xvi visited bavaria in september 2006 , stoiber played host at the king 's palace in munich , posing his children and grandchildren with the pontiff for an official photo . stoiber has been running bavaria - one of germany 's most prosperous regions - for almost 14 years .
in 2002 , he failed in his bid to become german chancellor , losing out to incumbent gerhard schröder in one of the narrowest votes in post-war history . then in 2005 , he wavered over joining the new coalition government in berlin as economics minister before opting to stay in bavaria .
many critics interpreted this decision to be based on stoiber 's inability to operate as freely in the big city capital as he could in his " royal surroundings " in munich . the push for power is turning into a dirty fight although the csu faction has yet to make an official decision on stoiber , several leading party politicians have been named as possible successors .
bavaria 's interior minister , günther beckstein , could become premier , with german agriculture minister horst seehofer as party chief .
but rumors of seehofer having an extramarital affair hit the german mass-circulation tabloid bild on monday , with a tuesday report claiming his girlfriend was expecting a child . bild quoted an unnamed csu functionary as its source .
now , politicians are asking who out of their own ranks would spread this rumor . the speculations about seehofer 's private life are reminiscent of similar events back in 1993 , when stoiber was battling bavaria 's premier at the time , theo waigel .
stoiber was able to win , after waigel 's affair with the professional skier irene epple was leaked to the press .
waigel married epple in 1994 and they have one son . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german parties set political agendas for 2007 the new year is the time when germany 's political parties meet to map out their strategies for the coming year and health and labor reforms look set to dominate the political agenda in 2007 .

while many topics will eventually get an eu airing , not all issues are created equal . " every eu presidency presents a comprehensive program , but only a small amount of the content is actually new or actually written by the respective government , " said roman maruhn of munich 's center for applied policy research , explaining why the official program lists such a range of topics . but there 's one issue that is on everyone 's mind and which will likely get the much of the attention over the next six months - the moribund eu constitution .
germany 's progress on finding a compromise regarding the rejected eu constitution will be a major benchmark used to judge berlin 's success , he added . the c word bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french voters rejected the constitution draft in a referendum vetoed by french and dutch voters in 2005 , the constitutional treaty had been put on ice for a yearlong " period of reflection " and the controversial issue has begun to reappear on the european agenda as germany takes the eu 's reigns . " expectations toward the german presidency , and angela merkel in particular , are incredibly high , " said katinka barysch of the center for european reform .
" she seems to be very good at listening to people and bringing everybody on board , but whether she is really good at forging consensus - that remains to be seen . " hammering out a constitutional deal will be particularly difficult for germany as it is among the treaty 's strongest supporters and is likely to be viewed as a biased mediator .
french elections , scheduled to be held shortly before the german presidency comes to a close , will also complicate negotiations , barysch added . a natural mediator bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some wonder if merkel will be able to unite the eu again merkel , who surprised many at her first european summit as german chancellor by brokering a deal on the bloc 's budget , could make some headway on deciding which parts of the constitution eu members are in favor of saving , according to the german marshall fund 's ulrike guerot . " things can go quickly if they are well orchestrated , and i think the ambition of the german presidency to get a clear roadmap for the constitution is a realistic goal , " guerot said . germany 's geopolitical location in the middle of europe predestines the country for a role as a leader and mediator , especially since it has added european integration to its national interests since the reunification of east and west germany , maruhn said . germany is n't alone on european stage bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin has to convince 26 other national leaders to build a consensus but when it comes to forging compromises on a european level , countries that have expressed skepticism about the treaty , including the netherlands , france , the uk and poland , also have to be willing to negotiate for any progress to be made , according to guerot . " it 's not just about what germany wants to achieve , " she added .
" germany is a key player and a big country so there are big chances to bring things together , but one should not expect germany will fix everything . " but even if germany proves unable to bridge both sides of the constitutional debate , there is a chance for berlin to book a successful presidency by concentrating on endearing the eu to its citizens by reminding them of the peace the eu brought to a war-torn continent , barysch said .

the formal setting up of the bloc allows it various rights including receiving official funding of around one million euros -lrb- $ 770,000 -rrb- and certain speaking rights . french national front mep bruno gollnisch will lead the new far right bloc , whose founding principles include recognizing " national interests , sovereignties , identities and differences , " and opposing a " unitary , bureaucratic , european superstate .

the northern german city-state would then hold 2 percent of the 7.5 percent stake daimlerchrysler has put up for sale . mayor jens böhrnsen and his deputy thomas röwekamp agreed on the sum monday and will make a proposal to the regional government on tuesday , a spokesman said . other german local governments over the weekend hinted that they were also interested in acquiring part of the daimlerchrysler stake , as part of a bid to keep it in german hands .

there has been speculation that france could seek to increase its stake in eads via a possible capital hike . keeping stake in german hands a top priority berlin is adamant that the 7.5-percent stake being put up for sale by daimlerchrysler remain in german hands and must not be allowed to fall under french or even russian control . but moscow is also keen to increase its say in eads after state-owned bank vneshtorgbank bought a 5.02 percent stake in september 2006 .

pressure is growing on the conservative bavarian premier to step down and the repercussions could be felt in the german capital as well . the usual snow may be missing this year at the remote bavarian resort of wildbad kreuth .
but an icy wind is blowing at the closed retreat of the christian social union -lrb- csu -rrb- currently meeting there .
the bavarian sister party to chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union -lrb- cdu -rrb- is meeting in kreuth to discuss the future of the csu and , more importantly , its veteran state premier , edmund stoiber . stoiber is under mounting pressure to either resign or not seek re-election in 2008 .
the csu has held an absolute majority in the bavarian parliament for over 30 years .
yet support for the conservatives has dipped below 50 percent in state-wide opinion polls after it became known that his top aide had pried into the private life of csu rival and staunch stoiber critic gabriele pauli . " the consensus in the party leadership is that he must go before bavarian local elections in the spring of 2008 , " the munich-based süddeutsche zeitung said in an editorial on monday .

in 2002 , he failed in his bid to become german chancellor , losing out to incumbent gerhard schröder in one of the narrowest votes in post-war history . then in 2005 , he wavered over joining the new coalition government in berlin as economics minister before opting to stay in bavaria .
many critics interpreted this decision to be based on stoiber 's inability to operate as freely in the big city capital as he could in his " royal surroundings " in munich . the push for power is turning into a dirty fight although the csu faction has yet to make an official decision on stoiber , several leading party politicians have been named as possible successors .

under a longtime power-sharing pact , the csu confines itself to bavaria and merkel 's cdu never seeks office inside the state . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber and merkel had happier days during the 2005 campaign the csu is a party outside of the cdu 's control , yet both make up a common group in the federal parliament .
this means merkel needs csu support to push through her party 's platform . but stoiber 's recent opposition to government reform plans , in particular to the healthcare system , has hurt merkel 's popularity and the two have a strained relationship .
stoiber has also been a loud critic of germany 's federalism reform , which regulates berlin 's authority over the country 's 16 states . many cdu allies have been angered by stoiber 's public criticism of merkel while she was struggling to keep a coalition with the spd on an even keel .
fears are growing in his own party that he would drag down csu candidates at local polls , as well . a bavarian premier enjoys royal benefits a state premier in munich is all but a successor to the former kings of bavaria , enjoying the use of royal palaces , dominating every aspect of administration and basking in the acclaim of the mainly catholic population . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : stoiber gave pope benedict xvi the royal treatment during his visit when bavarian-born pope benedict xvi visited bavaria in september 2006 , stoiber played host at the king 's palace in munich , posing his children and grandchildren with the pontiff for an official photo . stoiber has been running bavaria - one of germany 's most prosperous regions - for almost 14 years .
in 2002 , he failed in his bid to become german chancellor , losing out to incumbent gerhard schröder in one of the narrowest votes in post-war history . then in 2005 , he wavered over joining the new coalition government in berlin as economics minister before opting to stay in bavaria .
many critics interpreted this decision to be based on stoiber 's inability to operate as freely in the big city capital as he could in his " royal surroundings " in munich . the push for power is turning into a dirty fight although the csu faction has yet to make an official decision on stoiber , several leading party politicians have been named as possible successors .
bavaria 's interior minister , günther beckstein , could become premier , with german agriculture minister horst seehofer as party chief .
but rumors of seehofer having an extramarital affair hit the german mass-circulation tabloid bild on monday , with a tuesday report claiming his girlfriend was expecting a child . bild quoted an unnamed csu functionary as its source .
now , politicians are asking who out of their own ranks would spread this rumor . the speculations about seehofer 's private life are reminiscent of similar events back in 1993 , when stoiber was battling bavaria 's premier at the time , theo waigel .
stoiber was able to win , after waigel 's affair with the professional skier irene epple was leaked to the press .

" the eu will continue to campaign for a worldwide abolition , " he stressed . italy has been pushing for a global moratorium on capital punishment since iraq executed former dictator saddam hussein two and a half weeks ago .
rome , which is currently a member of the 15-member un security council , says the 27-member eu should try to increase international support for the diplomatic bid .
botched execution a botched hanging in iraq on monday , which was condemned by european leaders , may have rallied more eu states to the cause . two of saddam hussein 's aides , his half-brother barzan ibrahim al-tikriti and former judge awad hamed al-bandar , were executed for crimes against humanity .
al-tikriti 's head was accidentally ripped off his body by the noose that hanged him .

the city-state 's purchase would help meet aims to keep the shares in german hands . the bremen government is prepared to spend 30 million euros -lrb- $ 38.7 million -rrb- to acquire part of the european aeronautics defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- .
the northern german city-state would then hold 2 percent of the 7.5 percent stake daimlerchrysler has put up for sale . mayor jens böhrnsen and his deputy thomas röwekamp agreed on the sum monday and will make a proposal to the regional government on tuesday , a spokesman said . other german local governments over the weekend hinted that they were also interested in acquiring part of the daimlerchrysler stake , as part of a bid to keep it in german hands .
these include the city state of hamburg and the northwestern state of lower saxony .
both are , like bremen , home to eads factories or offices . support from berlin for new shareholder structure after months of protracted negotiations , german government spokesman ulrich wilhelm said in a newspaper interview last week that a solution had been found with regard to eads ' shareholder structure . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hamburg is home to eads company airbus berlin has long feared that france could gain the upper hand in the long-running power struggle at eads when german-us auto giant daimlerchrysler cuts its stake from 22.5 percent to 15 percent . such concerns gained more urgency from eads ' financial crisis , triggered by problems at aircraft maker airbus .
there has been speculation that france could seek to increase its stake in eads via a possible capital hike . keeping stake in german hands a top priority berlin is adamant that the 7.5-percent stake being put up for sale by daimlerchrysler remain in german hands and must not be allowed to fall under french or even russian control . but moscow is also keen to increase its say in eads after state-owned bank vneshtorgbank bought a 5.02 percent stake in september 2006 .
spanish interests are represented by the holding group sepi , which owns 5.48 percent . daimlerchrysler effectively represents german interests in the company , while france is represented via a 30 percent stake shared by the state holding company sogeade and media group lagardere . lagardere has committed itself to cutting its stake to put french interests back on a par with germany 's .

while environmental rights groups are concerned , german airports are eagerly awaiting a deal . it 's no longer surprising for european passengers to play cut-rate prices - sometimes under one euro -lrb- $ 1.30 -rrb- - for an international flight , and the discount airlines offering them , including ryanair , easyjet and germanwings , have managed to take over 30 percent of air traffic market share , accounting for a large part of the increase in international traffic . though pakistan , china and india are all likely to see an average passenger increase of eight percent , discount airlines make up just 10 percent of the asian market and are tightly regulated by national governments , according to the international air transport association . while other asian markets are only beginning to open their airports to regional competition , the airlines , including malaysia 's air asia x , are finding a warmer welcome in europe . 160 euros from london to hong kong bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most european discounters said there is no money to be made with long-haul flights germany 's cologne / bonn airport is particularly interested in attracting the asia 's intercontinental flights . " naturally we want be in a position to become the largest ' low-cost ' airport in continental europe and become a european hub for the new ' low-cost ' long-distance carriers , " said michael garvens , head of the cologne / bonn airport . discount airline oasis , which has offered flights from london to hong kong for 160 euros , is likely to offer similarly priced cologne-hong kong fares this year , garvens added . " we have had intensive talks with oasis for two years , " he said .
" it 's in place .
now the only factor is how fast oasis can get the additional airplanes . " can cheap fares be profitable ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cologne / bonn airport will soon host at least one asian low-cost airline still , some experts are skeptical whether the discount airlines ' business model will also make a profit when it comes to long-haul flights since the low-cost model 's profitability depends on keeping planes in the air , taking off again as soon as possible after an arrival . even though it takes longer to prepare a plane for take off after a 10-hour flight , garvens said he can still see plenty of ways for discount airlines to make a profit with long-distance flights . " the expensive costs for the large , worldwide reservation programs as well as lounges and mileage programs " all represent costs discounters would save , he said , adding that major airlines use profits on their intercontinental flights to make up for losses in continental profits that the discounters would not incur . good for the wallet , bad for the environment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are no exact figures on how much airplanes contribute to greenhouse gas emissions however , a profusion of low-cost intercontinental flights would be a nightmare scenario for environmental protection groups . already critical of growing air traffic , which is a heavy contributor to greenhouse gas emissions , sven harmeling from germanwatch , a group which looks at environmental issues , said measuring the exact effects air traffic has on the climate is difficult but that it is likely to make up between four and nine percent of man-made greenhouse emissions and is sharply increasing . he also said low-cost airlines are sending the wrong signal by implying that there is little cost involved in flying anywhere and everywhere . " we you look at the trend to introduce low-cost flights on long-distance flights , you also have to assume an increase in air traffic - that will be an extremely big climate policy problem , " he said . thomas bärthlein -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de planned berlin airport runs into rough weather again days before work begins on berlin 's long-planned international airport , a few discount carriers have strongly criticized the venture for fear they would face exorbitantly higher costs .

the formal setting up of the bloc allows it various rights including receiving official funding of around one million euros -lrb- $ 770,000 -rrb- and certain speaking rights . french national front mep bruno gollnisch will lead the new far right bloc , whose founding principles include recognizing " national interests , sovereignties , identities and differences , " and opposing a " unitary , bureaucratic , european superstate .

its formation was made possible by the accession of romania and bulgaria to the eu on jan.1 , as five romanian meps have signed up as well as a bulgarian . there are also three belgian deputies from the flemish nationalist vlaams belang party , including its president franck vanhecke . the membership list also includes austrian andreas molzer , british mep ashley mote and alessandra mussolini , the granddaughter of italian wartime dictator benito mussolini . socialist group leader martin schulz immediately questioned the group 's legitimacy , asking whether it adhered to the rules of parliament which stipulate that the members of a group must share a political position . but borrell rejected the call for an enquiry into the group 's legitimacy , noting that the 20 members had all signed a political declaration . defensive moves schulz , nonetheless , called on meps to prevent the new far-right group from securing senior positions in the european parliament . immediately after the announcement of the 20-member group 's formation , schulz wrote to fellow leaders of the parliament 's democratic groups , urging them to deny the new group posts under the proportional system of appointment . " we must not abandon this parliament , which symbolizes the integration of europe , to those who deny all european values , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's most famous far-right politician , jean-marie le pen , is a member after reports that he had been described as a " totalitarian " by gollnisch , schulz said : " to be attacked by a man who is a holocaust denier and who represents the neo-fascist movement is an honor for me . " in his letter to other group leaders , schulz said that while the new group would enjoy the privileges and staffing normally given to a political group they should not be approved as vice-presidents of parliamentary committees . it is not the first time that the far-right has had a bloc in the assembly .

bbc news -pipe- uk -pipe- scotland -pipe- more poll questions than answers home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help one-minute world news news services your news when you want it news front page africa americas asia-pacific europe middle east south asia uk england northern ireland scotland wales uk politics education magazine business health science & environment technology entertainment also in the news - video and audio - programmes have your say in pictures country profiles special reports related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : tuesday , 16 january 2007 , 06:23 gmt e-mail this to a friend printable version more poll questions than answers by brian taylor political editor , bbc scotland just what do the scots want ?
do they want independence ?
do they want to end the union ?
it depends , it would appear , upon how you pose the question .
it has been 300 years since the act of union was signed glance at the bbc / orb poll published to coincide with the special newsnight debate in edinburgh to commemorate 300 years since scottish politicians voted for the union with england .
voters were asked whether they wanted the union to " continue as it is or see it come to an end " .
they were further reminded that ending the union would " mean that scotland became an independent country " .
the responses suggest that 56 % of scots would prefer the continuing union , compared with 32 % favouring its end .
in england , the figures were 73 % supporting the union with 16 % urging an end .
the scottish figures are comparable with a yougov poll in the sunday times which indicated that 53 % of scots thought the union " worth maintaining " while 33 % did not .
that would appear to be relatively clear .
but look more closely at that and other polls .
narrow majority look at yougov in the sunday times last september .
respondents then were asked : " if there was a referendum tomorrow on whether scotland should become independent , how would you vote ? "
there was an apparent narrow majority for independence , 44 % to 42 % .
look at an icm poll in the sunday telegraph in november , suggesting 59 % to 28 % approval for " scotland becoming an independent country " .
similar wording in an icm poll for the mail in january suggested 51 % approval for scotland becoming independent , with 36 % disapproving .
english respondents also indicated support for scottish independence , by 48 % to 39 % .
the issue of the union is to the fore in a scottish election year how to explain these disparities ?
it would appear that , if you stress soothing longer-term concepts like " becoming independent " , then there is potential support for independence .
nationalists say that would be the wording in their planned referendum , highlighting the move to independence as a process .
by contrast , if you lay stress on immediate issues like ending or breaking the union , then potential support apparently declines .
unionist politicians say that is the reality of what independence would involve .
further , the sunday times poll suggests popular apprehension that there might be tax rises or spending cuts under independence .
labour says that indicates their claim of a " black hole " in snp economic plans is getting through to voters .
' scare stories ' nationalists say the sunday times poll suggests they can build support for independence by neutralising what they call " labour scare stories " .
the bbc poll , of course , features both elements of the union question in that it talks of the union coming to an end but also points out to respondents that such a development would equate to scotland becoming independent .
other findings in the bbc poll are also intriguing .
it suggests support north and south of the border for an english parliament to tackle the west lothian question .
it suggests that voters feel independence would make little difference to cultural identities .
do all these polls matter ?
yes .
we could , of course , resort to the customary cliché that the only poll which really counts is the one on the day .
but , as with voting intention , the various polls on independence point to the nature of the campaign itself , to the two visions of independence .
nationalists will assuage , will talk of independence as scotland 's manifest destiny , will seek to counter economic concerns .

do they want independence ?
do they want to end the union ?
it depends , it would appear , upon how you pose the question .
it has been 300 years since the act of union was signed glance at the bbc / orb poll published to coincide with the special newsnight debate in edinburgh to commemorate 300 years since scottish politicians voted for the union with england .
voters were asked whether they wanted the union to " continue as it is or see it come to an end " .
they were further reminded that ending the union would " mean that scotland became an independent country " .
the responses suggest that 56 % of scots would prefer the continuing union , compared with 32 % favouring its end .
in england , the figures were 73 % supporting the union with 16 % urging an end .
the scottish figures are comparable with a yougov poll in the sunday times which indicated that 53 % of scots thought the union " worth maintaining " while 33 % did not .
that would appear to be relatively clear .
but look more closely at that and other polls .
narrow majority look at yougov in the sunday times last september .
respondents then were asked : " if there was a referendum tomorrow on whether scotland should become independent , how would you vote ? "
there was an apparent narrow majority for independence , 44 % to 42 % .
look at an icm poll in the sunday telegraph in november , suggesting 59 % to 28 % approval for " scotland becoming an independent country " .
similar wording in an icm poll for the mail in january suggested 51 % approval for scotland becoming independent , with 36 % disapproving .
english respondents also indicated support for scottish independence , by 48 % to 39 % .
the issue of the union is to the fore in a scottish election year how to explain these disparities ?
it would appear that , if you stress soothing longer-term concepts like " becoming independent " , then there is potential support for independence .
nationalists say that would be the wording in their planned referendum , highlighting the move to independence as a process .
by contrast , if you lay stress on immediate issues like ending or breaking the union , then potential support apparently declines .
unionist politicians say that is the reality of what independence would involve .
further , the sunday times poll suggests popular apprehension that there might be tax rises or spending cuts under independence .
labour says that indicates their claim of a " black hole " in snp economic plans is getting through to voters .
' scare stories ' nationalists say the sunday times poll suggests they can build support for independence by neutralising what they call " labour scare stories " .
the bbc poll , of course , features both elements of the union question in that it talks of the union coming to an end but also points out to respondents that such a development would equate to scotland becoming independent .
other findings in the bbc poll are also intriguing .
it suggests support north and south of the border for an english parliament to tackle the west lothian question .
it suggests that voters feel independence would make little difference to cultural identities .
do all these polls matter ?
yes .
we could , of course , resort to the customary cliché that the only poll which really counts is the one on the day .
but , as with voting intention , the various polls on independence point to the nature of the campaign itself , to the two visions of independence .
nationalists will assuage , will talk of independence as scotland 's manifest destiny , will seek to counter economic concerns .
unionists will talk in blunt , apocalyptic terms about the destruction of existing ties , will forecast economic collapse .
you , the voters , will choose .

jaguars , mercedes or 4x4s in richmond would incur three times the normal parking fee , while a family with two large cars could pay up to £ 750 .
in a survey of residents , a narrow majority voted for the scheme , linking parking permit costs to car emissions .
the leader of richmond council , serge lourie , was " delighted " by the results .
if policies like this are to have a real effect in the long term then everyone must adopt them leader of richmond council , serge lourie the idea generated fierce debate when it was published last october .
the local authority 's survey showed 49 % supported the plan , with 39 % opposed - although a majority thought the extra charges for second car permits were " too punitive " .
mr lourie , said : " i am particularly encouraged by the fact that 64 % have indicated that they would be prepared to take practical action and switch to a less polluting vehicle - this is hugely significant .
" these proposals were always going to spark a fierce debate .
we have never had any illusions about that fact .
" climate change is the single most important issue facing our world today .
" we have since been hugely encouraged by indications from other authorities and the mayor of london , that they intended to introduce similar schemes .
" if policies like this are to have a real effect in the long term then everyone must adopt them . "
those with more than one car would have to pay 50 % more for extra permits .
there would also be a sliding scale of charges for parking permits based on the government 's car tax bands .
committee scrutiny but , significantly , the poll suggests two out of three residents would consider changing to a cleaner car to avoid the higher charges .
this would mean less revenue for the council , but lower levels of greenhouse gases .
richmond 's proposals differ from chancellor gordon brown 's transport taxes , which have made money for the exchequer without reducing emissions .

jaguars , mercedes or 4x4s in richmond would incur three times the normal parking fee , while a family with two large cars could pay up to £ 750 .
in a survey of residents , a narrow majority voted for the scheme , linking parking permit costs to car emissions .
the leader of richmond council , serge lourie , was " delighted " by the results .
if policies like this are to have a real effect in the long term then everyone must adopt them leader of richmond council , serge lourie the idea generated fierce debate when it was published last october .
the local authority 's survey showed 49 % supported the plan , with 39 % opposed - although a majority thought the extra charges for second car permits were " too punitive " .
mr lourie , said : " i am particularly encouraged by the fact that 64 % have indicated that they would be prepared to take practical action and switch to a less polluting vehicle - this is hugely significant .
" these proposals were always going to spark a fierce debate .
we have never had any illusions about that fact .
" climate change is the single most important issue facing our world today .
" we have since been hugely encouraged by indications from other authorities and the mayor of london , that they intended to introduce similar schemes .
" if policies like this are to have a real effect in the long term then everyone must adopt them . "
those with more than one car would have to pay 50 % more for extra permits .
there would also be a sliding scale of charges for parking permits based on the government 's car tax bands .
committee scrutiny but , significantly , the poll suggests two out of three residents would consider changing to a cleaner car to avoid the higher charges .
this would mean less revenue for the council , but lower levels of greenhouse gases .
richmond 's proposals differ from chancellor gordon brown 's transport taxes , which have made money for the exchequer without reducing emissions .

jaguars , mercedes or 4x4s in richmond would incur three times the normal parking fee , while a family with two large cars could pay up to £ 750 .
in a survey of residents , a narrow majority voted for the scheme , linking parking permit costs to car emissions .
the leader of richmond council , serge lourie , was " delighted " by the results .
if policies like this are to have a real effect in the long term then everyone must adopt them leader of richmond council , serge lourie the idea generated fierce debate when it was published last october .
the local authority 's survey showed 49 % supported the plan , with 39 % opposed - although a majority thought the extra charges for second car permits were " too punitive " .
mr lourie , said : " i am particularly encouraged by the fact that 64 % have indicated that they would be prepared to take practical action and switch to a less polluting vehicle - this is hugely significant .
" these proposals were always going to spark a fierce debate .
we have never had any illusions about that fact .
" climate change is the single most important issue facing our world today .
" we have since been hugely encouraged by indications from other authorities and the mayor of london , that they intended to introduce similar schemes .
" if policies like this are to have a real effect in the long term then everyone must adopt them . "
those with more than one car would have to pay 50 % more for extra permits .
there would also be a sliding scale of charges for parking permits based on the government 's car tax bands .
committee scrutiny but , significantly , the poll suggests two out of three residents would consider changing to a cleaner car to avoid the higher charges .
this would mean less revenue for the council , but lower levels of greenhouse gases .
richmond 's proposals differ from chancellor gordon brown 's transport taxes , which have made money for the exchequer without reducing emissions .
the proposals will now be considered by richmond council 's overview and scrutiny committee on 24 january , before going to cabinet on 29 january for a final decision .

he said : " we 've been recording the snowline on the mountain for the last 14 years and over that time we 've seen a distinct downward trend in the snow cover - not only in the height at which the snow is occurring but also in the season .
" for example , this year both september and october were free of snow so the season is getting shorter and the amount of snow cover on snowdon is declining as well .
" we 're linking that to the change in temperature , the rising temperature .
" we 've noticed particularly in the spring period a 2 degree rise in temperature on snowdon . "
countryside council of wales experts have created images using 3d computer modelling software of what snowdon could look like without its snow .
they depict snowdon under differing levels of snow cover , starting at the 100m snowline where you would typically expect to see snow cover in any given year .

dr walmsley said : " the changes that we 've monitored are actually quicker bearing in mind for the last two years the snow cover on snowdon has actually been half what we 'd expect in a bad year going back in time .
" so we are actually seeing more dramatic effects than might have been expected . "
the snowdon snowline is one of the assembly government 's climate change indicators for wales , along with the onset of the first daffodils in bloom .
an assembly government spokesperson said tackling climate change was down to everyone .
" a number of steps have already been taken by the welsh assembly government to address carbon emissions which cause climate change , and our approach is outlined in the environment strategy published last year .
" progress on energy efficiency , particularly in the public sector , has been encouraging .

caernarfon mp hywel williams said local communities would suffer if the area was not properly protected .
" local communities depend on these magnificent resources , for fishing , sustainable tourism and for the maintenance and continuation of our way of life , " he added .

mr chung has been on trial since june 2006 for raising money illegally from subsidiaries and spending some 69.3bn won -lrb- $ 74m -rrb- for his own use .
he was also charged with damaging related firms financially via dubious deals , to his and his sons ' benefit .
the news comes amid falling profits and a partial strike at the firm .
hyundai - the country 's largest car firm , and its affiliate kia motors , which is headed by eui-sun , mr chung 's son - represent some 70 % of south korea 's automobile exports .
' grave crime ' following their call , prosecutors said it was " unavoidable to seriously punish the defendants " because the crimes in the case were " grave " .
it is now up to judges in seoul to rule on the case , which local media said could take place in february .
the latest news comes as hyundai faces increasing difficulties with poor results , dented in part by the strength of the south korean won , making it harder to export vehicles .
a strike on monday , which lasted eight hours at three factories following a row with management over bonuses , come after the firm experienced a more protracted three-month strike last summer .
a longer strike could start from wednesday .

rainwater harvested it is meant to represents his vision of a sustainable and inclusive community with integrated affordable , social and private housing .
last year the prince spent his 58th birthday in the village , giving a tour to chinese business leaders and prince albert of monaco .

he added that " we are cautious about the outturn for the rest of this financial year " .

rick , who was self employed , has a grown up family who 've helped him cope with the diagnosis , but he admits there are tears every day .
what you told breakfast " what an incredible guy .. this man deserves a medal fighting the establishment in such poor health - shame on the government that it is necessary for him to have to do it . "
anita read more viewers ' comments on our your say page " for thousands of families out there , this is an all too familiar horror story , " he says " chemotherapy makes you feel cold , so in winter i have to have the heating up full . "
in the end , as money worries piled up , he was encouraged to apply for a heating grant from the macmillan cancer charity - because no state help was available .
rick wants the £ 200 winter fuel allowance - which is available to anyone over 60 - to be extended to people with serious illnesses .
he 's meeting a representative from each of the three main political parties today - and tomorrow , we 'll update you on how the meetings went .

the minister anne maguire mentioned that people who 've been given less than six months to live can get a fast-track benefit - the disability living allowance , which can be paid within days .
if you think you 're entitled to this and you 're not getting it , talk to one of the cancer charities , or to your health care team -lrb- which will have to confirm the prognosis -rrb- .
relatives and carers can fill out the forms for this benefit , if the person concerned is too ill to do it for themselves .

but , recently the firm has grown from selling beans and biscuits to becoming a major player in almost every area of the retail market .
clothing , furnishings , mobile phones , dvds , holidays , financial services , legal advice - the list of products tesco now offers seems endless .
in fact , the company seems set to leapfrog current non-food market leader , home retail group , owner of argos , with its 2006 results , according to retail analyst verdict research .
' buying structure ' tesco has been selling non-food for more than 25 years , but only realised its potential a decade ago .
" we only approached non-food with conviction 10 years ago , " says tesco finance director andrew higginson .
" we created a separate buying structure , bringing in high street specialists who really knew fashion , " says mr higginson .
more recently , ex-burton chief john horner , came in to run clothing and terry price from walmart joined to head up the rest of non-food .
tesco by numbers 260,000 uk employees ; 360,000 worldwide staff roller blade in the uk 's largest tesco in newcastle tesco sells its own brand software in over 700 stores one in ten people in the uk buy tesco make-up " it 's got to this stage by engaging with the customers , " says richard hyman , managing director of verdict research .
" most uk retailers are supply driven which has been ok for years , but now the customer is king . "
analysts agree that good value product has been key to driving tesco 's non-food growth .
" tesco 's huge size allows it to be more efficient in its buying process , " says analyst keith bowman of hargreaves lansdown stockbrokers .
floor space of course , much of tesco 's non-food growth has been helped by the fact that , to many , supermarkets are convenient .
" people come to the store regularly to buy food and see the non-food , " says mr higginson .
but much of tesco 's non-food growth has been driven by adding substantial floor space , increasing its portfolio of hypermarket extra stores .
tesco 's first extra store opened in 1997 and it now has at least 130 .
in fact , tesco grabbed half of all new shopping space in britain last year according to recent verdict figures .
tesco 's new dominance in non-food threatens high street retailers across the board .
in clothing , tesco has targeted discounters like matalan and mid-range retailers like next .
in entertainment , they are eating into sales at hmv .
" we 'll typically take 25 % market share on big lines , be it the latest harry potter dvd or robbie williams cd , " says mr higginson .
in electricals , retailers like currys digital are feeling the pressure , says credit suisse analyst tony shiret .
" when product goes below a certain price , people are insensitive to whether they require service . "
and not content with battling high street retailers , tesco recently took on microsoft , launching a range of own-brand pc software .
online and catalogue but andrew higginson does not think tesco is killing off specialist retailers .
" much of our growth is complementary to the market , " he says .
so can tesco extend its lead in non-food ?
tesco 's strategy is to be " as strong in non-food as in food , " and non-food currently gets half of new store footage , according to mr higginson .
meanwhile , tesco direct could be key to the supermarket 's future growth .
launched last autumn , the home shopping service offers items including bikes , beds and freezers .
operating in direct competition with argos , customers can order online or from a catalogue .
mr higginson says tesco direct is " an important growth channel " .
it offers 8,000 items compared with 20,000 lines offered by john lewis direct , so there is growth potential .
but analysts think tesco will take a cautious approach online .
" tesco has invested a huge amount in stores and are n't going to cannibalise sales , " says mr hyman .
in october 2005 , tesco trialled its first homeplus store near manchester , dedicated to selling non-food .
but hypermarkets seem to be tesco 's preferred store format for the foreseeable future .
risking reputation could tesco damage its reputation by moving into specialist non-food areas ?
" in new technology where the customer needs more reassurance , there is a lot they could learn , " says mr shiret .
however , mr higginson says a full-service model would be tricky for tesco to follow .
" we explain as much as possible on shelf , " he says .
another risk is that tesco could make stores so big they will put customers off .
" if you go to tesco for your biscuits , you might not want to walk around a massive hypermarket , " says mr bowman .
' severe penalty ' but analysts agree tesco 's cautious approach should pay off .
" if they 're not moving forward , they 'll focus their firepower elsewhere , " says mr bowman .
mr higginson accepts that new product areas pose risks .
" but the penalty for selling fresh food badly is severe and we 've managed to do that well , " he says .
tesco have , of course , made many mistakes along the way .
seven years ago , they had a special offer on scooters .
" i think we may still have a couple in the warehouse , " mr higginson says .

but , recently the firm has grown from selling beans and biscuits to becoming a major player in almost every area of the retail market .
clothing , furnishings , mobile phones , dvds , holidays , financial services , legal advice - the list of products tesco now offers seems endless .
in fact , the company seems set to leapfrog current non-food market leader , home retail group , owner of argos , with its 2006 results , according to retail analyst verdict research .
' buying structure ' tesco has been selling non-food for more than 25 years , but only realised its potential a decade ago .
" we only approached non-food with conviction 10 years ago , " says tesco finance director andrew higginson .
" we created a separate buying structure , bringing in high street specialists who really knew fashion , " says mr higginson .
more recently , ex-burton chief john horner , came in to run clothing and terry price from walmart joined to head up the rest of non-food .
tesco by numbers 260,000 uk employees ; 360,000 worldwide staff roller blade in the uk 's largest tesco in newcastle tesco sells its own brand software in over 700 stores one in ten people in the uk buy tesco make-up " it 's got to this stage by engaging with the customers , " says richard hyman , managing director of verdict research .
" most uk retailers are supply driven which has been ok for years , but now the customer is king . "
analysts agree that good value product has been key to driving tesco 's non-food growth .
" tesco 's huge size allows it to be more efficient in its buying process , " says analyst keith bowman of hargreaves lansdown stockbrokers .
floor space of course , much of tesco 's non-food growth has been helped by the fact that , to many , supermarkets are convenient .
" people come to the store regularly to buy food and see the non-food , " says mr higginson .
but much of tesco 's non-food growth has been driven by adding substantial floor space , increasing its portfolio of hypermarket extra stores .
tesco 's first extra store opened in 1997 and it now has at least 130 .
in fact , tesco grabbed half of all new shopping space in britain last year according to recent verdict figures .
one in seven tesco customers buy clothing each week .
tesco 's new dominance in non-food threatens high street retailers across the board .
in clothing , tesco has targeted discounters like matalan and mid-range retailers like next .
in entertainment , they are eating into sales at hmv .
" we 'll typically take 25 % market share on big lines , be it the latest harry potter dvd or robbie williams cd , " says mr higginson .
in electricals , retailers like currys digital are feeling the pressure , says credit suisse analyst tony shiret .
" when product goes below a certain price , people are insensitive to whether they require service . "

online and catalogue but andrew higginson does not think tesco is killing off specialist retailers .
" much of our growth is complementary to the market , " he says .
so can tesco extend its lead in non-food ?
tesco 's strategy is to be " as strong in non-food as in food , " and non-food currently gets half of new store footage , according to mr higginson .
meanwhile , tesco direct could be key to the supermarket 's future growth .
tesco sell lcd tvs costing from £ 200 to £ 2000 launched last autumn , the home shopping service offers items including bikes , beds and freezers .
operating in direct competition with argos , customers can order online or from a catalogue .
mr higginson says tesco direct is " an important growth channel " .
it offers 8,000 items compared with 20,000 lines offered by john lewis direct , so there is growth potential .
but analysts think tesco will take a cautious approach online .
" tesco has invested a huge amount in stores and are n't going to cannibalise sales , " says mr hyman .
in october 2005 , tesco trialled its first homeplus store near manchester , dedicated to selling non-food .
but hypermarkets seem to be tesco 's preferred store format for the foreseeable future .
risking reputation could tesco damage its reputation by moving into specialist non-food areas ?
" in new technology where the customer needs more reassurance , there is a lot they could learn , " says mr shiret .
however , mr higginson says a full-service model would be tricky for tesco to follow .
" we explain as much as possible on shelf , " he says .
another risk is that tesco could make stores so big they will put customers off .
" if you go to tesco for your biscuits , you might not want to walk around a massive hypermarket , " says mr bowman .
' severe penalty ' but analysts agree tesco 's cautious approach should pay off .
" if they 're not moving forward , they 'll focus their firepower elsewhere , " says mr bowman .
mr higginson accepts that new product areas pose risks .
" but the penalty for selling fresh food badly is severe and we 've managed to do that well , " he says .
tesco have , of course , made many mistakes along the way .
seven years ago , they had a special offer on scooters .

the debate has been sharpened by recent surveys on both sides of the border showing growing support for scottish independence .
with the snp promising to hold a referendum on independence should it win power and calling for an end to scotland 's current financial relationship with the rest of the uk , the stakes are high .
' debate needed ' the rhetoric may be escalating , but many economists - even those who oppose independence - say a debate on the financial arrangements underpinning devolution and their benefits to scotland is needed .
" there is a case for a sensible debate about fiscal decentralisation within a unionist framework , " says professor brian ashcroft , from the fraser of allander institute at the university of strathclyde .
he opposes enhancing the parliament 's current powers to give it full control over taxation , a position known in academic circles as " fiscal autonomy " . "
many politicians appear not to appreciate the economic context of their deliberations and , ultimately , their decisions " melfort campbell , cbi scotland but he agrees that there are tensions over the existing position , which are fuelled by scotland 's inability to determine tax levels and retain revenues , and by concerns over the amount of funding the nation gets from the uk treasury compared to the english regions .
all this , says professor ashcroft , makes a debate essential .
" the debate will move further forward .
this will be an increasing matter of debate not just in scotland but the rest of the uk . "
' economic underperformance ' of course , others want to do more than just talk .
the snp argues that the scottish parliament is " powerless " in economic matters and says the economy has " underperformed " since the historic move to devolution in 1999 .
giving parliament full taxation powers - adding to its already extensive powers over expenditure - could help boost competitiveness , stimulate economic growth and boost prosperity .
the snp cites the comparatively stronger growth of ireland , norway and finland , countries of similar size to scotland but with a full range of economic powers at their disposal , to back its argument .
some commentators share this view , arguing the financial framework - based on edinburgh receiving block funding from whitehall - does not impose enough constraints or incentives on ministers to spend money productively .
" one has to wonder for how many more years scotland and the rest of the uk are to labour under this failing fiscal mechanism , " ronald macdonald , from the university of glasgow and paul hallwood , from the university of connecticut , argued in a recent economic analysis .
the bare facts show the scottish economy has underperformed the uk as a whole since 1975 , seeing average annual growth of less than 2 % .
the situation has not improved much since 1999 but the headline figures do not tell the entire story .
growth in key sectors of the economy , such as business services , financial services and construction , has actually been higher in scotland than the uk as a whole under devolution .
according to the fraser of allander institute , the economic picture is generally bright with annual growth set to top 2 % in each of the next three years and unemployment stable at just over 5 % .
the arguments marshalled against fiscal autonomy , articulated forcefully in recent months by labour ministers , are lengthy .
their main claim is that scrapping the financial status quo would imperil scotland 's economic stability .
in this nightmare scenario , ministers may have to resort to raising taxes to fund increased welfare spending as more people retire , pensions must be paid out of scotland 's own pocket and the working population falls .
a rising tax burden would then hit consumer spending and deter corporate investment .
business priorities business has often found itself caught in the political crossfire over constitutional arguments .
recent comments by the cbi that scottish ministers would do better to ensure they used existing powers to improve the economy rather than push for new ones inevitably attracted criticism from some quarters .
but the employers ' body says it can not be " taken for granted " that economic growth will still be the executive 's number one goal following the next election .
" gradually , the economy has become recognised as a priority , certainly at senior ministerial level , " says melfort campbell , chairman of cbi scotland .
but he bemoans the fact the executive does not set its own economic growth targets : " many politicians appear not to appreciate the economic context of their deliberations and , ultimately , their decisions . "
scotland plc has been unhappy with what it feels is a lack of understanding among msps about the importance of business to society , resenting being seen by some as just another pressure group .
some , however , feel official attitudes have changed for the better .
" there were historical issues but they are gone and people are paying a lot more attention , " says hugh aitken , a senior executive with sun microsystems , one of scotland 's largest foreign investors .
" the good thing about scotland is that it is a very small community .
it is not difficult to get all the way to key decision makers to get an idea over and get things moving . "
birth pangs hovering over current discussions is the spectre of scotland 's falling population and the economic implications of this drop .
the number of scottish people has fallen steadily since the 1970s and , if current trends continue , could plunge over the next 30 years below the magic mark of five million . "
it is a totem that we want to remain above five million " professor brian ashcroft " the population is declining and that is a big issue , " says professor ashcroft .
" it is a totem that we want to remain above five million . "
annual death rates have exceeded births since the late 1990s and , if the situation continues , the impact on productivity could be stark .
but the scottish executive 's call for more people to make scotland their home and reverse decades of emigration seems to have been heeded .
there has been net migration of nearly 55,000 in the past three years , boosted by a growing number of arrivals from eastern europe .
" we have been giving our health and safety notices in russian , " says gerry more , managing director of edinburgh building firm cala , reflecting the influx of labour which has boosted the construction and fish processing industries in particular .
for many years , many scots have looked to europe for a solution to its perceived economic problems .
it seems that europe is providing an answer - at least to one of scotland 's main weaknesses .
but other concerns clearly remain .
