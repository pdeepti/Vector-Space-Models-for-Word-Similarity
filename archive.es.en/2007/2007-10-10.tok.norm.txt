volkswagen has announced it plans to bring out a plastic and magnesium car that can get 238 miles per us gallon by 2010 .
neither experts nor the company imagine many people lining up to buy the small but expensive car . there were plenty of pamphlets touting environmental concerns and banners proclaiming green credentials at the frankfurt auto show which ended last month .
but german carmaker volkswagen said tuesday , oct .
9 , it intended to put its money where its mouth is regarding promises to cut carbon dioxide emissions by meeting consumer demand for cars with better gas mileage . " the environment is a topic of discussion in our society and we do not think it is going to come in like a wave then roll back away , as it has in the past , " vw spokesman andreas meurer said . still , no one at vw expects the company 's single-cylinder car in development , which would require one liter of gas to travel 100 kilometers - the equivalent of 238 miles per us gallon - to be a record breaker in sales terms , ceo martin winterkorn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw made a 1-liter-car prototype in 2002 - it 's unclear how similar the new car will be the car , whose body will be made primarily of plastic and magnesium , will only reach a maximum speed of 120 kilometer per hour -lrb- 75 mph -rrb- . " people taking this car on the autobahn should pray they do n't get run over by a trailer truck , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer , director for the center of automotive research at the university of gelsenkirchen . costly production dudenhöffer said he thought vw would sell between 500 and 1,500 of the cars .
the fuel-efficient vehicle will be based on the " up ! , " a compact four-door , though the new car is likely to be considerably more expensive . " a car based on the ' up ! ' and made out of light-weight materials with a special motor is a lot more expensive and will probably be more of a niche product , " dudenhöffer said . regardless of the price , which has not yet been set , the car will serve as an example of what technology can achieve and help vw develop its profile as an environmentally aware company , dudenhöffer said . " it will help build a positive image for the brand , " he added .
" that 's why the project is being run as a small series instead of a prototype . " missing voluntary targets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german automakers have come out against plans to make emissions cuts mandatory but the car is nothing more than a red herring for a failed ecological sales strategy , said werner reh of the environmental group friends of the earth deutschland . he said the company was trying to present itself as more environmentally friendly than the facts show , adding that vw , like most german carmakers , would not even be able to meet the voluntary co2 emissions limits the auto industry has set itself . " manufactures have to meet their self-imposed co2 emissions standards and a car that is sold a thousand - or even ten thousand - times wo n't help , " he said .
" a hundred thousand of the cars would have to be sold . " in 1998 , the european automobile manufacturers association , which represents the 13 of the largest automakers on the continent , reached a voluntary agreement with the european commission to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 140 g / km over 10 years . low-consumption cars nothing new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans want big cars with big , powerful engines , dudenhöffer said with an average or 173 g / km , a change in marketing strategy would be a step in the right direction for volkswagen , reh said . " vw , like all german manufactures , spends billions to advertise vehicles that emit more than 200 grams of co2 , " he said .
" maybe they should change the commercials first . " but consumers also have a hand in lowering co2 emission , dudenhöffer said , adding that germans are buying larger , more powerful cars than ever before . " we 've already had all kinds of fuel-saving cars on the market with the audi a2 , the three-liter lupo from vw and opel 's environmental models , " he said .
" they all flopped with customers . " manfred götzke -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

will the partnership work this time ? the german soccer league , the dfl , which represents the 36 first and second-division clubs , announced on tuesday that the kirch-led company sirius will sell the domestic broadcast rights to the bundesliga for six seasons .
the dfl said it set to earn some 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- from 2009 to 2015 - or 500 million euros a year - from the new deal .
the league currently makes 440 million euros per season from a deal allowing the private , pay tv station premiere to broadcast matches live and state-run television to show highlights .
that deal expires in 2009 .
now the dfl is turning to the 80-year-old kirch in an attempt to boost revenues and catch up with other , richer european leagues such as the english premiership .
lessons of history ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirch 's comeback has amazed all and distressed some the bundesliga has been around the block with kirch before - with near calamitous results .
kirch founded premiere , and for much of the 1990s , he owned live broadcast rights to bundesliga matches .
but the kirch media group repeatedly found itself in financial difficulty and was finally forced to file for bankruptcy in 2002 .
it was the largest insolvency in post-war german history .
the bankruptcy hit the bundesliga hard , depriving clubs of millions in planned revenues and driving some deep into debt .
the affair became known as the " kirch crisis . "
the new deal is reportedly covered in full by bank guarantees , although no specific names of financial institutions have been released .
mixed reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund , in yellow , was one club badly hit by the " kirch crisis " dfl members who approved the deal were generally positive about what kirch could do for the league .
" it 's a quantum leap , " hans-joachim watzke , commercial manager of borussia dortmund , told the dpa news agency .
" i consider mr. kirch a visionary entrepreneur who thinks strategically . "
but hamburg voted against the new deal .
" a decision with enormous implications was made under unnecessary time pressure , " hamburg chairman bernd hoffmann told dpa .
" the terms presented here did n't convince me . "
and fans worry that sirius , in its efforts to bring in increased revenues , might encroach upon the autonomy of soccer reporting or perhaps even do away with highlight programs on public television . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on the right , berlin - the city where he lived almost all his life .
on the left , tehran - the city where he was born .
dejagah 's decision to boycott the german under-21 team 's upcoming match in israel may be his attempt to align the two components of his perceived cultural identity .
but it 's also a political statement that flouts what should be the spirit of both of the german national team and international soccer itself .
dejagah could have gotten out of the match in israel without entering the spotlight .
he chose not to .
he wanted the public to sanction his action .
and his comments concerning his decision make for unhappy reading .
" i have more iranian than german blood in my veins , " dejagah told the tabloid bz newspaper in a report published tuesday .
" that should be respected , and besides i 'm doing this out of respect .
my parents are iranian . "
dejagah 's use of the blood metaphor no doubt reflects the fact that he has spent far more of his young life honing his skills with the ball in midfield than attuning himself to the historical nuances of his words .
but why should the german soccer association , the dfb , support the idea that some sort of essential iranian-ness entitles him to reject another culture - israel - wholesale ?
on the contrary , should n't the dfb be taking a stand for the principles of sportsmanship in international athletic competitions , which include treating opponents of all religions and ethnicities with equal respect ?
players who , for direct personal reasons , feel unable to live up to this standard against a given opponent can discreetly ask for a leave of absence .
players who feel a muddled religious animosity toward cultures with which they have little personal experience should n't play for national teams at all .
calls to keep politics out of soccer are misguided .
sports are inherently political - sometimes positively so .
teams from different cultures that compete fairly on the field demonstrate their shared values , including a mutual love of a game and a respect for one another as opponents .
dejagah has a right to prioritize loyalty to tehran 's hatred for israel over the spirit of the game .
the dfb has both a right and a reason to prioritize that spirit over an individual player 's perceived need to demonstrate cultural identity through discrimination .
the dejagah problem itself will be gone soon .
having already reached the maximum age , the midfielder is only eligible to play for the german under-21s for a few more months , and to become a serious candidate for the german national men 's team , dejagah would have to improve as a player .
he should also be encouraged to think more seriously about the issues he raised this week .
along with the tattoos on his arms , dejagah also got one on his neck , which reads : " remember where you from " -lrb- sic -rrb- .
he might do better to decide who he wants to be .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 10.10.2007 media mogul kirch to market the bundesliga for six seasons großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirch 's former station premiere currently broadcasts the bundesliga in a comeback almost as unlikely as diego maradona returning to the pitch , media mogul leo kirch will manage the rights to the bundesliga from 2009-2015 .
will the partnership work this time ? the german soccer league , the dfl , which represents the 36 first and second-division clubs , announced on tuesday that the kirch-led company sirius will sell the domestic broadcast rights to the bundesliga for six seasons .
the dfl said it set to earn some 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- from 2009 to 2015 - or 500 million euros a year - from the new deal .
the league currently makes 440 million euros per season from a deal allowing the private , pay tv station premiere to broadcast matches live and state-run television to show highlights .
that deal expires in 2009 .
now the dfl is turning to the 80-year-old kirch in an attempt to boost revenues and catch up with other , richer european leagues such as the english premiership .
lessons of history ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirch 's comeback has amazed all and distressed some the bundesliga has been around the block with kirch before - with near calamitous results .
kirch founded premiere , and for much of the 1990s , he owned live broadcast rights to bundesliga matches .
but the kirch media group repeatedly found itself in financial difficulty and was finally forced to file for bankruptcy in 2002 .
it was the largest insolvency in post-war german history .
the bankruptcy hit the bundesliga hard , depriving clubs of millions in planned revenues and driving some deep into debt .
the affair became known as the " kirch crisis . "
the new deal is reportedly covered in full by bank guarantees , although no specific names of financial institutions have been released .
mixed reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund , in yellow , was one club badly hit by the " kirch crisis " dfl members who approved the deal were generally positive about what kirch could do for the league .
" it 's a quantum leap , " hans-joachim watzke , commercial manager of borussia dortmund , told the dpa news agency .
" i consider mr. kirch a visionary entrepreneur who thinks strategically . "
but hamburg voted against the new deal .
" a decision with enormous implications was made under unnecessary time pressure , " hamburg chairman bernd hoffmann told dpa .
" the terms presented here did n't convince me . "
and fans worry that sirius , in its efforts to bring in increased revenues , might encroach upon the autonomy of soccer reporting or perhaps even do away with highlight programs on public television . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 10.10.2007 media mogul kirch to market the bundesliga for six seasons großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirch 's former station premiere currently broadcasts the bundesliga in a comeback almost as unlikely as diego maradona returning to the pitch , media mogul leo kirch will manage the rights to the bundesliga from 2009-2015 .
will the partnership work this time ? the german soccer league , the dfl , which represents the 36 first and second-division clubs , announced on tuesday that the kirch-led company sirius will sell the domestic broadcast rights to the bundesliga for six seasons .
the dfl said it set to earn some 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- from 2009 to 2015 - or 500 million euros a year - from the new deal .
the league currently makes 440 million euros per season from a deal allowing the private , pay tv station premiere to broadcast matches live and state-run television to show highlights .
that deal expires in 2009 .
now the dfl is turning to the 80-year-old kirch in an attempt to boost revenues and catch up with other , richer european leagues such as the english premiership .
lessons of history ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirch 's comeback has amazed all and distressed some the bundesliga has been around the block with kirch before - with near calamitous results .
kirch founded premiere , and for much of the 1990s , he owned live broadcast rights to bundesliga matches .
but the kirch media group repeatedly found itself in financial difficulty and was finally forced to file for bankruptcy in 2002 .
it was the largest insolvency in post-war german history .
the bankruptcy hit the bundesliga hard , depriving clubs of millions in planned revenues and driving some deep into debt .
the affair became known as the " kirch crisis . "
the new deal is reportedly covered in full by bank guarantees , although no specific names of financial institutions have been released .
mixed reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund , in yellow , was one club badly hit by the " kirch crisis " dfl members who approved the deal were generally positive about what kirch could do for the league .
" it 's a quantum leap , " hans-joachim watzke , commercial manager of borussia dortmund , told the dpa news agency .
" i consider mr. kirch a visionary entrepreneur who thinks strategically . "
but hamburg voted against the new deal .
" a decision with enormous implications was made under unnecessary time pressure , " hamburg chairman bernd hoffmann told dpa .
" the terms presented here did n't convince me . "
and fans worry that sirius , in its efforts to bring in increased revenues , might encroach upon the autonomy of soccer reporting or perhaps even do away with highlight programs on public television . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw chief correspondent peter philipp says that 's his decision and should be respected . it 's a story tailor-made to liven up the dull political landscape and give both tabloids and government backbenchers a perfect opportunity to voice some populist indignation : german-iranian soccer player ashkan dejagah has announced that his political sympathies prevent him from being able to take part in an official under-21 match against israel .
not acceptable , agree politicians across the board .
where would we be if sports player started choosing their opponents ?
sport should not become politicized , they say .
but that 's exactly what they do themselves .
anyone who refuses to demonstrate allegiance to german society is not allowed to represent the german national team .
the central council of the jews agrees , arguing that a german team player should not be allowed to " initiate a private jewish boycott . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they might have had a point , had the young man said he refused to play in israel because he does not acknowledge the state of israel .
but he did n't .
he referred to personal reasons and stressed that he was iranian as well as german .
anyone who criticizes him shows they have no awareness of how complex life can become for immigrants awarded german citizenship , and that they understand little or nothing of the integration process .
clearly , immigrants awarded german citizenship should try to become part of german society .
but this should not necessitate their having to renounce at the door their roots , their past , and everything it stands for .
obviously , they have ties to their former home ; they have friends and family there , maybe even property .
germans cultivate personal ties to foreign countries - why should n't immigrants retain their ties to their former home ?
it would be unreasonable and wrong to expect anything else .
in most cases , this principle is respected .
but not when politics enter the equation .
and they inevitably do , when iran and israel rear their head .
the german-iranian soccer player has little to do with it all - the real conflict is between sworn enemies tehran and jerusalem .
but it 's the public who take the rap - people , like ashkan dejagah , who then face penalties , or unpleasantness at the very least .
the german media and the politicians should avoid blowing these stories out of all proportion and , first and foremost , should stop twisting peoples ' words .
moreover , no one would ever insist that a german-israeli football player in the german under-21 team should have to take part in a game in iran , were it scheduled .
integration is a two-way process , as this case shows .
it has to be undertaken by the naturalized citizen , and it has to be undertaken by the society welcoming him - or not , as the case may be .
integration should not have to mean self-abnegation .
it requires sensitivity , awareness and respect from both sides .
in this particular case , all these are absent .
ultimately , the political rabble-rousing is superfluous for an entirely different reason : ashkan dejagah is 21 years old .
he only has to play in the under-21s for another few months .

on the right , berlin - the city where he lived almost all his life .
on the left , tehran - the city where he was born .
dejagah 's decision to boycott the german under-21 team 's upcoming match in israel may be his attempt to align the two components of his perceived cultural identity .
but it 's also a political statement that flouts what should be the spirit of both of the german national team and international soccer itself .
dejagah could have gotten out of the match in israel without entering the spotlight .
he chose not to .
he wanted the public to sanction his action .
and his comments concerning his decision make for unhappy reading .
" i have more iranian than german blood in my veins , " dejagah told the tabloid bz newspaper in a report published tuesday .
" that should be respected , and besides i 'm doing this out of respect .
my parents are iranian . "
dejagah 's use of the blood metaphor no doubt reflects the fact that he has spent far more of his young life honing his skills with the ball in midfield than attuning himself to the historical nuances of his words .
but why should the german soccer association , the dfb , support the idea that some sort of essential iranian-ness entitles him to reject another culture - israel - wholesale ?
on the contrary , should n't the dfb be taking a stand for the principles of sportsmanship in international athletic competitions , which include treating opponents of all religions and ethnicities with equal respect ?
players who , for direct personal reasons , feel unable to live up to this standard against a given opponent can discreetly ask for a leave of absence .
players who feel a muddled religious animosity toward cultures with which they have little personal experience should n't play for national teams at all .
calls to keep politics out of soccer are misguided .
sports are inherently political - sometimes positively so .
teams from different cultures that compete fairly on the field demonstrate their shared values , including a mutual love of a game and a respect for one another as opponents .
dejagah has a right to prioritize loyalty to tehran 's hatred for israel over the spirit of the game .
the dfb has both a right and a reason to prioritize that spirit over an individual player 's perceived need to demonstrate cultural identity through discrimination .
the dejagah problem itself will be gone soon .
having already reached the maximum age , the midfielder is only eligible to play for the german under-21s for a few more months , and to become a serious candidate for the german national men 's team , dejagah would have to improve as a player .
he should also be encouraged to think more seriously about the issues he raised this week .
along with the tattoos on his arms , dejagah also got one on his neck , which reads : " remember where you from " -lrb- sic -rrb- .
he might do better to decide who he wants to be .

but dw chief correspondent peter philipp says that 's his decision and should be respected . it 's a story tailor-made to liven up the dull political landscape and give both tabloids and government backbenchers a perfect opportunity to voice some populist indignation : german-iranian soccer player ashkan dejagah has announced that his political sympathies prevent him from being able to take part in an official under-21 match against israel .
not acceptable , agree politicians across the board .
where would we be if sports player started choosing their opponents ?
sport should not become politicized , they say .
but that 's exactly what they do themselves .
anyone who refuses to demonstrate allegiance to german society is not allowed to represent the german national team .
the central council of the jews agrees , arguing that a german team player should not be allowed to " initiate a private jewish boycott . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they might have had a point , had the young man said he refused to play in israel because he does not acknowledge the state of israel .
but he did n't .
he referred to personal reasons and stressed that he was iranian as well as german .
anyone who criticizes him shows they have no awareness of how complex life can become for immigrants awarded german citizenship , and that they understand little or nothing of the integration process .
clearly , immigrants awarded german citizenship should try to become part of german society .
but this should not necessitate their having to renounce at the door their roots , their past , and everything it stands for .
obviously , they have ties to their former home ; they have friends and family there , maybe even property .
germans cultivate personal ties to foreign countries - why should n't immigrants retain their ties to their former home ?
it would be unreasonable and wrong to expect anything else .
in most cases , this principle is respected .
but not when politics enter the equation .
and they inevitably do , when iran and israel rear their head .
the german-iranian soccer player has little to do with it all - the real conflict is between sworn enemies tehran and jerusalem .
but it 's the public who take the rap - people , like ashkan dejagah , who then face penalties , or unpleasantness at the very least .
the german media and the politicians should avoid blowing these stories out of all proportion and , first and foremost , should stop twisting peoples ' words .
moreover , no one would ever insist that a german-israeli football player in the german under-21 team should have to take part in a game in iran , were it scheduled .
integration is a two-way process , as this case shows .
it has to be undertaken by the naturalized citizen , and it has to be undertaken by the society welcoming him - or not , as the case may be .
integration should not have to mean self-abnegation .
it requires sensitivity , awareness and respect from both sides .
in this particular case , all these are absent .
ultimately , the political rabble-rousing is superfluous for an entirely different reason : ashkan dejagah is 21 years old .
he only has to play in the under-21s for another few months .

" as the world focuses on china 's poor human rights record in the run-up to the olympics , the chinese government could avoid further embarrassment by making a bold step to address its position as the world 's leading executioner of its own citizens , " said brad adams , asia director at human rights watch . wartime authorization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a handful of eu nations still allow capital punishment during wartime all european countries have banned the death penalty under the european convention on human rights .

on the right , berlin - the city where he lived almost all his life .
on the left , tehran - the city where he was born .
dejagah 's decision to boycott the german under-21 team 's upcoming match in israel may be his attempt to align the two components of his perceived cultural identity .
but it 's also a political statement that flouts what should be the spirit of both of the german national team and international soccer itself .
dejagah could have gotten out of the match in israel without entering the spotlight .
he chose not to .
he wanted the public to sanction his action .
and his comments concerning his decision make for unhappy reading .
" i have more iranian than german blood in my veins , " dejagah told the tabloid bz newspaper in a report published tuesday .
" that should be respected , and besides i 'm doing this out of respect .
my parents are iranian . "
dejagah 's use of the blood metaphor no doubt reflects the fact that he has spent far more of his young life honing his skills with the ball in midfield than attuning himself to the historical nuances of his words .
but why should the german soccer association , the dfb , support the idea that some sort of essential iranian-ness entitles him to reject another culture - israel - wholesale ?
on the contrary , should n't the dfb be taking a stand for the principles of sportsmanship in international athletic competitions , which include treating opponents of all religions and ethnicities with equal respect ?
players who , for direct personal reasons , feel unable to live up to this standard against a given opponent can discreetly ask for a leave of absence .
players who feel a muddled religious animosity toward cultures with which they have little personal experience should n't play for national teams at all .
calls to keep politics out of soccer are misguided .
sports are inherently political - sometimes positively so .
teams from different cultures that compete fairly on the field demonstrate their shared values , including a mutual love of a game and a respect for one another as opponents .
dejagah has a right to prioritize loyalty to tehran 's hatred for israel over the spirit of the game .
the dfb has both a right and a reason to prioritize that spirit over an individual player 's perceived need to demonstrate cultural identity through discrimination .
the dejagah problem itself will be gone soon .
having already reached the maximum age , the midfielder is only eligible to play for the german under-21s for a few more months , and to become a serious candidate for the german national men 's team , dejagah would have to improve as a player .
he should also be encouraged to think more seriously about the issues he raised this week .
along with the tattoos on his arms , dejagah also got one on his neck , which reads : " remember where you from " -lrb- sic -rrb- .
he might do better to decide who he wants to be .

and as sales show , german tv formats are holding their own internationally . for the participants , the mipcom bazaar means five heady days of wheeling and dealing in program rights .
the biggest winner is clearly the us , with companies such as disney taking the opportunity to boost foreign tv sales with primetime hits such as lost and desperate housewives .
but as tv markets become increasingly internationalized , the traffic has become more two-way than ever .
europe : format factory with foreign license fees reaching record heights in recent years , the movers and shakers in the riviera this week were playing for high stakes .
" we the broadcasters are the guys who feed the world what it wants to watch , " said leslie moonves from cbs in a keynote address as the fair kicked off .
but he also admitted that americans " had been slow on the uptake " when it came to tv produced outside the us .
but now the us networks have learnt their lesson after dragging their feet on european formats such as survivor and big brother , made by dutch company endemol . these days , while europe is still more than happy to open its wallets for us shows , american networks have also realized that where europe leads , it might be worth following .
repackaging , customizing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas gottschalk , germany 's favorite talk show host that includes germany .
the country has been positioning itself to benefit from developments in film and tv markets that have seen reality show concepts traded worldwide and soaps repackaged and customized for international markets .
many of the country 's prime time entertainment format exports have been gaining international momentum .
thomas gottschalk 's talk show wetten , dass ... , which first aired 26 years ago , has gone from strength to strength .
on its home turf it attracts record viewing figures , and became the first entertainment show from germany to be sold abroad .
over the years , the format has been sold to 13 countries - including in 2006 to the key us market , where it airs as wanna bet .
further ratings giants in germany with international resonance are the science show clever , fronted by comedian wigald boning , sold to 15 countries , and schlag den raab , or " beat stefan raab . "
although it only debuted one year ago , it has already been sold to four countries including britain and the us .
the international title is beat your host .
negotiations with other prospective buyers are ongoing . "
clever is what we now call ' sciencetainment ' - that means knowledge , family entertainment , and a game show component , in a form that never existed before , " says jens richter , who distributes both clever and schlag den raab worldwide .
" it 's innovative , it 's new , no one ever did it before … it was successful at home , has great viewer ratings , and it is easy to grasp . "
crucially , these shows tick all the right boxes .
according to prominent industry watcher virginia mouseler , what tv audiences around the globe want these days are kid-centered , family-based reality shows - and especially game shows with big cash prizes , reported the afp news agency .
edgy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crew from " türkisch für anfänger " another german show generating interest at mipcom might prove more controversial .
willkommen in der nachbarschaft -lrb- " welcome to the neighborhood " -rrb- features five families competing to win a house worth 250,000 euros .
the snag is , it 's the neighbors who decide who wins - while the five families include one with a transsexual father , an islamic fundamentalist family and an african family in which the husband has two wives .
going global meanwhile , marketing agency telepool made the most of the trade fair , and sold the weekly german drama türkisch für anfänger -lrb- " turkish for beginners " -rrb- , made by state broadcaster ard , to two buyers .
in france , the show about german-turkish patchwork family , the ötztürk-schneiders , will air on canal + and the free tv youth station nrj .
broadcast rights were also bought by russian mtv .
telepool has said it is also talking to other countries and expects to sign further contracts .
gaining similar heat abroad is ard 's daily soap sturm der liebe -lrb- " love storm " -rrb- , currently the most successful show on german tv in terms of market share .
according to german united distributors , a distribution subsidiary of ard , it has been bought by 15 countries , including finland , austria , canada , latvia , slovakia and italy , where it 's called tempesta d 'amore .
a surprise success this week was the 2004 tv movie stauffenberg starring sebastian koch , who stared in the oscar-winning the lives of others , as the eponymous hero .
the topic triggered renewed interest from buyers in the us and spain thanks to the tom cruise film on the same subject currently in production in berlin .
a number of broadcasters and dvd distributors were keen to make the most of publicity generated by the cruise project to boost ratings and sales of the german movie .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the mipcom the german entries for the annual emmys , awarded by the international academy of television arts & sciences , were also announced at mipcom .
selected for the category tv movie is die mauer - berlin ' 61 -lrb- " the wall - berlin ' 61 " -rrb- , which beat nominees from brazil , china and britain , while the jury selected the rtl soap alle lieben jimmy -lrb- " everyone loves jimmy " -rrb- , made by bavaria film in the comedy category . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" crime can not be prevented or stopped with death , or with state vengeance , but with justice , " said portuguese prime minister jose socrates , whose country currently holds the european union presidency . poland wants broader definition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish officials said they wanted protection of life to extend beyond the death penalty predominantly catholic poland was the only country to oppose the decision , arguing any such event should also condemn abortion and euthanasia .

the country has been positioning itself to benefit from developments in film and tv markets that have seen reality show concepts traded worldwide and soaps repackaged and customized for international markets .
many of the country 's prime time entertainment format exports have been gaining international momentum .
thomas gottschalk 's talk show wetten , dass ... , which first aired 26 years ago , has gone from strength to strength .
on its home turf it attracts record viewing figures , and became the first entertainment show from germany to be sold abroad .
over the years , the format has been sold to 13 countries - including in 2006 to the key us market , where it airs as wanna bet .
further ratings giants in germany with international resonance are the science show clever , fronted by comedian wigald boning , sold to 15 countries , and schlag den raab , or " beat stefan raab . "
although it only debuted one year ago , it has already been sold to four countries including britain and the us .

" it 's innovative , it 's new , no one ever did it before … it was successful at home , has great viewer ratings , and it is easy to grasp . "
crucially , these shows tick all the right boxes .
according to prominent industry watcher virginia mouseler , what tv audiences around the globe want these days are kid-centered , family-based reality shows - and especially game shows with big cash prizes , reported the afp news agency .

on the right , berlin - the city where he lived almost all his life .
on the left , tehran - the city where he was born .
dejagah 's decision to boycott the german under-21 team 's upcoming match in israel may be his attempt to align the two components of his perceived cultural identity .
but it 's also a political statement that flouts what should be the spirit of both of the german national team and international soccer itself .
dejagah could have gotten out of the match in israel without entering the spotlight .
he chose not to .
he wanted the public to sanction his action .
and his comments concerning his decision make for unhappy reading .
" i have more iranian than german blood in my veins , " dejagah told the tabloid bz newspaper in a report published tuesday .
" that should be respected , and besides i 'm doing this out of respect .
my parents are iranian . "
dejagah 's use of the blood metaphor no doubt reflects the fact that he has spent far more of his young life honing his skills with the ball in midfield than attuning himself to the historical nuances of his words .
but why should the german soccer association , the dfb , support the idea that some sort of essential iranian-ness entitles him to reject another culture - israel - wholesale ?
on the contrary , should n't the dfb be taking a stand for the principles of sportsmanship in international athletic competitions , which include treating opponents of all religions and ethnicities with equal respect ?
players who , for direct personal reasons , feel unable to live up to this standard against a given opponent can discreetly ask for a leave of absence .
players who feel a muddled religious animosity toward cultures with which they have little personal experience should n't play for national teams at all .
calls to keep politics out of soccer are misguided .
sports are inherently political - sometimes positively so .
teams from different cultures that compete fairly on the field demonstrate their shared values , including a mutual love of a game and a respect for one another as opponents .
dejagah has a right to prioritize loyalty to tehran 's hatred for israel over the spirit of the game .
the dfb has both a right and a reason to prioritize that spirit over an individual player 's perceived need to demonstrate cultural identity through discrimination .
the dejagah problem itself will be gone soon .
having already reached the maximum age , the midfielder is only eligible to play for the german under-21s for a few more months , and to become a serious candidate for the german national men 's team , dejagah would have to improve as a player .
he should also be encouraged to think more seriously about the issues he raised this week .
along with the tattoos on his arms , dejagah also got one on his neck , which reads : " remember where you from " -lrb- sic -rrb- .
he might do better to decide who he wants to be .

will the partnership work this time ? the german soccer league , the dfl , which represents the 36 first and second-division clubs , announced on tuesday that the kirch-led company sirius will sell the domestic broadcast rights to the bundesliga for six seasons .
the dfl said it set to earn some 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- from 2009 to 2015 - or 500 million euros a year - from the new deal .
the league currently makes 440 million euros per season from a deal allowing the private , pay tv station premiere to broadcast matches live and state-run television to show highlights .
that deal expires in 2009 .
now the dfl is turning to the 80-year-old kirch in an attempt to boost revenues and catch up with other , richer european leagues such as the english premiership .
lessons of history ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirch 's comeback has amazed all and distressed some the bundesliga has been around the block with kirch before - with near calamitous results .
kirch founded premiere , and for much of the 1990s , he owned live broadcast rights to bundesliga matches .
but the kirch media group repeatedly found itself in financial difficulty and was finally forced to file for bankruptcy in 2002 .
it was the largest insolvency in post-war german history .
the bankruptcy hit the bundesliga hard , depriving clubs of millions in planned revenues and driving some deep into debt .
the affair became known as the " kirch crisis . "
the new deal is reportedly covered in full by bank guarantees , although no specific names of financial institutions have been released .
mixed reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund , in yellow , was one club badly hit by the " kirch crisis " dfl members who approved the deal were generally positive about what kirch could do for the league .
" it 's a quantum leap , " hans-joachim watzke , commercial manager of borussia dortmund , told the dpa news agency .
" i consider mr. kirch a visionary entrepreneur who thinks strategically . "
but hamburg voted against the new deal .
" a decision with enormous implications was made under unnecessary time pressure , " hamburg chairman bernd hoffmann told dpa .
" the terms presented here did n't convince me . "
and fans worry that sirius , in its efforts to bring in increased revenues , might encroach upon the autonomy of soccer reporting or perhaps even do away with highlight programs on public television . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and it would seem that a growing number of people like what they see . although it is difficult to do a reliable headcount of the number of german buddhists in germany , the german buddhist union -lrb- dbu -rrb- estimates there are about 130,000 practioners .
and there appears to be an increased interest in the religion in the nation 's traditionally christian population . " we are definitely experiencing an upwards trend , " said helge latenza of the dbu head office , " but it is a gentle curve . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german buddhists during meditation gentle or not , significantly more germans are turning towards buddhism than are converting to islam , an issue which has been creating waves throughout germany lately . last month , according to the federal interior ministry , there were between 15,000 and 40,000 converts to islam living in germany . so what is the reason for this growing interest in buddhism , which is not even recognized as a religious body under german public law ?
david schneider , one of the senior teachers of the shambala buddhist tradition , says one factor is that buddhism is a particularly tolerant religion which is open to anyone . " there have never been any buddhist wars , " schneider said . "
i think one of the things that people fear these days are extremist groups in all religions .
being the middle way , buddhism is against extremism , you can not be a buddhist extremist . " ambassador for buddhism the growing profile of the buddhist way all over the world can at least in part be attributed to the dalai lama , the spiritual head of the religion . " the media has taken a big interest in buddhism partly because of his holiness , " schneider said , adding that although he is often seen with world leaders and celebrities , he is a serious monk and practitioner who has not lost his compassion . " people like a star and he is a star and a wonderful ambassador , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama inken prohl , a theologist at heidelberg university , agrees that the german fascination for asia and buddhism has much to do with the work and profile of the dalai lama , but believes that people are also looking for care and compassion and answers to questions their christian backgrounds have been unable to provide . " people are seeking ways to get on with their lives , looking for ways to cope , " prohl said , adding that the main churches neither address the body nor the senses in the way that buddhism does . " appealing to the senses is very important , " she said , " and buddhism does this through meditation , physical exercise and simple aesthetics . " seeking happiness there is most certainly an en vogue element to buddhism in germany at the moment , but as latenza from the dbu says that does not make it any less valid .
" some people may be interested on a superficial level , but the fact is that buddhism does provide answers to today 's problems , " he said .
" people want to learn how to live a happier life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yoga practice buddhism calls for self-reflection , which fledgling practitioner volker wieprecht considers " an endlessly valuable gift . "
after almost two decades of rushing around trying out anything he thought might fill his life with happiness and meaning , he suddenly realized that he could find what he was looking for in what he describes as a " totally reliable philosophical system . " for wieprecht , buddhism means " much less drama and much more joy . " but he also acknowledges that living the buddhist way is a life-long project . sustainable trend ? that is not the same for everyone , indeed buddhism lends itself perfectly to the religious dabbler .
anyone is welcome and the extent to which one practices is determined solely by the individual . but if buddhism is something which one can dip in and out of , it is unclear how deep its roots in germany will end up being , or if it will continue to enjoy growth .
david schneider believes that the trend might slow down once people realize the work involved in following the buddhist path . " trend wo n't get you through .

" people like a star and he is a star and a wonderful ambassador , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama inken prohl , a theologist at heidelberg university , agrees that the german fascination for asia and buddhism has much to do with the work and profile of the dalai lama , but believes that people are also looking for care and compassion and answers to questions their christian backgrounds have been unable to provide . " people are seeking ways to get on with their lives , looking for ways to cope , " prohl said , adding that the main churches neither address the body nor the senses in the way that buddhism does . " appealing to the senses is very important , " she said , " and buddhism does this through meditation , physical exercise and simple aesthetics . " seeking happiness there is most certainly an en vogue element to buddhism in germany at the moment , but as latenza from the dbu says that does not make it any less valid .
" some people may be interested on a superficial level , but the fact is that buddhism does provide answers to today 's problems , " he said .
" people want to learn how to live a happier life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yoga practice buddhism calls for self-reflection , which fledgling practitioner volker wieprecht considers " an endlessly valuable gift . "
after almost two decades of rushing around trying out anything he thought might fill his life with happiness and meaning , he suddenly realized that he could find what he was looking for in what he describes as a " totally reliable philosophical system . " for wieprecht , buddhism means " much less drama and much more joy . " but he also acknowledges that living the buddhist way is a life-long project . sustainable trend ? that is not the same for everyone , indeed buddhism lends itself perfectly to the religious dabbler .
anyone is welcome and the extent to which one practices is determined solely by the individual . but if buddhism is something which one can dip in and out of , it is unclear how deep its roots in germany will end up being , or if it will continue to enjoy growth .
david schneider believes that the trend might slow down once people realize the work involved in following the buddhist path . " trend wo n't get you through .
even if the beautiful and famous people are walking the same path , everyone ultimately has to go it alone , " he said .
" but given the stresses of modern life , it has a lot to offer . " tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the report says the plan involves discontinuing all subsidies for maintenance and improvements to stations where fewer than 100 people get on or off trains per day . the station closure plan comes as tiefensee readies legislation , to be put forth in 2008 , that would privatize parts of germany 's national rail system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 10.10.2007 buddhism in germany finding new adherents großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional face of buddhism it 's been around in the wings for several decades already , yet only recently has buddhism begun to venture out towards mainstream german society .
and it would seem that a growing number of people like what they see . although it is difficult to do a reliable headcount of the number of german buddhists in germany , the german buddhist union -lrb- dbu -rrb- estimates there are about 130,000 practioners .
and there appears to be an increased interest in the religion in the nation 's traditionally christian population . " we are definitely experiencing an upwards trend , " said helge latenza of the dbu head office , " but it is a gentle curve . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german buddhists during meditation gentle or not , significantly more germans are turning towards buddhism than are converting to islam , an issue which has been creating waves throughout germany lately . last month , according to the federal interior ministry , there were between 15,000 and 40,000 converts to islam living in germany . so what is the reason for this growing interest in buddhism , which is not even recognized as a religious body under german public law ?
david schneider , one of the senior teachers of the shambala buddhist tradition , says one factor is that buddhism is a particularly tolerant religion which is open to anyone . " there have never been any buddhist wars , " schneider said . "
i think one of the things that people fear these days are extremist groups in all religions .
being the middle way , buddhism is against extremism , you can not be a buddhist extremist . " ambassador for buddhism the growing profile of the buddhist way all over the world can at least in part be attributed to the dalai lama , the spiritual head of the religion . " the media has taken a big interest in buddhism partly because of his holiness , " schneider said , adding that although he is often seen with world leaders and celebrities , he is a serious monk and practitioner who has not lost his compassion . " people like a star and he is a star and a wonderful ambassador , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama inken prohl , a theologist at heidelberg university , agrees that the german fascination for asia and buddhism has much to do with the work and profile of the dalai lama , but believes that people are also looking for care and compassion and answers to questions their christian backgrounds have been unable to provide . " people are seeking ways to get on with their lives , looking for ways to cope , " prohl said , adding that the main churches neither address the body nor the senses in the way that buddhism does . " appealing to the senses is very important , " she said , " and buddhism does this through meditation , physical exercise and simple aesthetics . " seeking happiness there is most certainly an en vogue element to buddhism in germany at the moment , but as latenza from the dbu says that does not make it any less valid .
" some people may be interested on a superficial level , but the fact is that buddhism does provide answers to today 's problems , " he said .
" people want to learn how to live a happier life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yoga practice buddhism calls for self-reflection , which fledgling practitioner volker wieprecht considers " an endlessly valuable gift . "
after almost two decades of rushing around trying out anything he thought might fill his life with happiness and meaning , he suddenly realized that he could find what he was looking for in what he describes as a " totally reliable philosophical system . " for wieprecht , buddhism means " much less drama and much more joy . " but he also acknowledges that living the buddhist way is a life-long project . sustainable trend ? that is not the same for everyone , indeed buddhism lends itself perfectly to the religious dabbler .
anyone is welcome and the extent to which one practices is determined solely by the individual . but if buddhism is something which one can dip in and out of , it is unclear how deep its roots in germany will end up being , or if it will continue to enjoy growth .
david schneider believes that the trend might slow down once people realize the work involved in following the buddhist path . " trend wo n't get you through .
even if the beautiful and famous people are walking the same path , everyone ultimately has to go it alone , " he said .
" but given the stresses of modern life , it has a lot to offer . " tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on the right , berlin - the city where he lived almost all his life .
on the left , tehran - the city where he was born .
dejagah 's decision to boycott the german under-21 team 's upcoming match in israel may be his attempt to align the two components of his perceived cultural identity .
but it 's also a political statement that flouts what should be the spirit of both of the german national team and international soccer itself .
dejagah could have gotten out of the match in israel without entering the spotlight .
he chose not to .
he wanted the public to sanction his action .
and his comments concerning his decision make for unhappy reading .
" i have more iranian than german blood in my veins , " dejagah told the tabloid bz newspaper in a report published tuesday .
" that should be respected , and besides i 'm doing this out of respect .
my parents are iranian . "
dejagah 's use of the blood metaphor no doubt reflects the fact that he has spent far more of his young life honing his skills with the ball in midfield than attuning himself to the historical nuances of his words .
but why should the german soccer association , the dfb , support the idea that some sort of essential iranian-ness entitles him to reject another culture - israel - wholesale ?
on the contrary , should n't the dfb be taking a stand for the principles of sportsmanship in international athletic competitions , which include treating opponents of all religions and ethnicities with equal respect ?
players who , for direct personal reasons , feel unable to live up to this standard against a given opponent can discreetly ask for a leave of absence .
players who feel a muddled religious animosity toward cultures with which they have little personal experience should n't play for national teams at all .
calls to keep politics out of soccer are misguided .
sports are inherently political - sometimes positively so .
teams from different cultures that compete fairly on the field demonstrate their shared values , including a mutual love of a game and a respect for one another as opponents .
dejagah has a right to prioritize loyalty to tehran 's hatred for israel over the spirit of the game .
the dfb has both a right and a reason to prioritize that spirit over an individual player 's perceived need to demonstrate cultural identity through discrimination .
the dejagah problem itself will be gone soon .
having already reached the maximum age , the midfielder is only eligible to play for the german under-21s for a few more months , and to become a serious candidate for the german national men 's team , dejagah would have to improve as a player .
he should also be encouraged to think more seriously about the issues he raised this week .

on the right , berlin - the city where he lived almost all his life .
on the left , tehran - the city where he was born .
dejagah 's decision to boycott the german under-21 team 's upcoming match in israel may be his attempt to align the two components of his perceived cultural identity .
but it 's also a political statement that flouts what should be the spirit of both of the german national team and international soccer itself .
dejagah could have gotten out of the match in israel without entering the spotlight .
he chose not to .
he wanted the public to sanction his action .
and his comments concerning his decision make for unhappy reading .
" i have more iranian than german blood in my veins , " dejagah told the tabloid bz newspaper in a report published tuesday .
" that should be respected , and besides i 'm doing this out of respect .
my parents are iranian . "
dejagah 's use of the blood metaphor no doubt reflects the fact that he has spent far more of his young life honing his skills with the ball in midfield than attuning himself to the historical nuances of his words .
but why should the german soccer association , the dfb , support the idea that some sort of essential iranian-ness entitles him to reject another culture - israel - wholesale ?
on the contrary , should n't the dfb be taking a stand for the principles of sportsmanship in international athletic competitions , which include treating opponents of all religions and ethnicities with equal respect ?
players who , for direct personal reasons , feel unable to live up to this standard against a given opponent can discreetly ask for a leave of absence .
players who feel a muddled religious animosity toward cultures with which they have little personal experience should n't play for national teams at all .
calls to keep politics out of soccer are misguided .
sports are inherently political - sometimes positively so .
teams from different cultures that compete fairly on the field demonstrate their shared values , including a mutual love of a game and a respect for one another as opponents .
dejagah has a right to prioritize loyalty to tehran 's hatred for israel over the spirit of the game .
the dfb has both a right and a reason to prioritize that spirit over an individual player 's perceived need to demonstrate cultural identity through discrimination .
the dejagah problem itself will be gone soon .
having already reached the maximum age , the midfielder is only eligible to play for the german under-21s for a few more months , and to become a serious candidate for the german national men 's team , dejagah would have to improve as a player .
he should also be encouraged to think more seriously about the issues he raised this week .
along with the tattoos on his arms , dejagah also got one on his neck , which reads : " remember where you from " -lrb- sic -rrb- .
he might do better to decide who he wants to be .

but dw chief correspondent peter philipp says that 's his decision and should be respected . it 's a story tailor-made to liven up the dull political landscape and give both tabloids and government backbenchers a perfect opportunity to voice some populist indignation : german-iranian soccer player ashkan dejagah has announced that his political sympathies prevent him from being able to take part in an official under-21 match against israel .
not acceptable , agree politicians across the board .
where would we be if sports player started choosing their opponents ?
sport should not become politicized , they say .
but that 's exactly what they do themselves .
anyone who refuses to demonstrate allegiance to german society is not allowed to represent the german national team .
the central council of the jews agrees , arguing that a german team player should not be allowed to " initiate a private jewish boycott . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they might have had a point , had the young man said he refused to play in israel because he does not acknowledge the state of israel .
but he did n't .
he referred to personal reasons and stressed that he was iranian as well as german .
anyone who criticizes him shows they have no awareness of how complex life can become for immigrants awarded german citizenship , and that they understand little or nothing of the integration process .
clearly , immigrants awarded german citizenship should try to become part of german society .
but this should not necessitate their having to renounce at the door their roots , their past , and everything it stands for .
obviously , they have ties to their former home ; they have friends and family there , maybe even property .
germans cultivate personal ties to foreign countries - why should n't immigrants retain their ties to their former home ?
it would be unreasonable and wrong to expect anything else .
in most cases , this principle is respected .
but not when politics enter the equation .
and they inevitably do , when iran and israel rear their head .
the german-iranian soccer player has little to do with it all - the real conflict is between sworn enemies tehran and jerusalem .
but it 's the public who take the rap - people , like ashkan dejagah , who then face penalties , or unpleasantness at the very least .
the german media and the politicians should avoid blowing these stories out of all proportion and , first and foremost , should stop twisting peoples ' words .
moreover , no one would ever insist that a german-israeli football player in the german under-21 team should have to take part in a game in iran , were it scheduled .
integration is a two-way process , as this case shows .
it has to be undertaken by the naturalized citizen , and it has to be undertaken by the society welcoming him - or not , as the case may be .
integration should not have to mean self-abnegation .
it requires sensitivity , awareness and respect from both sides .
in this particular case , all these are absent .
ultimately , the political rabble-rousing is superfluous for an entirely different reason : ashkan dejagah is 21 years old .
he only has to play in the under-21s for another few months .

but dw chief correspondent peter philipp says that 's his decision and should be respected . it 's a story tailor-made to liven up the dull political landscape and give both tabloids and government backbenchers a perfect opportunity to voice some populist indignation : german-iranian soccer player ashkan dejagah has announced that his political sympathies prevent him from being able to take part in an official under-21 match against israel .
not acceptable , agree politicians across the board .
where would we be if sports player started choosing their opponents ?
sport should not become politicized , they say .
but that 's exactly what they do themselves .
anyone who refuses to demonstrate allegiance to german society is not allowed to represent the german national team .
the central council of the jews agrees , arguing that a german team player should not be allowed to " initiate a private jewish boycott . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they might have had a point , had the young man said he refused to play in israel because he does not acknowledge the state of israel .
but he did n't .
he referred to personal reasons and stressed that he was iranian as well as german .
anyone who criticizes him shows they have no awareness of how complex life can become for immigrants awarded german citizenship , and that they understand little or nothing of the integration process .
clearly , immigrants awarded german citizenship should try to become part of german society .
but this should not necessitate their having to renounce at the door their roots , their past , and everything it stands for .
obviously , they have ties to their former home ; they have friends and family there , maybe even property .
germans cultivate personal ties to foreign countries - why should n't immigrants retain their ties to their former home ?
it would be unreasonable and wrong to expect anything else .
in most cases , this principle is respected .
but not when politics enter the equation .
and they inevitably do , when iran and israel rear their head .
the german-iranian soccer player has little to do with it all - the real conflict is between sworn enemies tehran and jerusalem .
but it 's the public who take the rap - people , like ashkan dejagah , who then face penalties , or unpleasantness at the very least .
the german media and the politicians should avoid blowing these stories out of all proportion and , first and foremost , should stop twisting peoples ' words .
moreover , no one would ever insist that a german-israeli football player in the german under-21 team should have to take part in a game in iran , were it scheduled .
integration is a two-way process , as this case shows .
it has to be undertaken by the naturalized citizen , and it has to be undertaken by the society welcoming him - or not , as the case may be .
integration should not have to mean self-abnegation .
it requires sensitivity , awareness and respect from both sides .
in this particular case , all these are absent .
ultimately , the political rabble-rousing is superfluous for an entirely different reason : ashkan dejagah is 21 years old .
he only has to play in the under-21s for another few months .

but dw chief correspondent peter philipp says that 's his decision and should be respected . it 's a story tailor-made to liven up the dull political landscape and give both tabloids and government backbenchers a perfect opportunity to voice some populist indignation : german-iranian soccer player ashkan dejagah has announced that his political sympathies prevent him from being able to take part in an official under-21 match against israel .
not acceptable , agree politicians across the board .
where would we be if sports player started choosing their opponents ?
sport should not become politicized , they say .
but that 's exactly what they do themselves .
anyone who refuses to demonstrate allegiance to german society is not allowed to represent the german national team .
the central council of the jews agrees , arguing that a german team player should not be allowed to " initiate a private jewish boycott . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they might have had a point , had the young man said he refused to play in israel because he does not acknowledge the state of israel .
but he did n't .
he referred to personal reasons and stressed that he was iranian as well as german .
anyone who criticizes him shows they have no awareness of how complex life can become for immigrants awarded german citizenship , and that they understand little or nothing of the integration process .
clearly , immigrants awarded german citizenship should try to become part of german society .
but this should not necessitate their having to renounce at the door their roots , their past , and everything it stands for .
obviously , they have ties to their former home ; they have friends and family there , maybe even property .
germans cultivate personal ties to foreign countries - why should n't immigrants retain their ties to their former home ?
it would be unreasonable and wrong to expect anything else .
in most cases , this principle is respected .
but not when politics enter the equation .
and they inevitably do , when iran and israel rear their head .
the german-iranian soccer player has little to do with it all - the real conflict is between sworn enemies tehran and jerusalem .
but it 's the public who take the rap - people , like ashkan dejagah , who then face penalties , or unpleasantness at the very least .
the german media and the politicians should avoid blowing these stories out of all proportion and , first and foremost , should stop twisting peoples ' words .
moreover , no one would ever insist that a german-israeli football player in the german under-21 team should have to take part in a game in iran , were it scheduled .
integration is a two-way process , as this case shows .
it has to be undertaken by the naturalized citizen , and it has to be undertaken by the society welcoming him - or not , as the case may be .
integration should not have to mean self-abnegation .
it requires sensitivity , awareness and respect from both sides .
in this particular case , all these are absent .
ultimately , the political rabble-rousing is superfluous for an entirely different reason : ashkan dejagah is 21 years old .
he only has to play in the under-21s for another few months .

volkswagen has announced it plans to bring out a plastic and magnesium car that can get 238 miles per us gallon by 2010 .
neither experts nor the company imagine many people lining up to buy the small but expensive car . there were plenty of pamphlets touting environmental concerns and banners proclaiming green credentials at the frankfurt auto show which ended last month .
but german carmaker volkswagen said tuesday , oct .
9 , it intended to put its money where its mouth is regarding promises to cut carbon dioxide emissions by meeting consumer demand for cars with better gas mileage . " the environment is a topic of discussion in our society and we do not think it is going to come in like a wave then roll back away , as it has in the past , " vw spokesman andreas meurer said . still , no one at vw expects the company 's single-cylinder car in development , which would require one liter of gas to travel 100 kilometers - the equivalent of 238 miles per us gallon - to be a record breaker in sales terms , ceo martin winterkorn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw made a 1-liter-car prototype in 2002 - it 's unclear how similar the new car will be the car , whose body will be made primarily of plastic and magnesium , will only reach a maximum speed of 120 kilometer per hour -lrb- 75 mph -rrb- . " people taking this car on the autobahn should pray they do n't get run over by a trailer truck , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer , director for the center of automotive research at the university of gelsenkirchen . costly production dudenhöffer said he thought vw would sell between 500 and 1,500 of the cars .
the fuel-efficient vehicle will be based on the " up ! , " a compact four-door , though the new car is likely to be considerably more expensive . " a car based on the ' up ! ' and made out of light-weight materials with a special motor is a lot more expensive and will probably be more of a niche product , " dudenhöffer said . regardless of the price , which has not yet been set , the car will serve as an example of what technology can achieve and help vw develop its profile as an environmentally aware company , dudenhöffer said . " it will help build a positive image for the brand , " he added .
" that 's why the project is being run as a small series instead of a prototype . " missing voluntary targets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german automakers have come out against plans to make emissions cuts mandatory but the car is nothing more than a red herring for a failed ecological sales strategy , said werner reh of the environmental group friends of the earth deutschland . he said the company was trying to present itself as more environmentally friendly than the facts show , adding that vw , like most german carmakers , would not even be able to meet the voluntary co2 emissions limits the auto industry has set itself . " manufactures have to meet their self-imposed co2 emissions standards and a car that is sold a thousand - or even ten thousand - times wo n't help , " he said .
" a hundred thousand of the cars would have to be sold . " in 1998 , the european automobile manufacturers association , which represents the 13 of the largest automakers on the continent , reached a voluntary agreement with the european commission to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 140 g / km over 10 years . low-consumption cars nothing new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans want big cars with big , powerful engines , dudenhöffer said with an average or 173 g / km , a change in marketing strategy would be a step in the right direction for volkswagen , reh said . " vw , like all german manufactures , spends billions to advertise vehicles that emit more than 200 grams of co2 , " he said .
" maybe they should change the commercials first . " but consumers also have a hand in lowering co2 emission , dudenhöffer said , adding that germans are buying larger , more powerful cars than ever before . " we 've already had all kinds of fuel-saving cars on the market with the audi a2 , the three-liter lupo from vw and opel 's environmental models , " he said .

will the partnership work this time ? the german soccer league , the dfl , which represents the 36 first and second-division clubs , announced on tuesday that the kirch-led company sirius will sell the domestic broadcast rights to the bundesliga for six seasons .
the dfl said it set to earn some 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- from 2009 to 2015 - or 500 million euros a year - from the new deal .
the league currently makes 440 million euros per season from a deal allowing the private , pay tv station premiere to broadcast matches live and state-run television to show highlights .

the bankruptcy hit the bundesliga hard , depriving clubs of millions in planned revenues and driving some deep into debt .

the country has been positioning itself to benefit from developments in film and tv markets that have seen reality show concepts traded worldwide and soaps repackaged and customized for international markets .
many of the country 's prime time entertainment format exports have been gaining international momentum .
thomas gottschalk 's talk show wetten , dass ... , which first aired 26 years ago , has gone from strength to strength .
on its home turf it attracts record viewing figures , and became the first entertainment show from germany to be sold abroad .
over the years , the format has been sold to 13 countries - including in 2006 to the key us market , where it airs as wanna bet .
further ratings giants in germany with international resonance are the science show clever , fronted by comedian wigald boning , sold to 15 countries , and schlag den raab , or " beat stefan raab . "
although it only debuted one year ago , it has already been sold to four countries including britain and the us .
the international title is beat your host .

" it 's innovative , it 's new , no one ever did it before … it was successful at home , has great viewer ratings , and it is easy to grasp . "

the snag is , it 's the neighbors who decide who wins - while the five families include one with a transsexual father , an islamic fundamentalist family and an african family in which the husband has two wives .

according to german united distributors , a distribution subsidiary of ard , it has been bought by 15 countries , including finland , austria , canada , latvia , slovakia and italy , where it 's called tempesta d 'amore .
a surprise success this week was the 2004 tv movie stauffenberg starring sebastian koch , who stared in the oscar-winning the lives of others , as the eponymous hero .
the topic triggered renewed interest from buyers in the us and spain thanks to the tom cruise film on the same subject currently in production in berlin .
a number of broadcasters and dvd distributors were keen to make the most of publicity generated by the cruise project to boost ratings and sales of the german movie .

and it would seem that a growing number of people like what they see . although it is difficult to do a reliable headcount of the number of german buddhists in germany , the german buddhist union -lrb- dbu -rrb- estimates there are about 130,000 practioners .

david schneider , one of the senior teachers of the shambala buddhist tradition , says one factor is that buddhism is a particularly tolerant religion which is open to anyone . " there have never been any buddhist wars , " schneider said . "
i think one of the things that people fear these days are extremist groups in all religions .
being the middle way , buddhism is against extremism , you can not be a buddhist extremist . " ambassador for buddhism the growing profile of the buddhist way all over the world can at least in part be attributed to the dalai lama , the spiritual head of the religion . " the media has taken a big interest in buddhism partly because of his holiness , " schneider said , adding that although he is often seen with world leaders and celebrities , he is a serious monk and practitioner who has not lost his compassion . " people like a star and he is a star and a wonderful ambassador , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama inken prohl , a theologist at heidelberg university , agrees that the german fascination for asia and buddhism has much to do with the work and profile of the dalai lama , but believes that people are also looking for care and compassion and answers to questions their christian backgrounds have been unable to provide . " people are seeking ways to get on with their lives , looking for ways to cope , " prohl said , adding that the main churches neither address the body nor the senses in the way that buddhism does . " appealing to the senses is very important , " she said , " and buddhism does this through meditation , physical exercise and simple aesthetics . " seeking happiness there is most certainly an en vogue element to buddhism in germany at the moment , but as latenza from the dbu says that does not make it any less valid .
" some people may be interested on a superficial level , but the fact is that buddhism does provide answers to today 's problems , " he said .
" people want to learn how to live a happier life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yoga practice buddhism calls for self-reflection , which fledgling practitioner volker wieprecht considers " an endlessly valuable gift . "
after almost two decades of rushing around trying out anything he thought might fill his life with happiness and meaning , he suddenly realized that he could find what he was looking for in what he describes as a " totally reliable philosophical system . " for wieprecht , buddhism means " much less drama and much more joy . " but he also acknowledges that living the buddhist way is a life-long project . sustainable trend ? that is not the same for everyone , indeed buddhism lends itself perfectly to the religious dabbler .
anyone is welcome and the extent to which one practices is determined solely by the individual . but if buddhism is something which one can dip in and out of , it is unclear how deep its roots in germany will end up being , or if it will continue to enjoy growth .
david schneider believes that the trend might slow down once people realize the work involved in following the buddhist path . " trend wo n't get you through .

will the partnership work this time ? the german soccer league , the dfl , which represents the 36 first and second-division clubs , announced on tuesday that the kirch-led company sirius will sell the domestic broadcast rights to the bundesliga for six seasons .
the dfl said it set to earn some 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- from 2009 to 2015 - or 500 million euros a year - from the new deal .
the league currently makes 440 million euros per season from a deal allowing the private , pay tv station premiere to broadcast matches live and state-run television to show highlights .
that deal expires in 2009 .
now the dfl is turning to the 80-year-old kirch in an attempt to boost revenues and catch up with other , richer european leagues such as the english premiership .
lessons of history ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirch 's comeback has amazed all and distressed some the bundesliga has been around the block with kirch before - with near calamitous results .
kirch founded premiere , and for much of the 1990s , he owned live broadcast rights to bundesliga matches .
but the kirch media group repeatedly found itself in financial difficulty and was finally forced to file for bankruptcy in 2002 .
it was the largest insolvency in post-war german history .
the bankruptcy hit the bundesliga hard , depriving clubs of millions in planned revenues and driving some deep into debt .
the affair became known as the " kirch crisis . "
the new deal is reportedly covered in full by bank guarantees , although no specific names of financial institutions have been released .
mixed reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund , in yellow , was one club badly hit by the " kirch crisis " dfl members who approved the deal were generally positive about what kirch could do for the league .
" it 's a quantum leap , " hans-joachim watzke , commercial manager of borussia dortmund , told the dpa news agency .
" i consider mr. kirch a visionary entrepreneur who thinks strategically . "
but hamburg voted against the new deal .
" a decision with enormous implications was made under unnecessary time pressure , " hamburg chairman bernd hoffmann told dpa .
" the terms presented here did n't convince me . "
and fans worry that sirius , in its efforts to bring in increased revenues , might encroach upon the autonomy of soccer reporting or perhaps even do away with highlight programs on public television . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it 's a quantum leap , " hans-joachim watzke , commercial manager of borussia dortmund , told the dpa news agency .
" i consider mr. kirch a visionary entrepreneur who thinks strategically . "
but hamburg voted against the new deal .
" a decision with enormous implications was made under unnecessary time pressure , " hamburg chairman bernd hoffmann told dpa .
" the terms presented here did n't convince me . "

volkswagen has announced it plans to bring out a plastic and magnesium car that can get 238 miles per us gallon by 2010 .
neither experts nor the company imagine many people lining up to buy the small but expensive car . there were plenty of pamphlets touting environmental concerns and banners proclaiming green credentials at the frankfurt auto show which ended last month .
but german carmaker volkswagen said tuesday , oct .
9 , it intended to put its money where its mouth is regarding promises to cut carbon dioxide emissions by meeting consumer demand for cars with better gas mileage . " the environment is a topic of discussion in our society and we do not think it is going to come in like a wave then roll back away , as it has in the past , " vw spokesman andreas meurer said . still , no one at vw expects the company 's single-cylinder car in development , which would require one liter of gas to travel 100 kilometers - the equivalent of 238 miles per us gallon - to be a record breaker in sales terms , ceo martin winterkorn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw made a 1-liter-car prototype in 2002 - it 's unclear how similar the new car will be the car , whose body will be made primarily of plastic and magnesium , will only reach a maximum speed of 120 kilometer per hour -lrb- 75 mph -rrb- . " people taking this car on the autobahn should pray they do n't get run over by a trailer truck , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer , director for the center of automotive research at the university of gelsenkirchen . costly production dudenhöffer said he thought vw would sell between 500 and 1,500 of the cars .
the fuel-efficient vehicle will be based on the " up ! , " a compact four-door , though the new car is likely to be considerably more expensive . " a car based on the ' up ! ' and made out of light-weight materials with a special motor is a lot more expensive and will probably be more of a niche product , " dudenhöffer said . regardless of the price , which has not yet been set , the car will serve as an example of what technology can achieve and help vw develop its profile as an environmentally aware company , dudenhöffer said . " it will help build a positive image for the brand , " he added .
" that 's why the project is being run as a small series instead of a prototype . " missing voluntary targets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german automakers have come out against plans to make emissions cuts mandatory but the car is nothing more than a red herring for a failed ecological sales strategy , said werner reh of the environmental group friends of the earth deutschland . he said the company was trying to present itself as more environmentally friendly than the facts show , adding that vw , like most german carmakers , would not even be able to meet the voluntary co2 emissions limits the auto industry has set itself . " manufactures have to meet their self-imposed co2 emissions standards and a car that is sold a thousand - or even ten thousand - times wo n't help , " he said .
" a hundred thousand of the cars would have to be sold . " in 1998 , the european automobile manufacturers association , which represents the 13 of the largest automakers on the continent , reached a voluntary agreement with the european commission to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 140 g / km over 10 years . low-consumption cars nothing new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans want big cars with big , powerful engines , dudenhöffer said with an average or 173 g / km , a change in marketing strategy would be a step in the right direction for volkswagen , reh said . " vw , like all german manufactures , spends billions to advertise vehicles that emit more than 200 grams of co2 , " he said .
" maybe they should change the commercials first . " but consumers also have a hand in lowering co2 emission , dudenhöffer said , adding that germans are buying larger , more powerful cars than ever before . " we 've already had all kinds of fuel-saving cars on the market with the audi a2 , the three-liter lupo from vw and opel 's environmental models , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 10.10.2007 opinion : soccer player within his rights to boycott israel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young soccer player 's refusal to play in israel created headlines throughout germany on tuesday .
but dw chief correspondent peter philipp says that 's his decision and should be respected . it 's a story tailor-made to liven up the dull political landscape and give both tabloids and government backbenchers a perfect opportunity to voice some populist indignation : german-iranian soccer player ashkan dejagah has announced that his political sympathies prevent him from being able to take part in an official under-21 match against israel .
not acceptable , agree politicians across the board .
where would we be if sports player started choosing their opponents ?
sport should not become politicized , they say .
but that 's exactly what they do themselves .
anyone who refuses to demonstrate allegiance to german society is not allowed to represent the german national team .
the central council of the jews agrees , arguing that a german team player should not be allowed to " initiate a private jewish boycott . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they might have had a point , had the young man said he refused to play in israel because he does not acknowledge the state of israel .
but he did n't .
he referred to personal reasons and stressed that he was iranian as well as german .
anyone who criticizes him shows they have no awareness of how complex life can become for immigrants awarded german citizenship , and that they understand little or nothing of the integration process .
clearly , immigrants awarded german citizenship should try to become part of german society .
but this should not necessitate their having to renounce at the door their roots , their past , and everything it stands for .
obviously , they have ties to their former home ; they have friends and family there , maybe even property .
germans cultivate personal ties to foreign countries - why should n't immigrants retain their ties to their former home ?
it would be unreasonable and wrong to expect anything else .
in most cases , this principle is respected .
but not when politics enter the equation .
and they inevitably do , when iran and israel rear their head .
the german-iranian soccer player has little to do with it all - the real conflict is between sworn enemies tehran and jerusalem .
but it 's the public who take the rap - people , like ashkan dejagah , who then face penalties , or unpleasantness at the very least .
the german media and the politicians should avoid blowing these stories out of all proportion and , first and foremost , should stop twisting peoples ' words .
moreover , no one would ever insist that a german-israeli football player in the german under-21 team should have to take part in a game in iran , were it scheduled .
integration is a two-way process , as this case shows .
it has to be undertaken by the naturalized citizen , and it has to be undertaken by the society welcoming him - or not , as the case may be .
integration should not have to mean self-abnegation .
it requires sensitivity , awareness and respect from both sides .
in this particular case , all these are absent .
ultimately , the political rabble-rousing is superfluous for an entirely different reason : ashkan dejagah is 21 years old .
he only has to play in the under-21s for another few months .

and it would seem that a growing number of people like what they see . although it is difficult to do a reliable headcount of the number of german buddhists in germany , the german buddhist union -lrb- dbu -rrb- estimates there are about 130,000 practioners .
and there appears to be an increased interest in the religion in the nation 's traditionally christian population . " we are definitely experiencing an upwards trend , " said helge latenza of the dbu head office , " but it is a gentle curve . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german buddhists during meditation gentle or not , significantly more germans are turning towards buddhism than are converting to islam , an issue which has been creating waves throughout germany lately . last month , according to the federal interior ministry , there were between 15,000 and 40,000 converts to islam living in germany . so what is the reason for this growing interest in buddhism , which is not even recognized as a religious body under german public law ?
david schneider , one of the senior teachers of the shambala buddhist tradition , says one factor is that buddhism is a particularly tolerant religion which is open to anyone . " there have never been any buddhist wars , " schneider said . "
i think one of the things that people fear these days are extremist groups in all religions .
being the middle way , buddhism is against extremism , you can not be a buddhist extremist . " ambassador for buddhism the growing profile of the buddhist way all over the world can at least in part be attributed to the dalai lama , the spiritual head of the religion . " the media has taken a big interest in buddhism partly because of his holiness , " schneider said , adding that although he is often seen with world leaders and celebrities , he is a serious monk and practitioner who has not lost his compassion . " people like a star and he is a star and a wonderful ambassador , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama inken prohl , a theologist at heidelberg university , agrees that the german fascination for asia and buddhism has much to do with the work and profile of the dalai lama , but believes that people are also looking for care and compassion and answers to questions their christian backgrounds have been unable to provide . " people are seeking ways to get on with their lives , looking for ways to cope , " prohl said , adding that the main churches neither address the body nor the senses in the way that buddhism does . " appealing to the senses is very important , " she said , " and buddhism does this through meditation , physical exercise and simple aesthetics . " seeking happiness there is most certainly an en vogue element to buddhism in germany at the moment , but as latenza from the dbu says that does not make it any less valid .
" some people may be interested on a superficial level , but the fact is that buddhism does provide answers to today 's problems , " he said .
" people want to learn how to live a happier life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yoga practice buddhism calls for self-reflection , which fledgling practitioner volker wieprecht considers " an endlessly valuable gift . "
after almost two decades of rushing around trying out anything he thought might fill his life with happiness and meaning , he suddenly realized that he could find what he was looking for in what he describes as a " totally reliable philosophical system . " for wieprecht , buddhism means " much less drama and much more joy . " but he also acknowledges that living the buddhist way is a life-long project . sustainable trend ? that is not the same for everyone , indeed buddhism lends itself perfectly to the religious dabbler .
anyone is welcome and the extent to which one practices is determined solely by the individual . but if buddhism is something which one can dip in and out of , it is unclear how deep its roots in germany will end up being , or if it will continue to enjoy growth .
david schneider believes that the trend might slow down once people realize the work involved in following the buddhist path . " trend wo n't get you through .
even if the beautiful and famous people are walking the same path , everyone ultimately has to go it alone , " he said .

david schneider , one of the senior teachers of the shambala buddhist tradition , says one factor is that buddhism is a particularly tolerant religion which is open to anyone . " there have never been any buddhist wars , " schneider said . "
i think one of the things that people fear these days are extremist groups in all religions .
being the middle way , buddhism is against extremism , you can not be a buddhist extremist . " ambassador for buddhism the growing profile of the buddhist way all over the world can at least in part be attributed to the dalai lama , the spiritual head of the religion . " the media has taken a big interest in buddhism partly because of his holiness , " schneider said , adding that although he is often seen with world leaders and celebrities , he is a serious monk and practitioner who has not lost his compassion . " people like a star and he is a star and a wonderful ambassador , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama inken prohl , a theologist at heidelberg university , agrees that the german fascination for asia and buddhism has much to do with the work and profile of the dalai lama , but believes that people are also looking for care and compassion and answers to questions their christian backgrounds have been unable to provide . " people are seeking ways to get on with their lives , looking for ways to cope , " prohl said , adding that the main churches neither address the body nor the senses in the way that buddhism does . " appealing to the senses is very important , " she said , " and buddhism does this through meditation , physical exercise and simple aesthetics . " seeking happiness there is most certainly an en vogue element to buddhism in germany at the moment , but as latenza from the dbu says that does not make it any less valid .
" some people may be interested on a superficial level , but the fact is that buddhism does provide answers to today 's problems , " he said .
" people want to learn how to live a happier life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yoga practice buddhism calls for self-reflection , which fledgling practitioner volker wieprecht considers " an endlessly valuable gift . "
after almost two decades of rushing around trying out anything he thought might fill his life with happiness and meaning , he suddenly realized that he could find what he was looking for in what he describes as a " totally reliable philosophical system . " for wieprecht , buddhism means " much less drama and much more joy . " but he also acknowledges that living the buddhist way is a life-long project . sustainable trend ? that is not the same for everyone , indeed buddhism lends itself perfectly to the religious dabbler .
anyone is welcome and the extent to which one practices is determined solely by the individual . but if buddhism is something which one can dip in and out of , it is unclear how deep its roots in germany will end up being , or if it will continue to enjoy growth .
david schneider believes that the trend might slow down once people realize the work involved in following the buddhist path . " trend wo n't get you through .
even if the beautiful and famous people are walking the same path , everyone ultimately has to go it alone , " he said .
" but given the stresses of modern life , it has a lot to offer . " tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de soccer -pipe- 10.10.2007 opinion : soccer player within his rights to boycott israel großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a young soccer player 's refusal to play in israel created headlines throughout germany on tuesday .
but dw chief correspondent peter philipp says that 's his decision and should be respected . it 's a story tailor-made to liven up the dull political landscape and give both tabloids and government backbenchers a perfect opportunity to voice some populist indignation : german-iranian soccer player ashkan dejagah has announced that his political sympathies prevent him from being able to take part in an official under-21 match against israel .
not acceptable , agree politicians across the board .
where would we be if sports player started choosing their opponents ?
sport should not become politicized , they say .
but that 's exactly what they do themselves .
anyone who refuses to demonstrate allegiance to german society is not allowed to represent the german national team .
the central council of the jews agrees , arguing that a german team player should not be allowed to " initiate a private jewish boycott . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they might have had a point , had the young man said he refused to play in israel because he does not acknowledge the state of israel .
but he did n't .
he referred to personal reasons and stressed that he was iranian as well as german .
anyone who criticizes him shows they have no awareness of how complex life can become for immigrants awarded german citizenship , and that they understand little or nothing of the integration process .
clearly , immigrants awarded german citizenship should try to become part of german society .
but this should not necessitate their having to renounce at the door their roots , their past , and everything it stands for .
obviously , they have ties to their former home ; they have friends and family there , maybe even property .
germans cultivate personal ties to foreign countries - why should n't immigrants retain their ties to their former home ?
it would be unreasonable and wrong to expect anything else .
in most cases , this principle is respected .
but not when politics enter the equation .
and they inevitably do , when iran and israel rear their head .
the german-iranian soccer player has little to do with it all - the real conflict is between sworn enemies tehran and jerusalem .
but it 's the public who take the rap - people , like ashkan dejagah , who then face penalties , or unpleasantness at the very least .
the german media and the politicians should avoid blowing these stories out of all proportion and , first and foremost , should stop twisting peoples ' words .
moreover , no one would ever insist that a german-israeli football player in the german under-21 team should have to take part in a game in iran , were it scheduled .
integration is a two-way process , as this case shows .
it has to be undertaken by the naturalized citizen , and it has to be undertaken by the society welcoming him - or not , as the case may be .
integration should not have to mean self-abnegation .
it requires sensitivity , awareness and respect from both sides .
in this particular case , all these are absent .
ultimately , the political rabble-rousing is superfluous for an entirely different reason : ashkan dejagah is 21 years old .
he only has to play in the under-21s for another few months .

on the right , berlin - the city where he lived almost all his life .
on the left , tehran - the city where he was born .
dejagah 's decision to boycott the german under-21 team 's upcoming match in israel may be his attempt to align the two components of his perceived cultural identity .
but it 's also a political statement that flouts what should be the spirit of both of the german national team and international soccer itself .
dejagah could have gotten out of the match in israel without entering the spotlight .
he chose not to .
he wanted the public to sanction his action .
and his comments concerning his decision make for unhappy reading .
" i have more iranian than german blood in my veins , " dejagah told the tabloid bz newspaper in a report published tuesday .
" that should be respected , and besides i 'm doing this out of respect .
my parents are iranian . "
dejagah 's use of the blood metaphor no doubt reflects the fact that he has spent far more of his young life honing his skills with the ball in midfield than attuning himself to the historical nuances of his words .
but why should the german soccer association , the dfb , support the idea that some sort of essential iranian-ness entitles him to reject another culture - israel - wholesale ?
on the contrary , should n't the dfb be taking a stand for the principles of sportsmanship in international athletic competitions , which include treating opponents of all religions and ethnicities with equal respect ?
players who , for direct personal reasons , feel unable to live up to this standard against a given opponent can discreetly ask for a leave of absence .
players who feel a muddled religious animosity toward cultures with which they have little personal experience should n't play for national teams at all .
calls to keep politics out of soccer are misguided .
sports are inherently political - sometimes positively so .
teams from different cultures that compete fairly on the field demonstrate their shared values , including a mutual love of a game and a respect for one another as opponents .
dejagah has a right to prioritize loyalty to tehran 's hatred for israel over the spirit of the game .
the dfb has both a right and a reason to prioritize that spirit over an individual player 's perceived need to demonstrate cultural identity through discrimination .
the dejagah problem itself will be gone soon .
having already reached the maximum age , the midfielder is only eligible to play for the german under-21s for a few more months , and to become a serious candidate for the german national men 's team , dejagah would have to improve as a player .
he should also be encouraged to think more seriously about the issues he raised this week .
along with the tattoos on his arms , dejagah also got one on his neck , which reads : " remember where you from " -lrb- sic -rrb- .
he might do better to decide who he wants to be .

and as sales show , german tv formats are holding their own internationally . for the participants , the mipcom bazaar means five heady days of wheeling and dealing in program rights .
the biggest winner is clearly the us , with companies such as disney taking the opportunity to boost foreign tv sales with primetime hits such as lost and desperate housewives .
but as tv markets become increasingly internationalized , the traffic has become more two-way than ever .
europe : format factory with foreign license fees reaching record heights in recent years , the movers and shakers in the riviera this week were playing for high stakes .
" we the broadcasters are the guys who feed the world what it wants to watch , " said leslie moonves from cbs in a keynote address as the fair kicked off .
but he also admitted that americans " had been slow on the uptake " when it came to tv produced outside the us .
but now the us networks have learnt their lesson after dragging their feet on european formats such as survivor and big brother , made by dutch company endemol . these days , while europe is still more than happy to open its wallets for us shows , american networks have also realized that where europe leads , it might be worth following .
repackaging , customizing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas gottschalk , germany 's favorite talk show host that includes germany .
the country has been positioning itself to benefit from developments in film and tv markets that have seen reality show concepts traded worldwide and soaps repackaged and customized for international markets .
many of the country 's prime time entertainment format exports have been gaining international momentum .
thomas gottschalk 's talk show wetten , dass ... , which first aired 26 years ago , has gone from strength to strength .
on its home turf it attracts record viewing figures , and became the first entertainment show from germany to be sold abroad .
over the years , the format has been sold to 13 countries - including in 2006 to the key us market , where it airs as wanna bet .
further ratings giants in germany with international resonance are the science show clever , fronted by comedian wigald boning , sold to 15 countries , and schlag den raab , or " beat stefan raab . "
although it only debuted one year ago , it has already been sold to four countries including britain and the us .
the international title is beat your host .
negotiations with other prospective buyers are ongoing . "
clever is what we now call ' sciencetainment ' - that means knowledge , family entertainment , and a game show component , in a form that never existed before , " says jens richter , who distributes both clever and schlag den raab worldwide .
" it 's innovative , it 's new , no one ever did it before … it was successful at home , has great viewer ratings , and it is easy to grasp . "
crucially , these shows tick all the right boxes .
according to prominent industry watcher virginia mouseler , what tv audiences around the globe want these days are kid-centered , family-based reality shows - and especially game shows with big cash prizes , reported the afp news agency .
edgy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crew from " türkisch für anfänger " another german show generating interest at mipcom might prove more controversial .
willkommen in der nachbarschaft -lrb- " welcome to the neighborhood " -rrb- features five families competing to win a house worth 250,000 euros .
the snag is , it 's the neighbors who decide who wins - while the five families include one with a transsexual father , an islamic fundamentalist family and an african family in which the husband has two wives .
going global meanwhile , marketing agency telepool made the most of the trade fair , and sold the weekly german drama türkisch für anfänger -lrb- " turkish for beginners " -rrb- , made by state broadcaster ard , to two buyers .
in france , the show about german-turkish patchwork family , the ötztürk-schneiders , will air on canal + and the free tv youth station nrj .
broadcast rights were also bought by russian mtv .
telepool has said it is also talking to other countries and expects to sign further contracts .
gaining similar heat abroad is ard 's daily soap sturm der liebe -lrb- " love storm " -rrb- , currently the most successful show on german tv in terms of market share .
according to german united distributors , a distribution subsidiary of ard , it has been bought by 15 countries , including finland , austria , canada , latvia , slovakia and italy , where it 's called tempesta d 'amore .
a surprise success this week was the 2004 tv movie stauffenberg starring sebastian koch , who stared in the oscar-winning the lives of others , as the eponymous hero .
the topic triggered renewed interest from buyers in the us and spain thanks to the tom cruise film on the same subject currently in production in berlin .
a number of broadcasters and dvd distributors were keen to make the most of publicity generated by the cruise project to boost ratings and sales of the german movie .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the mipcom the german entries for the annual emmys , awarded by the international academy of television arts & sciences , were also announced at mipcom .
selected for the category tv movie is die mauer - berlin ' 61 -lrb- " the wall - berlin ' 61 " -rrb- , which beat nominees from brazil , china and britain , while the jury selected the rtl soap alle lieben jimmy -lrb- " everyone loves jimmy " -rrb- , made by bavaria film in the comedy category . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

local politicians say that could leave passengers who live outside cities permanently stranded . the financial times germany reported on tuesday that germany 's social democratic transport minister wolfgang tiefensee has drawn up a position paper calling for drastic cuts in government subsidies stations receive .
the report says the plan involves discontinuing all subsidies for maintenance and improvements to stations where fewer than 100 people get on or off trains per day . the station closure plan comes as tiefensee readies legislation , to be put forth in 2008 , that would privatize parts of germany 's national rail system .
off the beaten track bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee is under fire for the plan local politicians , already wary of what privatization could mean for their constituencies , are up in arms about proposed cuts .
" according to tiefensee 's criteria , we 'd have to shut 53 percent of stations in our region , " the transportation minister of saxony-anhalt , karl-heinz daehre , told the financial times .
" his plans are beyond discussion for germany 's federal states . "
advocacy groups also lambasted the plans , particularly reported that subsidies would be discontinued for stations with " complicated platforms , " that is , containing ramps and other modifications for disabled passengers , if they did not meet a workday minimum of 1,000 passengers .
" ending subsidies would further reduce the already insufficient number of handicapped-friendly stations , " the managing director of the german welfare association -lrb- deutscher wohlfahrtsverband -rrb- , ulrich schneider , told the dpa news agency .
referring to germany 's ageing population , he added : " tiefensee is showing that he 's out of touch with demographic developments . "
however , the transport minister 's office has denied that part of the report , calling it " unfounded . "
even at the federal level teifensee 's plans have provoked ire .
" it 's not very clever to connect this decision with the privatization of the german railways , " the deputy head of the conservative parliamentary group , hans-peter freidrich , told the ap news agency . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 10.10.2007 buddhism in germany finding new adherents großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional face of buddhism it 's been around in the wings for several decades already , yet only recently has buddhism begun to venture out towards mainstream german society .
and it would seem that a growing number of people like what they see . although it is difficult to do a reliable headcount of the number of german buddhists in germany , the german buddhist union -lrb- dbu -rrb- estimates there are about 130,000 practioners .
and there appears to be an increased interest in the religion in the nation 's traditionally christian population . " we are definitely experiencing an upwards trend , " said helge latenza of the dbu head office , " but it is a gentle curve . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german buddhists during meditation gentle or not , significantly more germans are turning towards buddhism than are converting to islam , an issue which has been creating waves throughout germany lately . last month , according to the federal interior ministry , there were between 15,000 and 40,000 converts to islam living in germany . so what is the reason for this growing interest in buddhism , which is not even recognized as a religious body under german public law ?
david schneider , one of the senior teachers of the shambala buddhist tradition , says one factor is that buddhism is a particularly tolerant religion which is open to anyone . " there have never been any buddhist wars , " schneider said . "
i think one of the things that people fear these days are extremist groups in all religions .
being the middle way , buddhism is against extremism , you can not be a buddhist extremist . " ambassador for buddhism the growing profile of the buddhist way all over the world can at least in part be attributed to the dalai lama , the spiritual head of the religion . " the media has taken a big interest in buddhism partly because of his holiness , " schneider said , adding that although he is often seen with world leaders and celebrities , he is a serious monk and practitioner who has not lost his compassion . " people like a star and he is a star and a wonderful ambassador , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama inken prohl , a theologist at heidelberg university , agrees that the german fascination for asia and buddhism has much to do with the work and profile of the dalai lama , but believes that people are also looking for care and compassion and answers to questions their christian backgrounds have been unable to provide . " people are seeking ways to get on with their lives , looking for ways to cope , " prohl said , adding that the main churches neither address the body nor the senses in the way that buddhism does . " appealing to the senses is very important , " she said , " and buddhism does this through meditation , physical exercise and simple aesthetics . " seeking happiness there is most certainly an en vogue element to buddhism in germany at the moment , but as latenza from the dbu says that does not make it any less valid .
" some people may be interested on a superficial level , but the fact is that buddhism does provide answers to today 's problems , " he said .
" people want to learn how to live a happier life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yoga practice buddhism calls for self-reflection , which fledgling practitioner volker wieprecht considers " an endlessly valuable gift . "
after almost two decades of rushing around trying out anything he thought might fill his life with happiness and meaning , he suddenly realized that he could find what he was looking for in what he describes as a " totally reliable philosophical system . " for wieprecht , buddhism means " much less drama and much more joy . " but he also acknowledges that living the buddhist way is a life-long project . sustainable trend ? that is not the same for everyone , indeed buddhism lends itself perfectly to the religious dabbler .
anyone is welcome and the extent to which one practices is determined solely by the individual . but if buddhism is something which one can dip in and out of , it is unclear how deep its roots in germany will end up being , or if it will continue to enjoy growth .
david schneider believes that the trend might slow down once people realize the work involved in following the buddhist path . " trend wo n't get you through .
even if the beautiful and famous people are walking the same path , everyone ultimately has to go it alone , " he said .
" but given the stresses of modern life , it has a lot to offer . " tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but dw chief correspondent peter philipp says that 's his decision and should be respected . it 's a story tailor-made to liven up the dull political landscape and give both tabloids and government backbenchers a perfect opportunity to voice some populist indignation : german-iranian soccer player ashkan dejagah has announced that his political sympathies prevent him from being able to take part in an official under-21 match against israel .
not acceptable , agree politicians across the board .
where would we be if sports player started choosing their opponents ?
sport should not become politicized , they say .
but that 's exactly what they do themselves .
anyone who refuses to demonstrate allegiance to german society is not allowed to represent the german national team .
the central council of the jews agrees , arguing that a german team player should not be allowed to " initiate a private jewish boycott . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they might have had a point , had the young man said he refused to play in israel because he does not acknowledge the state of israel .
but he did n't .
he referred to personal reasons and stressed that he was iranian as well as german .
anyone who criticizes him shows they have no awareness of how complex life can become for immigrants awarded german citizenship , and that they understand little or nothing of the integration process .
clearly , immigrants awarded german citizenship should try to become part of german society .
but this should not necessitate their having to renounce at the door their roots , their past , and everything it stands for .
obviously , they have ties to their former home ; they have friends and family there , maybe even property .
germans cultivate personal ties to foreign countries - why should n't immigrants retain their ties to their former home ?
it would be unreasonable and wrong to expect anything else .
in most cases , this principle is respected .
but not when politics enter the equation .
and they inevitably do , when iran and israel rear their head .
the german-iranian soccer player has little to do with it all - the real conflict is between sworn enemies tehran and jerusalem .
but it 's the public who take the rap - people , like ashkan dejagah , who then face penalties , or unpleasantness at the very least .
the german media and the politicians should avoid blowing these stories out of all proportion and , first and foremost , should stop twisting peoples ' words .
moreover , no one would ever insist that a german-israeli football player in the german under-21 team should have to take part in a game in iran , were it scheduled .
integration is a two-way process , as this case shows .
it has to be undertaken by the naturalized citizen , and it has to be undertaken by the society welcoming him - or not , as the case may be .
integration should not have to mean self-abnegation .
it requires sensitivity , awareness and respect from both sides .
in this particular case , all these are absent .
ultimately , the political rabble-rousing is superfluous for an entirely different reason : ashkan dejagah is 21 years old .
he only has to play in the under-21s for another few months .

volkswagen has announced it plans to bring out a plastic and magnesium car that can get 238 miles per us gallon by 2010 .
neither experts nor the company imagine many people lining up to buy the small but expensive car . there were plenty of pamphlets touting environmental concerns and banners proclaiming green credentials at the frankfurt auto show which ended last month .
but german carmaker volkswagen said tuesday , oct .
9 , it intended to put its money where its mouth is regarding promises to cut carbon dioxide emissions by meeting consumer demand for cars with better gas mileage . " the environment is a topic of discussion in our society and we do not think it is going to come in like a wave then roll back away , as it has in the past , " vw spokesman andreas meurer said . still , no one at vw expects the company 's single-cylinder car in development , which would require one liter of gas to travel 100 kilometers - the equivalent of 238 miles per us gallon - to be a record breaker in sales terms , ceo martin winterkorn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw made a 1-liter-car prototype in 2002 - it 's unclear how similar the new car will be the car , whose body will be made primarily of plastic and magnesium , will only reach a maximum speed of 120 kilometer per hour -lrb- 75 mph -rrb- . " people taking this car on the autobahn should pray they do n't get run over by a trailer truck , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer , director for the center of automotive research at the university of gelsenkirchen . costly production dudenhöffer said he thought vw would sell between 500 and 1,500 of the cars .
the fuel-efficient vehicle will be based on the " up ! , " a compact four-door , though the new car is likely to be considerably more expensive . " a car based on the ' up ! ' and made out of light-weight materials with a special motor is a lot more expensive and will probably be more of a niche product , " dudenhöffer said . regardless of the price , which has not yet been set , the car will serve as an example of what technology can achieve and help vw develop its profile as an environmentally aware company , dudenhöffer said . " it will help build a positive image for the brand , " he added .
" that 's why the project is being run as a small series instead of a prototype . " missing voluntary targets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german automakers have come out against plans to make emissions cuts mandatory but the car is nothing more than a red herring for a failed ecological sales strategy , said werner reh of the environmental group friends of the earth deutschland . he said the company was trying to present itself as more environmentally friendly than the facts show , adding that vw , like most german carmakers , would not even be able to meet the voluntary co2 emissions limits the auto industry has set itself . " manufactures have to meet their self-imposed co2 emissions standards and a car that is sold a thousand - or even ten thousand - times wo n't help , " he said .
" a hundred thousand of the cars would have to be sold . " in 1998 , the european automobile manufacturers association , which represents the 13 of the largest automakers on the continent , reached a voluntary agreement with the european commission to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 140 g / km over 10 years . low-consumption cars nothing new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans want big cars with big , powerful engines , dudenhöffer said with an average or 173 g / km , a change in marketing strategy would be a step in the right direction for volkswagen , reh said . " vw , like all german manufactures , spends billions to advertise vehicles that emit more than 200 grams of co2 , " he said .
" maybe they should change the commercials first . " but consumers also have a hand in lowering co2 emission , dudenhöffer said , adding that germans are buying larger , more powerful cars than ever before . " we 've already had all kinds of fuel-saving cars on the market with the audi a2 , the three-liter lupo from vw and opel 's environmental models , " he said .

and as sales show , german tv formats are holding their own internationally . for the participants , the mipcom bazaar means five heady days of wheeling and dealing in program rights .
the biggest winner is clearly the us , with companies such as disney taking the opportunity to boost foreign tv sales with primetime hits such as lost and desperate housewives .
but as tv markets become increasingly internationalized , the traffic has become more two-way than ever .
europe : format factory with foreign license fees reaching record heights in recent years , the movers and shakers in the riviera this week were playing for high stakes .
" we the broadcasters are the guys who feed the world what it wants to watch , " said leslie moonves from cbs in a keynote address as the fair kicked off .
but he also admitted that americans " had been slow on the uptake " when it came to tv produced outside the us .
but now the us networks have learnt their lesson after dragging their feet on european formats such as survivor and big brother , made by dutch company endemol . these days , while europe is still more than happy to open its wallets for us shows , american networks have also realized that where europe leads , it might be worth following .
repackaging , customizing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas gottschalk , germany 's favorite talk show host that includes germany .
the country has been positioning itself to benefit from developments in film and tv markets that have seen reality show concepts traded worldwide and soaps repackaged and customized for international markets .
many of the country 's prime time entertainment format exports have been gaining international momentum .
thomas gottschalk 's talk show wetten , dass ... , which first aired 26 years ago , has gone from strength to strength .
on its home turf it attracts record viewing figures , and became the first entertainment show from germany to be sold abroad .
over the years , the format has been sold to 13 countries - including in 2006 to the key us market , where it airs as wanna bet .
further ratings giants in germany with international resonance are the science show clever , fronted by comedian wigald boning , sold to 15 countries , and schlag den raab , or " beat stefan raab . "
although it only debuted one year ago , it has already been sold to four countries including britain and the us .
the international title is beat your host .
negotiations with other prospective buyers are ongoing . "
clever is what we now call ' sciencetainment ' - that means knowledge , family entertainment , and a game show component , in a form that never existed before , " says jens richter , who distributes both clever and schlag den raab worldwide .
" it 's innovative , it 's new , no one ever did it before … it was successful at home , has great viewer ratings , and it is easy to grasp . "
crucially , these shows tick all the right boxes .
according to prominent industry watcher virginia mouseler , what tv audiences around the globe want these days are kid-centered , family-based reality shows - and especially game shows with big cash prizes , reported the afp news agency .
edgy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crew from " türkisch für anfänger " another german show generating interest at mipcom might prove more controversial .
willkommen in der nachbarschaft -lrb- " welcome to the neighborhood " -rrb- features five families competing to win a house worth 250,000 euros .
the snag is , it 's the neighbors who decide who wins - while the five families include one with a transsexual father , an islamic fundamentalist family and an african family in which the husband has two wives .
going global meanwhile , marketing agency telepool made the most of the trade fair , and sold the weekly german drama türkisch für anfänger -lrb- " turkish for beginners " -rrb- , made by state broadcaster ard , to two buyers .
in france , the show about german-turkish patchwork family , the ötztürk-schneiders , will air on canal + and the free tv youth station nrj .
broadcast rights were also bought by russian mtv .
telepool has said it is also talking to other countries and expects to sign further contracts .
gaining similar heat abroad is ard 's daily soap sturm der liebe -lrb- " love storm " -rrb- , currently the most successful show on german tv in terms of market share .
according to german united distributors , a distribution subsidiary of ard , it has been bought by 15 countries , including finland , austria , canada , latvia , slovakia and italy , where it 's called tempesta d 'amore .
a surprise success this week was the 2004 tv movie stauffenberg starring sebastian koch , who stared in the oscar-winning the lives of others , as the eponymous hero .
the topic triggered renewed interest from buyers in the us and spain thanks to the tom cruise film on the same subject currently in production in berlin .
a number of broadcasters and dvd distributors were keen to make the most of publicity generated by the cruise project to boost ratings and sales of the german movie .

will the partnership work this time ? the german soccer league , the dfl , which represents the 36 first and second-division clubs , announced on tuesday that the kirch-led company sirius will sell the domestic broadcast rights to the bundesliga for six seasons .
the dfl said it set to earn some 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- from 2009 to 2015 - or 500 million euros a year - from the new deal .
the league currently makes 440 million euros per season from a deal allowing the private , pay tv station premiere to broadcast matches live and state-run television to show highlights .
that deal expires in 2009 .
now the dfl is turning to the 80-year-old kirch in an attempt to boost revenues and catch up with other , richer european leagues such as the english premiership .
lessons of history ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirch 's comeback has amazed all and distressed some the bundesliga has been around the block with kirch before - with near calamitous results .
kirch founded premiere , and for much of the 1990s , he owned live broadcast rights to bundesliga matches .
but the kirch media group repeatedly found itself in financial difficulty and was finally forced to file for bankruptcy in 2002 .
it was the largest insolvency in post-war german history .
the bankruptcy hit the bundesliga hard , depriving clubs of millions in planned revenues and driving some deep into debt .
the affair became known as the " kirch crisis . "
the new deal is reportedly covered in full by bank guarantees , although no specific names of financial institutions have been released .
mixed reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund , in yellow , was one club badly hit by the " kirch crisis " dfl members who approved the deal were generally positive about what kirch could do for the league .
" it 's a quantum leap , " hans-joachim watzke , commercial manager of borussia dortmund , told the dpa news agency .
" i consider mr. kirch a visionary entrepreneur who thinks strategically . "
but hamburg voted against the new deal .
" a decision with enormous implications was made under unnecessary time pressure , " hamburg chairman bernd hoffmann told dpa .
" the terms presented here did n't convince me . "
and fans worry that sirius , in its efforts to bring in increased revenues , might encroach upon the autonomy of soccer reporting or perhaps even do away with highlight programs on public television . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

local politicians say that could leave passengers who live outside cities permanently stranded . the financial times germany reported on tuesday that germany 's social democratic transport minister wolfgang tiefensee has drawn up a position paper calling for drastic cuts in government subsidies stations receive .
the report says the plan involves discontinuing all subsidies for maintenance and improvements to stations where fewer than 100 people get on or off trains per day . the station closure plan comes as tiefensee readies legislation , to be put forth in 2008 , that would privatize parts of germany 's national rail system .
off the beaten track bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee is under fire for the plan local politicians , already wary of what privatization could mean for their constituencies , are up in arms about proposed cuts .
" according to tiefensee 's criteria , we 'd have to shut 53 percent of stations in our region , " the transportation minister of saxony-anhalt , karl-heinz daehre , told the financial times .
" his plans are beyond discussion for germany 's federal states . "
advocacy groups also lambasted the plans , particularly reported that subsidies would be discontinued for stations with " complicated platforms , " that is , containing ramps and other modifications for disabled passengers , if they did not meet a workday minimum of 1,000 passengers .
" ending subsidies would further reduce the already insufficient number of handicapped-friendly stations , " the managing director of the german welfare association -lrb- deutscher wohlfahrtsverband -rrb- , ulrich schneider , told the dpa news agency .
referring to germany 's ageing population , he added : " tiefensee is showing that he 's out of touch with demographic developments . "
however , the transport minister 's office has denied that part of the report , calling it " unfounded . "
even at the federal level teifensee 's plans have provoked ire .
" it 's not very clever to connect this decision with the privatization of the german railways , " the deputy head of the conservative parliamentary group , hans-peter freidrich , told the ap news agency . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on the right , berlin - the city where he lived almost all his life .
on the left , tehran - the city where he was born .
dejagah 's decision to boycott the german under-21 team 's upcoming match in israel may be his attempt to align the two components of his perceived cultural identity .
but it 's also a political statement that flouts what should be the spirit of both of the german national team and international soccer itself .
dejagah could have gotten out of the match in israel without entering the spotlight .
he chose not to .
he wanted the public to sanction his action .
and his comments concerning his decision make for unhappy reading .
" i have more iranian than german blood in my veins , " dejagah told the tabloid bz newspaper in a report published tuesday .
" that should be respected , and besides i 'm doing this out of respect .
my parents are iranian . "
dejagah 's use of the blood metaphor no doubt reflects the fact that he has spent far more of his young life honing his skills with the ball in midfield than attuning himself to the historical nuances of his words .
but why should the german soccer association , the dfb , support the idea that some sort of essential iranian-ness entitles him to reject another culture - israel - wholesale ?
on the contrary , should n't the dfb be taking a stand for the principles of sportsmanship in international athletic competitions , which include treating opponents of all religions and ethnicities with equal respect ?
players who , for direct personal reasons , feel unable to live up to this standard against a given opponent can discreetly ask for a leave of absence .
players who feel a muddled religious animosity toward cultures with which they have little personal experience should n't play for national teams at all .
calls to keep politics out of soccer are misguided .
sports are inherently political - sometimes positively so .
teams from different cultures that compete fairly on the field demonstrate their shared values , including a mutual love of a game and a respect for one another as opponents .
dejagah has a right to prioritize loyalty to tehran 's hatred for israel over the spirit of the game .
the dfb has both a right and a reason to prioritize that spirit over an individual player 's perceived need to demonstrate cultural identity through discrimination .
the dejagah problem itself will be gone soon .
having already reached the maximum age , the midfielder is only eligible to play for the german under-21s for a few more months , and to become a serious candidate for the german national men 's team , dejagah would have to improve as a player .
he should also be encouraged to think more seriously about the issues he raised this week .

local politicians say that could leave passengers who live outside cities permanently stranded . the financial times germany reported on tuesday that germany 's social democratic transport minister wolfgang tiefensee has drawn up a position paper calling for drastic cuts in government subsidies stations receive .
the report says the plan involves discontinuing all subsidies for maintenance and improvements to stations where fewer than 100 people get on or off trains per day . the station closure plan comes as tiefensee readies legislation , to be put forth in 2008 , that would privatize parts of germany 's national rail system .
off the beaten track bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang tiefensee is under fire for the plan local politicians , already wary of what privatization could mean for their constituencies , are up in arms about proposed cuts .
" according to tiefensee 's criteria , we 'd have to shut 53 percent of stations in our region , " the transportation minister of saxony-anhalt , karl-heinz daehre , told the financial times .
" his plans are beyond discussion for germany 's federal states . "
advocacy groups also lambasted the plans , particularly reported that subsidies would be discontinued for stations with " complicated platforms , " that is , containing ramps and other modifications for disabled passengers , if they did not meet a workday minimum of 1,000 passengers .
" ending subsidies would further reduce the already insufficient number of handicapped-friendly stations , " the managing director of the german welfare association -lrb- deutscher wohlfahrtsverband -rrb- , ulrich schneider , told the dpa news agency .
referring to germany 's ageing population , he added : " tiefensee is showing that he 's out of touch with demographic developments . "
however , the transport minister 's office has denied that part of the report , calling it " unfounded . "
even at the federal level teifensee 's plans have provoked ire .
" it 's not very clever to connect this decision with the privatization of the german railways , " the deputy head of the conservative parliamentary group , hans-peter freidrich , told the ap news agency . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" i have more iranian than german blood in my veins , " dejagah told the tabloid bz newspaper in a report published tuesday .
" that should be respected , and besides i 'm doing this out of respect .
my parents are iranian . "
dejagah 's use of the blood metaphor no doubt reflects the fact that he has spent far more of his young life honing his skills with the ball in midfield than attuning himself to the historical nuances of his words .
but why should the german soccer association , the dfb , support the idea that some sort of essential iranian-ness entitles him to reject another culture - israel - wholesale ?
on the contrary , should n't the dfb be taking a stand for the principles of sportsmanship in international athletic competitions , which include treating opponents of all religions and ethnicities with equal respect ?
players who , for direct personal reasons , feel unable to live up to this standard against a given opponent can discreetly ask for a leave of absence .
players who feel a muddled religious animosity toward cultures with which they have little personal experience should n't play for national teams at all .
calls to keep politics out of soccer are misguided .
sports are inherently political - sometimes positively so .
teams from different cultures that compete fairly on the field demonstrate their shared values , including a mutual love of a game and a respect for one another as opponents .
dejagah has a right to prioritize loyalty to tehran 's hatred for israel over the spirit of the game .
the dfb has both a right and a reason to prioritize that spirit over an individual player 's perceived need to demonstrate cultural identity through discrimination .
the dejagah problem itself will be gone soon .
having already reached the maximum age , the midfielder is only eligible to play for the german under-21s for a few more months , and to become a serious candidate for the german national men 's team , dejagah would have to improve as a player .

but dw chief correspondent peter philipp says that 's his decision and should be respected . it 's a story tailor-made to liven up the dull political landscape and give both tabloids and government backbenchers a perfect opportunity to voice some populist indignation : german-iranian soccer player ashkan dejagah has announced that his political sympathies prevent him from being able to take part in an official under-21 match against israel .
not acceptable , agree politicians across the board .
where would we be if sports player started choosing their opponents ?
sport should not become politicized , they say .
but that 's exactly what they do themselves .
anyone who refuses to demonstrate allegiance to german society is not allowed to represent the german national team .
the central council of the jews agrees , arguing that a german team player should not be allowed to " initiate a private jewish boycott . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they might have had a point , had the young man said he refused to play in israel because he does not acknowledge the state of israel .
but he did n't .
he referred to personal reasons and stressed that he was iranian as well as german .
anyone who criticizes him shows they have no awareness of how complex life can become for immigrants awarded german citizenship , and that they understand little or nothing of the integration process .
clearly , immigrants awarded german citizenship should try to become part of german society .
but this should not necessitate their having to renounce at the door their roots , their past , and everything it stands for .
obviously , they have ties to their former home ; they have friends and family there , maybe even property .
germans cultivate personal ties to foreign countries - why should n't immigrants retain their ties to their former home ?
it would be unreasonable and wrong to expect anything else .
in most cases , this principle is respected .
but not when politics enter the equation .
and they inevitably do , when iran and israel rear their head .
the german-iranian soccer player has little to do with it all - the real conflict is between sworn enemies tehran and jerusalem .
but it 's the public who take the rap - people , like ashkan dejagah , who then face penalties , or unpleasantness at the very least .
the german media and the politicians should avoid blowing these stories out of all proportion and , first and foremost , should stop twisting peoples ' words .
moreover , no one would ever insist that a german-israeli football player in the german under-21 team should have to take part in a game in iran , were it scheduled .
integration is a two-way process , as this case shows .
it has to be undertaken by the naturalized citizen , and it has to be undertaken by the society welcoming him - or not , as the case may be .
integration should not have to mean self-abnegation .
it requires sensitivity , awareness and respect from both sides .
in this particular case , all these are absent .
ultimately , the political rabble-rousing is superfluous for an entirely different reason : ashkan dejagah is 21 years old .
he only has to play in the under-21s for another few months .

but dw chief correspondent peter philipp says that 's his decision and should be respected . it 's a story tailor-made to liven up the dull political landscape and give both tabloids and government backbenchers a perfect opportunity to voice some populist indignation : german-iranian soccer player ashkan dejagah has announced that his political sympathies prevent him from being able to take part in an official under-21 match against israel .
not acceptable , agree politicians across the board .
where would we be if sports player started choosing their opponents ?
sport should not become politicized , they say .
but that 's exactly what they do themselves .
anyone who refuses to demonstrate allegiance to german society is not allowed to represent the german national team .
the central council of the jews agrees , arguing that a german team player should not be allowed to " initiate a private jewish boycott . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they might have had a point , had the young man said he refused to play in israel because he does not acknowledge the state of israel .
but he did n't .
he referred to personal reasons and stressed that he was iranian as well as german .
anyone who criticizes him shows they have no awareness of how complex life can become for immigrants awarded german citizenship , and that they understand little or nothing of the integration process .
clearly , immigrants awarded german citizenship should try to become part of german society .
but this should not necessitate their having to renounce at the door their roots , their past , and everything it stands for .
obviously , they have ties to their former home ; they have friends and family there , maybe even property .
germans cultivate personal ties to foreign countries - why should n't immigrants retain their ties to their former home ?
it would be unreasonable and wrong to expect anything else .
in most cases , this principle is respected .
but not when politics enter the equation .
and they inevitably do , when iran and israel rear their head .
the german-iranian soccer player has little to do with it all - the real conflict is between sworn enemies tehran and jerusalem .
but it 's the public who take the rap - people , like ashkan dejagah , who then face penalties , or unpleasantness at the very least .
the german media and the politicians should avoid blowing these stories out of all proportion and , first and foremost , should stop twisting peoples ' words .
moreover , no one would ever insist that a german-israeli football player in the german under-21 team should have to take part in a game in iran , were it scheduled .
integration is a two-way process , as this case shows .
it has to be undertaken by the naturalized citizen , and it has to be undertaken by the society welcoming him - or not , as the case may be .
integration should not have to mean self-abnegation .
it requires sensitivity , awareness and respect from both sides .
in this particular case , all these are absent .
ultimately , the political rabble-rousing is superfluous for an entirely different reason : ashkan dejagah is 21 years old .
he only has to play in the under-21s for another few months .

volkswagen has announced it plans to bring out a plastic and magnesium car that can get 238 miles per us gallon by 2010 .
neither experts nor the company imagine many people lining up to buy the small but expensive car . there were plenty of pamphlets touting environmental concerns and banners proclaiming green credentials at the frankfurt auto show which ended last month .
but german carmaker volkswagen said tuesday , oct .

will the partnership work this time ? the german soccer league , the dfl , which represents the 36 first and second-division clubs , announced on tuesday that the kirch-led company sirius will sell the domestic broadcast rights to the bundesliga for six seasons .
the dfl said it set to earn some 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- from 2009 to 2015 - or 500 million euros a year - from the new deal .
the league currently makes 440 million euros per season from a deal allowing the private , pay tv station premiere to broadcast matches live and state-run television to show highlights .

the bankruptcy hit the bundesliga hard , depriving clubs of millions in planned revenues and driving some deep into debt .

will the partnership work this time ? the german soccer league , the dfl , which represents the 36 first and second-division clubs , announced on tuesday that the kirch-led company sirius will sell the domestic broadcast rights to the bundesliga for six seasons .
the dfl said it set to earn some 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- from 2009 to 2015 - or 500 million euros a year - from the new deal .
the league currently makes 440 million euros per season from a deal allowing the private , pay tv station premiere to broadcast matches live and state-run television to show highlights .
that deal expires in 2009 .
now the dfl is turning to the 80-year-old kirch in an attempt to boost revenues and catch up with other , richer european leagues such as the english premiership .
lessons of history ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirch 's comeback has amazed all and distressed some the bundesliga has been around the block with kirch before - with near calamitous results .
kirch founded premiere , and for much of the 1990s , he owned live broadcast rights to bundesliga matches .
but the kirch media group repeatedly found itself in financial difficulty and was finally forced to file for bankruptcy in 2002 .
it was the largest insolvency in post-war german history .
the bankruptcy hit the bundesliga hard , depriving clubs of millions in planned revenues and driving some deep into debt .
the affair became known as the " kirch crisis . "
the new deal is reportedly covered in full by bank guarantees , although no specific names of financial institutions have been released .
mixed reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund , in yellow , was one club badly hit by the " kirch crisis " dfl members who approved the deal were generally positive about what kirch could do for the league .
" it 's a quantum leap , " hans-joachim watzke , commercial manager of borussia dortmund , told the dpa news agency .
" i consider mr. kirch a visionary entrepreneur who thinks strategically . "
but hamburg voted against the new deal .
" a decision with enormous implications was made under unnecessary time pressure , " hamburg chairman bernd hoffmann told dpa .
" the terms presented here did n't convince me . "
and fans worry that sirius , in its efforts to bring in increased revenues , might encroach upon the autonomy of soccer reporting or perhaps even do away with highlight programs on public television . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and it would seem that a growing number of people like what they see . although it is difficult to do a reliable headcount of the number of german buddhists in germany , the german buddhist union -lrb- dbu -rrb- estimates there are about 130,000 practioners .

david schneider , one of the senior teachers of the shambala buddhist tradition , says one factor is that buddhism is a particularly tolerant religion which is open to anyone . " there have never been any buddhist wars , " schneider said . "
i think one of the things that people fear these days are extremist groups in all religions .
being the middle way , buddhism is against extremism , you can not be a buddhist extremist .

" people are seeking ways to get on with their lives , looking for ways to cope , " prohl said , adding that the main churches neither address the body nor the senses in the way that buddhism does . " appealing to the senses is very important , " she said , " and buddhism does this through meditation , physical exercise and simple aesthetics . " seeking happiness there is most certainly an en vogue element to buddhism in germany at the moment , but as latenza from the dbu says that does not make it any less valid .

" people want to learn how to live a happier life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yoga practice buddhism calls for self-reflection , which fledgling practitioner volker wieprecht considers " an endlessly valuable gift . "
after almost two decades of rushing around trying out anything he thought might fill his life with happiness and meaning , he suddenly realized that he could find what he was looking for in what he describes as a " totally reliable philosophical system . " for wieprecht , buddhism means " much less drama and much more joy . " but he also acknowledges that living the buddhist way is a life-long project . sustainable trend ? that is not the same for everyone , indeed buddhism lends itself perfectly to the religious dabbler .
anyone is welcome and the extent to which one practices is determined solely by the individual . but if buddhism is something which one can dip in and out of , it is unclear how deep its roots in germany will end up being , or if it will continue to enjoy growth .

and it would seem that a growing number of people like what they see . although it is difficult to do a reliable headcount of the number of german buddhists in germany , the german buddhist union -lrb- dbu -rrb- estimates there are about 130,000 practioners .

david schneider , one of the senior teachers of the shambala buddhist tradition , says one factor is that buddhism is a particularly tolerant religion which is open to anyone . " there have never been any buddhist wars , " schneider said . "
i think one of the things that people fear these days are extremist groups in all religions .
being the middle way , buddhism is against extremism , you can not be a buddhist extremist . " ambassador for buddhism the growing profile of the buddhist way all over the world can at least in part be attributed to the dalai lama , the spiritual head of the religion .

" people like a star and he is a star and a wonderful ambassador , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama inken prohl , a theologist at heidelberg university , agrees that the german fascination for asia and buddhism has much to do with the work and profile of the dalai lama , but believes that people are also looking for care and compassion and answers to questions their christian backgrounds have been unable to provide . " people are seeking ways to get on with their lives , looking for ways to cope , " prohl said , adding that the main churches neither address the body nor the senses in the way that buddhism does . " appealing to the senses is very important , " she said , " and buddhism does this through meditation , physical exercise and simple aesthetics . " seeking happiness there is most certainly an en vogue element to buddhism in germany at the moment , but as latenza from the dbu says that does not make it any less valid .
" some people may be interested on a superficial level , but the fact is that buddhism does provide answers to today 's problems , " he said .
" people want to learn how to live a happier life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yoga practice buddhism calls for self-reflection , which fledgling practitioner volker wieprecht considers " an endlessly valuable gift . "
after almost two decades of rushing around trying out anything he thought might fill his life with happiness and meaning , he suddenly realized that he could find what he was looking for in what he describes as a " totally reliable philosophical system . " for wieprecht , buddhism means " much less drama and much more joy . " but he also acknowledges that living the buddhist way is a life-long project . sustainable trend ? that is not the same for everyone , indeed buddhism lends itself perfectly to the religious dabbler .
anyone is welcome and the extent to which one practices is determined solely by the individual . but if buddhism is something which one can dip in and out of , it is unclear how deep its roots in germany will end up being , or if it will continue to enjoy growth .
david schneider believes that the trend might slow down once people realize the work involved in following the buddhist path . " trend wo n't get you through .

but he also admitted that americans " had been slow on the uptake " when it came to tv produced outside the us .
but now the us networks have learnt their lesson after dragging their feet on european formats such as survivor and big brother , made by dutch company endemol . these days , while europe is still more than happy to open its wallets for us shows , american networks have also realized that where europe leads , it might be worth following .
repackaging , customizing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas gottschalk , germany 's favorite talk show host that includes germany .
the country has been positioning itself to benefit from developments in film and tv markets that have seen reality show concepts traded worldwide and soaps repackaged and customized for international markets .
many of the country 's prime time entertainment format exports have been gaining international momentum .
thomas gottschalk 's talk show wetten , dass ... , which first aired 26 years ago , has gone from strength to strength .
on its home turf it attracts record viewing figures , and became the first entertainment show from germany to be sold abroad .
over the years , the format has been sold to 13 countries - including in 2006 to the key us market , where it airs as wanna bet .
further ratings giants in germany with international resonance are the science show clever , fronted by comedian wigald boning , sold to 15 countries , and schlag den raab , or " beat stefan raab . "
although it only debuted one year ago , it has already been sold to four countries including britain and the us .
the international title is beat your host .
negotiations with other prospective buyers are ongoing . "
clever is what we now call ' sciencetainment ' - that means knowledge , family entertainment , and a game show component , in a form that never existed before , " says jens richter , who distributes both clever and schlag den raab worldwide .
" it 's innovative , it 's new , no one ever did it before … it was successful at home , has great viewer ratings , and it is easy to grasp . "
crucially , these shows tick all the right boxes .
according to prominent industry watcher virginia mouseler , what tv audiences around the globe want these days are kid-centered , family-based reality shows - and especially game shows with big cash prizes , reported the afp news agency .
edgy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crew from " türkisch für anfänger " another german show generating interest at mipcom might prove more controversial .
willkommen in der nachbarschaft -lrb- " welcome to the neighborhood " -rrb- features five families competing to win a house worth 250,000 euros .
the snag is , it 's the neighbors who decide who wins - while the five families include one with a transsexual father , an islamic fundamentalist family and an african family in which the husband has two wives .
going global meanwhile , marketing agency telepool made the most of the trade fair , and sold the weekly german drama türkisch für anfänger -lrb- " turkish for beginners " -rrb- , made by state broadcaster ard , to two buyers .
in france , the show about german-turkish patchwork family , the ötztürk-schneiders , will air on canal + and the free tv youth station nrj .
broadcast rights were also bought by russian mtv .
telepool has said it is also talking to other countries and expects to sign further contracts .
gaining similar heat abroad is ard 's daily soap sturm der liebe -lrb- " love storm " -rrb- , currently the most successful show on german tv in terms of market share .
according to german united distributors , a distribution subsidiary of ard , it has been bought by 15 countries , including finland , austria , canada , latvia , slovakia and italy , where it 's called tempesta d 'amore .
a surprise success this week was the 2004 tv movie stauffenberg starring sebastian koch , who stared in the oscar-winning the lives of others , as the eponymous hero .
the topic triggered renewed interest from buyers in the us and spain thanks to the tom cruise film on the same subject currently in production in berlin .
a number of broadcasters and dvd distributors were keen to make the most of publicity generated by the cruise project to boost ratings and sales of the german movie .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the mipcom the german entries for the annual emmys , awarded by the international academy of television arts & sciences , were also announced at mipcom .
selected for the category tv movie is die mauer - berlin ' 61 -lrb- " the wall - berlin ' 61 " -rrb- , which beat nominees from brazil , china and britain , while the jury selected the rtl soap alle lieben jimmy -lrb- " everyone loves jimmy " -rrb- , made by bavaria film in the comedy category . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the country has been positioning itself to benefit from developments in film and tv markets that have seen reality show concepts traded worldwide and soaps repackaged and customized for international markets .
many of the country 's prime time entertainment format exports have been gaining international momentum .
thomas gottschalk 's talk show wetten , dass ... , which first aired 26 years ago , has gone from strength to strength .
on its home turf it attracts record viewing figures , and became the first entertainment show from germany to be sold abroad .
over the years , the format has been sold to 13 countries - including in 2006 to the key us market , where it airs as wanna bet .
further ratings giants in germany with international resonance are the science show clever , fronted by comedian wigald boning , sold to 15 countries , and schlag den raab , or " beat stefan raab . "

" it 's innovative , it 's new , no one ever did it before … it was successful at home , has great viewer ratings , and it is easy to grasp . "

the country has been positioning itself to benefit from developments in film and tv markets that have seen reality show concepts traded worldwide and soaps repackaged and customized for international markets .
many of the country 's prime time entertainment format exports have been gaining international momentum .
thomas gottschalk 's talk show wetten , dass ... , which first aired 26 years ago , has gone from strength to strength .

the snag is , it 's the neighbors who decide who wins - while the five families include one with a transsexual father , an islamic fundamentalist family and an african family in which the husband has two wives .
going global meanwhile , marketing agency telepool made the most of the trade fair , and sold the weekly german drama türkisch für anfänger -lrb- " turkish for beginners " -rrb- , made by state broadcaster ard , to two buyers .
in france , the show about german-turkish patchwork family , the ötztürk-schneiders , will air on canal + and the free tv youth station nrj .
broadcast rights were also bought by russian mtv .
telepool has said it is also talking to other countries and expects to sign further contracts .
gaining similar heat abroad is ard 's daily soap sturm der liebe -lrb- " love storm " -rrb- , currently the most successful show on german tv in terms of market share .
according to german united distributors , a distribution subsidiary of ard , it has been bought by 15 countries , including finland , austria , canada , latvia , slovakia and italy , where it 's called tempesta d 'amore .
a surprise success this week was the 2004 tv movie stauffenberg starring sebastian koch , who stared in the oscar-winning the lives of others , as the eponymous hero .
the topic triggered renewed interest from buyers in the us and spain thanks to the tom cruise film on the same subject currently in production in berlin .
a number of broadcasters and dvd distributors were keen to make the most of publicity generated by the cruise project to boost ratings and sales of the german movie .

volkswagen has announced it plans to bring out a plastic and magnesium car that can get 238 miles per us gallon by 2010 .
neither experts nor the company imagine many people lining up to buy the small but expensive car . there were plenty of pamphlets touting environmental concerns and banners proclaiming green credentials at the frankfurt auto show which ended last month .
but german carmaker volkswagen said tuesday , oct .
9 , it intended to put its money where its mouth is regarding promises to cut carbon dioxide emissions by meeting consumer demand for cars with better gas mileage . " the environment is a topic of discussion in our society and we do not think it is going to come in like a wave then roll back away , as it has in the past , " vw spokesman andreas meurer said . still , no one at vw expects the company 's single-cylinder car in development , which would require one liter of gas to travel 100 kilometers - the equivalent of 238 miles per us gallon - to be a record breaker in sales terms , ceo martin winterkorn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw made a 1-liter-car prototype in 2002 - it 's unclear how similar the new car will be the car , whose body will be made primarily of plastic and magnesium , will only reach a maximum speed of 120 kilometer per hour -lrb- 75 mph -rrb- . " people taking this car on the autobahn should pray they do n't get run over by a trailer truck , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer , director for the center of automotive research at the university of gelsenkirchen . costly production dudenhöffer said he thought vw would sell between 500 and 1,500 of the cars .
the fuel-efficient vehicle will be based on the " up ! , " a compact four-door , though the new car is likely to be considerably more expensive . " a car based on the ' up ! ' and made out of light-weight materials with a special motor is a lot more expensive and will probably be more of a niche product , " dudenhöffer said . regardless of the price , which has not yet been set , the car will serve as an example of what technology can achieve and help vw develop its profile as an environmentally aware company , dudenhöffer said . " it will help build a positive image for the brand , " he added .
" that 's why the project is being run as a small series instead of a prototype . " missing voluntary targets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german automakers have come out against plans to make emissions cuts mandatory but the car is nothing more than a red herring for a failed ecological sales strategy , said werner reh of the environmental group friends of the earth deutschland . he said the company was trying to present itself as more environmentally friendly than the facts show , adding that vw , like most german carmakers , would not even be able to meet the voluntary co2 emissions limits the auto industry has set itself . " manufactures have to meet their self-imposed co2 emissions standards and a car that is sold a thousand - or even ten thousand - times wo n't help , " he said .
" a hundred thousand of the cars would have to be sold . " in 1998 , the european automobile manufacturers association , which represents the 13 of the largest automakers on the continent , reached a voluntary agreement with the european commission to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 140 g / km over 10 years . low-consumption cars nothing new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans want big cars with big , powerful engines , dudenhöffer said with an average or 173 g / km , a change in marketing strategy would be a step in the right direction for volkswagen , reh said . " vw , like all german manufactures , spends billions to advertise vehicles that emit more than 200 grams of co2 , " he said .
" maybe they should change the commercials first . " but consumers also have a hand in lowering co2 emission , dudenhöffer said , adding that germans are buying larger , more powerful cars than ever before . " we 've already had all kinds of fuel-saving cars on the market with the audi a2 , the three-liter lupo from vw and opel 's environmental models , " he said .

and as sales show , german tv formats are holding their own internationally . for the participants , the mipcom bazaar means five heady days of wheeling and dealing in program rights .
the biggest winner is clearly the us , with companies such as disney taking the opportunity to boost foreign tv sales with primetime hits such as lost and desperate housewives .
but as tv markets become increasingly internationalized , the traffic has become more two-way than ever .
europe : format factory with foreign license fees reaching record heights in recent years , the movers and shakers in the riviera this week were playing for high stakes .
" we the broadcasters are the guys who feed the world what it wants to watch , " said leslie moonves from cbs in a keynote address as the fair kicked off .
but he also admitted that americans " had been slow on the uptake " when it came to tv produced outside the us .
but now the us networks have learnt their lesson after dragging their feet on european formats such as survivor and big brother , made by dutch company endemol . these days , while europe is still more than happy to open its wallets for us shows , american networks have also realized that where europe leads , it might be worth following .
repackaging , customizing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas gottschalk , germany 's favorite talk show host that includes germany .
the country has been positioning itself to benefit from developments in film and tv markets that have seen reality show concepts traded worldwide and soaps repackaged and customized for international markets .
many of the country 's prime time entertainment format exports have been gaining international momentum .
thomas gottschalk 's talk show wetten , dass ... , which first aired 26 years ago , has gone from strength to strength .
on its home turf it attracts record viewing figures , and became the first entertainment show from germany to be sold abroad .
over the years , the format has been sold to 13 countries - including in 2006 to the key us market , where it airs as wanna bet .
further ratings giants in germany with international resonance are the science show clever , fronted by comedian wigald boning , sold to 15 countries , and schlag den raab , or " beat stefan raab . "
although it only debuted one year ago , it has already been sold to four countries including britain and the us .
the international title is beat your host .
negotiations with other prospective buyers are ongoing . "
clever is what we now call ' sciencetainment ' - that means knowledge , family entertainment , and a game show component , in a form that never existed before , " says jens richter , who distributes both clever and schlag den raab worldwide .
" it 's innovative , it 's new , no one ever did it before … it was successful at home , has great viewer ratings , and it is easy to grasp . "
crucially , these shows tick all the right boxes .
according to prominent industry watcher virginia mouseler , what tv audiences around the globe want these days are kid-centered , family-based reality shows - and especially game shows with big cash prizes , reported the afp news agency .
edgy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crew from " türkisch für anfänger " another german show generating interest at mipcom might prove more controversial .
willkommen in der nachbarschaft -lrb- " welcome to the neighborhood " -rrb- features five families competing to win a house worth 250,000 euros .
the snag is , it 's the neighbors who decide who wins - while the five families include one with a transsexual father , an islamic fundamentalist family and an african family in which the husband has two wives .
going global meanwhile , marketing agency telepool made the most of the trade fair , and sold the weekly german drama türkisch für anfänger -lrb- " turkish for beginners " -rrb- , made by state broadcaster ard , to two buyers .
in france , the show about german-turkish patchwork family , the ötztürk-schneiders , will air on canal + and the free tv youth station nrj .
broadcast rights were also bought by russian mtv .
telepool has said it is also talking to other countries and expects to sign further contracts .
gaining similar heat abroad is ard 's daily soap sturm der liebe -lrb- " love storm " -rrb- , currently the most successful show on german tv in terms of market share .
according to german united distributors , a distribution subsidiary of ard , it has been bought by 15 countries , including finland , austria , canada , latvia , slovakia and italy , where it 's called tempesta d 'amore .
a surprise success this week was the 2004 tv movie stauffenberg starring sebastian koch , who stared in the oscar-winning the lives of others , as the eponymous hero .
the topic triggered renewed interest from buyers in the us and spain thanks to the tom cruise film on the same subject currently in production in berlin .
a number of broadcasters and dvd distributors were keen to make the most of publicity generated by the cruise project to boost ratings and sales of the german movie .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the mipcom the german entries for the annual emmys , awarded by the international academy of television arts & sciences , were also announced at mipcom .
selected for the category tv movie is die mauer - berlin ' 61 -lrb- " the wall - berlin ' 61 " -rrb- , which beat nominees from brazil , china and britain , while the jury selected the rtl soap alle lieben jimmy -lrb- " everyone loves jimmy " -rrb- , made by bavaria film in the comedy category . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the report says the plan involves discontinuing all subsidies for maintenance and improvements to stations where fewer than 100 people get on or off trains per day . the station closure plan comes as tiefensee readies legislation , to be put forth in 2008 , that would privatize parts of germany 's national rail system .

the report says the plan involves discontinuing all subsidies for maintenance and improvements to stations where fewer than 100 people get on or off trains per day . the station closure plan comes as tiefensee readies legislation , to be put forth in 2008 , that would privatize parts of germany 's national rail system .

and it would seem that a growing number of people like what they see . although it is difficult to do a reliable headcount of the number of german buddhists in germany , the german buddhist union -lrb- dbu -rrb- estimates there are about 130,000 practioners .
and there appears to be an increased interest in the religion in the nation 's traditionally christian population . " we are definitely experiencing an upwards trend , " said helge latenza of the dbu head office , " but it is a gentle curve . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german buddhists during meditation gentle or not , significantly more germans are turning towards buddhism than are converting to islam , an issue which has been creating waves throughout germany lately . last month , according to the federal interior ministry , there were between 15,000 and 40,000 converts to islam living in germany . so what is the reason for this growing interest in buddhism , which is not even recognized as a religious body under german public law ?
david schneider , one of the senior teachers of the shambala buddhist tradition , says one factor is that buddhism is a particularly tolerant religion which is open to anyone . " there have never been any buddhist wars , " schneider said . "
i think one of the things that people fear these days are extremist groups in all religions .
being the middle way , buddhism is against extremism , you can not be a buddhist extremist . " ambassador for buddhism the growing profile of the buddhist way all over the world can at least in part be attributed to the dalai lama , the spiritual head of the religion . " the media has taken a big interest in buddhism partly because of his holiness , " schneider said , adding that although he is often seen with world leaders and celebrities , he is a serious monk and practitioner who has not lost his compassion . " people like a star and he is a star and a wonderful ambassador , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama inken prohl , a theologist at heidelberg university , agrees that the german fascination for asia and buddhism has much to do with the work and profile of the dalai lama , but believes that people are also looking for care and compassion and answers to questions their christian backgrounds have been unable to provide . " people are seeking ways to get on with their lives , looking for ways to cope , " prohl said , adding that the main churches neither address the body nor the senses in the way that buddhism does . " appealing to the senses is very important , " she said , " and buddhism does this through meditation , physical exercise and simple aesthetics . " seeking happiness there is most certainly an en vogue element to buddhism in germany at the moment , but as latenza from the dbu says that does not make it any less valid .
" some people may be interested on a superficial level , but the fact is that buddhism does provide answers to today 's problems , " he said .
" people want to learn how to live a happier life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yoga practice buddhism calls for self-reflection , which fledgling practitioner volker wieprecht considers " an endlessly valuable gift . "
after almost two decades of rushing around trying out anything he thought might fill his life with happiness and meaning , he suddenly realized that he could find what he was looking for in what he describes as a " totally reliable philosophical system . " for wieprecht , buddhism means " much less drama and much more joy . " but he also acknowledges that living the buddhist way is a life-long project . sustainable trend ? that is not the same for everyone , indeed buddhism lends itself perfectly to the religious dabbler .
anyone is welcome and the extent to which one practices is determined solely by the individual . but if buddhism is something which one can dip in and out of , it is unclear how deep its roots in germany will end up being , or if it will continue to enjoy growth .
david schneider believes that the trend might slow down once people realize the work involved in following the buddhist path . " trend wo n't get you through .
even if the beautiful and famous people are walking the same path , everyone ultimately has to go it alone , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 10.10.2007 buddhism in germany finding new adherents großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional face of buddhism it 's been around in the wings for several decades already , yet only recently has buddhism begun to venture out towards mainstream german society .
and it would seem that a growing number of people like what they see . although it is difficult to do a reliable headcount of the number of german buddhists in germany , the german buddhist union -lrb- dbu -rrb- estimates there are about 130,000 practioners .
and there appears to be an increased interest in the religion in the nation 's traditionally christian population . " we are definitely experiencing an upwards trend , " said helge latenza of the dbu head office , " but it is a gentle curve . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german buddhists during meditation gentle or not , significantly more germans are turning towards buddhism than are converting to islam , an issue which has been creating waves throughout germany lately . last month , according to the federal interior ministry , there were between 15,000 and 40,000 converts to islam living in germany . so what is the reason for this growing interest in buddhism , which is not even recognized as a religious body under german public law ?
david schneider , one of the senior teachers of the shambala buddhist tradition , says one factor is that buddhism is a particularly tolerant religion which is open to anyone . " there have never been any buddhist wars , " schneider said . "
i think one of the things that people fear these days are extremist groups in all religions .
being the middle way , buddhism is against extremism , you can not be a buddhist extremist . " ambassador for buddhism the growing profile of the buddhist way all over the world can at least in part be attributed to the dalai lama , the spiritual head of the religion . " the media has taken a big interest in buddhism partly because of his holiness , " schneider said , adding that although he is often seen with world leaders and celebrities , he is a serious monk and practitioner who has not lost his compassion . " people like a star and he is a star and a wonderful ambassador , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama inken prohl , a theologist at heidelberg university , agrees that the german fascination for asia and buddhism has much to do with the work and profile of the dalai lama , but believes that people are also looking for care and compassion and answers to questions their christian backgrounds have been unable to provide . " people are seeking ways to get on with their lives , looking for ways to cope , " prohl said , adding that the main churches neither address the body nor the senses in the way that buddhism does . " appealing to the senses is very important , " she said , " and buddhism does this through meditation , physical exercise and simple aesthetics . " seeking happiness there is most certainly an en vogue element to buddhism in germany at the moment , but as latenza from the dbu says that does not make it any less valid .
" some people may be interested on a superficial level , but the fact is that buddhism does provide answers to today 's problems , " he said .
" people want to learn how to live a happier life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yoga practice buddhism calls for self-reflection , which fledgling practitioner volker wieprecht considers " an endlessly valuable gift . "
after almost two decades of rushing around trying out anything he thought might fill his life with happiness and meaning , he suddenly realized that he could find what he was looking for in what he describes as a " totally reliable philosophical system . " for wieprecht , buddhism means " much less drama and much more joy . " but he also acknowledges that living the buddhist way is a life-long project . sustainable trend ? that is not the same for everyone , indeed buddhism lends itself perfectly to the religious dabbler .
anyone is welcome and the extent to which one practices is determined solely by the individual . but if buddhism is something which one can dip in and out of , it is unclear how deep its roots in germany will end up being , or if it will continue to enjoy growth .
david schneider believes that the trend might slow down once people realize the work involved in following the buddhist path . " trend wo n't get you through .
even if the beautiful and famous people are walking the same path , everyone ultimately has to go it alone , " he said .
" but given the stresses of modern life , it has a lot to offer . " tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on the right , berlin - the city where he lived almost all his life .
on the left , tehran - the city where he was born .
dejagah 's decision to boycott the german under-21 team 's upcoming match in israel may be his attempt to align the two components of his perceived cultural identity .
but it 's also a political statement that flouts what should be the spirit of both of the german national team and international soccer itself .
dejagah could have gotten out of the match in israel without entering the spotlight .
he chose not to .
he wanted the public to sanction his action .
and his comments concerning his decision make for unhappy reading .
" i have more iranian than german blood in my veins , " dejagah told the tabloid bz newspaper in a report published tuesday .
" that should be respected , and besides i 'm doing this out of respect .
my parents are iranian . "
dejagah 's use of the blood metaphor no doubt reflects the fact that he has spent far more of his young life honing his skills with the ball in midfield than attuning himself to the historical nuances of his words .
but why should the german soccer association , the dfb , support the idea that some sort of essential iranian-ness entitles him to reject another culture - israel - wholesale ?
on the contrary , should n't the dfb be taking a stand for the principles of sportsmanship in international athletic competitions , which include treating opponents of all religions and ethnicities with equal respect ?
players who , for direct personal reasons , feel unable to live up to this standard against a given opponent can discreetly ask for a leave of absence .
players who feel a muddled religious animosity toward cultures with which they have little personal experience should n't play for national teams at all .
calls to keep politics out of soccer are misguided .
sports are inherently political - sometimes positively so .
teams from different cultures that compete fairly on the field demonstrate their shared values , including a mutual love of a game and a respect for one another as opponents .
dejagah has a right to prioritize loyalty to tehran 's hatred for israel over the spirit of the game .
the dfb has both a right and a reason to prioritize that spirit over an individual player 's perceived need to demonstrate cultural identity through discrimination .
the dejagah problem itself will be gone soon .
having already reached the maximum age , the midfielder is only eligible to play for the german under-21s for a few more months , and to become a serious candidate for the german national men 's team , dejagah would have to improve as a player .
he should also be encouraged to think more seriously about the issues he raised this week .
along with the tattoos on his arms , dejagah also got one on his neck , which reads : " remember where you from " -lrb- sic -rrb- .
he might do better to decide who he wants to be .

on the contrary , should n't the dfb be taking a stand for the principles of sportsmanship in international athletic competitions , which include treating opponents of all religions and ethnicities with equal respect ?
players who , for direct personal reasons , feel unable to live up to this standard against a given opponent can discreetly ask for a leave of absence .
players who feel a muddled religious animosity toward cultures with which they have little personal experience should n't play for national teams at all .
calls to keep politics out of soccer are misguided .
sports are inherently political - sometimes positively so .
teams from different cultures that compete fairly on the field demonstrate their shared values , including a mutual love of a game and a respect for one another as opponents .
dejagah has a right to prioritize loyalty to tehran 's hatred for israel over the spirit of the game .
the dfb has both a right and a reason to prioritize that spirit over an individual player 's perceived need to demonstrate cultural identity through discrimination .
the dejagah problem itself will be gone soon .
having already reached the maximum age , the midfielder is only eligible to play for the german under-21s for a few more months , and to become a serious candidate for the german national men 's team , dejagah would have to improve as a player .
he should also be encouraged to think more seriously about the issues he raised this week .
along with the tattoos on his arms , dejagah also got one on his neck , which reads : " remember where you from " -lrb- sic -rrb- .
he might do better to decide who he wants to be .

on the right , berlin - the city where he lived almost all his life .
on the left , tehran - the city where he was born .
dejagah 's decision to boycott the german under-21 team 's upcoming match in israel may be his attempt to align the two components of his perceived cultural identity .
but it 's also a political statement that flouts what should be the spirit of both of the german national team and international soccer itself .
dejagah could have gotten out of the match in israel without entering the spotlight .
he chose not to .
he wanted the public to sanction his action .
and his comments concerning his decision make for unhappy reading .
" i have more iranian than german blood in my veins , " dejagah told the tabloid bz newspaper in a report published tuesday .
" that should be respected , and besides i 'm doing this out of respect .
my parents are iranian . "
dejagah 's use of the blood metaphor no doubt reflects the fact that he has spent far more of his young life honing his skills with the ball in midfield than attuning himself to the historical nuances of his words .
but why should the german soccer association , the dfb , support the idea that some sort of essential iranian-ness entitles him to reject another culture - israel - wholesale ?

but dw chief correspondent peter philipp says that 's his decision and should be respected . it 's a story tailor-made to liven up the dull political landscape and give both tabloids and government backbenchers a perfect opportunity to voice some populist indignation : german-iranian soccer player ashkan dejagah has announced that his political sympathies prevent him from being able to take part in an official under-21 match against israel .
not acceptable , agree politicians across the board .
where would we be if sports player started choosing their opponents ?
sport should not become politicized , they say .
but that 's exactly what they do themselves .
anyone who refuses to demonstrate allegiance to german society is not allowed to represent the german national team .
the central council of the jews agrees , arguing that a german team player should not be allowed to " initiate a private jewish boycott . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they might have had a point , had the young man said he refused to play in israel because he does not acknowledge the state of israel .
but he did n't .
he referred to personal reasons and stressed that he was iranian as well as german .
anyone who criticizes him shows they have no awareness of how complex life can become for immigrants awarded german citizenship , and that they understand little or nothing of the integration process .
clearly , immigrants awarded german citizenship should try to become part of german society .
but this should not necessitate their having to renounce at the door their roots , their past , and everything it stands for .
obviously , they have ties to their former home ; they have friends and family there , maybe even property .
germans cultivate personal ties to foreign countries - why should n't immigrants retain their ties to their former home ?
it would be unreasonable and wrong to expect anything else .
in most cases , this principle is respected .
but not when politics enter the equation .
and they inevitably do , when iran and israel rear their head .
the german-iranian soccer player has little to do with it all - the real conflict is between sworn enemies tehran and jerusalem .
but it 's the public who take the rap - people , like ashkan dejagah , who then face penalties , or unpleasantness at the very least .
the german media and the politicians should avoid blowing these stories out of all proportion and , first and foremost , should stop twisting peoples ' words .
moreover , no one would ever insist that a german-israeli football player in the german under-21 team should have to take part in a game in iran , were it scheduled .
integration is a two-way process , as this case shows .
it has to be undertaken by the naturalized citizen , and it has to be undertaken by the society welcoming him - or not , as the case may be .
integration should not have to mean self-abnegation .
it requires sensitivity , awareness and respect from both sides .
in this particular case , all these are absent .
ultimately , the political rabble-rousing is superfluous for an entirely different reason : ashkan dejagah is 21 years old .
he only has to play in the under-21s for another few months .

but dw chief correspondent peter philipp says that 's his decision and should be respected . it 's a story tailor-made to liven up the dull political landscape and give both tabloids and government backbenchers a perfect opportunity to voice some populist indignation : german-iranian soccer player ashkan dejagah has announced that his political sympathies prevent him from being able to take part in an official under-21 match against israel .
not acceptable , agree politicians across the board .
where would we be if sports player started choosing their opponents ?
sport should not become politicized , they say .
but that 's exactly what they do themselves .
anyone who refuses to demonstrate allegiance to german society is not allowed to represent the german national team .
the central council of the jews agrees , arguing that a german team player should not be allowed to " initiate a private jewish boycott . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they might have had a point , had the young man said he refused to play in israel because he does not acknowledge the state of israel .
but he did n't .
he referred to personal reasons and stressed that he was iranian as well as german .
anyone who criticizes him shows they have no awareness of how complex life can become for immigrants awarded german citizenship , and that they understand little or nothing of the integration process .
clearly , immigrants awarded german citizenship should try to become part of german society .
but this should not necessitate their having to renounce at the door their roots , their past , and everything it stands for .
obviously , they have ties to their former home ; they have friends and family there , maybe even property .
germans cultivate personal ties to foreign countries - why should n't immigrants retain their ties to their former home ?
it would be unreasonable and wrong to expect anything else .
in most cases , this principle is respected .
but not when politics enter the equation .
and they inevitably do , when iran and israel rear their head .
the german-iranian soccer player has little to do with it all - the real conflict is between sworn enemies tehran and jerusalem .
but it 's the public who take the rap - people , like ashkan dejagah , who then face penalties , or unpleasantness at the very least .
the german media and the politicians should avoid blowing these stories out of all proportion and , first and foremost , should stop twisting peoples ' words .
moreover , no one would ever insist that a german-israeli football player in the german under-21 team should have to take part in a game in iran , were it scheduled .
integration is a two-way process , as this case shows .
it has to be undertaken by the naturalized citizen , and it has to be undertaken by the society welcoming him - or not , as the case may be .
integration should not have to mean self-abnegation .
it requires sensitivity , awareness and respect from both sides .
in this particular case , all these are absent .
ultimately , the political rabble-rousing is superfluous for an entirely different reason : ashkan dejagah is 21 years old .
he only has to play in the under-21s for another few months .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 10.10.2007 buddhism in germany finding new adherents großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional face of buddhism it 's been around in the wings for several decades already , yet only recently has buddhism begun to venture out towards mainstream german society .
and it would seem that a growing number of people like what they see . although it is difficult to do a reliable headcount of the number of german buddhists in germany , the german buddhist union -lrb- dbu -rrb- estimates there are about 130,000 practioners .
and there appears to be an increased interest in the religion in the nation 's traditionally christian population . " we are definitely experiencing an upwards trend , " said helge latenza of the dbu head office , " but it is a gentle curve . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german buddhists during meditation gentle or not , significantly more germans are turning towards buddhism than are converting to islam , an issue which has been creating waves throughout germany lately . last month , according to the federal interior ministry , there were between 15,000 and 40,000 converts to islam living in germany . so what is the reason for this growing interest in buddhism , which is not even recognized as a religious body under german public law ?
david schneider , one of the senior teachers of the shambala buddhist tradition , says one factor is that buddhism is a particularly tolerant religion which is open to anyone . " there have never been any buddhist wars , " schneider said . "
i think one of the things that people fear these days are extremist groups in all religions .
being the middle way , buddhism is against extremism , you can not be a buddhist extremist . " ambassador for buddhism the growing profile of the buddhist way all over the world can at least in part be attributed to the dalai lama , the spiritual head of the religion . " the media has taken a big interest in buddhism partly because of his holiness , " schneider said , adding that although he is often seen with world leaders and celebrities , he is a serious monk and practitioner who has not lost his compassion . " people like a star and he is a star and a wonderful ambassador , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama inken prohl , a theologist at heidelberg university , agrees that the german fascination for asia and buddhism has much to do with the work and profile of the dalai lama , but believes that people are also looking for care and compassion and answers to questions their christian backgrounds have been unable to provide . " people are seeking ways to get on with their lives , looking for ways to cope , " prohl said , adding that the main churches neither address the body nor the senses in the way that buddhism does . " appealing to the senses is very important , " she said , " and buddhism does this through meditation , physical exercise and simple aesthetics . " seeking happiness there is most certainly an en vogue element to buddhism in germany at the moment , but as latenza from the dbu says that does not make it any less valid .
" some people may be interested on a superficial level , but the fact is that buddhism does provide answers to today 's problems , " he said .
" people want to learn how to live a happier life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yoga practice buddhism calls for self-reflection , which fledgling practitioner volker wieprecht considers " an endlessly valuable gift . "
after almost two decades of rushing around trying out anything he thought might fill his life with happiness and meaning , he suddenly realized that he could find what he was looking for in what he describes as a " totally reliable philosophical system . " for wieprecht , buddhism means " much less drama and much more joy . " but he also acknowledges that living the buddhist way is a life-long project . sustainable trend ? that is not the same for everyone , indeed buddhism lends itself perfectly to the religious dabbler .
anyone is welcome and the extent to which one practices is determined solely by the individual . but if buddhism is something which one can dip in and out of , it is unclear how deep its roots in germany will end up being , or if it will continue to enjoy growth .
david schneider believes that the trend might slow down once people realize the work involved in following the buddhist path . " trend wo n't get you through .
even if the beautiful and famous people are walking the same path , everyone ultimately has to go it alone , " he said .

" crime can not be prevented or stopped with death , or with state vengeance , but with justice , " said portuguese prime minister jose socrates , whose country currently holds the european union presidency . poland wants broader definition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : polish officials said they wanted protection of life to extend beyond the death penalty predominantly catholic poland was the only country to oppose the decision , arguing any such event should also condemn abortion and euthanasia .

" as the world focuses on china 's poor human rights record in the run-up to the olympics , the chinese government could avoid further embarrassment by making a bold step to address its position as the world 's leading executioner of its own citizens , " said brad adams , asia director at human rights watch . wartime authorization bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a handful of eu nations still allow capital punishment during wartime all european countries have banned the death penalty under the european convention on human rights .
but five - france , italy , latvia , poland and spain - have still not signed the convention 's protocol on abolishing the death penalty during wartime . " our final priority is the death penalty elsewhere in the world , " terry davis , secretary-general of the council of europe , said .
" some of our closest friends and observers at the council of europe continue to execute people . " according to amnesty international 's report for 2006 , at least 1,591 people were executed in 25 countries and at least 3,861 people were sentenced to death in 55 countries .
at least 1,010 people were executed in china during the year .
iran executed 177 people ; pakistan put 82 people to death and iraq and sudan each at least 65 .

but dw chief correspondent peter philipp says that 's his decision and should be respected . it 's a story tailor-made to liven up the dull political landscape and give both tabloids and government backbenchers a perfect opportunity to voice some populist indignation : german-iranian soccer player ashkan dejagah has announced that his political sympathies prevent him from being able to take part in an official under-21 match against israel .
not acceptable , agree politicians across the board .
where would we be if sports player started choosing their opponents ?
sport should not become politicized , they say .
but that 's exactly what they do themselves .
anyone who refuses to demonstrate allegiance to german society is not allowed to represent the german national team .
the central council of the jews agrees , arguing that a german team player should not be allowed to " initiate a private jewish boycott . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : they might have had a point , had the young man said he refused to play in israel because he does not acknowledge the state of israel .
but he did n't .
he referred to personal reasons and stressed that he was iranian as well as german .
anyone who criticizes him shows they have no awareness of how complex life can become for immigrants awarded german citizenship , and that they understand little or nothing of the integration process .
clearly , immigrants awarded german citizenship should try to become part of german society .
but this should not necessitate their having to renounce at the door their roots , their past , and everything it stands for .
obviously , they have ties to their former home ; they have friends and family there , maybe even property .
germans cultivate personal ties to foreign countries - why should n't immigrants retain their ties to their former home ?
it would be unreasonable and wrong to expect anything else .
in most cases , this principle is respected .
but not when politics enter the equation .
and they inevitably do , when iran and israel rear their head .
the german-iranian soccer player has little to do with it all - the real conflict is between sworn enemies tehran and jerusalem .
but it 's the public who take the rap - people , like ashkan dejagah , who then face penalties , or unpleasantness at the very least .
the german media and the politicians should avoid blowing these stories out of all proportion and , first and foremost , should stop twisting peoples ' words .
moreover , no one would ever insist that a german-israeli football player in the german under-21 team should have to take part in a game in iran , were it scheduled .
integration is a two-way process , as this case shows .
it has to be undertaken by the naturalized citizen , and it has to be undertaken by the society welcoming him - or not , as the case may be .
integration should not have to mean self-abnegation .
it requires sensitivity , awareness and respect from both sides .
in this particular case , all these are absent .
ultimately , the political rabble-rousing is superfluous for an entirely different reason : ashkan dejagah is 21 years old .
he only has to play in the under-21s for another few months .

will the partnership work this time ? the german soccer league , the dfl , which represents the 36 first and second-division clubs , announced on tuesday that the kirch-led company sirius will sell the domestic broadcast rights to the bundesliga for six seasons .
the dfl said it set to earn some 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- from 2009 to 2015 - or 500 million euros a year - from the new deal .
the league currently makes 440 million euros per season from a deal allowing the private , pay tv station premiere to broadcast matches live and state-run television to show highlights .
that deal expires in 2009 .
now the dfl is turning to the 80-year-old kirch in an attempt to boost revenues and catch up with other , richer european leagues such as the english premiership .
lessons of history ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirch 's comeback has amazed all and distressed some the bundesliga has been around the block with kirch before - with near calamitous results .
kirch founded premiere , and for much of the 1990s , he owned live broadcast rights to bundesliga matches .
but the kirch media group repeatedly found itself in financial difficulty and was finally forced to file for bankruptcy in 2002 .
it was the largest insolvency in post-war german history .
the bankruptcy hit the bundesliga hard , depriving clubs of millions in planned revenues and driving some deep into debt .
the affair became known as the " kirch crisis . "
the new deal is reportedly covered in full by bank guarantees , although no specific names of financial institutions have been released .
mixed reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund , in yellow , was one club badly hit by the " kirch crisis " dfl members who approved the deal were generally positive about what kirch could do for the league .
" it 's a quantum leap , " hans-joachim watzke , commercial manager of borussia dortmund , told the dpa news agency .
" i consider mr. kirch a visionary entrepreneur who thinks strategically . "
but hamburg voted against the new deal .
" a decision with enormous implications was made under unnecessary time pressure , " hamburg chairman bernd hoffmann told dpa .
" the terms presented here did n't convince me . "
and fans worry that sirius , in its efforts to bring in increased revenues , might encroach upon the autonomy of soccer reporting or perhaps even do away with highlight programs on public television . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but he also admitted that americans " had been slow on the uptake " when it came to tv produced outside the us .
but now the us networks have learnt their lesson after dragging their feet on european formats such as survivor and big brother , made by dutch company endemol . these days , while europe is still more than happy to open its wallets for us shows , american networks have also realized that where europe leads , it might be worth following .
repackaging , customizing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas gottschalk , germany 's favorite talk show host that includes germany .
the country has been positioning itself to benefit from developments in film and tv markets that have seen reality show concepts traded worldwide and soaps repackaged and customized for international markets .
many of the country 's prime time entertainment format exports have been gaining international momentum .
thomas gottschalk 's talk show wetten , dass ... , which first aired 26 years ago , has gone from strength to strength .
on its home turf it attracts record viewing figures , and became the first entertainment show from germany to be sold abroad .
over the years , the format has been sold to 13 countries - including in 2006 to the key us market , where it airs as wanna bet .
further ratings giants in germany with international resonance are the science show clever , fronted by comedian wigald boning , sold to 15 countries , and schlag den raab , or " beat stefan raab . "
although it only debuted one year ago , it has already been sold to four countries including britain and the us .
the international title is beat your host .
negotiations with other prospective buyers are ongoing . "
clever is what we now call ' sciencetainment ' - that means knowledge , family entertainment , and a game show component , in a form that never existed before , " says jens richter , who distributes both clever and schlag den raab worldwide .
" it 's innovative , it 's new , no one ever did it before … it was successful at home , has great viewer ratings , and it is easy to grasp . "
crucially , these shows tick all the right boxes .
according to prominent industry watcher virginia mouseler , what tv audiences around the globe want these days are kid-centered , family-based reality shows - and especially game shows with big cash prizes , reported the afp news agency .
edgy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crew from " türkisch für anfänger " another german show generating interest at mipcom might prove more controversial .
willkommen in der nachbarschaft -lrb- " welcome to the neighborhood " -rrb- features five families competing to win a house worth 250,000 euros .
the snag is , it 's the neighbors who decide who wins - while the five families include one with a transsexual father , an islamic fundamentalist family and an african family in which the husband has two wives .
going global meanwhile , marketing agency telepool made the most of the trade fair , and sold the weekly german drama türkisch für anfänger -lrb- " turkish for beginners " -rrb- , made by state broadcaster ard , to two buyers .
in france , the show about german-turkish patchwork family , the ötztürk-schneiders , will air on canal + and the free tv youth station nrj .
broadcast rights were also bought by russian mtv .
telepool has said it is also talking to other countries and expects to sign further contracts .
gaining similar heat abroad is ard 's daily soap sturm der liebe -lrb- " love storm " -rrb- , currently the most successful show on german tv in terms of market share .
according to german united distributors , a distribution subsidiary of ard , it has been bought by 15 countries , including finland , austria , canada , latvia , slovakia and italy , where it 's called tempesta d 'amore .
a surprise success this week was the 2004 tv movie stauffenberg starring sebastian koch , who stared in the oscar-winning the lives of others , as the eponymous hero .
the topic triggered renewed interest from buyers in the us and spain thanks to the tom cruise film on the same subject currently in production in berlin .
a number of broadcasters and dvd distributors were keen to make the most of publicity generated by the cruise project to boost ratings and sales of the german movie .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the mipcom the german entries for the annual emmys , awarded by the international academy of television arts & sciences , were also announced at mipcom .
selected for the category tv movie is die mauer - berlin ' 61 -lrb- " the wall - berlin ' 61 " -rrb- , which beat nominees from brazil , china and britain , while the jury selected the rtl soap alle lieben jimmy -lrb- " everyone loves jimmy " -rrb- , made by bavaria film in the comedy category . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 10.10.2007 buddhism in germany finding new adherents großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional face of buddhism it 's been around in the wings for several decades already , yet only recently has buddhism begun to venture out towards mainstream german society .
and it would seem that a growing number of people like what they see . although it is difficult to do a reliable headcount of the number of german buddhists in germany , the german buddhist union -lrb- dbu -rrb- estimates there are about 130,000 practioners .
and there appears to be an increased interest in the religion in the nation 's traditionally christian population . " we are definitely experiencing an upwards trend , " said helge latenza of the dbu head office , " but it is a gentle curve . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german buddhists during meditation gentle or not , significantly more germans are turning towards buddhism than are converting to islam , an issue which has been creating waves throughout germany lately . last month , according to the federal interior ministry , there were between 15,000 and 40,000 converts to islam living in germany . so what is the reason for this growing interest in buddhism , which is not even recognized as a religious body under german public law ?
david schneider , one of the senior teachers of the shambala buddhist tradition , says one factor is that buddhism is a particularly tolerant religion which is open to anyone . " there have never been any buddhist wars , " schneider said . "
i think one of the things that people fear these days are extremist groups in all religions .
being the middle way , buddhism is against extremism , you can not be a buddhist extremist . " ambassador for buddhism the growing profile of the buddhist way all over the world can at least in part be attributed to the dalai lama , the spiritual head of the religion . " the media has taken a big interest in buddhism partly because of his holiness , " schneider said , adding that although he is often seen with world leaders and celebrities , he is a serious monk and practitioner who has not lost his compassion . " people like a star and he is a star and a wonderful ambassador , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama inken prohl , a theologist at heidelberg university , agrees that the german fascination for asia and buddhism has much to do with the work and profile of the dalai lama , but believes that people are also looking for care and compassion and answers to questions their christian backgrounds have been unable to provide . " people are seeking ways to get on with their lives , looking for ways to cope , " prohl said , adding that the main churches neither address the body nor the senses in the way that buddhism does . " appealing to the senses is very important , " she said , " and buddhism does this through meditation , physical exercise and simple aesthetics . " seeking happiness there is most certainly an en vogue element to buddhism in germany at the moment , but as latenza from the dbu says that does not make it any less valid .
" some people may be interested on a superficial level , but the fact is that buddhism does provide answers to today 's problems , " he said .
" people want to learn how to live a happier life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yoga practice buddhism calls for self-reflection , which fledgling practitioner volker wieprecht considers " an endlessly valuable gift . "
after almost two decades of rushing around trying out anything he thought might fill his life with happiness and meaning , he suddenly realized that he could find what he was looking for in what he describes as a " totally reliable philosophical system . " for wieprecht , buddhism means " much less drama and much more joy . " but he also acknowledges that living the buddhist way is a life-long project . sustainable trend ? that is not the same for everyone , indeed buddhism lends itself perfectly to the religious dabbler .
anyone is welcome and the extent to which one practices is determined solely by the individual . but if buddhism is something which one can dip in and out of , it is unclear how deep its roots in germany will end up being , or if it will continue to enjoy growth .
david schneider believes that the trend might slow down once people realize the work involved in following the buddhist path . " trend wo n't get you through .
even if the beautiful and famous people are walking the same path , everyone ultimately has to go it alone , " he said .
" but given the stresses of modern life , it has a lot to offer . " tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 10.10.2007 opinion : dejagah 's attitudes at odds with sportsmanship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw sports correspondent jefferson chase says a young german international soccer player 's refusal to play against israel is a mistake that runs contrary to the proper spirit of sports competitions . to see that ashkan dejagah is a conflicted person , you need only look at the words tattooed on his arms .
on the right , berlin - the city where he lived almost all his life .
on the left , tehran - the city where he was born .
dejagah 's decision to boycott the german under-21 team 's upcoming match in israel may be his attempt to align the two components of his perceived cultural identity .
but it 's also a political statement that flouts what should be the spirit of both of the german national team and international soccer itself .
dejagah could have gotten out of the match in israel without entering the spotlight .
he chose not to .
he wanted the public to sanction his action .
and his comments concerning his decision make for unhappy reading .
" i have more iranian than german blood in my veins , " dejagah told the tabloid bz newspaper in a report published tuesday .
" that should be respected , and besides i 'm doing this out of respect .
my parents are iranian . "
dejagah 's use of the blood metaphor no doubt reflects the fact that he has spent far more of his young life honing his skills with the ball in midfield than attuning himself to the historical nuances of his words .
but why should the german soccer association , the dfb , support the idea that some sort of essential iranian-ness entitles him to reject another culture - israel - wholesale ?
on the contrary , should n't the dfb be taking a stand for the principles of sportsmanship in international athletic competitions , which include treating opponents of all religions and ethnicities with equal respect ?
players who , for direct personal reasons , feel unable to live up to this standard against a given opponent can discreetly ask for a leave of absence .
players who feel a muddled religious animosity toward cultures with which they have little personal experience should n't play for national teams at all .
calls to keep politics out of soccer are misguided .
sports are inherently political - sometimes positively so .
teams from different cultures that compete fairly on the field demonstrate their shared values , including a mutual love of a game and a respect for one another as opponents .
dejagah has a right to prioritize loyalty to tehran 's hatred for israel over the spirit of the game .
the dfb has both a right and a reason to prioritize that spirit over an individual player 's perceived need to demonstrate cultural identity through discrimination .
the dejagah problem itself will be gone soon .
having already reached the maximum age , the midfielder is only eligible to play for the german under-21s for a few more months , and to become a serious candidate for the german national men 's team , dejagah would have to improve as a player .
he should also be encouraged to think more seriously about the issues he raised this week .
along with the tattoos on his arms , dejagah also got one on his neck , which reads : " remember where you from " -lrb- sic -rrb- .
he might do better to decide who he wants to be .

the report says the plan involves discontinuing all subsidies for maintenance and improvements to stations where fewer than 100 people get on or off trains per day . the station closure plan comes as tiefensee readies legislation , to be put forth in 2008 , that would privatize parts of germany 's national rail system .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 10.10.2007 opinion : dejagah 's attitudes at odds with sportsmanship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw sports correspondent jefferson chase says a young german international soccer player 's refusal to play against israel is a mistake that runs contrary to the proper spirit of sports competitions . to see that ashkan dejagah is a conflicted person , you need only look at the words tattooed on his arms .
on the right , berlin - the city where he lived almost all his life .
on the left , tehran - the city where he was born .
dejagah 's decision to boycott the german under-21 team 's upcoming match in israel may be his attempt to align the two components of his perceived cultural identity .
but it 's also a political statement that flouts what should be the spirit of both of the german national team and international soccer itself .
dejagah could have gotten out of the match in israel without entering the spotlight .
he chose not to .
he wanted the public to sanction his action .
and his comments concerning his decision make for unhappy reading .
" i have more iranian than german blood in my veins , " dejagah told the tabloid bz newspaper in a report published tuesday .
" that should be respected , and besides i 'm doing this out of respect .
my parents are iranian . "
dejagah 's use of the blood metaphor no doubt reflects the fact that he has spent far more of his young life honing his skills with the ball in midfield than attuning himself to the historical nuances of his words .
but why should the german soccer association , the dfb , support the idea that some sort of essential iranian-ness entitles him to reject another culture - israel - wholesale ?
on the contrary , should n't the dfb be taking a stand for the principles of sportsmanship in international athletic competitions , which include treating opponents of all religions and ethnicities with equal respect ?
players who , for direct personal reasons , feel unable to live up to this standard against a given opponent can discreetly ask for a leave of absence .
players who feel a muddled religious animosity toward cultures with which they have little personal experience should n't play for national teams at all .
calls to keep politics out of soccer are misguided .
sports are inherently political - sometimes positively so .
teams from different cultures that compete fairly on the field demonstrate their shared values , including a mutual love of a game and a respect for one another as opponents .
dejagah has a right to prioritize loyalty to tehran 's hatred for israel over the spirit of the game .
the dfb has both a right and a reason to prioritize that spirit over an individual player 's perceived need to demonstrate cultural identity through discrimination .
the dejagah problem itself will be gone soon .
having already reached the maximum age , the midfielder is only eligible to play for the german under-21s for a few more months , and to become a serious candidate for the german national men 's team , dejagah would have to improve as a player .
he should also be encouraged to think more seriously about the issues he raised this week .
along with the tattoos on his arms , dejagah also got one on his neck , which reads : " remember where you from " -lrb- sic -rrb- .
he might do better to decide who he wants to be .

and as sales show , german tv formats are holding their own internationally . for the participants , the mipcom bazaar means five heady days of wheeling and dealing in program rights .
the biggest winner is clearly the us , with companies such as disney taking the opportunity to boost foreign tv sales with primetime hits such as lost and desperate housewives .
but as tv markets become increasingly internationalized , the traffic has become more two-way than ever .
europe : format factory with foreign license fees reaching record heights in recent years , the movers and shakers in the riviera this week were playing for high stakes .
" we the broadcasters are the guys who feed the world what it wants to watch , " said leslie moonves from cbs in a keynote address as the fair kicked off .
but he also admitted that americans " had been slow on the uptake " when it came to tv produced outside the us .
but now the us networks have learnt their lesson after dragging their feet on european formats such as survivor and big brother , made by dutch company endemol . these days , while europe is still more than happy to open its wallets for us shows , american networks have also realized that where europe leads , it might be worth following .
repackaging , customizing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas gottschalk , germany 's favorite talk show host that includes germany .
the country has been positioning itself to benefit from developments in film and tv markets that have seen reality show concepts traded worldwide and soaps repackaged and customized for international markets .
many of the country 's prime time entertainment format exports have been gaining international momentum .
thomas gottschalk 's talk show wetten , dass ... , which first aired 26 years ago , has gone from strength to strength .
on its home turf it attracts record viewing figures , and became the first entertainment show from germany to be sold abroad .
over the years , the format has been sold to 13 countries - including in 2006 to the key us market , where it airs as wanna bet .
further ratings giants in germany with international resonance are the science show clever , fronted by comedian wigald boning , sold to 15 countries , and schlag den raab , or " beat stefan raab . "
although it only debuted one year ago , it has already been sold to four countries including britain and the us .
the international title is beat your host .
negotiations with other prospective buyers are ongoing . "
clever is what we now call ' sciencetainment ' - that means knowledge , family entertainment , and a game show component , in a form that never existed before , " says jens richter , who distributes both clever and schlag den raab worldwide .
" it 's innovative , it 's new , no one ever did it before … it was successful at home , has great viewer ratings , and it is easy to grasp . "
crucially , these shows tick all the right boxes .
according to prominent industry watcher virginia mouseler , what tv audiences around the globe want these days are kid-centered , family-based reality shows - and especially game shows with big cash prizes , reported the afp news agency .
edgy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crew from " türkisch für anfänger " another german show generating interest at mipcom might prove more controversial .
willkommen in der nachbarschaft -lrb- " welcome to the neighborhood " -rrb- features five families competing to win a house worth 250,000 euros .
the snag is , it 's the neighbors who decide who wins - while the five families include one with a transsexual father , an islamic fundamentalist family and an african family in which the husband has two wives .
going global meanwhile , marketing agency telepool made the most of the trade fair , and sold the weekly german drama türkisch für anfänger -lrb- " turkish for beginners " -rrb- , made by state broadcaster ard , to two buyers .
in france , the show about german-turkish patchwork family , the ötztürk-schneiders , will air on canal + and the free tv youth station nrj .
broadcast rights were also bought by russian mtv .
telepool has said it is also talking to other countries and expects to sign further contracts .
gaining similar heat abroad is ard 's daily soap sturm der liebe -lrb- " love storm " -rrb- , currently the most successful show on german tv in terms of market share .
according to german united distributors , a distribution subsidiary of ard , it has been bought by 15 countries , including finland , austria , canada , latvia , slovakia and italy , where it 's called tempesta d 'amore .
a surprise success this week was the 2004 tv movie stauffenberg starring sebastian koch , who stared in the oscar-winning the lives of others , as the eponymous hero .
the topic triggered renewed interest from buyers in the us and spain thanks to the tom cruise film on the same subject currently in production in berlin .
a number of broadcasters and dvd distributors were keen to make the most of publicity generated by the cruise project to boost ratings and sales of the german movie .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the mipcom the german entries for the annual emmys , awarded by the international academy of television arts & sciences , were also announced at mipcom .
selected for the category tv movie is die mauer - berlin ' 61 -lrb- " the wall - berlin ' 61 " -rrb- , which beat nominees from brazil , china and britain , while the jury selected the rtl soap alle lieben jimmy -lrb- " everyone loves jimmy " -rrb- , made by bavaria film in the comedy category . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the report says the plan involves discontinuing all subsidies for maintenance and improvements to stations where fewer than 100 people get on or off trains per day . the station closure plan comes as tiefensee readies legislation , to be put forth in 2008 , that would privatize parts of germany 's national rail system .

will the partnership work this time ? the german soccer league , the dfl , which represents the 36 first and second-division clubs , announced on tuesday that the kirch-led company sirius will sell the domestic broadcast rights to the bundesliga for six seasons .
the dfl said it set to earn some 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- from 2009 to 2015 - or 500 million euros a year - from the new deal .
the league currently makes 440 million euros per season from a deal allowing the private , pay tv station premiere to broadcast matches live and state-run television to show highlights .

the bankruptcy hit the bundesliga hard , depriving clubs of millions in planned revenues and driving some deep into debt .
the affair became known as the " kirch crisis . "
the new deal is reportedly covered in full by bank guarantees , although no specific names of financial institutions have been released .

volkswagen has announced it plans to bring out a plastic and magnesium car that can get 238 miles per us gallon by 2010 .
neither experts nor the company imagine many people lining up to buy the small but expensive car . there were plenty of pamphlets touting environmental concerns and banners proclaiming green credentials at the frankfurt auto show which ended last month .
but german carmaker volkswagen said tuesday , oct .
9 , it intended to put its money where its mouth is regarding promises to cut carbon dioxide emissions by meeting consumer demand for cars with better gas mileage . " the environment is a topic of discussion in our society and we do not think it is going to come in like a wave then roll back away , as it has in the past , " vw spokesman andreas meurer said . still , no one at vw expects the company 's single-cylinder car in development , which would require one liter of gas to travel 100 kilometers - the equivalent of 238 miles per us gallon - to be a record breaker in sales terms , ceo martin winterkorn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw made a 1-liter-car prototype in 2002 - it 's unclear how similar the new car will be the car , whose body will be made primarily of plastic and magnesium , will only reach a maximum speed of 120 kilometer per hour -lrb- 75 mph -rrb- . " people taking this car on the autobahn should pray they do n't get run over by a trailer truck , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer , director for the center of automotive research at the university of gelsenkirchen . costly production dudenhöffer said he thought vw would sell between 500 and 1,500 of the cars .
the fuel-efficient vehicle will be based on the " up ! , " a compact four-door , though the new car is likely to be considerably more expensive . " a car based on the ' up ! ' and made out of light-weight materials with a special motor is a lot more expensive and will probably be more of a niche product , " dudenhöffer said . regardless of the price , which has not yet been set , the car will serve as an example of what technology can achieve and help vw develop its profile as an environmentally aware company , dudenhöffer said . " it will help build a positive image for the brand , " he added .
" that 's why the project is being run as a small series instead of a prototype . " missing voluntary targets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german automakers have come out against plans to make emissions cuts mandatory but the car is nothing more than a red herring for a failed ecological sales strategy , said werner reh of the environmental group friends of the earth deutschland . he said the company was trying to present itself as more environmentally friendly than the facts show , adding that vw , like most german carmakers , would not even be able to meet the voluntary co2 emissions limits the auto industry has set itself . " manufactures have to meet their self-imposed co2 emissions standards and a car that is sold a thousand - or even ten thousand - times wo n't help , " he said .
" a hundred thousand of the cars would have to be sold . " in 1998 , the european automobile manufacturers association , which represents the 13 of the largest automakers on the continent , reached a voluntary agreement with the european commission to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 140 g / km over 10 years . low-consumption cars nothing new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans want big cars with big , powerful engines , dudenhöffer said with an average or 173 g / km , a change in marketing strategy would be a step in the right direction for volkswagen , reh said . " vw , like all german manufactures , spends billions to advertise vehicles that emit more than 200 grams of co2 , " he said .
" maybe they should change the commercials first . " but consumers also have a hand in lowering co2 emission , dudenhöffer said , adding that germans are buying larger , more powerful cars than ever before . " we 've already had all kinds of fuel-saving cars on the market with the audi a2 , the three-liter lupo from vw and opel 's environmental models , " he said .

volkswagen has announced it plans to bring out a plastic and magnesium car that can get 238 miles per us gallon by 2010 .
neither experts nor the company imagine many people lining up to buy the small but expensive car . there were plenty of pamphlets touting environmental concerns and banners proclaiming green credentials at the frankfurt auto show which ended last month .
but german carmaker volkswagen said tuesday , oct .
9 , it intended to put its money where its mouth is regarding promises to cut carbon dioxide emissions by meeting consumer demand for cars with better gas mileage . " the environment is a topic of discussion in our society and we do not think it is going to come in like a wave then roll back away , as it has in the past , " vw spokesman andreas meurer said . still , no one at vw expects the company 's single-cylinder car in development , which would require one liter of gas to travel 100 kilometers - the equivalent of 238 miles per us gallon - to be a record breaker in sales terms , ceo martin winterkorn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw made a 1-liter-car prototype in 2002 - it 's unclear how similar the new car will be the car , whose body will be made primarily of plastic and magnesium , will only reach a maximum speed of 120 kilometer per hour -lrb- 75 mph -rrb- . " people taking this car on the autobahn should pray they do n't get run over by a trailer truck , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer , director for the center of automotive research at the university of gelsenkirchen . costly production dudenhöffer said he thought vw would sell between 500 and 1,500 of the cars .
the fuel-efficient vehicle will be based on the " up ! , " a compact four-door , though the new car is likely to be considerably more expensive . " a car based on the ' up ! ' and made out of light-weight materials with a special motor is a lot more expensive and will probably be more of a niche product , " dudenhöffer said . regardless of the price , which has not yet been set , the car will serve as an example of what technology can achieve and help vw develop its profile as an environmentally aware company , dudenhöffer said . " it will help build a positive image for the brand , " he added .
" that 's why the project is being run as a small series instead of a prototype . " missing voluntary targets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german automakers have come out against plans to make emissions cuts mandatory but the car is nothing more than a red herring for a failed ecological sales strategy , said werner reh of the environmental group friends of the earth deutschland . he said the company was trying to present itself as more environmentally friendly than the facts show , adding that vw , like most german carmakers , would not even be able to meet the voluntary co2 emissions limits the auto industry has set itself . " manufactures have to meet their self-imposed co2 emissions standards and a car that is sold a thousand - or even ten thousand - times wo n't help , " he said .
" a hundred thousand of the cars would have to be sold . " in 1998 , the european automobile manufacturers association , which represents the 13 of the largest automakers on the continent , reached a voluntary agreement with the european commission to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 140 g / km over 10 years . low-consumption cars nothing new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans want big cars with big , powerful engines , dudenhöffer said with an average or 173 g / km , a change in marketing strategy would be a step in the right direction for volkswagen , reh said . " vw , like all german manufactures , spends billions to advertise vehicles that emit more than 200 grams of co2 , " he said .
" maybe they should change the commercials first . " but consumers also have a hand in lowering co2 emission , dudenhöffer said , adding that germans are buying larger , more powerful cars than ever before . " we 've already had all kinds of fuel-saving cars on the market with the audi a2 , the three-liter lupo from vw and opel 's environmental models , " he said .

will the partnership work this time ? the german soccer league , the dfl , which represents the 36 first and second-division clubs , announced on tuesday that the kirch-led company sirius will sell the domestic broadcast rights to the bundesliga for six seasons .
the dfl said it set to earn some 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- from 2009 to 2015 - or 500 million euros a year - from the new deal .
the league currently makes 440 million euros per season from a deal allowing the private , pay tv station premiere to broadcast matches live and state-run television to show highlights .
that deal expires in 2009 .
now the dfl is turning to the 80-year-old kirch in an attempt to boost revenues and catch up with other , richer european leagues such as the english premiership .
lessons of history ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirch 's comeback has amazed all and distressed some the bundesliga has been around the block with kirch before - with near calamitous results .
kirch founded premiere , and for much of the 1990s , he owned live broadcast rights to bundesliga matches .
but the kirch media group repeatedly found itself in financial difficulty and was finally forced to file for bankruptcy in 2002 .
it was the largest insolvency in post-war german history .
the bankruptcy hit the bundesliga hard , depriving clubs of millions in planned revenues and driving some deep into debt .
the affair became known as the " kirch crisis . "
the new deal is reportedly covered in full by bank guarantees , although no specific names of financial institutions have been released .
mixed reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund , in yellow , was one club badly hit by the " kirch crisis " dfl members who approved the deal were generally positive about what kirch could do for the league .
" it 's a quantum leap , " hans-joachim watzke , commercial manager of borussia dortmund , told the dpa news agency .
" i consider mr. kirch a visionary entrepreneur who thinks strategically . "
but hamburg voted against the new deal .
" a decision with enormous implications was made under unnecessary time pressure , " hamburg chairman bernd hoffmann told dpa .
" the terms presented here did n't convince me . "
and fans worry that sirius , in its efforts to bring in increased revenues , might encroach upon the autonomy of soccer reporting or perhaps even do away with highlight programs on public television . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 10.10.2007 opinion : dejagah 's attitudes at odds with sportsmanship großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dw sports correspondent jefferson chase says a young german international soccer player 's refusal to play against israel is a mistake that runs contrary to the proper spirit of sports competitions . to see that ashkan dejagah is a conflicted person , you need only look at the words tattooed on his arms .
on the right , berlin - the city where he lived almost all his life .
on the left , tehran - the city where he was born .
dejagah 's decision to boycott the german under-21 team 's upcoming match in israel may be his attempt to align the two components of his perceived cultural identity .
but it 's also a political statement that flouts what should be the spirit of both of the german national team and international soccer itself .
dejagah could have gotten out of the match in israel without entering the spotlight .
he chose not to .
he wanted the public to sanction his action .
and his comments concerning his decision make for unhappy reading .
" i have more iranian than german blood in my veins , " dejagah told the tabloid bz newspaper in a report published tuesday .
" that should be respected , and besides i 'm doing this out of respect .
my parents are iranian . "
dejagah 's use of the blood metaphor no doubt reflects the fact that he has spent far more of his young life honing his skills with the ball in midfield than attuning himself to the historical nuances of his words .
but why should the german soccer association , the dfb , support the idea that some sort of essential iranian-ness entitles him to reject another culture - israel - wholesale ?
on the contrary , should n't the dfb be taking a stand for the principles of sportsmanship in international athletic competitions , which include treating opponents of all religions and ethnicities with equal respect ?
players who , for direct personal reasons , feel unable to live up to this standard against a given opponent can discreetly ask for a leave of absence .
players who feel a muddled religious animosity toward cultures with which they have little personal experience should n't play for national teams at all .
calls to keep politics out of soccer are misguided .
sports are inherently political - sometimes positively so .
teams from different cultures that compete fairly on the field demonstrate their shared values , including a mutual love of a game and a respect for one another as opponents .
dejagah has a right to prioritize loyalty to tehran 's hatred for israel over the spirit of the game .
the dfb has both a right and a reason to prioritize that spirit over an individual player 's perceived need to demonstrate cultural identity through discrimination .
the dejagah problem itself will be gone soon .
having already reached the maximum age , the midfielder is only eligible to play for the german under-21s for a few more months , and to become a serious candidate for the german national men 's team , dejagah would have to improve as a player .
he should also be encouraged to think more seriously about the issues he raised this week .
along with the tattoos on his arms , dejagah also got one on his neck , which reads : " remember where you from " -lrb- sic -rrb- .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de religion -pipe- 10.10.2007 buddhism in germany finding new adherents großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : traditional face of buddhism it 's been around in the wings for several decades already , yet only recently has buddhism begun to venture out towards mainstream german society .
and it would seem that a growing number of people like what they see . although it is difficult to do a reliable headcount of the number of german buddhists in germany , the german buddhist union -lrb- dbu -rrb- estimates there are about 130,000 practioners .
and there appears to be an increased interest in the religion in the nation 's traditionally christian population . " we are definitely experiencing an upwards trend , " said helge latenza of the dbu head office , " but it is a gentle curve . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german buddhists during meditation gentle or not , significantly more germans are turning towards buddhism than are converting to islam , an issue which has been creating waves throughout germany lately . last month , according to the federal interior ministry , there were between 15,000 and 40,000 converts to islam living in germany . so what is the reason for this growing interest in buddhism , which is not even recognized as a religious body under german public law ?
david schneider , one of the senior teachers of the shambala buddhist tradition , says one factor is that buddhism is a particularly tolerant religion which is open to anyone . " there have never been any buddhist wars , " schneider said . "
i think one of the things that people fear these days are extremist groups in all religions .
being the middle way , buddhism is against extremism , you can not be a buddhist extremist . " ambassador for buddhism the growing profile of the buddhist way all over the world can at least in part be attributed to the dalai lama , the spiritual head of the religion . " the media has taken a big interest in buddhism partly because of his holiness , " schneider said , adding that although he is often seen with world leaders and celebrities , he is a serious monk and practitioner who has not lost his compassion . " people like a star and he is a star and a wonderful ambassador , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dalai lama inken prohl , a theologist at heidelberg university , agrees that the german fascination for asia and buddhism has much to do with the work and profile of the dalai lama , but believes that people are also looking for care and compassion and answers to questions their christian backgrounds have been unable to provide . " people are seeking ways to get on with their lives , looking for ways to cope , " prohl said , adding that the main churches neither address the body nor the senses in the way that buddhism does . " appealing to the senses is very important , " she said , " and buddhism does this through meditation , physical exercise and simple aesthetics . " seeking happiness there is most certainly an en vogue element to buddhism in germany at the moment , but as latenza from the dbu says that does not make it any less valid .
" some people may be interested on a superficial level , but the fact is that buddhism does provide answers to today 's problems , " he said .
" people want to learn how to live a happier life . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : yoga practice buddhism calls for self-reflection , which fledgling practitioner volker wieprecht considers " an endlessly valuable gift . "
after almost two decades of rushing around trying out anything he thought might fill his life with happiness and meaning , he suddenly realized that he could find what he was looking for in what he describes as a " totally reliable philosophical system . " for wieprecht , buddhism means " much less drama and much more joy . " but he also acknowledges that living the buddhist way is a life-long project . sustainable trend ? that is not the same for everyone , indeed buddhism lends itself perfectly to the religious dabbler .
anyone is welcome and the extent to which one practices is determined solely by the individual . but if buddhism is something which one can dip in and out of , it is unclear how deep its roots in germany will end up being , or if it will continue to enjoy growth .
david schneider believes that the trend might slow down once people realize the work involved in following the buddhist path . " trend wo n't get you through .
even if the beautiful and famous people are walking the same path , everyone ultimately has to go it alone , " he said .
" but given the stresses of modern life , it has a lot to offer . " tamsin walker send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

on the right , berlin - the city where he lived almost all his life .
on the left , tehran - the city where he was born .
dejagah 's decision to boycott the german under-21 team 's upcoming match in israel may be his attempt to align the two components of his perceived cultural identity .
but it 's also a political statement that flouts what should be the spirit of both of the german national team and international soccer itself .
dejagah could have gotten out of the match in israel without entering the spotlight .
he chose not to .
he wanted the public to sanction his action .
and his comments concerning his decision make for unhappy reading .
" i have more iranian than german blood in my veins , " dejagah told the tabloid bz newspaper in a report published tuesday .
" that should be respected , and besides i 'm doing this out of respect .
my parents are iranian . "
dejagah 's use of the blood metaphor no doubt reflects the fact that he has spent far more of his young life honing his skills with the ball in midfield than attuning himself to the historical nuances of his words .
but why should the german soccer association , the dfb , support the idea that some sort of essential iranian-ness entitles him to reject another culture - israel - wholesale ?
on the contrary , should n't the dfb be taking a stand for the principles of sportsmanship in international athletic competitions , which include treating opponents of all religions and ethnicities with equal respect ?
players who , for direct personal reasons , feel unable to live up to this standard against a given opponent can discreetly ask for a leave of absence .
players who feel a muddled religious animosity toward cultures with which they have little personal experience should n't play for national teams at all .
calls to keep politics out of soccer are misguided .
sports are inherently political - sometimes positively so .
teams from different cultures that compete fairly on the field demonstrate their shared values , including a mutual love of a game and a respect for one another as opponents .
dejagah has a right to prioritize loyalty to tehran 's hatred for israel over the spirit of the game .
the dfb has both a right and a reason to prioritize that spirit over an individual player 's perceived need to demonstrate cultural identity through discrimination .
the dejagah problem itself will be gone soon .
having already reached the maximum age , the midfielder is only eligible to play for the german under-21s for a few more months , and to become a serious candidate for the german national men 's team , dejagah would have to improve as a player .
he should also be encouraged to think more seriously about the issues he raised this week .
along with the tattoos on his arms , dejagah also got one on his neck , which reads : " remember where you from " -lrb- sic -rrb- .
he might do better to decide who he wants to be .

volkswagen has announced it plans to bring out a plastic and magnesium car that can get 238 miles per us gallon by 2010 .
neither experts nor the company imagine many people lining up to buy the small but expensive car . there were plenty of pamphlets touting environmental concerns and banners proclaiming green credentials at the frankfurt auto show which ended last month .
but german carmaker volkswagen said tuesday , oct .
9 , it intended to put its money where its mouth is regarding promises to cut carbon dioxide emissions by meeting consumer demand for cars with better gas mileage . " the environment is a topic of discussion in our society and we do not think it is going to come in like a wave then roll back away , as it has in the past , " vw spokesman andreas meurer said . still , no one at vw expects the company 's single-cylinder car in development , which would require one liter of gas to travel 100 kilometers - the equivalent of 238 miles per us gallon - to be a record breaker in sales terms , ceo martin winterkorn . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : vw made a 1-liter-car prototype in 2002 - it 's unclear how similar the new car will be the car , whose body will be made primarily of plastic and magnesium , will only reach a maximum speed of 120 kilometer per hour -lrb- 75 mph -rrb- . " people taking this car on the autobahn should pray they do n't get run over by a trailer truck , " said ferdinand dudenhöffer , director for the center of automotive research at the university of gelsenkirchen . costly production dudenhöffer said he thought vw would sell between 500 and 1,500 of the cars .
the fuel-efficient vehicle will be based on the " up ! , " a compact four-door , though the new car is likely to be considerably more expensive . " a car based on the ' up ! ' and made out of light-weight materials with a special motor is a lot more expensive and will probably be more of a niche product , " dudenhöffer said . regardless of the price , which has not yet been set , the car will serve as an example of what technology can achieve and help vw develop its profile as an environmentally aware company , dudenhöffer said . " it will help build a positive image for the brand , " he added .
" that 's why the project is being run as a small series instead of a prototype . " missing voluntary targets bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german automakers have come out against plans to make emissions cuts mandatory but the car is nothing more than a red herring for a failed ecological sales strategy , said werner reh of the environmental group friends of the earth deutschland . he said the company was trying to present itself as more environmentally friendly than the facts show , adding that vw , like most german carmakers , would not even be able to meet the voluntary co2 emissions limits the auto industry has set itself . " manufactures have to meet their self-imposed co2 emissions standards and a car that is sold a thousand - or even ten thousand - times wo n't help , " he said .
" a hundred thousand of the cars would have to be sold . " in 1998 , the european automobile manufacturers association , which represents the 13 of the largest automakers on the continent , reached a voluntary agreement with the european commission to reduce carbon dioxide emissions to 140 g / km over 10 years . low-consumption cars nothing new bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germans want big cars with big , powerful engines , dudenhöffer said with an average or 173 g / km , a change in marketing strategy would be a step in the right direction for volkswagen , reh said . " vw , like all german manufactures , spends billions to advertise vehicles that emit more than 200 grams of co2 , " he said .
" maybe they should change the commercials first . " but consumers also have a hand in lowering co2 emission , dudenhöffer said , adding that germans are buying larger , more powerful cars than ever before . " we 've already had all kinds of fuel-saving cars on the market with the audi a2 , the three-liter lupo from vw and opel 's environmental models , " he said .

and as sales show , german tv formats are holding their own internationally . for the participants , the mipcom bazaar means five heady days of wheeling and dealing in program rights .
the biggest winner is clearly the us , with companies such as disney taking the opportunity to boost foreign tv sales with primetime hits such as lost and desperate housewives .
but as tv markets become increasingly internationalized , the traffic has become more two-way than ever .
europe : format factory with foreign license fees reaching record heights in recent years , the movers and shakers in the riviera this week were playing for high stakes .
" we the broadcasters are the guys who feed the world what it wants to watch , " said leslie moonves from cbs in a keynote address as the fair kicked off .
but he also admitted that americans " had been slow on the uptake " when it came to tv produced outside the us .
but now the us networks have learnt their lesson after dragging their feet on european formats such as survivor and big brother , made by dutch company endemol . these days , while europe is still more than happy to open its wallets for us shows , american networks have also realized that where europe leads , it might be worth following .
repackaging , customizing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : thomas gottschalk , germany 's favorite talk show host that includes germany .
the country has been positioning itself to benefit from developments in film and tv markets that have seen reality show concepts traded worldwide and soaps repackaged and customized for international markets .
many of the country 's prime time entertainment format exports have been gaining international momentum .
thomas gottschalk 's talk show wetten , dass ... , which first aired 26 years ago , has gone from strength to strength .
on its home turf it attracts record viewing figures , and became the first entertainment show from germany to be sold abroad .
over the years , the format has been sold to 13 countries - including in 2006 to the key us market , where it airs as wanna bet .
further ratings giants in germany with international resonance are the science show clever , fronted by comedian wigald boning , sold to 15 countries , and schlag den raab , or " beat stefan raab . "
although it only debuted one year ago , it has already been sold to four countries including britain and the us .
the international title is beat your host .
negotiations with other prospective buyers are ongoing . "
clever is what we now call ' sciencetainment ' - that means knowledge , family entertainment , and a game show component , in a form that never existed before , " says jens richter , who distributes both clever and schlag den raab worldwide .
" it 's innovative , it 's new , no one ever did it before … it was successful at home , has great viewer ratings , and it is easy to grasp . "
crucially , these shows tick all the right boxes .
according to prominent industry watcher virginia mouseler , what tv audiences around the globe want these days are kid-centered , family-based reality shows - and especially game shows with big cash prizes , reported the afp news agency .
edgy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the crew from " türkisch für anfänger " another german show generating interest at mipcom might prove more controversial .
willkommen in der nachbarschaft -lrb- " welcome to the neighborhood " -rrb- features five families competing to win a house worth 250,000 euros .
the snag is , it 's the neighbors who decide who wins - while the five families include one with a transsexual father , an islamic fundamentalist family and an african family in which the husband has two wives .
going global meanwhile , marketing agency telepool made the most of the trade fair , and sold the weekly german drama türkisch für anfänger -lrb- " turkish for beginners " -rrb- , made by state broadcaster ard , to two buyers .
in france , the show about german-turkish patchwork family , the ötztürk-schneiders , will air on canal + and the free tv youth station nrj .
broadcast rights were also bought by russian mtv .
telepool has said it is also talking to other countries and expects to sign further contracts .
gaining similar heat abroad is ard 's daily soap sturm der liebe -lrb- " love storm " -rrb- , currently the most successful show on german tv in terms of market share .
according to german united distributors , a distribution subsidiary of ard , it has been bought by 15 countries , including finland , austria , canada , latvia , slovakia and italy , where it 's called tempesta d 'amore .
a surprise success this week was the 2004 tv movie stauffenberg starring sebastian koch , who stared in the oscar-winning the lives of others , as the eponymous hero .
the topic triggered renewed interest from buyers in the us and spain thanks to the tom cruise film on the same subject currently in production in berlin .
a number of broadcasters and dvd distributors were keen to make the most of publicity generated by the cruise project to boost ratings and sales of the german movie .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : at the mipcom the german entries for the annual emmys , awarded by the international academy of television arts & sciences , were also announced at mipcom .

on the right , berlin - the city where he lived almost all his life .
on the left , tehran - the city where he was born .
dejagah 's decision to boycott the german under-21 team 's upcoming match in israel may be his attempt to align the two components of his perceived cultural identity .
but it 's also a political statement that flouts what should be the spirit of both of the german national team and international soccer itself .
dejagah could have gotten out of the match in israel without entering the spotlight .
he chose not to .
he wanted the public to sanction his action .
and his comments concerning his decision make for unhappy reading .
" i have more iranian than german blood in my veins , " dejagah told the tabloid bz newspaper in a report published tuesday .
" that should be respected , and besides i 'm doing this out of respect .
my parents are iranian . "
dejagah 's use of the blood metaphor no doubt reflects the fact that he has spent far more of his young life honing his skills with the ball in midfield than attuning himself to the historical nuances of his words .
but why should the german soccer association , the dfb , support the idea that some sort of essential iranian-ness entitles him to reject another culture - israel - wholesale ?
on the contrary , should n't the dfb be taking a stand for the principles of sportsmanship in international athletic competitions , which include treating opponents of all religions and ethnicities with equal respect ?
players who , for direct personal reasons , feel unable to live up to this standard against a given opponent can discreetly ask for a leave of absence .
players who feel a muddled religious animosity toward cultures with which they have little personal experience should n't play for national teams at all .
calls to keep politics out of soccer are misguided .
sports are inherently political - sometimes positively so .
teams from different cultures that compete fairly on the field demonstrate their shared values , including a mutual love of a game and a respect for one another as opponents .
dejagah has a right to prioritize loyalty to tehran 's hatred for israel over the spirit of the game .
the dfb has both a right and a reason to prioritize that spirit over an individual player 's perceived need to demonstrate cultural identity through discrimination .
the dejagah problem itself will be gone soon .
having already reached the maximum age , the midfielder is only eligible to play for the german under-21s for a few more months , and to become a serious candidate for the german national men 's team , dejagah would have to improve as a player .
he should also be encouraged to think more seriously about the issues he raised this week .
along with the tattoos on his arms , dejagah also got one on his neck , which reads : " remember where you from " -lrb- sic -rrb- .
he might do better to decide who he wants to be .

will the partnership work this time ? the german soccer league , the dfl , which represents the 36 first and second-division clubs , announced on tuesday that the kirch-led company sirius will sell the domestic broadcast rights to the bundesliga for six seasons .
the dfl said it set to earn some 3 billion euros -lrb- $ 4.2 billion -rrb- from 2009 to 2015 - or 500 million euros a year - from the new deal .
the league currently makes 440 million euros per season from a deal allowing the private , pay tv station premiere to broadcast matches live and state-run television to show highlights .
that deal expires in 2009 .
now the dfl is turning to the 80-year-old kirch in an attempt to boost revenues and catch up with other , richer european leagues such as the english premiership .
lessons of history ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kirch 's comeback has amazed all and distressed some the bundesliga has been around the block with kirch before - with near calamitous results .
kirch founded premiere , and for much of the 1990s , he owned live broadcast rights to bundesliga matches .
but the kirch media group repeatedly found itself in financial difficulty and was finally forced to file for bankruptcy in 2002 .
it was the largest insolvency in post-war german history .
the bankruptcy hit the bundesliga hard , depriving clubs of millions in planned revenues and driving some deep into debt .
the affair became known as the " kirch crisis . "
the new deal is reportedly covered in full by bank guarantees , although no specific names of financial institutions have been released .
mixed reactions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dortmund , in yellow , was one club badly hit by the " kirch crisis " dfl members who approved the deal were generally positive about what kirch could do for the league .
" it 's a quantum leap , " hans-joachim watzke , commercial manager of borussia dortmund , told the dpa news agency .
" i consider mr. kirch a visionary entrepreneur who thinks strategically . "
but hamburg voted against the new deal .
" a decision with enormous implications was made under unnecessary time pressure , " hamburg chairman bernd hoffmann told dpa .
" the terms presented here did n't convince me . "
and fans worry that sirius , in its efforts to bring in increased revenues , might encroach upon the autonomy of soccer reporting or perhaps even do away with highlight programs on public television . dw staff -lrb- jc -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germans cultivate personal ties to foreign countries - why should n't immigrants retain their ties to their former home ?
it would be unreasonable and wrong to expect anything else .
in most cases , this principle is respected .
but not when politics enter the equation .
and they inevitably do , when iran and israel rear their head .
the german-iranian soccer player has little to do with it all - the real conflict is between sworn enemies tehran and jerusalem .
but it 's the public who take the rap - people , like ashkan dejagah , who then face penalties , or unpleasantness at the very least .
the german media and the politicians should avoid blowing these stories out of all proportion and , first and foremost , should stop twisting peoples ' words .
moreover , no one would ever insist that a german-israeli football player in the german under-21 team should have to take part in a game in iran , were it scheduled .
integration is a two-way process , as this case shows .
it has to be undertaken by the naturalized citizen , and it has to be undertaken by the society welcoming him - or not , as the case may be .
integration should not have to mean self-abnegation .
it requires sensitivity , awareness and respect from both sides .
in this particular case , all these are absent .
ultimately , the political rabble-rousing is superfluous for an entirely different reason : ashkan dejagah is 21 years old .
he only has to play in the under-21s for another few months .

david schneider , one of the senior teachers of the shambala buddhist tradition , says one factor is that buddhism is a particularly tolerant religion which is open to anyone . " there have never been any buddhist wars , " schneider said . "

" people are seeking ways to get on with their lives , looking for ways to cope , " prohl said , adding that the main churches neither address the body nor the senses in the way that buddhism does . " appealing to the senses is very important , " she said , " and buddhism does this through meditation , physical exercise and simple aesthetics . " seeking happiness there is most certainly an en vogue element to buddhism in germany at the moment , but as latenza from the dbu says that does not make it any less valid .

after almost two decades of rushing around trying out anything he thought might fill his life with happiness and meaning , he suddenly realized that he could find what he was looking for in what he describes as a " totally reliable philosophical system .

anyone is welcome and the extent to which one practices is determined solely by the individual . but if buddhism is something which one can dip in and out of , it is unclear how deep its roots in germany will end up being , or if it will continue to enjoy growth .

jane hutt revealed the revised curriculum for children ranging from three to 19 years , following an extensive consultation .
she said the changes would make a difference to pupils ' career prospects .
however , the national union of teachers -lrb- nut -rrb- said the changes could mean an increase in teachers ' workload .
ms hutt said on tuesday the revisions would promote bilingualism and " embrace the ' curriculum cymreig ' - a curriculum that is set in the welsh context and deals with matters and issues relevant to wales while ensuring wider international perspectives " .
budget a range of personal and social issues are covered , including personal relationships , diet and health , money management , sustainable living , first aid and citizenship .
ms hutt said the revised curriculum would better prepare individuals for life in the 21st century .
the changes will mean a greater emphasis on money management , so that students could be taught everything from how to live within a budget to the pros and cons of credit cards .
health and well-being will also be on the timetable in addition to first aid training .
rhys williams from nut cymru said that while they believed the new subjects were a good idea , they were concerned whether teachers would be capable of teaching every single subject .
" i think the strategy needs to be thought out well , " he said .
" not all teachers are perfect examples of healthy eating and good diet .
is that going to effect their credibility to teach health and diet to children ? "
mr williams suggested that schools could invite experts into schools to give talks but said teachers would also need training and resources .
" most teachers do n't mind the principle of teaching these subjects for the benefit and welfare of the children , it 's just you have got to be helped and supported and you have got to have the resrouces , " he said .
' raise standards ' ms hutt said : " this revised curriculum will help raise standards of performance , and will enable our young people to make valuable contributions to the social , cultural and economic life of our country .
" it maintains the best tradition of our established model , whilst placing a firm and clear emphasis on the skills needed to widen educational opportunities and raise standards of achievement . "
the consultation on the school curriculum was held between january and march .

it is hoped a bronze bust of the player can be unveiled in february , on the 10th anniversary of his untimely death .
james , who played for the swans during the club 's glory years in the old first division , collapsed and died while playing for llanelli in 1998 , aged 40 .
the appeal is the idea of his son luke and is backed by the supporters ' trust .
" as i 've got older , i 've started to think about my dad more , " said luke .
" i 'm coming to terms with it all now and something i would love to see would be some kind of memorial to my dad .
" people tell me what a legend he was and how swansea 's fans used to chant his name .
" it would mean so much to me if there was a tribute to him at the liberty stadium . "
a welsh international who played in midfield and as a striker , james made 593 appearances for swansea as well as having spells with stoke , qpr , leicester , bradford and cardiff .
he was player-manger at llanelli when he died .
the swansea supporters ' trust has agreed to help organise fundraising activities .
chairman phil sumbler said : " robbie was one of my early swansea heroes and i do n't think anyone who saw him play would forget what he did for swansea city .
" i do believe that swans fans of all ages will back the memorial fund and give luke the memorial that his dad deserves . "
since the stadium opened in 2005 , a bronze statue of club legend ivor allchurch has been erected outside , and a bust of swansea-born former wales great john charles has also been unveiled .

under a deal with prosecutors , the star will serve the sentence during breaks in filming for his hit tv drama , 24 .
sutherland , 40 , was arrested in los angeles last month while on probation for a 2004 drink-driving offence .
in a statement , the actor apologised for his " poor judgement " and the " distress this has caused my family , friends and co-workers " .
sutherland was not in court as his lawyer , blair berk , entered the plea agreement .
a second charge of driving under the influence was dropped .
his arrangement means that filming on the seventh series of 24 will not be interrupted , drawing praise from his bosses at tv network fox .
' man of his word ' " kiefer made clear to us at the time of his arrest that his first concern was the welfare of those he worked with and that he intended to do whatever was necessary to prevent shutting down the show , " it said in a statement .
" he told us that even if he had to sacrifice more time in custody in order to protect the show and the jobs of those who work with him , he would do so .
the actor picked up an emmy for his role in 24 last year " from what occurred today , it is evident he is a man of his word . "
the jail sentence consists of 30 days for driving with a blood-alcohol level above the legal limit , and 18 days for violating his probation , according to court records .
under the terms of his agreement , he must serve the time in full .
sutherland also received a six-month driving ban , and was ordered to attend alcohol education classes for 18 months and weekly alcohol therapy sessions for six months .
the canadian actor first came to fame as part of the 1980s " brat pack " , starring in films such as the lost boys , young guns and flatliners .
he took on the role of 24 's counter-terrorist agent jack bauer in 2001 , and won an emmy for the role last year .
last week , financial magazine forbes placed him tenth on its list of the highest-paid celebrities .
it stated that he earned $ 22m -lrb- £ 10.79m -rrb- ; the list was topped by oprah winfrey with $ 260m -lrb- £ 128m -rrb- .

by fiona pryor entertainment reporter , bbc news the release of the new radiohead album , in rainbows , has set a precedent for challenging the cost of music .
instead of listing a price for the record , the group announced on their website last week that it was up to fans to pay whatever they wanted for it .
the band are the latest in a long line of artists who are reaching out to fans in ways that completely cut out the corporate machine - otherwise known as the record company .
nme reviews editor julian marshall thinks more bands are going to attempt new ideas like radiohead .
" i think it 's actually a really exciting time .
people have been talking for years about how the internet was going to change the way people approach releasing their records , " he says .
he suspects major record labels face being cut out of the deal regularly now because they have not been " quick enough to react " to the digital era .
release build up mr marshall , who interviewed radiohead last year , says they were keen to do things their way once their contract with emi 's parlophone label came to an end .
" they wanted to get away from the pressures of the big cycles of a release and from their point of view they wanted to get away from the enormity of the build-up to a release date .
" they did n't want to be part of an empire , " he says . "
for someone like prince i think he knew in his heart of hearts that he probably would n't have sold as many records as he managed to give away with the mail on sunday " julian marshall , nme bbc radio 1 's head of music , george ergatoudis , says there is " real pressure " on record labels to keep up with the changing times .
" they need to change how they run their business .
the future is definitely more competitive than it has ever been , " he says .
according to mr ergatoudis , new music could be at risk if the major labels do not seek a solution .
" they need to look at alternative revenue streams in order to have the money to help finance starter packs , " he says .
entertainment retailers association deputy chairman ben drury agrees .
" as cd sales have gone down live music is booming , so music itself is becoming more and more popular , " he says .
" there are more ways to get music than ever before and really , it 's those labels that adapt to those conditions are the ones that will survive and prosper . "
' devaluing music ' it is not just radiohead who have moved forward in finding original ways to distribute and market their music .
simply red frontman mick hucknall set up his own label in the band 's name and now sells music via its website .
the charlatans recently announced a deal with radio station xfm , which will allow fans to download their forthcoming new album via the station 's website for free .
and prince made headlines recently for being the first artist to agree a deal with a sunday newspaper which gave copies of his latest album , planet earth , away with the publication .
at the time , hmv 's chief executive , simon fox , said the deal was " devaluing music " .
however others thought prince , who started releasing music in 1978 , was one step ahead of the game .
" i think he knew in his heart of hearts that he probably would n't have sold as many records as he managed to give away with the mail on sunday , " says the nme 's julian marshall .
" he makes his money from doing 21 nights at the o2 , so in a way the money side of the industry for prince is performance . "
the promotion was believed to have been worth about £ 250,000 to the musician .
according to the mail on sunday 's managing director , stephen miron , the agreement proved to be very lucrative for both parties , with the paper selling 2.8 million copies - its second-highest sale in 10 years . "
this is probably the biggest transitional period in the history of the music industry " george ergatoudis radio 1 's head of music " what we have created is the opportunity to get music to the masses and on a scale not available via traditional methods , " he adds .
could this be the demise of the big labels who have dominated the market for so long ?
" it 's a very challenging market - there is no question , " says george ergatoudis .
" the realisation is they 're in a very competitive place and there are some serious challenges ahead .
this is probably the biggest transitional period in the history of the music industry , but i think the majors will be around for some time to come . "

by fiona pryor entertainment reporter , bbc news radiohead 's album can only be downloaded from their website the release of the new radiohead album , in rainbows , has set a precedent for challenging the cost of music .
instead of listing a price for the record , the group announced on their website last week that it was up to fans to pay whatever they wanted for it .
the band are the latest in a long line of artists who are reaching out to fans in ways that completely cut out the corporate machine - otherwise known as the record company .
nme reviews editor julian marshall thinks more bands are going to attempt new ideas like radiohead .
" i think it 's actually a really exciting time .
people have been talking for years about how the internet was going to change the way people approach releasing their records , " he says .
he suspects major record labels face being cut out of the deal regularly now because they have not been " quick enough to react " to the digital era .
release build up mr marshall , who interviewed radiohead last year , says they were keen to do things their way once their contract with emi 's parlophone label came to an end .
" they wanted to get away from the pressures of the big cycles of a release and from their point of view they wanted to get away from the enormity of the build-up to a release date .
" they did n't want to be part of an empire , " he says .
for someone like prince i think he knew in his heart of hearts that he probably would n't have sold as many records as he managed to give away with the mail on sunday julian marshall , nme bbc radio 1 's head of music , george ergatoudis , says there is " real pressure " on record labels to keep up with the changing times .
" they need to change how they run their business .
the future is definitely more competitive than it has ever been , " he says .
according to mr ergatoudis , new music could be at risk if the major labels do not seek a solution .
" they need to look at alternative revenue streams in order to have the money to help finance starter packs , " he says .
entertainment retailers association deputy chairman ben drury agrees .
" as cd sales have gone down live music is booming , so music itself is becoming more and more popular , " he says .
" there are more ways to get music than ever before and really , it 's those labels that adapt to those conditions are the ones that will survive and prosper . "
' devaluing music ' it is not just radiohead who have moved forward in finding original ways to distribute and market their music .
simply red frontman mick hucknall set up his own label in the band 's name and now sells music via its website .
the charlatans recently announced a deal with radio station xfm , which will allow fans to download their forthcoming new album via the station 's website for free .
the charlatans will give their album away via xfm 's website and prince made headlines recently for being the first artist to agree a deal with a sunday newspaper which gave copies of his latest album , planet earth , away with the publication .
at the time , hmv 's chief executive , simon fox , said the deal was " devaluing music " .
however others thought prince , who started releasing music in 1978 , was one step ahead of the game .
" i think he knew in his heart of hearts that he probably would n't have sold as many records as he managed to give away with the mail on sunday , " says the nme 's julian marshall .
" he makes his money from doing 21 nights at the o2 , so in a way the money side of the industry for prince is performance . "
the promotion was believed to have been worth about £ 250,000 to the musician .
according to the mail on sunday 's managing director , stephen miron , the agreement proved to be very lucrative for both parties , with the paper selling 2.8 million copies - its second-highest sale in 10 years .
this is probably the biggest transitional period in the history of the music industry george ergatoudis radio 1 's head of music " what we have created is the opportunity to get music to the masses and on a scale not available via traditional methods , " he adds .
could this be the demise of the big labels who have dominated the market for so long ?
" it 's a very challenging market - there is no question , " says george ergatoudis .
