experts say a decline in construction is to blame . the seasonally-adjusted figure released by officials at the federal statistics office on tuesday came in well below the 0.5-percent growth in gross domestic product recorded in the first quarter .
exports continued to provide most of the impetus , although there were also indications of growing domestic expenditure .
domestic investment in machines and equipment rose significantly , while construction declined . " economic growth was based especially on the highly dynamic foreign trade , " the statistical office said , adding that domestic demand had made a " positive , though smaller contribution to growth . "
past the peak financial analysts said they were disappointed with the growth , adding that they had expected a slightly higher figure of 0.4 percent .
" a few weeks ago , we thought that it was going to be significantly stronger because of the good mood among companies and the labor market situation , " dirk schumacher of goldman sachs told reuters news service .
he added that the dip should be seen as a slip-up and that growth would again pick up in the third quarter .
" but we 've definitely surpassed the growth peak , " he added .
strong 2006 revised figures for 2006 meanwhile indicated that the economy grew faster than previously announced , with growth for the full year coming in at 2.9 percent , against the 2.8 percent previously reported .

it was gul 's attempt to run for the presidency that triggered early parliamentary elections in july and saw prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's akp returned to power with a parliamentary majority .
millions protested bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-secular demonstrators with a portrait of turkey 's founder atatürk in april millions of people urged on by retired generals took to the streets in april and june to protest against the akp and the prospect of gül becoming president .
they objected to gül 's past involvement in conservative islamist groups , the fact that his wife wears an islamic-style headscarf - no president 's wife in turkey has ever worn one - and also at the prospect of the akp controlling the government , the parliament and presidency .
gül 's original attempt failed thanks to a boycott of the presidential vote by opposition parties . " if gul is elected , turkey 's political balances will change , " deniz baykal , head of the main opposition republican people 's party , was quoted as saying in the radikal newspaper .
" turkey will be transformed into a country with an overbearing religious and middle eastern identity . "
after a late-night warning from the military that it would do whatever necessary to protect secularism , the constitutional court ruled that at least two-thirds of deputies in the parliament must be present for the vote to go ahead .

gül is not expected to win the two-thirds of the vote necessary to be elected in the first or second rounds , but with the akp holding a strong majority in parliament , he is expected to be elected in the third round .
one of the main opposition parties , the nationalist movement party -lrb- mhp -rrb- has promised to take part in the vote thus ensuring that quorum will be reached . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but is often criticized for lacking a consistent strategy , especially in afghanistan , where troops serve under three different mandates . the deployments are also stretching the bundeswehr , which is one of the reason 's chancellor merkel 's coalition gave for waving aside french president nicolas sarkozy 's call for european troops to protect refugees from darfur , according to the government . but many german parliamentarians consider the argument of depleted capacities an insufficient one .
they say this mission is necessary , precisely because it is a humanitarian one . at the same time , they want a debate about which missions the bundeswehr should take part in , and which should have priority . deutsche welle : mr. gerhardt , considering the drop in public acceptance of foreign peacekeeping missions , is there - at the least - a problem of communication between politicians and the people ?
is n't it time for a general debate on the purpose of the individual missions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang gerhardt wolfgang gerhard : yes .
as a government , or as a member of parliament or the opposition , each day you have to justify to society why you mobilize soldiers .
you have to have clear criteria .
and you have to go into this debate convincingly , with political leadership .
the security of our country is threatened by places in the world where there are problems , and it can only be ensured if we , along with other democratic nations , and with united nations mandates , can to some degree calm the world 's hot spots . but the priorities are also unclear .
some say the missions must be in germany 's interest .
is that definition justified ? in the interest of human dignity and in the interest of freedom and security in the world , i would add that is in germany 's interest .
that may sound generalized , but it can be more precise .
if we are unable to offer people in afghanistan an alternative to poppy-growing , where they supply practically the entire world with drugs , then deploying all those soldiers there is useless .
so a political solution must always accompany a military mission . so in addition to the military deployment , we have to think much more intensely about social structures there , with participation by the european union .
in darfur , where women are being raped , and human suffering is everywhere , it 's not a place where we can stay away - if the bundeswehr is capable of involvement - on moral or ethical grounds .
anyone who goes into congo to monitor elections should have strong arguments for not going into darfur . so you 're in favor of an engagement , of a bundeswehr mission to darfur ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african union said it could provide enough troops to protect darfur the first question is does the bundeswehr have the capacity to take part in what maybe action in darfur .
and the second reason is a moral question for me - the responsibility to protect is one of the important points of foreign policy in our times .
we see worldwide that there are governments who do not like to protect their own people , and though it is a responsibility for the community of democratic nations , with a legitimate mandate from the united nations to protect people , that 's a main reason for me to advocate participation of the bundeswehr if the bundeswehr is capable of doing so . can the bundeswehr do that ? if it can , then we should not stand on the sidelines .
my moral justification for that does n't exist in a vacuum of course - we have to know if the bundeswehr can do it , if it has the capacities to get involved .
and who else would take part ?
all of that has not yet been answered .
but if there is a special humane reason to protect people , then darfur is an important place for it . why do you think then that the german government is being so reticent about committing troops to darfur ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suffering of sudan 's refugees needs to be made clear to germans , gerhardt said i believe the government has a hard time with this rejection .
for moral and ethical reasons , it must realize this responsibility to protect , when human rights are discussed , for instance in the united nations .
we have to clear all the deployment mandates and all the soldiers we have worldwide .
we have to ask ourselves what is the reason , what is the aim , where is the escape , is the task fulfilled ? we had a mission in congo , it was not a mission i would like to have .
it was for one day , or two days , we left congo and nothing is better there .
we have been in afghanistan for years , we have n't given the people an alternative for social security ; we have only deployed soldiers .
we have to fulfill mandates but not only with soldiers .
we have been looking on for years at the rape in darfur , at the brutality in darfur and we know that the government of sudan is not able to protect the people there . given the low support in germany for foreign peacekeeping missions , how will you sell this mission to darfur ? every conflict has a variety of reasons - the agricultural structure in the region , the ethnic split in this region .
but at the end of the day you have to convince people in which world we would like to live , and what is security for the federal republic of germany , and what are the necessary steps to protect europe .
if we are not able to calm conflicts in worldwide hotspots , we can not contribute to security policy in europe . dw-tv 's christopher springate interviewed wolfgang gerhardt -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke with ulrich kater , of germany 's dekabank , who said that market participants underestimated risks involved in the us federal reserve bank 's low-interest-rate policies .
dw-world.de : the central banks have been massively pumping money into markets - in unheard of amounts since the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the us .
are the banks living up to their responsibilities , or is this a sign of a real crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich kater , of the dekabank ulrich kater : the central banks have a responsibility to ensure that the money markets can function .
if the demand for liquidity rises to a point that money markets can not satisfy , then it is clearly the obligation of the central banks to provide liquidity .
but one can see that the amounts the banks have pumped into the markets in this very short-term liquidity intervention have continually decreased ; that was already evident last week , although it was often portrayed differently .
that speaks to conditions on the markets that are getting back to normal . how much responsibility do the central banks carry in whether the financial markets continue to calm down , or whether there will be more panicked reactions ?
the central banks are simply the fundament on which the money markets are based .
the markets , however , are currently suffering from an intense phenomenon of the masses : even though trust in one 's business partner is the most important commodity on the markets , every market participant is under the general suspicion of not being able to live up to his promises .
the central banks are there to ease fears so that so that things will settle down .
i think confidence in the markets will return , especially given the basic economic data .
is n't there a risk that investors can now rely on the banks too much ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's up to central banks to make sure credit markets have the liquidity they need no .
the central banks have an obligation only for short-term interventions .
investors , on the other hand , plan months , quarters and years in advance .
in moments of crisis , everything always appears very dramatic , but at second glance , when the markets return to normal , the investors will also see that the basic economic figures are on track and that the global economy continues to be very dynamic .
how were things in the past ?
did the central banks , especially the federal reserve bank under alan greenspan at that time , always fulfill their obligations ?
could interest rate policies in the us have been one of the reasons for the current crisis ?
there were good reasons back then for lowering the interest rates so much .
the fed wanted to control the macro-economic consequences of the stock market bubble that burst in 2001 , and it managed to do that .
but now we are seeing the collateral damage of these interest rate policies .
the sense of danger among market participants became too sedated by the " medicine " of low interest rates .
in hindsight , it probably would have been better if the central banks had started raising their interest rates a year earlier .
but even central bank professionals do not have 20/20 vision for the future .
the lesson that should be learned from this is not to underestimate the danger of interest rates that are too low for loans .
the lack of liquidity on the global markets has also highlighted the interest policies of the bank of japan .
can we expect it to raise its rates , thus intensifying the crisis ?
even last year , japan 's central bank policies were slower to move than expected .
it is possible that , due to liquidity shortages on the markets , the bank of japan will postpone its plans for raising interest rates in august - perhaps just for a month .
but generally speaking , it will also be pushing for a normalization of economic policies and will have to raise interest rates . angela göpfert interviewed ulrich kater -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in moments of crisis , everything always appears very dramatic , but at second glance , when the markets return to normal , the investors will also see that the basic economic figures are on track and that the global economy continues to be very dynamic .
how were things in the past ?
did the central banks , especially the federal reserve bank under alan greenspan at that time , always fulfill their obligations ?
could interest rate policies in the us have been one of the reasons for the current crisis ?
there were good reasons back then for lowering the interest rates so much .
the fed wanted to control the macro-economic consequences of the stock market bubble that burst in 2001 , and it managed to do that .
but now we are seeing the collateral damage of these interest rate policies .
the sense of danger among market participants became too sedated by the " medicine " of low interest rates .
in hindsight , it probably would have been better if the central banks had started raising their interest rates a year earlier .
but even central bank professionals do not have 20/20 vision for the future .
the lesson that should be learned from this is not to underestimate the danger of interest rates that are too low for loans .
the lack of liquidity on the global markets has also highlighted the interest policies of the bank of japan .
can we expect it to raise its rates , thus intensifying the crisis ?
even last year , japan 's central bank policies were slower to move than expected .
it is possible that , due to liquidity shortages on the markets , the bank of japan will postpone its plans for raising interest rates in august - perhaps just for a month .
but generally speaking , it will also be pushing for a normalization of economic policies and will have to raise interest rates . angela göpfert interviewed ulrich kater -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he was sentenced to three years in prison and pardoned after six months behind bars . schirach 's involvement in the case also made headlines because he is the grandson of baldur von schirach , the former leader of the nazi hitler youth , who was found guilty of crimes against humanity and served 20 years in prison . dw-world.de : what 's the significance of the resurfaced shoot-to-kill order ? ferdinand von schirach : it 's negligible .
it 's a document that 's been known for a long time to everyone involved , including the berlin state prosecutor 's office , which now claims that it has to investigate this again .
this piece of paper has no known author and no clear addressee .
it 's a simple piece of paper that could have been written by anyone and that will not hold up for convictions or even the initiation of a criminal investigation . of course you have to say - and that 's probably the best thing that can be said about this piece of paper - that it 's circumstantial evidence for the cruelty of the border fortifications and the guarding of the border .
but one should n't think that this is a piece of paper that the courts have been looking for for years and that places guilt on a certain person without a doubt or is able to describe the system as a whole . could you say then that it 's a historically interesting but legally irrelevant document ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler , the head of the agency that administers the stasi files it 's not irrelevant from a legal standpoint , because even circumstantial evidence is relevant .
it 's certainly interesting from a historic perspective , but it 's not unique - there were several of these documents . the thing that 's maybe interesting from a historic perspective is that the head of a federal agency has gone so far off the rails that she thinks that she can make policy with this on the anniversary of the construction of the wall .
-lrb- marianne birthler heads the so-called " birthler authority , " the unofficial name given to the government office responsible for researching the history of the gdr 's secret police , the stasi -rrb- .we need to get away from handling these issues in a sensationalist way . it 's a serious issue and as the head of such an agency , you can not push such a paper into the public realm and claim to reveal something completely new even though it 's been known for a long time .
in my opinion , it will also have to lead to a discussion about what should be done with the agency . why do you think that this surfaced right now ? because of the anniversary of the construction of the wall .
-lrb- this week marked the 46th anniversary of the building of the berlin wall -rrb- there 's no other reason in my opinion .
the paper has been known , the state prosecutors received a number of such papers for investigations years ago , and none of them played any role in any of the trials .
it 's a little trite to say : i have now found the document that offers conclusive proof for everything . let 's take a step back and think about what this shoot-to-kill order actually means .
it meant that the gdr forcefully prevented its people from doing nothing more than trying to leave the country .
that 's what 's condemnable about this system and the courts ruled accordingly .
they declared - questionable from a legal standpoint but correct from a moral one - that such systems are inhuman and that this deserves to be punished . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : white crosses serve as memorials to those killed while trying to cross the wall now , many years after the trials , someone comes and says : now , i have the piece of paper that makes it perfectly clear that the gdr had such an order -lsb- to shoot and kill -rsb- .
but that was n't the case .
this clear-cut order was n't confirmed by any of the witnesses or any outsider .
it did not exist in a single document . it 's not a secret that these young border patrols shot at people and that many people died there .
it is a historic fact .
but that does n't mean that we can turn around and say : there was a clear order to shoot women and children .
i think that 's nonsense .
these systems were also too intelligent to do something like this .
the border patrols were put under oath every morning and had to swear on all sorts of orders that were given there .
for all intents and purposes , it did what 's written in this ominous paper , but no one in the gdr would have said something like this . several politicians have called for an investigation into possible legal action .
do you think any legal action will be taken ? it definitely wo n't happen .
the prosecutor 's office already had these papers and could have checked them a long time ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de peacekeeping -pipe- 14.08.2007 politician wants more german help for darfur großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 300,000 people have been killed and 2 million displaced in darfur since 2003 wolfgang gerhard , foreign policy advisor for the opposition free-market liberal fdp , spoke to deutsche welle about german concerns regarding international peacekeeping missions and why germany 's army should be in darfur . at present the german army , the bundeswehr , is taking part in nine missions abroad .
but is often criticized for lacking a consistent strategy , especially in afghanistan , where troops serve under three different mandates . the deployments are also stretching the bundeswehr , which is one of the reason 's chancellor merkel 's coalition gave for waving aside french president nicolas sarkozy 's call for european troops to protect refugees from darfur , according to the government . but many german parliamentarians consider the argument of depleted capacities an insufficient one .
they say this mission is necessary , precisely because it is a humanitarian one . at the same time , they want a debate about which missions the bundeswehr should take part in , and which should have priority . deutsche welle : mr. gerhardt , considering the drop in public acceptance of foreign peacekeeping missions , is there - at the least - a problem of communication between politicians and the people ?
is n't it time for a general debate on the purpose of the individual missions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang gerhardt wolfgang gerhard : yes .
as a government , or as a member of parliament or the opposition , each day you have to justify to society why you mobilize soldiers .
you have to have clear criteria .
and you have to go into this debate convincingly , with political leadership .
the security of our country is threatened by places in the world where there are problems , and it can only be ensured if we , along with other democratic nations , and with united nations mandates , can to some degree calm the world 's hot spots . but the priorities are also unclear .
some say the missions must be in germany 's interest .
is that definition justified ? in the interest of human dignity and in the interest of freedom and security in the world , i would add that is in germany 's interest .
that may sound generalized , but it can be more precise .
if we are unable to offer people in afghanistan an alternative to poppy-growing , where they supply practically the entire world with drugs , then deploying all those soldiers there is useless .
so a political solution must always accompany a military mission . so in addition to the military deployment , we have to think much more intensely about social structures there , with participation by the european union .
in darfur , where women are being raped , and human suffering is everywhere , it 's not a place where we can stay away - if the bundeswehr is capable of involvement - on moral or ethical grounds .
anyone who goes into congo to monitor elections should have strong arguments for not going into darfur . so you 're in favor of an engagement , of a bundeswehr mission to darfur ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african union said it could provide enough troops to protect darfur the first question is does the bundeswehr have the capacity to take part in what maybe action in darfur .
and the second reason is a moral question for me - the responsibility to protect is one of the important points of foreign policy in our times .
we see worldwide that there are governments who do not like to protect their own people , and though it is a responsibility for the community of democratic nations , with a legitimate mandate from the united nations to protect people , that 's a main reason for me to advocate participation of the bundeswehr if the bundeswehr is capable of doing so . can the bundeswehr do that ? if it can , then we should not stand on the sidelines .
my moral justification for that does n't exist in a vacuum of course - we have to know if the bundeswehr can do it , if it has the capacities to get involved .
and who else would take part ?
all of that has not yet been answered .
but if there is a special humane reason to protect people , then darfur is an important place for it . why do you think then that the german government is being so reticent about committing troops to darfur ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suffering of sudan 's refugees needs to be made clear to germans , gerhardt said i believe the government has a hard time with this rejection .
for moral and ethical reasons , it must realize this responsibility to protect , when human rights are discussed , for instance in the united nations .
we have to clear all the deployment mandates and all the soldiers we have worldwide .
we have to ask ourselves what is the reason , what is the aim , where is the escape , is the task fulfilled ? we had a mission in congo , it was not a mission i would like to have .
it was for one day , or two days , we left congo and nothing is better there .
we have been in afghanistan for years , we have n't given the people an alternative for social security ; we have only deployed soldiers .
we have to fulfill mandates but not only with soldiers .
we have been looking on for years at the rape in darfur , at the brutality in darfur and we know that the government of sudan is not able to protect the people there . given the low support in germany for foreign peacekeeping missions , how will you sell this mission to darfur ? every conflict has a variety of reasons - the agricultural structure in the region , the ethnic split in this region .
but at the end of the day you have to convince people in which world we would like to live , and what is security for the federal republic of germany , and what are the necessary steps to protect europe .
if we are not able to calm conflicts in worldwide hotspots , we can not contribute to security policy in europe . dw-tv 's christopher springate interviewed wolfgang gerhardt -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin fashion week recently featured " green living " in all its sexy , multi-colored glory .
eco-clothing has broken free of the " grim ethics of sacrifice " that defined the 1980s . europe 's fashionistas can now wear organic cotton and still make it past the bouncers .
spectacular growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just for hippies organic cotton is forecast to have an annual growth rate of 116 percent between 2006 and 2008 and to reach $ 2.6 billion -lrb- 1.9 billion euros -rrb- in global retail sales , according to an organic exchange 's cotton market report .
globally , the organic cotton market is evenly split between europe and the united states .
german consumers led europe 's organic cotton demand in the 1990s , with mail order companies such as hess natur making it a cornerstone of its strategy .
demand in great britain and france is quickly eclipsing germany , said damien sanfilippo , cotton project officer for the pesticide action network -lrb- pan . -rrb-
he estimates that three out of every four high street retailers in the britain now offer organic cotton products , nearly all of them since 2003 .
eco-chic in the big leagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers benefit from organic cotton organic cotton clothing lines are showing up both in europe 's high-end fashion boutiques and stores for the masses such as h & m and zara .
last year swedish-based h & m used 30 tons of organic cotton .
this year it expects to use 1,100 tons .
the organic clothing lines are selling so well that the company has expanded it to be available in all departments , including men 's clothing , said karolina dubowicz , a project leader in h & m 's press relations department .
customers have shown they 'll buy organic if the clothes look good and are priced right , she said .
using organic cotton is part of the company 's corporate responsibility plan .
" we do a lot of things to contribute to a better environment , " dubowicz said .
" this is one of the ways that we do this .
it 's an investment in a better environment . "
inditex , the spanish retail giant which owns zara , announced a green strategy which will slash energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions in the upcoming years .
zara , famous for bringing the latest trends to market quickly and inexpensively , sells organic cotton t-shirt for about 10 euros .
too good to be true ?

many consumers feel an organic peach is healthier than a conventional one and will spend the extra money to buy it .
and retailers in germany are finding that many shoppers are willing to do the same for clothes , according to simon ferrigno of the organic exchange , a nonprofit trade association working to expand the use of organically-grown cotton .
but consumers only experience a health benefit if the cotton is processed in an environmentally friendly way without harsh chemicals , said katharina schaus , a garment engineer who founded the german company it fits .
schaus has helped develop standards that allow companies to certify the entire process as organic .
most retailers want to label the entire product , not just the cotton , as organic , she said .
h & m uses the same techniques and dyes for all its cotton , which dubowicz said is strictly regulated to make sure it poses no risk to consumers ' health .
fickle fashion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are often recruited to help with the cotton harvest there has been some concern as cotton has become big business that some of the gains organic farmers have made will be lost .
" now that the big retailers are involved , they have a way to do business which is a different way than the specialized organic cotton companies , " said sanfilippo of pan .
" we hope that they 'll promote organic agriculture overall . "
while this year 's obsession with african prints will be in next year 's trash bins , organic cotton seems to have staying power . companies have shown long-term commitment to organic cotton by making big changes to their supply chains , experts said . " it 's for the long term , " ferrigno said of the interest in organic cotton .

"
it was gul 's attempt to run for the presidency that triggered early parliamentary elections in july and saw prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's akp returned to power with a parliamentary majority .
millions protested bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-secular demonstrators with a portrait of turkey 's founder atatürk in april millions of people urged on by retired generals took to the streets in april and june to protest against the akp and the prospect of gül becoming president .
they objected to gül 's past involvement in conservative islamist groups , the fact that his wife wears an islamic-style headscarf - no president 's wife in turkey has ever worn one - and also at the prospect of the akp controlling the government , the parliament and presidency .
gül 's original attempt failed thanks to a boycott of the presidential vote by opposition parties . " if gul is elected , turkey 's political balances will change , " deniz baykal , head of the main opposition republican people 's party , was quoted as saying in the radikal newspaper .
" turkey will be transformed into a country with an overbearing religious and middle eastern identity . "
after a late-night warning from the military that it would do whatever necessary to protect secularism , the constitutional court ruled that at least two-thirds of deputies in the parliament must be present for the vote to go ahead .

but is often criticized for lacking a consistent strategy , especially in afghanistan , where troops serve under three different mandates . the deployments are also stretching the bundeswehr , which is one of the reason 's chancellor merkel 's coalition gave for waving aside french president nicolas sarkozy 's call for european troops to protect refugees from darfur , according to the government . but many german parliamentarians consider the argument of depleted capacities an insufficient one .
they say this mission is necessary , precisely because it is a humanitarian one . at the same time , they want a debate about which missions the bundeswehr should take part in , and which should have priority . deutsche welle : mr. gerhardt , considering the drop in public acceptance of foreign peacekeeping missions , is there - at the least - a problem of communication between politicians and the people ?
is n't it time for a general debate on the purpose of the individual missions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang gerhardt wolfgang gerhard : yes .
as a government , or as a member of parliament or the opposition , each day you have to justify to society why you mobilize soldiers .
you have to have clear criteria .
and you have to go into this debate convincingly , with political leadership .
the security of our country is threatened by places in the world where there are problems , and it can only be ensured if we , along with other democratic nations , and with united nations mandates , can to some degree calm the world 's hot spots . but the priorities are also unclear .
some say the missions must be in germany 's interest .
is that definition justified ? in the interest of human dignity and in the interest of freedom and security in the world , i would add that is in germany 's interest .
that may sound generalized , but it can be more precise .
if we are unable to offer people in afghanistan an alternative to poppy-growing , where they supply practically the entire world with drugs , then deploying all those soldiers there is useless .
so a political solution must always accompany a military mission . so in addition to the military deployment , we have to think much more intensely about social structures there , with participation by the european union .
in darfur , where women are being raped , and human suffering is everywhere , it 's not a place where we can stay away - if the bundeswehr is capable of involvement - on moral or ethical grounds .
anyone who goes into congo to monitor elections should have strong arguments for not going into darfur . so you 're in favor of an engagement , of a bundeswehr mission to darfur ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african union said it could provide enough troops to protect darfur the first question is does the bundeswehr have the capacity to take part in what maybe action in darfur .
and the second reason is a moral question for me - the responsibility to protect is one of the important points of foreign policy in our times .
we see worldwide that there are governments who do not like to protect their own people , and though it is a responsibility for the community of democratic nations , with a legitimate mandate from the united nations to protect people , that 's a main reason for me to advocate participation of the bundeswehr if the bundeswehr is capable of doing so . can the bundeswehr do that ? if it can , then we should not stand on the sidelines .
my moral justification for that does n't exist in a vacuum of course - we have to know if the bundeswehr can do it , if it has the capacities to get involved .
and who else would take part ?
all of that has not yet been answered .
but if there is a special humane reason to protect people , then darfur is an important place for it . why do you think then that the german government is being so reticent about committing troops to darfur ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suffering of sudan 's refugees needs to be made clear to germans , gerhardt said i believe the government has a hard time with this rejection .
for moral and ethical reasons , it must realize this responsibility to protect , when human rights are discussed , for instance in the united nations .
we have to clear all the deployment mandates and all the soldiers we have worldwide .
we have to ask ourselves what is the reason , what is the aim , where is the escape , is the task fulfilled ? we had a mission in congo , it was not a mission i would like to have .
it was for one day , or two days , we left congo and nothing is better there .
we have been in afghanistan for years , we have n't given the people an alternative for social security ; we have only deployed soldiers .
we have to fulfill mandates but not only with soldiers .
we have been looking on for years at the rape in darfur , at the brutality in darfur and we know that the government of sudan is not able to protect the people there . given the low support in germany for foreign peacekeeping missions , how will you sell this mission to darfur ? every conflict has a variety of reasons - the agricultural structure in the region , the ethnic split in this region .
but at the end of the day you have to convince people in which world we would like to live , and what is security for the federal republic of germany , and what are the necessary steps to protect europe .
if we are not able to calm conflicts in worldwide hotspots , we can not contribute to security policy in europe . dw-tv 's christopher springate interviewed wolfgang gerhardt -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts say a decline in construction is to blame . the seasonally-adjusted figure released by officials at the federal statistics office on tuesday came in well below the 0.5-percent growth in gross domestic product recorded in the first quarter .
exports continued to provide most of the impetus , although there were also indications of growing domestic expenditure .
domestic investment in machines and equipment rose significantly , while construction declined . " economic growth was based especially on the highly dynamic foreign trade , " the statistical office said , adding that domestic demand had made a " positive , though smaller contribution to growth . "
past the peak financial analysts said they were disappointed with the growth , adding that they had expected a slightly higher figure of 0.4 percent .
" a few weeks ago , we thought that it was going to be significantly stronger because of the good mood among companies and the labor market situation , " dirk schumacher of goldman sachs told reuters news service .
he added that the dip should be seen as a slip-up and that growth would again pick up in the third quarter .
" but we 've definitely surpassed the growth peak , " he added .
strong 2006 revised figures for 2006 meanwhile indicated that the economy grew faster than previously announced , with growth for the full year coming in at 2.9 percent , against the 2.8 percent previously reported .
government officials are forecasting growth of 2.3 percent in 2007 . article based on news reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case was brought by a 52-year-old secondary school teacher , who said she would appeal tuesday 's ruling .

the case was brought by a 52-year-old secondary school teacher , who said she would appeal tuesday 's ruling .
the teacher had argued that her headscarf was a " fashion accessory à la grace kelly " that was in line with christian-occidental values .
the judges did not accept the argument , pointing out that since the teacher always wore the scarf , it was a symbol of her religous beliefs .
authorities in north rhine-westphalia imposed a ban on headscarves in june 2006 .
a similar ban was introduced in the southern state of bavaria in 2005 with the aim of protecting children from the influence of islamic fundamentalists .
rules vary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german flag as headscarf headscarves are banned in eight of germany 's 16 states , but laws vary about other headdress .
after the headscarf prohibition came into effect in june 2006 in north rhine-westphalia , one teacher appeared at school wearing a beret .
a court said the beret fell under the headscarf rule and asked the teacher to consider wearing a wig instead , which she refused .
in bavaria , on the other hand , teachers may wear hats in school .
at an administrative court in stuttgart in the state of baden-württemburg , judges in july 2006 reversed an earlier decision .
there , muslim teachers may now wear headscarves since nuns are also permitted to wear their habits in public schools . article based on news reports -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

reinhard grindel , of the chrisitian democrats - part of the government 's ruling coalition - said the review of the stasi documents should not be left up to the " birthler authority , " the unofficial name given to the government office , headed by marianne birthler , responsible for researching the history of the gdr 's stasi .
grindel said the mistakes made regarding the recent resurfacing of documents about the " shoot-to-kill " policy of the stasi at the berlin wall showed that the responsibility for the investigation of such texts should be given to a research association , to which the birthler office should belong .
" it is now clear that the processing of these documents should not be exclusively left up to the birthler authority , " grindel told broadcaster rbb .
grindel also recommended that the stasi document office be integrated into the german federal archives in koblenz .
dietmar bartsch of the left party called the stasi document office 's work " ahistorical and unscientific . " merging offices bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler , stasi archive commissioner german culture secretary bernd neumann , a member of chancellor angela merkel 's christian democratic union , also said that in the mid-term the birthler office should be integrated into the federal archives .
he added that his party continued to find the office 's work important and worth supporting . birthler has had to deflect criticism over the past few days that she made the announcement of the stasi " shoot-to-kill " policy just days before the 46th anniversary of the start of the construction of the berlin wall .
some have accused her of " sensationalizing " information to gain attention for her office , particularly because the data had already surfaced 10 years ago in a scientific journal .
klaus schroeder , of the research center " sed-staat " at the university of berlin , told the daily leipziger volkszeitung that birthler " without doing thorough research beforehand , left herself get caught up in the idea of announcing information that made it appear like an historically new , sensational discovery .

but times , it seems , have changed , and suddenly germany - and berlin in particular - is a moving-making magnet . tom 's controversial role from brangelina to tom cruise and matt damon to nicole kidman , berlin locations have been pulling in hollywood stars more and more regularly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise plays claus schenk von stauffenberg cruise has been staying in the city with his wife , katie holmes , and daughter suri during the shooting of the war movie " valkyrie " at locations in berlin and brandenburg , the eastern state that surrounds the capital city . the actor has stirred controversy , not only because of his famed devotion to scientology , but also his role in the movie about a key figure in the german resistance against adolf hitler .
cruise plays colonel count claus schenk von stauffenberg in the film , about stauffenberg 's failed bomb-plot bid to kill hitler on july 20 , 1944 .
the plot led to the colonel 's arrest and execution by firing squad in the courtyard of the bendlerblock , the current german army 's headquarters in berlin .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : babelsberg says its undergoing a renaissance " last year we had just one full length feature , " she said .
carl woebcken , managing director of studio babelsberg motion pictures , said that despite doubling the studio capacity in 2005 , they have had to rent extra studio space in order to cope with the demand from international productions .
while the current rush of business is more than welcome , the number of films produced there in babelsberg in the past few years is a far cry from the studio 's heyday in the late 1920s , when it was hollywood 's strongest competitor .
back then , the studio pumped out almost 600 films a year , including classics such as fritz lang 's " metropolis " -lrb- 1927 -rrb- , and the 1930 josef von sternberg feature " blue angel , " which gave marlene dietrich her debut .
projects in the pipeline besides " valkyrie " , other films in progress at babelsberg this year include director tom tykwer 's " the international , " starring clive owen and naomi watts ; jan de bont 's thriller " stopping point , " with actor john cusack ; " mr.nobody , " starring jared leto ; and " speed racer , " a $ 53 million warner brothers production .

but times , it seems , have changed , and suddenly germany - and berlin in particular - is a moving-making magnet . tom 's controversial role from brangelina to tom cruise and matt damon to nicole kidman , berlin locations have been pulling in hollywood stars more and more regularly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise plays claus schenk von stauffenberg cruise has been staying in the city with his wife , katie holmes , and daughter suri during the shooting of the war movie " valkyrie " at locations in berlin and brandenburg , the eastern state that surrounds the capital city . the actor has stirred controversy , not only because of his famed devotion to scientology , but also his role in the movie about a key figure in the german resistance against adolf hitler .
cruise plays colonel count claus schenk von stauffenberg in the film , about stauffenberg 's failed bomb-plot bid to kill hitler on july 20 , 1944 .
the plot led to the colonel 's arrest and execution by firing squad in the courtyard of the bendlerblock , the current german army 's headquarters in berlin .
besides cruise , who has been tracked by paparazzi since his arrival in the capital , the actors kenneth branagh , bill nighy , tom wilkinson , eddie izzard , cristian berkel , thomas kretschmann and carice van houten belong to the cast .
' amazing ' period of growth " our studios are presently at full capacity , " eike wolf , a spokesperson at babelsberg , said of the berlin film boom .
" it 's amazing .
it 's the busiest period we 've experienced since the studios were privatized in 1992 . "
wolf said by the end of the year babelsberg will have handled a " record " 11 productions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : babelsberg says its undergoing a renaissance " last year we had just one full length feature , " she said .
carl woebcken , managing director of studio babelsberg motion pictures , said that despite doubling the studio capacity in 2005 , they have had to rent extra studio space in order to cope with the demand from international productions .
while the current rush of business is more than welcome , the number of films produced there in babelsberg in the past few years is a far cry from the studio 's heyday in the late 1920s , when it was hollywood 's strongest competitor .
back then , the studio pumped out almost 600 films a year , including classics such as fritz lang 's " metropolis " -lrb- 1927 -rrb- , and the 1930 josef von sternberg feature " blue angel , " which gave marlene dietrich her debut .
projects in the pipeline besides " valkyrie " , other films in progress at babelsberg this year include director tom tykwer 's " the international , " starring clive owen and naomi watts ; jan de bont 's thriller " stopping point , " with actor john cusack ; " mr.nobody , " starring jared leto ; and " speed racer , " a $ 53 million warner brothers production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich got her start in german film 's heyday in the pipeline for babelsberg are " the reader " , starring tom cruise 's ex-wife nicole kidman , and oscar prize-winning director caroline link 's " a year of winter " with corinna harfouch and karoline herfurth .
another berlin project is german producer bernd eichinger 's " the baader-meinhof complex " , starring german actor moritz bleibtreu as modern radical andreas baader .
the movie tackles an explosive period in germany 's post-war history when a group of urban terrorists known as the baader-meinhof gang , or red army faction , staged a series of murders , robberies and kidnappings during the 1970s and early 80s . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts say a decline in construction is to blame . the seasonally-adjusted figure released by officials at the federal statistics office on tuesday came in well below the 0.5-percent growth in gross domestic product recorded in the first quarter .
exports continued to provide most of the impetus , although there were also indications of growing domestic expenditure .
domestic investment in machines and equipment rose significantly , while construction declined . " economic growth was based especially on the highly dynamic foreign trade , " the statistical office said , adding that domestic demand had made a " positive , though smaller contribution to growth . "
past the peak financial analysts said they were disappointed with the growth , adding that they had expected a slightly higher figure of 0.4 percent .
" a few weeks ago , we thought that it was going to be significantly stronger because of the good mood among companies and the labor market situation , " dirk schumacher of goldman sachs told reuters news service .
he added that the dip should be seen as a slip-up and that growth would again pick up in the third quarter .
" but we 've definitely surpassed the growth peak , " he added .
strong 2006 revised figures for 2006 meanwhile indicated that the economy grew faster than previously announced , with growth for the full year coming in at 2.9 percent , against the 2.8 percent previously reported .
government officials are forecasting growth of 2.3 percent in 2007 . article based on news reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nearly 2 million toys sold in britain and ireland were being recalled due to concerns linked to small magnetic toys .
recalls of thousands of toys were also confirmed in the netherlands , belgium and luxembourg . a total of 18.2 million toys around the world are being recalled , the company said . the european commission , which oversees consumer safety across the european union , said it had not been notified of any recalls under rapex , the bloc 's rapid alert system under which countries must immediately report any cases of unsafe products . us toy market badly hit more than 9 million of the toys , which include barbie and batman figures , are being recalled in the united states and canada , and the rest in other countries , mattel said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some sesame street characters too are being recalled in the us the recalls - the second this month - have also hit mattel toys in america .
more than 250,000 jeep-like toy cars sold as promotional products for the animated film cars were recalled because they contain more lead than us rules allow . mattel also recalled about 1 million fisher-price brand toys , including some sesame street characters , on august 1 because of lead paint . " i 'm deeply apologetic to everyone affected , " mattel chief executive bob eckert said in a videotaped statement .
" we 'll continue to enforce ... the highest level of quality and safety . " if children swallow or inhale several magnets , the parts could bond inside the body and block or injure the intestine , said nancy nord , head of the us government 's consumer product safety commission . most of the recall , 7.3 million items , involves polly pocket doll sets .
in november , mattel recalled 2.4 million of the toy sets in the us and canada after three reports of serious injuries to children who swallowed more than one magnet .
the children , aged two to eight , suffered intestinal perforations that required surgery , the government said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are worries about the amounts of lead in some of the chinese-made toys mattel has stepped up testing of paint and finished toys at its vendors since the november recall , eckert said .
the company has also developed ways to attach magnets more firmly , he said . chinese-made products take battering problems with chinese products , including tainted pet food , seafood for human consumption and toothpaste , have generated bad publicity in the united states and europe in recent months and underscored consumers ' dependence on competitively priced imports from china . the food scandals in particular have led to calls in the us for tighter supervision of chinese imports .
chinese authorities say they have taken steps to boost product safety . last week , the co-owner of a chinese toymaker killed himself after products from his plant were included in the fisher-price recall . in july , china executed the former head of its state food and drug administration after convicting him of corruption .
he reportedly took bribes from companies to certify drugs that were not fully tested . article based on news reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de peacekeeping -pipe- 14.08.2007 politician wants more german help for darfur großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 300,000 people have been killed and 2 million displaced in darfur since 2003 wolfgang gerhard , foreign policy advisor for the opposition free-market liberal fdp , spoke to deutsche welle about german concerns regarding international peacekeeping missions and why germany 's army should be in darfur . at present the german army , the bundeswehr , is taking part in nine missions abroad .
but is often criticized for lacking a consistent strategy , especially in afghanistan , where troops serve under three different mandates . the deployments are also stretching the bundeswehr , which is one of the reason 's chancellor merkel 's coalition gave for waving aside french president nicolas sarkozy 's call for european troops to protect refugees from darfur , according to the government . but many german parliamentarians consider the argument of depleted capacities an insufficient one .
they say this mission is necessary , precisely because it is a humanitarian one . at the same time , they want a debate about which missions the bundeswehr should take part in , and which should have priority . deutsche welle : mr. gerhardt , considering the drop in public acceptance of foreign peacekeeping missions , is there - at the least - a problem of communication between politicians and the people ?
is n't it time for a general debate on the purpose of the individual missions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang gerhardt wolfgang gerhard : yes .
as a government , or as a member of parliament or the opposition , each day you have to justify to society why you mobilize soldiers .
you have to have clear criteria .
and you have to go into this debate convincingly , with political leadership .
the security of our country is threatened by places in the world where there are problems , and it can only be ensured if we , along with other democratic nations , and with united nations mandates , can to some degree calm the world 's hot spots . but the priorities are also unclear .
some say the missions must be in germany 's interest .
is that definition justified ? in the interest of human dignity and in the interest of freedom and security in the world , i would add that is in germany 's interest .
that may sound generalized , but it can be more precise .
if we are unable to offer people in afghanistan an alternative to poppy-growing , where they supply practically the entire world with drugs , then deploying all those soldiers there is useless .
so a political solution must always accompany a military mission . so in addition to the military deployment , we have to think much more intensely about social structures there , with participation by the european union .
in darfur , where women are being raped , and human suffering is everywhere , it 's not a place where we can stay away - if the bundeswehr is capable of involvement - on moral or ethical grounds .
anyone who goes into congo to monitor elections should have strong arguments for not going into darfur . so you 're in favor of an engagement , of a bundeswehr mission to darfur ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african union said it could provide enough troops to protect darfur the first question is does the bundeswehr have the capacity to take part in what maybe action in darfur .
and the second reason is a moral question for me - the responsibility to protect is one of the important points of foreign policy in our times .
we see worldwide that there are governments who do not like to protect their own people , and though it is a responsibility for the community of democratic nations , with a legitimate mandate from the united nations to protect people , that 's a main reason for me to advocate participation of the bundeswehr if the bundeswehr is capable of doing so . can the bundeswehr do that ? if it can , then we should not stand on the sidelines .
my moral justification for that does n't exist in a vacuum of course - we have to know if the bundeswehr can do it , if it has the capacities to get involved .
and who else would take part ?
all of that has not yet been answered .
but if there is a special humane reason to protect people , then darfur is an important place for it . why do you think then that the german government is being so reticent about committing troops to darfur ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suffering of sudan 's refugees needs to be made clear to germans , gerhardt said i believe the government has a hard time with this rejection .
for moral and ethical reasons , it must realize this responsibility to protect , when human rights are discussed , for instance in the united nations .
we have to clear all the deployment mandates and all the soldiers we have worldwide .
we have to ask ourselves what is the reason , what is the aim , where is the escape , is the task fulfilled ? we had a mission in congo , it was not a mission i would like to have .
it was for one day , or two days , we left congo and nothing is better there .
we have been in afghanistan for years , we have n't given the people an alternative for social security ; we have only deployed soldiers .
we have to fulfill mandates but not only with soldiers .
we have been looking on for years at the rape in darfur , at the brutality in darfur and we know that the government of sudan is not able to protect the people there . given the low support in germany for foreign peacekeeping missions , how will you sell this mission to darfur ? every conflict has a variety of reasons - the agricultural structure in the region , the ethnic split in this region .
but at the end of the day you have to convince people in which world we would like to live , and what is security for the federal republic of germany , and what are the necessary steps to protect europe .
if we are not able to calm conflicts in worldwide hotspots , we can not contribute to security policy in europe . dw-tv 's christopher springate interviewed wolfgang gerhardt -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but is often criticized for lacking a consistent strategy , especially in afghanistan , where troops serve under three different mandates . the deployments are also stretching the bundeswehr , which is one of the reason 's chancellor merkel 's coalition gave for waving aside french president nicolas sarkozy 's call for european troops to protect refugees from darfur , according to the government . but many german parliamentarians consider the argument of depleted capacities an insufficient one .
they say this mission is necessary , precisely because it is a humanitarian one . at the same time , they want a debate about which missions the bundeswehr should take part in , and which should have priority . deutsche welle : mr. gerhardt , considering the drop in public acceptance of foreign peacekeeping missions , is there - at the least - a problem of communication between politicians and the people ?
is n't it time for a general debate on the purpose of the individual missions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang gerhardt wolfgang gerhard : yes .
as a government , or as a member of parliament or the opposition , each day you have to justify to society why you mobilize soldiers .
you have to have clear criteria .
and you have to go into this debate convincingly , with political leadership .
the security of our country is threatened by places in the world where there are problems , and it can only be ensured if we , along with other democratic nations , and with united nations mandates , can to some degree calm the world 's hot spots . but the priorities are also unclear .
some say the missions must be in germany 's interest .
is that definition justified ? in the interest of human dignity and in the interest of freedom and security in the world , i would add that is in germany 's interest .
that may sound generalized , but it can be more precise .
if we are unable to offer people in afghanistan an alternative to poppy-growing , where they supply practically the entire world with drugs , then deploying all those soldiers there is useless .
so a political solution must always accompany a military mission . so in addition to the military deployment , we have to think much more intensely about social structures there , with participation by the european union .
in darfur , where women are being raped , and human suffering is everywhere , it 's not a place where we can stay away - if the bundeswehr is capable of involvement - on moral or ethical grounds .
anyone who goes into congo to monitor elections should have strong arguments for not going into darfur . so you 're in favor of an engagement , of a bundeswehr mission to darfur ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african union said it could provide enough troops to protect darfur the first question is does the bundeswehr have the capacity to take part in what maybe action in darfur .
and the second reason is a moral question for me - the responsibility to protect is one of the important points of foreign policy in our times .
we see worldwide that there are governments who do not like to protect their own people , and though it is a responsibility for the community of democratic nations , with a legitimate mandate from the united nations to protect people , that 's a main reason for me to advocate participation of the bundeswehr if the bundeswehr is capable of doing so . can the bundeswehr do that ? if it can , then we should not stand on the sidelines .
my moral justification for that does n't exist in a vacuum of course - we have to know if the bundeswehr can do it , if it has the capacities to get involved .
and who else would take part ?
all of that has not yet been answered .
but if there is a special humane reason to protect people , then darfur is an important place for it . why do you think then that the german government is being so reticent about committing troops to darfur ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suffering of sudan 's refugees needs to be made clear to germans , gerhardt said i believe the government has a hard time with this rejection .
for moral and ethical reasons , it must realize this responsibility to protect , when human rights are discussed , for instance in the united nations .
we have to clear all the deployment mandates and all the soldiers we have worldwide .
we have to ask ourselves what is the reason , what is the aim , where is the escape , is the task fulfilled ? we had a mission in congo , it was not a mission i would like to have .
it was for one day , or two days , we left congo and nothing is better there .
we have been in afghanistan for years , we have n't given the people an alternative for social security ; we have only deployed soldiers .
we have to fulfill mandates but not only with soldiers .
we have been looking on for years at the rape in darfur , at the brutality in darfur and we know that the government of sudan is not able to protect the people there . given the low support in germany for foreign peacekeeping missions , how will you sell this mission to darfur ? every conflict has a variety of reasons - the agricultural structure in the region , the ethnic split in this region .
but at the end of the day you have to convince people in which world we would like to live , and what is security for the federal republic of germany , and what are the necessary steps to protect europe .
if we are not able to calm conflicts in worldwide hotspots , we can not contribute to security policy in europe . dw-tv 's christopher springate interviewed wolfgang gerhardt -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nearly 2 million toys sold in britain and ireland were being recalled due to concerns linked to small magnetic toys .
recalls of thousands of toys were also confirmed in the netherlands , belgium and luxembourg . a total of 18.2 million toys around the world are being recalled , the company said . the european commission , which oversees consumer safety across the european union , said it had not been notified of any recalls under rapex , the bloc 's rapid alert system under which countries must immediately report any cases of unsafe products . us toy market badly hit more than 9 million of the toys , which include barbie and batman figures , are being recalled in the united states and canada , and the rest in other countries , mattel said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some sesame street characters too are being recalled in the us the recalls - the second this month - have also hit mattel toys in america .
more than 250,000 jeep-like toy cars sold as promotional products for the animated film cars were recalled because they contain more lead than us rules allow . mattel also recalled about 1 million fisher-price brand toys , including some sesame street characters , on august 1 because of lead paint . " i 'm deeply apologetic to everyone affected , " mattel chief executive bob eckert said in a videotaped statement .
" we 'll continue to enforce ... the highest level of quality and safety . " if children swallow or inhale several magnets , the parts could bond inside the body and block or injure the intestine , said nancy nord , head of the us government 's consumer product safety commission . most of the recall , 7.3 million items , involves polly pocket doll sets .
in november , mattel recalled 2.4 million of the toy sets in the us and canada after three reports of serious injuries to children who swallowed more than one magnet .
the children , aged two to eight , suffered intestinal perforations that required surgery , the government said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are worries about the amounts of lead in some of the chinese-made toys mattel has stepped up testing of paint and finished toys at its vendors since the november recall , eckert said .
the company has also developed ways to attach magnets more firmly , he said . chinese-made products take battering problems with chinese products , including tainted pet food , seafood for human consumption and toothpaste , have generated bad publicity in the united states and europe in recent months and underscored consumers ' dependence on competitively priced imports from china . the food scandals in particular have led to calls in the us for tighter supervision of chinese imports .
chinese authorities say they have taken steps to boost product safety . last week , the co-owner of a chinese toymaker killed himself after products from his plant were included in the fisher-price recall . in july , china executed the former head of its state food and drug administration after convicting him of corruption .
he reportedly took bribes from companies to certify drugs that were not fully tested . article based on news reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case was brought by a 52-year-old secondary school teacher , who said she would appeal tuesday 's ruling .
the teacher had argued that her headscarf was a " fashion accessory à la grace kelly " that was in line with christian-occidental values .
the judges did not accept the argument , pointing out that since the teacher always wore the scarf , it was a symbol of her religous beliefs .
authorities in north rhine-westphalia imposed a ban on headscarves in june 2006 .
a similar ban was introduced in the southern state of bavaria in 2005 with the aim of protecting children from the influence of islamic fundamentalists .
rules vary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german flag as headscarf headscarves are banned in eight of germany 's 16 states , but laws vary about other headdress .
after the headscarf prohibition came into effect in june 2006 in north rhine-westphalia , one teacher appeared at school wearing a beret .
a court said the beret fell under the headscarf rule and asked the teacher to consider wearing a wig instead , which she refused .
in bavaria , on the other hand , teachers may wear hats in school .
at an administrative court in stuttgart in the state of baden-württemburg , judges in july 2006 reversed an earlier decision .
there , muslim teachers may now wear headscarves since nuns are also permitted to wear their habits in public schools . article based on news reports -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case was brought by a 52-year-old secondary school teacher , who said she would appeal tuesday 's ruling .
the teacher had argued that her headscarf was a " fashion accessory à la grace kelly " that was in line with christian-occidental values .
the judges did not accept the argument , pointing out that since the teacher always wore the scarf , it was a symbol of her religous beliefs .
authorities in north rhine-westphalia imposed a ban on headscarves in june 2006 .
a similar ban was introduced in the southern state of bavaria in 2005 with the aim of protecting children from the influence of islamic fundamentalists .
rules vary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german flag as headscarf headscarves are banned in eight of germany 's 16 states , but laws vary about other headdress .
after the headscarf prohibition came into effect in june 2006 in north rhine-westphalia , one teacher appeared at school wearing a beret .
a court said the beret fell under the headscarf rule and asked the teacher to consider wearing a wig instead , which she refused .
in bavaria , on the other hand , teachers may wear hats in school .
at an administrative court in stuttgart in the state of baden-württemburg , judges in july 2006 reversed an earlier decision .

in the 1990s , schirach defended günter schabowksi in a trial of high-ranking east german officials for their role in the killings of people who had attempted to flee across the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schirach -lrb- left -rrb- and schabowski during the trial schabowski , a member of the east german politburo who became famous for announcing the fall of the berlin wall , was convicted of manslaughter and accepted moral responsibility for the killings .
he was sentenced to three years in prison and pardoned after six months behind bars . schirach 's involvement in the case also made headlines because he is the grandson of baldur von schirach , the former leader of the nazi hitler youth , who was found guilty of crimes against humanity and served 20 years in prison . dw-world.de : what 's the significance of the resurfaced shoot-to-kill order ? ferdinand von schirach : it 's negligible .
it 's a document that 's been known for a long time to everyone involved , including the berlin state prosecutor 's office , which now claims that it has to investigate this again .
this piece of paper has no known author and no clear addressee .
it 's a simple piece of paper that could have been written by anyone and that will not hold up for convictions or even the initiation of a criminal investigation . of course you have to say - and that 's probably the best thing that can be said about this piece of paper - that it 's circumstantial evidence for the cruelty of the border fortifications and the guarding of the border .
but one should n't think that this is a piece of paper that the courts have been looking for for years and that places guilt on a certain person without a doubt or is able to describe the system as a whole . could you say then that it 's a historically interesting but legally irrelevant document ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler , the head of the agency that administers the stasi files it 's not irrelevant from a legal standpoint , because even circumstantial evidence is relevant .
it 's certainly interesting from a historic perspective , but it 's not unique - there were several of these documents . the thing that 's maybe interesting from a historic perspective is that the head of a federal agency has gone so far off the rails that she thinks that she can make policy with this on the anniversary of the construction of the wall .

-lrb- this week marked the 46th anniversary of the building of the berlin wall -rrb- there 's no other reason in my opinion .
the paper has been known , the state prosecutors received a number of such papers for investigations years ago , and none of them played any role in any of the trials .
it 's a little trite to say : i have now found the document that offers conclusive proof for everything . let 's take a step back and think about what this shoot-to-kill order actually means .
it meant that the gdr forcefully prevented its people from doing nothing more than trying to leave the country .
that 's what 's condemnable about this system and the courts ruled accordingly .

this clear-cut order was n't confirmed by any of the witnesses or any outsider .
it did not exist in a single document . it 's not a secret that these young border patrols shot at people and that many people died there .

the border patrols were put under oath every morning and had to swear on all sorts of orders that were given there .
for all intents and purposes , it did what 's written in this ominous paper , but no one in the gdr would have said something like this . several politicians have called for an investigation into possible legal action .

the frankfurt-based central bank has injected over 200 million euros into the financial system since thursday .
thanks in part to a several central banks intervening worldwide , t he ecb described conditions in the money market as now " close to normal . "
dw-world.de spoke with ulrich kater , of germany 's dekabank , who said that market participants underestimated risks involved in the us federal reserve bank 's low-interest-rate policies .
dw-world.de : the central banks have been massively pumping money into markets - in unheard of amounts since the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the us .
are the banks living up to their responsibilities , or is this a sign of a real crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich kater , of the dekabank ulrich kater : the central banks have a responsibility to ensure that the money markets can function .
if the demand for liquidity rises to a point that money markets can not satisfy , then it is clearly the obligation of the central banks to provide liquidity .
but one can see that the amounts the banks have pumped into the markets in this very short-term liquidity intervention have continually decreased ; that was already evident last week , although it was often portrayed differently .
that speaks to conditions on the markets that are getting back to normal . how much responsibility do the central banks carry in whether the financial markets continue to calm down , or whether there will be more panicked reactions ?
the central banks are simply the fundament on which the money markets are based .
the markets , however , are currently suffering from an intense phenomenon of the masses : even though trust in one 's business partner is the most important commodity on the markets , every market participant is under the general suspicion of not being able to live up to his promises .
the central banks are there to ease fears so that so that things will settle down .
i think confidence in the markets will return , especially given the basic economic data .
is n't there a risk that investors can now rely on the banks too much ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's up to central banks to make sure credit markets have the liquidity they need no .
the central banks have an obligation only for short-term interventions .
investors , on the other hand , plan months , quarters and years in advance .
in moments of crisis , everything always appears very dramatic , but at second glance , when the markets return to normal , the investors will also see that the basic economic figures are on track and that the global economy continues to be very dynamic .
how were things in the past ?
did the central banks , especially the federal reserve bank under alan greenspan at that time , always fulfill their obligations ?
could interest rate policies in the us have been one of the reasons for the current crisis ?
there were good reasons back then for lowering the interest rates so much .
the fed wanted to control the macro-economic consequences of the stock market bubble that burst in 2001 , and it managed to do that .
but now we are seeing the collateral damage of these interest rate policies .
the sense of danger among market participants became too sedated by the " medicine " of low interest rates .
in hindsight , it probably would have been better if the central banks had started raising their interest rates a year earlier .
but even central bank professionals do not have 20/20 vision for the future .
the lesson that should be learned from this is not to underestimate the danger of interest rates that are too low for loans .
the lack of liquidity on the global markets has also highlighted the interest policies of the bank of japan .
can we expect it to raise its rates , thus intensifying the crisis ?
even last year , japan 's central bank policies were slower to move than expected .
it is possible that , due to liquidity shortages on the markets , the bank of japan will postpone its plans for raising interest rates in august - perhaps just for a month .
but generally speaking , it will also be pushing for a normalization of economic policies and will have to raise interest rates . angela göpfert interviewed ulrich kater -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

are the banks living up to their responsibilities , or is this a sign of a real crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich kater , of the dekabank ulrich kater : the central banks have a responsibility to ensure that the money markets can function .
if the demand for liquidity rises to a point that money markets can not satisfy , then it is clearly the obligation of the central banks to provide liquidity .
but one can see that the amounts the banks have pumped into the markets in this very short-term liquidity intervention have continually decreased ; that was already evident last week , although it was often portrayed differently .
that speaks to conditions on the markets that are getting back to normal . how much responsibility do the central banks carry in whether the financial markets continue to calm down , or whether there will be more panicked reactions ?
the central banks are simply the fundament on which the money markets are based .
the markets , however , are currently suffering from an intense phenomenon of the masses : even though trust in one 's business partner is the most important commodity on the markets , every market participant is under the general suspicion of not being able to live up to his promises .
the central banks are there to ease fears so that so that things will settle down .
i think confidence in the markets will return , especially given the basic economic data .
is n't there a risk that investors can now rely on the banks too much ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's up to central banks to make sure credit markets have the liquidity they need no .
the central banks have an obligation only for short-term interventions .
investors , on the other hand , plan months , quarters and years in advance .
in moments of crisis , everything always appears very dramatic , but at second glance , when the markets return to normal , the investors will also see that the basic economic figures are on track and that the global economy continues to be very dynamic .
how were things in the past ?
did the central banks , especially the federal reserve bank under alan greenspan at that time , always fulfill their obligations ?
could interest rate policies in the us have been one of the reasons for the current crisis ?
there were good reasons back then for lowering the interest rates so much .
the fed wanted to control the macro-economic consequences of the stock market bubble that burst in 2001 , and it managed to do that .
but now we are seeing the collateral damage of these interest rate policies .
the sense of danger among market participants became too sedated by the " medicine " of low interest rates .
in hindsight , it probably would have been better if the central banks had started raising their interest rates a year earlier .
but even central bank professionals do not have 20/20 vision for the future .
the lesson that should be learned from this is not to underestimate the danger of interest rates that are too low for loans .
the lack of liquidity on the global markets has also highlighted the interest policies of the bank of japan .
can we expect it to raise its rates , thus intensifying the crisis ?
even last year , japan 's central bank policies were slower to move than expected .
it is possible that , due to liquidity shortages on the markets , the bank of japan will postpone its plans for raising interest rates in august - perhaps just for a month .
but generally speaking , it will also be pushing for a normalization of economic policies and will have to raise interest rates . angela göpfert interviewed ulrich kater -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but even central bank professionals do not have 20/20 vision for the future .
the lesson that should be learned from this is not to underestimate the danger of interest rates that are too low for loans .
the lack of liquidity on the global markets has also highlighted the interest policies of the bank of japan .
can we expect it to raise its rates , thus intensifying the crisis ?
even last year , japan 's central bank policies were slower to move than expected .
it is possible that , due to liquidity shortages on the markets , the bank of japan will postpone its plans for raising interest rates in august - perhaps just for a month .

the case was brought by a 52-year-old secondary school teacher , who said she would appeal tuesday 's ruling .
the teacher had argued that her headscarf was a " fashion accessory à la grace kelly " that was in line with christian-occidental values .
the judges did not accept the argument , pointing out that since the teacher always wore the scarf , it was a symbol of her religous beliefs .
authorities in north rhine-westphalia imposed a ban on headscarves in june 2006 .
a similar ban was introduced in the southern state of bavaria in 2005 with the aim of protecting children from the influence of islamic fundamentalists .

after the headscarf prohibition came into effect in june 2006 in north rhine-westphalia , one teacher appeared at school wearing a beret .
a court said the beret fell under the headscarf rule and asked the teacher to consider wearing a wig instead , which she refused .

reinhard grindel , of the chrisitian democrats - part of the government 's ruling coalition - said the review of the stasi documents should not be left up to the " birthler authority , " the unofficial name given to the government office , headed by marianne birthler , responsible for researching the history of the gdr 's stasi .
grindel said the mistakes made regarding the recent resurfacing of documents about the " shoot-to-kill " policy of the stasi at the berlin wall showed that the responsibility for the investigation of such texts should be given to a research association , to which the birthler office should belong .
" it is now clear that the processing of these documents should not be exclusively left up to the birthler authority , " grindel told broadcaster rbb .

some have accused her of " sensationalizing " information to gain attention for her office , particularly because the data had already surfaced 10 years ago in a scientific journal .
klaus schroeder , of the research center " sed-staat " at the university of berlin , told the daily leipziger volkszeitung that birthler " without doing thorough research beforehand , left herself get caught up in the idea of announcing information that made it appear like an historically new , sensational discovery .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 14.08.2007 in berlin , the stars are out - and filmmaking is back in großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is once again becoming a popular film location although it is still nowhere near the production levels of the 1920s , german film industry officials say movie making in the berlin is undergoing a renaissance . for decades , germany has had a hard time persuading international moviemakers to shoot their films in the country.even after the nation was reunited in 1989 , hollywood directors were slow to develop projects in berlin , munich or , for that matter , at the famous babelsberg film studios in potsdam , outside berlin .
but times , it seems , have changed , and suddenly germany - and berlin in particular - is a moving-making magnet . tom 's controversial role from brangelina to tom cruise and matt damon to nicole kidman , berlin locations have been pulling in hollywood stars more and more regularly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise plays claus schenk von stauffenberg cruise has been staying in the city with his wife , katie holmes , and daughter suri during the shooting of the war movie " valkyrie " at locations in berlin and brandenburg , the eastern state that surrounds the capital city . the actor has stirred controversy , not only because of his famed devotion to scientology , but also his role in the movie about a key figure in the german resistance against adolf hitler .
cruise plays colonel count claus schenk von stauffenberg in the film , about stauffenberg 's failed bomb-plot bid to kill hitler on july 20 , 1944 .
the plot led to the colonel 's arrest and execution by firing squad in the courtyard of the bendlerblock , the current german army 's headquarters in berlin .
besides cruise , who has been tracked by paparazzi since his arrival in the capital , the actors kenneth branagh , bill nighy , tom wilkinson , eddie izzard , cristian berkel , thomas kretschmann and carice van houten belong to the cast .
' amazing ' period of growth " our studios are presently at full capacity , " eike wolf , a spokesperson at babelsberg , said of the berlin film boom .
" it 's amazing .
it 's the busiest period we 've experienced since the studios were privatized in 1992 . "
wolf said by the end of the year babelsberg will have handled a " record " 11 productions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : babelsberg says its undergoing a renaissance " last year we had just one full length feature , " she said .
carl woebcken , managing director of studio babelsberg motion pictures , said that despite doubling the studio capacity in 2005 , they have had to rent extra studio space in order to cope with the demand from international productions .
while the current rush of business is more than welcome , the number of films produced there in babelsberg in the past few years is a far cry from the studio 's heyday in the late 1920s , when it was hollywood 's strongest competitor .
back then , the studio pumped out almost 600 films a year , including classics such as fritz lang 's " metropolis " -lrb- 1927 -rrb- , and the 1930 josef von sternberg feature " blue angel , " which gave marlene dietrich her debut .
projects in the pipeline besides " valkyrie " , other films in progress at babelsberg this year include director tom tykwer 's " the international , " starring clive owen and naomi watts ; jan de bont 's thriller " stopping point , " with actor john cusack ; " mr.nobody , " starring jared leto ; and " speed racer , " a $ 53 million warner brothers production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich got her start in german film 's heyday in the pipeline for babelsberg are " the reader " , starring tom cruise 's ex-wife nicole kidman , and oscar prize-winning director caroline link 's " a year of winter " with corinna harfouch and karoline herfurth .
another berlin project is german producer bernd eichinger 's " the baader-meinhof complex " , starring german actor moritz bleibtreu as modern radical andreas baader .
the movie tackles an explosive period in germany 's post-war history when a group of urban terrorists known as the baader-meinhof gang , or red army faction , staged a series of murders , robberies and kidnappings during the 1970s and early 80s . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this year it expects to use 1,100 tons .
the organic clothing lines are selling so well that the company has expanded it to be available in all departments , including men 's clothing , said karolina dubowicz , a project leader in h & m 's press relations department .
customers have shown they 'll buy organic if the clothes look good and are priced right , she said .
using organic cotton is part of the company 's corporate responsibility plan .
" we do a lot of things to contribute to a better environment , " dubowicz said .
" this is one of the ways that we do this .
it 's an investment in a better environment . "
inditex , the spanish retail giant which owns zara , announced a green strategy which will slash energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions in the upcoming years .

and retailers in germany are finding that many shoppers are willing to do the same for clothes , according to simon ferrigno of the organic exchange , a nonprofit trade association working to expand the use of organically-grown cotton .
but consumers only experience a health benefit if the cotton is processed in an environmentally friendly way without harsh chemicals , said katharina schaus , a garment engineer who founded the german company it fits .
schaus has helped develop standards that allow companies to certify the entire process as organic .
most retailers want to label the entire product , not just the cotton , as organic , she said .
h & m uses the same techniques and dyes for all its cotton , which dubowicz said is strictly regulated to make sure it poses no risk to consumers ' health .
fickle fashion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are often recruited to help with the cotton harvest there has been some concern as cotton has become big business that some of the gains organic farmers have made will be lost .
" now that the big retailers are involved , they have a way to do business which is a different way than the specialized organic cotton companies , " said sanfilippo of pan .
" we hope that they 'll promote organic agriculture overall . "
while this year 's obsession with african prints will be in next year 's trash bins , organic cotton seems to have staying power . companies have shown long-term commitment to organic cotton by making big changes to their supply chains , experts said . " it 's for the long term , " ferrigno said of the interest in organic cotton .

a similar ban was introduced in the southern state of bavaria in 2005 with the aim of protecting children from the influence of islamic fundamentalists .
rules vary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german flag as headscarf headscarves are banned in eight of germany 's 16 states , but laws vary about other headdress .
after the headscarf prohibition came into effect in june 2006 in north rhine-westphalia , one teacher appeared at school wearing a beret .
a court said the beret fell under the headscarf rule and asked the teacher to consider wearing a wig instead , which she refused .
in bavaria , on the other hand , teachers may wear hats in school .
at an administrative court in stuttgart in the state of baden-württemburg , judges in july 2006 reversed an earlier decision .
there , muslim teachers may now wear headscarves since nuns are also permitted to wear their habits in public schools . article based on news reports -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts say a decline in construction is to blame . the seasonally-adjusted figure released by officials at the federal statistics office on tuesday came in well below the 0.5-percent growth in gross domestic product recorded in the first quarter .
exports continued to provide most of the impetus , although there were also indications of growing domestic expenditure .
domestic investment in machines and equipment rose significantly , while construction declined . " economic growth was based especially on the highly dynamic foreign trade , " the statistical office said , adding that domestic demand had made a " positive , though smaller contribution to growth . "
past the peak financial analysts said they were disappointed with the growth , adding that they had expected a slightly higher figure of 0.4 percent .
" a few weeks ago , we thought that it was going to be significantly stronger because of the good mood among companies and the labor market situation , " dirk schumacher of goldman sachs told reuters news service .
he added that the dip should be seen as a slip-up and that growth would again pick up in the third quarter .
" but we 've definitely surpassed the growth peak , " he added .
strong 2006 revised figures for 2006 meanwhile indicated that the economy grew faster than previously announced , with growth for the full year coming in at 2.9 percent , against the 2.8 percent previously reported .
government officials are forecasting growth of 2.3 percent in 2007 . article based on news reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the frankfurt-based central bank has injected over 200 million euros into the financial system since thursday .
thanks in part to a several central banks intervening worldwide , t he ecb described conditions in the money market as now " close to normal . "
dw-world.de spoke with ulrich kater , of germany 's dekabank , who said that market participants underestimated risks involved in the us federal reserve bank 's low-interest-rate policies .
dw-world.de : the central banks have been massively pumping money into markets - in unheard of amounts since the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the us .
are the banks living up to their responsibilities , or is this a sign of a real crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich kater , of the dekabank ulrich kater : the central banks have a responsibility to ensure that the money markets can function .
if the demand for liquidity rises to a point that money markets can not satisfy , then it is clearly the obligation of the central banks to provide liquidity .
but one can see that the amounts the banks have pumped into the markets in this very short-term liquidity intervention have continually decreased ; that was already evident last week , although it was often portrayed differently .
that speaks to conditions on the markets that are getting back to normal . how much responsibility do the central banks carry in whether the financial markets continue to calm down , or whether there will be more panicked reactions ?
the central banks are simply the fundament on which the money markets are based .
the markets , however , are currently suffering from an intense phenomenon of the masses : even though trust in one 's business partner is the most important commodity on the markets , every market participant is under the general suspicion of not being able to live up to his promises .
the central banks are there to ease fears so that so that things will settle down .
i think confidence in the markets will return , especially given the basic economic data .
is n't there a risk that investors can now rely on the banks too much ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's up to central banks to make sure credit markets have the liquidity they need no .
the central banks have an obligation only for short-term interventions .
investors , on the other hand , plan months , quarters and years in advance .
in moments of crisis , everything always appears very dramatic , but at second glance , when the markets return to normal , the investors will also see that the basic economic figures are on track and that the global economy continues to be very dynamic .
how were things in the past ?
did the central banks , especially the federal reserve bank under alan greenspan at that time , always fulfill their obligations ?
could interest rate policies in the us have been one of the reasons for the current crisis ?
there were good reasons back then for lowering the interest rates so much .
the fed wanted to control the macro-economic consequences of the stock market bubble that burst in 2001 , and it managed to do that .
but now we are seeing the collateral damage of these interest rate policies .
the sense of danger among market participants became too sedated by the " medicine " of low interest rates .
in hindsight , it probably would have been better if the central banks had started raising their interest rates a year earlier .
but even central bank professionals do not have 20/20 vision for the future .
the lesson that should be learned from this is not to underestimate the danger of interest rates that are too low for loans .
the lack of liquidity on the global markets has also highlighted the interest policies of the bank of japan .
can we expect it to raise its rates , thus intensifying the crisis ?
even last year , japan 's central bank policies were slower to move than expected .
it is possible that , due to liquidity shortages on the markets , the bank of japan will postpone its plans for raising interest rates in august - perhaps just for a month .
but generally speaking , it will also be pushing for a normalization of economic policies and will have to raise interest rates . angela göpfert interviewed ulrich kater -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the 1990s , schirach defended günter schabowksi in a trial of high-ranking east german officials for their role in the killings of people who had attempted to flee across the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schirach -lrb- left -rrb- and schabowski during the trial schabowski , a member of the east german politburo who became famous for announcing the fall of the berlin wall , was convicted of manslaughter and accepted moral responsibility for the killings .
he was sentenced to three years in prison and pardoned after six months behind bars . schirach 's involvement in the case also made headlines because he is the grandson of baldur von schirach , the former leader of the nazi hitler youth , who was found guilty of crimes against humanity and served 20 years in prison . dw-world.de : what 's the significance of the resurfaced shoot-to-kill order ? ferdinand von schirach : it 's negligible .

the frankfurt-based central bank has injected over 200 million euros into the financial system since thursday .
thanks in part to a several central banks intervening worldwide , t he ecb described conditions in the money market as now " close to normal . "
dw-world.de spoke with ulrich kater , of germany 's dekabank , who said that market participants underestimated risks involved in the us federal reserve bank 's low-interest-rate policies .
dw-world.de : the central banks have been massively pumping money into markets - in unheard of amounts since the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the us .
are the banks living up to their responsibilities , or is this a sign of a real crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich kater , of the dekabank ulrich kater : the central banks have a responsibility to ensure that the money markets can function .
if the demand for liquidity rises to a point that money markets can not satisfy , then it is clearly the obligation of the central banks to provide liquidity .
but one can see that the amounts the banks have pumped into the markets in this very short-term liquidity intervention have continually decreased ; that was already evident last week , although it was often portrayed differently .
that speaks to conditions on the markets that are getting back to normal . how much responsibility do the central banks carry in whether the financial markets continue to calm down , or whether there will be more panicked reactions ?
the central banks are simply the fundament on which the money markets are based .
the markets , however , are currently suffering from an intense phenomenon of the masses : even though trust in one 's business partner is the most important commodity on the markets , every market participant is under the general suspicion of not being able to live up to his promises .
the central banks are there to ease fears so that so that things will settle down .
i think confidence in the markets will return , especially given the basic economic data .
is n't there a risk that investors can now rely on the banks too much ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's up to central banks to make sure credit markets have the liquidity they need no .
the central banks have an obligation only for short-term interventions .
investors , on the other hand , plan months , quarters and years in advance .
in moments of crisis , everything always appears very dramatic , but at second glance , when the markets return to normal , the investors will also see that the basic economic figures are on track and that the global economy continues to be very dynamic .
how were things in the past ?
did the central banks , especially the federal reserve bank under alan greenspan at that time , always fulfill their obligations ?
could interest rate policies in the us have been one of the reasons for the current crisis ?
there were good reasons back then for lowering the interest rates so much .
the fed wanted to control the macro-economic consequences of the stock market bubble that burst in 2001 , and it managed to do that .
but now we are seeing the collateral damage of these interest rate policies .
the sense of danger among market participants became too sedated by the " medicine " of low interest rates .
in hindsight , it probably would have been better if the central banks had started raising their interest rates a year earlier .
but even central bank professionals do not have 20/20 vision for the future .
the lesson that should be learned from this is not to underestimate the danger of interest rates that are too low for loans .
the lack of liquidity on the global markets has also highlighted the interest policies of the bank of japan .
can we expect it to raise its rates , thus intensifying the crisis ?
even last year , japan 's central bank policies were slower to move than expected .
it is possible that , due to liquidity shortages on the markets , the bank of japan will postpone its plans for raising interest rates in august - perhaps just for a month .
but generally speaking , it will also be pushing for a normalization of economic policies and will have to raise interest rates . angela göpfert interviewed ulrich kater -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the frankfurt-based central bank has injected over 200 million euros into the financial system since thursday .
thanks in part to a several central banks intervening worldwide , t he ecb described conditions in the money market as now " close to normal . "
dw-world.de spoke with ulrich kater , of germany 's dekabank , who said that market participants underestimated risks involved in the us federal reserve bank 's low-interest-rate policies .
dw-world.de : the central banks have been massively pumping money into markets - in unheard of amounts since the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the us .
are the banks living up to their responsibilities , or is this a sign of a real crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich kater , of the dekabank ulrich kater : the central banks have a responsibility to ensure that the money markets can function .
if the demand for liquidity rises to a point that money markets can not satisfy , then it is clearly the obligation of the central banks to provide liquidity .
but one can see that the amounts the banks have pumped into the markets in this very short-term liquidity intervention have continually decreased ; that was already evident last week , although it was often portrayed differently .
that speaks to conditions on the markets that are getting back to normal . how much responsibility do the central banks carry in whether the financial markets continue to calm down , or whether there will be more panicked reactions ?
the central banks are simply the fundament on which the money markets are based .
the markets , however , are currently suffering from an intense phenomenon of the masses : even though trust in one 's business partner is the most important commodity on the markets , every market participant is under the general suspicion of not being able to live up to his promises .
the central banks are there to ease fears so that so that things will settle down .
i think confidence in the markets will return , especially given the basic economic data .
is n't there a risk that investors can now rely on the banks too much ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's up to central banks to make sure credit markets have the liquidity they need no .
the central banks have an obligation only for short-term interventions .
investors , on the other hand , plan months , quarters and years in advance .
in moments of crisis , everything always appears very dramatic , but at second glance , when the markets return to normal , the investors will also see that the basic economic figures are on track and that the global economy continues to be very dynamic .
how were things in the past ?
did the central banks , especially the federal reserve bank under alan greenspan at that time , always fulfill their obligations ?
could interest rate policies in the us have been one of the reasons for the current crisis ?
there were good reasons back then for lowering the interest rates so much .
the fed wanted to control the macro-economic consequences of the stock market bubble that burst in 2001 , and it managed to do that .
but now we are seeing the collateral damage of these interest rate policies .
the sense of danger among market participants became too sedated by the " medicine " of low interest rates .
in hindsight , it probably would have been better if the central banks had started raising their interest rates a year earlier .
but even central bank professionals do not have 20/20 vision for the future .
the lesson that should be learned from this is not to underestimate the danger of interest rates that are too low for loans .
the lack of liquidity on the global markets has also highlighted the interest policies of the bank of japan .
can we expect it to raise its rates , thus intensifying the crisis ?
even last year , japan 's central bank policies were slower to move than expected .
it is possible that , due to liquidity shortages on the markets , the bank of japan will postpone its plans for raising interest rates in august - perhaps just for a month .
but generally speaking , it will also be pushing for a normalization of economic policies and will have to raise interest rates . angela göpfert interviewed ulrich kater -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but times , it seems , have changed , and suddenly germany - and berlin in particular - is a moving-making magnet . tom 's controversial role from brangelina to tom cruise and matt damon to nicole kidman , berlin locations have been pulling in hollywood stars more and more regularly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise plays claus schenk von stauffenberg cruise has been staying in the city with his wife , katie holmes , and daughter suri during the shooting of the war movie " valkyrie " at locations in berlin and brandenburg , the eastern state that surrounds the capital city . the actor has stirred controversy , not only because of his famed devotion to scientology , but also his role in the movie about a key figure in the german resistance against adolf hitler .
cruise plays colonel count claus schenk von stauffenberg in the film , about stauffenberg 's failed bomb-plot bid to kill hitler on july 20 , 1944 .
the plot led to the colonel 's arrest and execution by firing squad in the courtyard of the bendlerblock , the current german army 's headquarters in berlin .
besides cruise , who has been tracked by paparazzi since his arrival in the capital , the actors kenneth branagh , bill nighy , tom wilkinson , eddie izzard , cristian berkel , thomas kretschmann and carice van houten belong to the cast .
' amazing ' period of growth " our studios are presently at full capacity , " eike wolf , a spokesperson at babelsberg , said of the berlin film boom .
" it 's amazing .
it 's the busiest period we 've experienced since the studios were privatized in 1992 . "
wolf said by the end of the year babelsberg will have handled a " record " 11 productions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : babelsberg says its undergoing a renaissance " last year we had just one full length feature , " she said .
carl woebcken , managing director of studio babelsberg motion pictures , said that despite doubling the studio capacity in 2005 , they have had to rent extra studio space in order to cope with the demand from international productions .
while the current rush of business is more than welcome , the number of films produced there in babelsberg in the past few years is a far cry from the studio 's heyday in the late 1920s , when it was hollywood 's strongest competitor .
back then , the studio pumped out almost 600 films a year , including classics such as fritz lang 's " metropolis " -lrb- 1927 -rrb- , and the 1930 josef von sternberg feature " blue angel , " which gave marlene dietrich her debut .
projects in the pipeline besides " valkyrie " , other films in progress at babelsberg this year include director tom tykwer 's " the international , " starring clive owen and naomi watts ; jan de bont 's thriller " stopping point , " with actor john cusack ; " mr.nobody , " starring jared leto ; and " speed racer , " a $ 53 million warner brothers production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich got her start in german film 's heyday in the pipeline for babelsberg are " the reader " , starring tom cruise 's ex-wife nicole kidman , and oscar prize-winning director caroline link 's " a year of winter " with corinna harfouch and karoline herfurth .
another berlin project is german producer bernd eichinger 's " the baader-meinhof complex " , starring german actor moritz bleibtreu as modern radical andreas baader .
the movie tackles an explosive period in germany 's post-war history when a group of urban terrorists known as the baader-meinhof gang , or red army faction , staged a series of murders , robberies and kidnappings during the 1970s and early 80s . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 14.08.2007 in berlin , the stars are out - and filmmaking is back in großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin is once again becoming a popular film location although it is still nowhere near the production levels of the 1920s , german film industry officials say movie making in the berlin is undergoing a renaissance . for decades , germany has had a hard time persuading international moviemakers to shoot their films in the country.even after the nation was reunited in 1989 , hollywood directors were slow to develop projects in berlin , munich or , for that matter , at the famous babelsberg film studios in potsdam , outside berlin .
but times , it seems , have changed , and suddenly germany - and berlin in particular - is a moving-making magnet . tom 's controversial role from brangelina to tom cruise and matt damon to nicole kidman , berlin locations have been pulling in hollywood stars more and more regularly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise plays claus schenk von stauffenberg cruise has been staying in the city with his wife , katie holmes , and daughter suri during the shooting of the war movie " valkyrie " at locations in berlin and brandenburg , the eastern state that surrounds the capital city . the actor has stirred controversy , not only because of his famed devotion to scientology , but also his role in the movie about a key figure in the german resistance against adolf hitler .
cruise plays colonel count claus schenk von stauffenberg in the film , about stauffenberg 's failed bomb-plot bid to kill hitler on july 20 , 1944 .
the plot led to the colonel 's arrest and execution by firing squad in the courtyard of the bendlerblock , the current german army 's headquarters in berlin .
besides cruise , who has been tracked by paparazzi since his arrival in the capital , the actors kenneth branagh , bill nighy , tom wilkinson , eddie izzard , cristian berkel , thomas kretschmann and carice van houten belong to the cast .
' amazing ' period of growth " our studios are presently at full capacity , " eike wolf , a spokesperson at babelsberg , said of the berlin film boom .
" it 's amazing .
it 's the busiest period we 've experienced since the studios were privatized in 1992 . "
wolf said by the end of the year babelsberg will have handled a " record " 11 productions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : babelsberg says its undergoing a renaissance " last year we had just one full length feature , " she said .
carl woebcken , managing director of studio babelsberg motion pictures , said that despite doubling the studio capacity in 2005 , they have had to rent extra studio space in order to cope with the demand from international productions .
while the current rush of business is more than welcome , the number of films produced there in babelsberg in the past few years is a far cry from the studio 's heyday in the late 1920s , when it was hollywood 's strongest competitor .
back then , the studio pumped out almost 600 films a year , including classics such as fritz lang 's " metropolis " -lrb- 1927 -rrb- , and the 1930 josef von sternberg feature " blue angel , " which gave marlene dietrich her debut .
projects in the pipeline besides " valkyrie " , other films in progress at babelsberg this year include director tom tykwer 's " the international , " starring clive owen and naomi watts ; jan de bont 's thriller " stopping point , " with actor john cusack ; " mr.nobody , " starring jared leto ; and " speed racer , " a $ 53 million warner brothers production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich got her start in german film 's heyday in the pipeline for babelsberg are " the reader " , starring tom cruise 's ex-wife nicole kidman , and oscar prize-winning director caroline link 's " a year of winter " with corinna harfouch and karoline herfurth .
another berlin project is german producer bernd eichinger 's " the baader-meinhof complex " , starring german actor moritz bleibtreu as modern radical andreas baader .
the movie tackles an explosive period in germany 's post-war history when a group of urban terrorists known as the baader-meinhof gang , or red army faction , staged a series of murders , robberies and kidnappings during the 1970s and early 80s . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but is often criticized for lacking a consistent strategy , especially in afghanistan , where troops serve under three different mandates . the deployments are also stretching the bundeswehr , which is one of the reason 's chancellor merkel 's coalition gave for waving aside french president nicolas sarkozy 's call for european troops to protect refugees from darfur , according to the government . but many german parliamentarians consider the argument of depleted capacities an insufficient one .
they say this mission is necessary , precisely because it is a humanitarian one . at the same time , they want a debate about which missions the bundeswehr should take part in , and which should have priority . deutsche welle : mr. gerhardt , considering the drop in public acceptance of foreign peacekeeping missions , is there - at the least - a problem of communication between politicians and the people ?
is n't it time for a general debate on the purpose of the individual missions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang gerhardt wolfgang gerhard : yes .
as a government , or as a member of parliament or the opposition , each day you have to justify to society why you mobilize soldiers .
you have to have clear criteria .
and you have to go into this debate convincingly , with political leadership .
the security of our country is threatened by places in the world where there are problems , and it can only be ensured if we , along with other democratic nations , and with united nations mandates , can to some degree calm the world 's hot spots . but the priorities are also unclear .
some say the missions must be in germany 's interest .
is that definition justified ? in the interest of human dignity and in the interest of freedom and security in the world , i would add that is in germany 's interest .
that may sound generalized , but it can be more precise .
if we are unable to offer people in afghanistan an alternative to poppy-growing , where they supply practically the entire world with drugs , then deploying all those soldiers there is useless .
so a political solution must always accompany a military mission . so in addition to the military deployment , we have to think much more intensely about social structures there , with participation by the european union .
in darfur , where women are being raped , and human suffering is everywhere , it 's not a place where we can stay away - if the bundeswehr is capable of involvement - on moral or ethical grounds .
anyone who goes into congo to monitor elections should have strong arguments for not going into darfur . so you 're in favor of an engagement , of a bundeswehr mission to darfur ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african union said it could provide enough troops to protect darfur the first question is does the bundeswehr have the capacity to take part in what maybe action in darfur .
and the second reason is a moral question for me - the responsibility to protect is one of the important points of foreign policy in our times .
we see worldwide that there are governments who do not like to protect their own people , and though it is a responsibility for the community of democratic nations , with a legitimate mandate from the united nations to protect people , that 's a main reason for me to advocate participation of the bundeswehr if the bundeswehr is capable of doing so . can the bundeswehr do that ? if it can , then we should not stand on the sidelines .
my moral justification for that does n't exist in a vacuum of course - we have to know if the bundeswehr can do it , if it has the capacities to get involved .
and who else would take part ?
all of that has not yet been answered .
but if there is a special humane reason to protect people , then darfur is an important place for it . why do you think then that the german government is being so reticent about committing troops to darfur ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suffering of sudan 's refugees needs to be made clear to germans , gerhardt said i believe the government has a hard time with this rejection .
for moral and ethical reasons , it must realize this responsibility to protect , when human rights are discussed , for instance in the united nations .
we have to clear all the deployment mandates and all the soldiers we have worldwide .
we have to ask ourselves what is the reason , what is the aim , where is the escape , is the task fulfilled ? we had a mission in congo , it was not a mission i would like to have .
it was for one day , or two days , we left congo and nothing is better there .
we have been in afghanistan for years , we have n't given the people an alternative for social security ; we have only deployed soldiers .
we have to fulfill mandates but not only with soldiers .
we have been looking on for years at the rape in darfur , at the brutality in darfur and we know that the government of sudan is not able to protect the people there . given the low support in germany for foreign peacekeeping missions , how will you sell this mission to darfur ? every conflict has a variety of reasons - the agricultural structure in the region , the ethnic split in this region .
but at the end of the day you have to convince people in which world we would like to live , and what is security for the federal republic of germany , and what are the necessary steps to protect europe .
if we are not able to calm conflicts in worldwide hotspots , we can not contribute to security policy in europe . dw-tv 's christopher springate interviewed wolfgang gerhardt -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the 1990s , schirach defended günter schabowksi in a trial of high-ranking east german officials for their role in the killings of people who had attempted to flee across the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schirach -lrb- left -rrb- and schabowski during the trial schabowski , a member of the east german politburo who became famous for announcing the fall of the berlin wall , was convicted of manslaughter and accepted moral responsibility for the killings .
he was sentenced to three years in prison and pardoned after six months behind bars . schirach 's involvement in the case also made headlines because he is the grandson of baldur von schirach , the former leader of the nazi hitler youth , who was found guilty of crimes against humanity and served 20 years in prison . dw-world.de : what 's the significance of the resurfaced shoot-to-kill order ? ferdinand von schirach : it 's negligible .
it 's a document that 's been known for a long time to everyone involved , including the berlin state prosecutor 's office , which now claims that it has to investigate this again .
this piece of paper has no known author and no clear addressee .
it 's a simple piece of paper that could have been written by anyone and that will not hold up for convictions or even the initiation of a criminal investigation . of course you have to say - and that 's probably the best thing that can be said about this piece of paper - that it 's circumstantial evidence for the cruelty of the border fortifications and the guarding of the border .
but one should n't think that this is a piece of paper that the courts have been looking for for years and that places guilt on a certain person without a doubt or is able to describe the system as a whole . could you say then that it 's a historically interesting but legally irrelevant document ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler , the head of the agency that administers the stasi files it 's not irrelevant from a legal standpoint , because even circumstantial evidence is relevant .
it 's certainly interesting from a historic perspective , but it 's not unique - there were several of these documents . the thing that 's maybe interesting from a historic perspective is that the head of a federal agency has gone so far off the rails that she thinks that she can make policy with this on the anniversary of the construction of the wall .
-lrb- marianne birthler heads the so-called " birthler authority , " the unofficial name given to the government office responsible for researching the history of the gdr 's secret police , the stasi -rrb- .we need to get away from handling these issues in a sensationalist way . it 's a serious issue and as the head of such an agency , you can not push such a paper into the public realm and claim to reveal something completely new even though it 's been known for a long time .
in my opinion , it will also have to lead to a discussion about what should be done with the agency . why do you think that this surfaced right now ? because of the anniversary of the construction of the wall .
-lrb- this week marked the 46th anniversary of the building of the berlin wall -rrb- there 's no other reason in my opinion .
the paper has been known , the state prosecutors received a number of such papers for investigations years ago , and none of them played any role in any of the trials .
it 's a little trite to say : i have now found the document that offers conclusive proof for everything . let 's take a step back and think about what this shoot-to-kill order actually means .
it meant that the gdr forcefully prevented its people from doing nothing more than trying to leave the country .
that 's what 's condemnable about this system and the courts ruled accordingly .
they declared - questionable from a legal standpoint but correct from a moral one - that such systems are inhuman and that this deserves to be punished . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : white crosses serve as memorials to those killed while trying to cross the wall now , many years after the trials , someone comes and says : now , i have the piece of paper that makes it perfectly clear that the gdr had such an order -lsb- to shoot and kill -rsb- .
but that was n't the case .
this clear-cut order was n't confirmed by any of the witnesses or any outsider .
it did not exist in a single document . it 's not a secret that these young border patrols shot at people and that many people died there .
it is a historic fact .
but that does n't mean that we can turn around and say : there was a clear order to shoot women and children .
i think that 's nonsense .
these systems were also too intelligent to do something like this .
the border patrols were put under oath every morning and had to swear on all sorts of orders that were given there .
for all intents and purposes , it did what 's written in this ominous paper , but no one in the gdr would have said something like this . several politicians have called for an investigation into possible legal action .
do you think any legal action will be taken ? it definitely wo n't happen .
the prosecutor 's office already had these papers and could have checked them a long time ago .
i 'm absolutely certain that nothing that 's relevant in terms of criminal law can come from this kind of document . mathis winkler interviewed ferdinand von schirach send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
it was gul 's attempt to run for the presidency that triggered early parliamentary elections in july and saw prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's akp returned to power with a parliamentary majority .
millions protested bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-secular demonstrators with a portrait of turkey 's founder atatürk in april millions of people urged on by retired generals took to the streets in april and june to protest against the akp and the prospect of gül becoming president .
they objected to gül 's past involvement in conservative islamist groups , the fact that his wife wears an islamic-style headscarf - no president 's wife in turkey has ever worn one - and also at the prospect of the akp controlling the government , the parliament and presidency .
gül 's original attempt failed thanks to a boycott of the presidential vote by opposition parties . " if gul is elected , turkey 's political balances will change , " deniz baykal , head of the main opposition republican people 's party , was quoted as saying in the radikal newspaper .
" turkey will be transformed into a country with an overbearing religious and middle eastern identity . "
after a late-night warning from the military that it would do whatever necessary to protect secularism , the constitutional court ruled that at least two-thirds of deputies in the parliament must be present for the vote to go ahead .
aug .
20 vote parliament is scheduled to meet on aug .
20 for a first round of voting on the new president .
gül is not expected to win the two-thirds of the vote necessary to be elected in the first or second rounds , but with the akp holding a strong majority in parliament , he is expected to be elected in the third round .
one of the main opposition parties , the nationalist movement party -lrb- mhp -rrb- has promised to take part in the vote thus ensuring that quorum will be reached . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but is often criticized for lacking a consistent strategy , especially in afghanistan , where troops serve under three different mandates . the deployments are also stretching the bundeswehr , which is one of the reason 's chancellor merkel 's coalition gave for waving aside french president nicolas sarkozy 's call for european troops to protect refugees from darfur , according to the government . but many german parliamentarians consider the argument of depleted capacities an insufficient one .
they say this mission is necessary , precisely because it is a humanitarian one . at the same time , they want a debate about which missions the bundeswehr should take part in , and which should have priority . deutsche welle : mr. gerhardt , considering the drop in public acceptance of foreign peacekeeping missions , is there - at the least - a problem of communication between politicians and the people ?
is n't it time for a general debate on the purpose of the individual missions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang gerhardt wolfgang gerhard : yes .
as a government , or as a member of parliament or the opposition , each day you have to justify to society why you mobilize soldiers .
you have to have clear criteria .
and you have to go into this debate convincingly , with political leadership .
the security of our country is threatened by places in the world where there are problems , and it can only be ensured if we , along with other democratic nations , and with united nations mandates , can to some degree calm the world 's hot spots . but the priorities are also unclear .
some say the missions must be in germany 's interest .
is that definition justified ? in the interest of human dignity and in the interest of freedom and security in the world , i would add that is in germany 's interest .
that may sound generalized , but it can be more precise .
if we are unable to offer people in afghanistan an alternative to poppy-growing , where they supply practically the entire world with drugs , then deploying all those soldiers there is useless .
so a political solution must always accompany a military mission . so in addition to the military deployment , we have to think much more intensely about social structures there , with participation by the european union .
in darfur , where women are being raped , and human suffering is everywhere , it 's not a place where we can stay away - if the bundeswehr is capable of involvement - on moral or ethical grounds .
anyone who goes into congo to monitor elections should have strong arguments for not going into darfur . so you 're in favor of an engagement , of a bundeswehr mission to darfur ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african union said it could provide enough troops to protect darfur the first question is does the bundeswehr have the capacity to take part in what maybe action in darfur .
and the second reason is a moral question for me - the responsibility to protect is one of the important points of foreign policy in our times .
we see worldwide that there are governments who do not like to protect their own people , and though it is a responsibility for the community of democratic nations , with a legitimate mandate from the united nations to protect people , that 's a main reason for me to advocate participation of the bundeswehr if the bundeswehr is capable of doing so . can the bundeswehr do that ? if it can , then we should not stand on the sidelines .
my moral justification for that does n't exist in a vacuum of course - we have to know if the bundeswehr can do it , if it has the capacities to get involved .
and who else would take part ?
all of that has not yet been answered .
but if there is a special humane reason to protect people , then darfur is an important place for it . why do you think then that the german government is being so reticent about committing troops to darfur ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suffering of sudan 's refugees needs to be made clear to germans , gerhardt said i believe the government has a hard time with this rejection .
for moral and ethical reasons , it must realize this responsibility to protect , when human rights are discussed , for instance in the united nations .
we have to clear all the deployment mandates and all the soldiers we have worldwide .
we have to ask ourselves what is the reason , what is the aim , where is the escape , is the task fulfilled ? we had a mission in congo , it was not a mission i would like to have .
it was for one day , or two days , we left congo and nothing is better there .
we have been in afghanistan for years , we have n't given the people an alternative for social security ; we have only deployed soldiers .
we have to fulfill mandates but not only with soldiers .
we have been looking on for years at the rape in darfur , at the brutality in darfur and we know that the government of sudan is not able to protect the people there . given the low support in germany for foreign peacekeeping missions , how will you sell this mission to darfur ? every conflict has a variety of reasons - the agricultural structure in the region , the ethnic split in this region .
but at the end of the day you have to convince people in which world we would like to live , and what is security for the federal republic of germany , and what are the necessary steps to protect europe .
if we are not able to calm conflicts in worldwide hotspots , we can not contribute to security policy in europe . dw-tv 's christopher springate interviewed wolfgang gerhardt -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but is often criticized for lacking a consistent strategy , especially in afghanistan , where troops serve under three different mandates . the deployments are also stretching the bundeswehr , which is one of the reason 's chancellor merkel 's coalition gave for waving aside french president nicolas sarkozy 's call for european troops to protect refugees from darfur , according to the government . but many german parliamentarians consider the argument of depleted capacities an insufficient one .
they say this mission is necessary , precisely because it is a humanitarian one . at the same time , they want a debate about which missions the bundeswehr should take part in , and which should have priority . deutsche welle : mr. gerhardt , considering the drop in public acceptance of foreign peacekeeping missions , is there - at the least - a problem of communication between politicians and the people ?
is n't it time for a general debate on the purpose of the individual missions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang gerhardt wolfgang gerhard : yes .
as a government , or as a member of parliament or the opposition , each day you have to justify to society why you mobilize soldiers .
you have to have clear criteria .
and you have to go into this debate convincingly , with political leadership .
the security of our country is threatened by places in the world where there are problems , and it can only be ensured if we , along with other democratic nations , and with united nations mandates , can to some degree calm the world 's hot spots . but the priorities are also unclear .
some say the missions must be in germany 's interest .
is that definition justified ? in the interest of human dignity and in the interest of freedom and security in the world , i would add that is in germany 's interest .
that may sound generalized , but it can be more precise .
if we are unable to offer people in afghanistan an alternative to poppy-growing , where they supply practically the entire world with drugs , then deploying all those soldiers there is useless .
so a political solution must always accompany a military mission . so in addition to the military deployment , we have to think much more intensely about social structures there , with participation by the european union .
in darfur , where women are being raped , and human suffering is everywhere , it 's not a place where we can stay away - if the bundeswehr is capable of involvement - on moral or ethical grounds .
anyone who goes into congo to monitor elections should have strong arguments for not going into darfur . so you 're in favor of an engagement , of a bundeswehr mission to darfur ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african union said it could provide enough troops to protect darfur the first question is does the bundeswehr have the capacity to take part in what maybe action in darfur .
and the second reason is a moral question for me - the responsibility to protect is one of the important points of foreign policy in our times .
we see worldwide that there are governments who do not like to protect their own people , and though it is a responsibility for the community of democratic nations , with a legitimate mandate from the united nations to protect people , that 's a main reason for me to advocate participation of the bundeswehr if the bundeswehr is capable of doing so . can the bundeswehr do that ? if it can , then we should not stand on the sidelines .
my moral justification for that does n't exist in a vacuum of course - we have to know if the bundeswehr can do it , if it has the capacities to get involved .
and who else would take part ?
all of that has not yet been answered .
but if there is a special humane reason to protect people , then darfur is an important place for it . why do you think then that the german government is being so reticent about committing troops to darfur ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suffering of sudan 's refugees needs to be made clear to germans , gerhardt said i believe the government has a hard time with this rejection .
for moral and ethical reasons , it must realize this responsibility to protect , when human rights are discussed , for instance in the united nations .
we have to clear all the deployment mandates and all the soldiers we have worldwide .
we have to ask ourselves what is the reason , what is the aim , where is the escape , is the task fulfilled ? we had a mission in congo , it was not a mission i would like to have .
it was for one day , or two days , we left congo and nothing is better there .
we have been in afghanistan for years , we have n't given the people an alternative for social security ; we have only deployed soldiers .
we have to fulfill mandates but not only with soldiers .
we have been looking on for years at the rape in darfur , at the brutality in darfur and we know that the government of sudan is not able to protect the people there . given the low support in germany for foreign peacekeeping missions , how will you sell this mission to darfur ? every conflict has a variety of reasons - the agricultural structure in the region , the ethnic split in this region .
but at the end of the day you have to convince people in which world we would like to live , and what is security for the federal republic of germany , and what are the necessary steps to protect europe .
if we are not able to calm conflicts in worldwide hotspots , we can not contribute to security policy in europe . dw-tv 's christopher springate interviewed wolfgang gerhardt -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin fashion week recently featured " green living " in all its sexy , multi-colored glory .
eco-clothing has broken free of the " grim ethics of sacrifice " that defined the 1980s . europe 's fashionistas can now wear organic cotton and still make it past the bouncers .

globally , the organic cotton market is evenly split between europe and the united states .
german consumers led europe 's organic cotton demand in the 1990s , with mail order companies such as hess natur making it a cornerstone of its strategy .
demand in great britain and france is quickly eclipsing germany , said damien sanfilippo , cotton project officer for the pesticide action network -lrb- pan . -rrb-
he estimates that three out of every four high street retailers in the britain now offer organic cotton products , nearly all of them since 2003 .
eco-chic in the big leagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers benefit from organic cotton organic cotton clothing lines are showing up both in europe 's high-end fashion boutiques and stores for the masses such as h & m and zara .
last year swedish-based h & m used 30 tons of organic cotton .
this year it expects to use 1,100 tons .
the organic clothing lines are selling so well that the company has expanded it to be available in all departments , including men 's clothing , said karolina dubowicz , a project leader in h & m 's press relations department .
customers have shown they 'll buy organic if the clothes look good and are priced right , she said .
using organic cotton is part of the company 's corporate responsibility plan .
" we do a lot of things to contribute to a better environment , " dubowicz said .
" this is one of the ways that we do this .
it 's an investment in a better environment . "
inditex , the spanish retail giant which owns zara , announced a green strategy which will slash energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions in the upcoming years .
zara , famous for bringing the latest trends to market quickly and inexpensively , sells organic cotton t-shirt for about 10 euros .
too good to be true ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ethical consumers are going organic farmers and the environment are the main beneficiaries of organic cotton and other products . organic food is an easy sell compared to organic cotton .
many consumers feel an organic peach is healthier than a conventional one and will spend the extra money to buy it .
and retailers in germany are finding that many shoppers are willing to do the same for clothes , according to simon ferrigno of the organic exchange , a nonprofit trade association working to expand the use of organically-grown cotton .
but consumers only experience a health benefit if the cotton is processed in an environmentally friendly way without harsh chemicals , said katharina schaus , a garment engineer who founded the german company it fits .
schaus has helped develop standards that allow companies to certify the entire process as organic .
most retailers want to label the entire product , not just the cotton , as organic , she said .
h & m uses the same techniques and dyes for all its cotton , which dubowicz said is strictly regulated to make sure it poses no risk to consumers ' health .
fickle fashion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are often recruited to help with the cotton harvest there has been some concern as cotton has become big business that some of the gains organic farmers have made will be lost .
" now that the big retailers are involved , they have a way to do business which is a different way than the specialized organic cotton companies , " said sanfilippo of pan .
" we hope that they 'll promote organic agriculture overall . "
while this year 's obsession with african prints will be in next year 's trash bins , organic cotton seems to have staying power . companies have shown long-term commitment to organic cotton by making big changes to their supply chains , experts said . " it 's for the long term , " ferrigno said of the interest in organic cotton .

the frankfurt-based central bank has injected over 200 million euros into the financial system since thursday .
thanks in part to a several central banks intervening worldwide , t he ecb described conditions in the money market as now " close to normal . "
dw-world.de spoke with ulrich kater , of germany 's dekabank , who said that market participants underestimated risks involved in the us federal reserve bank 's low-interest-rate policies .
dw-world.de : the central banks have been massively pumping money into markets - in unheard of amounts since the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the us .
are the banks living up to their responsibilities , or is this a sign of a real crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich kater , of the dekabank ulrich kater : the central banks have a responsibility to ensure that the money markets can function .
if the demand for liquidity rises to a point that money markets can not satisfy , then it is clearly the obligation of the central banks to provide liquidity .
but one can see that the amounts the banks have pumped into the markets in this very short-term liquidity intervention have continually decreased ; that was already evident last week , although it was often portrayed differently .
that speaks to conditions on the markets that are getting back to normal . how much responsibility do the central banks carry in whether the financial markets continue to calm down , or whether there will be more panicked reactions ?
the central banks are simply the fundament on which the money markets are based .
the markets , however , are currently suffering from an intense phenomenon of the masses : even though trust in one 's business partner is the most important commodity on the markets , every market participant is under the general suspicion of not being able to live up to his promises .
the central banks are there to ease fears so that so that things will settle down .
i think confidence in the markets will return , especially given the basic economic data .
is n't there a risk that investors can now rely on the banks too much ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's up to central banks to make sure credit markets have the liquidity they need no .
the central banks have an obligation only for short-term interventions .
investors , on the other hand , plan months , quarters and years in advance .
in moments of crisis , everything always appears very dramatic , but at second glance , when the markets return to normal , the investors will also see that the basic economic figures are on track and that the global economy continues to be very dynamic .
how were things in the past ?
did the central banks , especially the federal reserve bank under alan greenspan at that time , always fulfill their obligations ?
could interest rate policies in the us have been one of the reasons for the current crisis ?
there were good reasons back then for lowering the interest rates so much .
the fed wanted to control the macro-economic consequences of the stock market bubble that burst in 2001 , and it managed to do that .
but now we are seeing the collateral damage of these interest rate policies .
the sense of danger among market participants became too sedated by the " medicine " of low interest rates .
in hindsight , it probably would have been better if the central banks had started raising their interest rates a year earlier .
but even central bank professionals do not have 20/20 vision for the future .
the lesson that should be learned from this is not to underestimate the danger of interest rates that are too low for loans .
the lack of liquidity on the global markets has also highlighted the interest policies of the bank of japan .
can we expect it to raise its rates , thus intensifying the crisis ?
even last year , japan 's central bank policies were slower to move than expected .
it is possible that , due to liquidity shortages on the markets , the bank of japan will postpone its plans for raising interest rates in august - perhaps just for a month .
but generally speaking , it will also be pushing for a normalization of economic policies and will have to raise interest rates . angela göpfert interviewed ulrich kater -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de east germany -pipe- 14.08.2007 expert : no hard proof for east german shoot-to-kill order großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a preserved section of the former german-german border an expert on killings along the former german-german border told dw-world.de that a recently discovered shoot-to-kill order is irrelevant and will not spark new criminal probes that some politicians are calling for . berlin state prosecutors have said they 're considering opening a new criminal investigation into deaths at the berlin wall after a document resurfaced that contains orders to " stop or liquidate " anyone trying to escape to the west , including women and children . dw-world.de talked about the document with ferdinand von schirach , a berlin-based lawyer .
in the 1990s , schirach defended günter schabowksi in a trial of high-ranking east german officials for their role in the killings of people who had attempted to flee across the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schirach -lrb- left -rrb- and schabowski during the trial schabowski , a member of the east german politburo who became famous for announcing the fall of the berlin wall , was convicted of manslaughter and accepted moral responsibility for the killings .
he was sentenced to three years in prison and pardoned after six months behind bars . schirach 's involvement in the case also made headlines because he is the grandson of baldur von schirach , the former leader of the nazi hitler youth , who was found guilty of crimes against humanity and served 20 years in prison . dw-world.de : what 's the significance of the resurfaced shoot-to-kill order ? ferdinand von schirach : it 's negligible .
it 's a document that 's been known for a long time to everyone involved , including the berlin state prosecutor 's office , which now claims that it has to investigate this again .
this piece of paper has no known author and no clear addressee .
it 's a simple piece of paper that could have been written by anyone and that will not hold up for convictions or even the initiation of a criminal investigation . of course you have to say - and that 's probably the best thing that can be said about this piece of paper - that it 's circumstantial evidence for the cruelty of the border fortifications and the guarding of the border .
but one should n't think that this is a piece of paper that the courts have been looking for for years and that places guilt on a certain person without a doubt or is able to describe the system as a whole . could you say then that it 's a historically interesting but legally irrelevant document ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler , the head of the agency that administers the stasi files it 's not irrelevant from a legal standpoint , because even circumstantial evidence is relevant .
it 's certainly interesting from a historic perspective , but it 's not unique - there were several of these documents . the thing that 's maybe interesting from a historic perspective is that the head of a federal agency has gone so far off the rails that she thinks that she can make policy with this on the anniversary of the construction of the wall .
-lrb- marianne birthler heads the so-called " birthler authority , " the unofficial name given to the government office responsible for researching the history of the gdr 's secret police , the stasi -rrb- .we need to get away from handling these issues in a sensationalist way . it 's a serious issue and as the head of such an agency , you can not push such a paper into the public realm and claim to reveal something completely new even though it 's been known for a long time .
in my opinion , it will also have to lead to a discussion about what should be done with the agency . why do you think that this surfaced right now ? because of the anniversary of the construction of the wall .
-lrb- this week marked the 46th anniversary of the building of the berlin wall -rrb- there 's no other reason in my opinion .
the paper has been known , the state prosecutors received a number of such papers for investigations years ago , and none of them played any role in any of the trials .
it 's a little trite to say : i have now found the document that offers conclusive proof for everything . let 's take a step back and think about what this shoot-to-kill order actually means .
it meant that the gdr forcefully prevented its people from doing nothing more than trying to leave the country .
that 's what 's condemnable about this system and the courts ruled accordingly .
they declared - questionable from a legal standpoint but correct from a moral one - that such systems are inhuman and that this deserves to be punished . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : white crosses serve as memorials to those killed while trying to cross the wall now , many years after the trials , someone comes and says : now , i have the piece of paper that makes it perfectly clear that the gdr had such an order -lsb- to shoot and kill -rsb- .
but that was n't the case .
this clear-cut order was n't confirmed by any of the witnesses or any outsider .
it did not exist in a single document . it 's not a secret that these young border patrols shot at people and that many people died there .
it is a historic fact .
but that does n't mean that we can turn around and say : there was a clear order to shoot women and children .
i think that 's nonsense .
these systems were also too intelligent to do something like this .
the border patrols were put under oath every morning and had to swear on all sorts of orders that were given there .
for all intents and purposes , it did what 's written in this ominous paper , but no one in the gdr would have said something like this . several politicians have called for an investigation into possible legal action .
do you think any legal action will be taken ? it definitely wo n't happen .
the prosecutor 's office already had these papers and could have checked them a long time ago .
i 'm absolutely certain that nothing that 's relevant in terms of criminal law can come from this kind of document . mathis winkler interviewed ferdinand von schirach send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
it was gul 's attempt to run for the presidency that triggered early parliamentary elections in july and saw prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's akp returned to power with a parliamentary majority .
millions protested bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-secular demonstrators with a portrait of turkey 's founder atatürk in april millions of people urged on by retired generals took to the streets in april and june to protest against the akp and the prospect of gül becoming president .
they objected to gül 's past involvement in conservative islamist groups , the fact that his wife wears an islamic-style headscarf - no president 's wife in turkey has ever worn one - and also at the prospect of the akp controlling the government , the parliament and presidency .
gül 's original attempt failed thanks to a boycott of the presidential vote by opposition parties . " if gul is elected , turkey 's political balances will change , " deniz baykal , head of the main opposition republican people 's party , was quoted as saying in the radikal newspaper .
" turkey will be transformed into a country with an overbearing religious and middle eastern identity . "
after a late-night warning from the military that it would do whatever necessary to protect secularism , the constitutional court ruled that at least two-thirds of deputies in the parliament must be present for the vote to go ahead .

gül is not expected to win the two-thirds of the vote necessary to be elected in the first or second rounds , but with the akp holding a strong majority in parliament , he is expected to be elected in the third round .
one of the main opposition parties , the nationalist movement party -lrb- mhp -rrb- has promised to take part in the vote thus ensuring that quorum will be reached . dw staff / dpa -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this year it expects to use 1,100 tons .
the organic clothing lines are selling so well that the company has expanded it to be available in all departments , including men 's clothing , said karolina dubowicz , a project leader in h & m 's press relations department .
customers have shown they 'll buy organic if the clothes look good and are priced right , she said .
using organic cotton is part of the company 's corporate responsibility plan .
" we do a lot of things to contribute to a better environment , " dubowicz said .
" this is one of the ways that we do this .
it 's an investment in a better environment . "
inditex , the spanish retail giant which owns zara , announced a green strategy which will slash energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions in the upcoming years .

and retailers in germany are finding that many shoppers are willing to do the same for clothes , according to simon ferrigno of the organic exchange , a nonprofit trade association working to expand the use of organically-grown cotton .
but consumers only experience a health benefit if the cotton is processed in an environmentally friendly way without harsh chemicals , said katharina schaus , a garment engineer who founded the german company it fits .
schaus has helped develop standards that allow companies to certify the entire process as organic .
most retailers want to label the entire product , not just the cotton , as organic , she said .
h & m uses the same techniques and dyes for all its cotton , which dubowicz said is strictly regulated to make sure it poses no risk to consumers ' health .
fickle fashion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are often recruited to help with the cotton harvest there has been some concern as cotton has become big business that some of the gains organic farmers have made will be lost .
" now that the big retailers are involved , they have a way to do business which is a different way than the specialized organic cotton companies , " said sanfilippo of pan .
" we hope that they 'll promote organic agriculture overall . "
while this year 's obsession with african prints will be in next year 's trash bins , organic cotton seems to have staying power . companies have shown long-term commitment to organic cotton by making big changes to their supply chains , experts said .

but times , it seems , have changed , and suddenly germany - and berlin in particular - is a moving-making magnet . tom 's controversial role from brangelina to tom cruise and matt damon to nicole kidman , berlin locations have been pulling in hollywood stars more and more regularly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise plays claus schenk von stauffenberg cruise has been staying in the city with his wife , katie holmes , and daughter suri during the shooting of the war movie " valkyrie " at locations in berlin and brandenburg , the eastern state that surrounds the capital city . the actor has stirred controversy , not only because of his famed devotion to scientology , but also his role in the movie about a key figure in the german resistance against adolf hitler .
cruise plays colonel count claus schenk von stauffenberg in the film , about stauffenberg 's failed bomb-plot bid to kill hitler on july 20 , 1944 .
the plot led to the colonel 's arrest and execution by firing squad in the courtyard of the bendlerblock , the current german army 's headquarters in berlin .
besides cruise , who has been tracked by paparazzi since his arrival in the capital , the actors kenneth branagh , bill nighy , tom wilkinson , eddie izzard , cristian berkel , thomas kretschmann and carice van houten belong to the cast .
' amazing ' period of growth " our studios are presently at full capacity , " eike wolf , a spokesperson at babelsberg , said of the berlin film boom .
" it 's amazing .
it 's the busiest period we 've experienced since the studios were privatized in 1992 . "
wolf said by the end of the year babelsberg will have handled a " record " 11 productions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : babelsberg says its undergoing a renaissance " last year we had just one full length feature , " she said .
carl woebcken , managing director of studio babelsberg motion pictures , said that despite doubling the studio capacity in 2005 , they have had to rent extra studio space in order to cope with the demand from international productions .
while the current rush of business is more than welcome , the number of films produced there in babelsberg in the past few years is a far cry from the studio 's heyday in the late 1920s , when it was hollywood 's strongest competitor .
back then , the studio pumped out almost 600 films a year , including classics such as fritz lang 's " metropolis " -lrb- 1927 -rrb- , and the 1930 josef von sternberg feature " blue angel , " which gave marlene dietrich her debut .
projects in the pipeline besides " valkyrie " , other films in progress at babelsberg this year include director tom tykwer 's " the international , " starring clive owen and naomi watts ; jan de bont 's thriller " stopping point , " with actor john cusack ; " mr.nobody , " starring jared leto ; and " speed racer , " a $ 53 million warner brothers production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich got her start in german film 's heyday in the pipeline for babelsberg are " the reader " , starring tom cruise 's ex-wife nicole kidman , and oscar prize-winning director caroline link 's " a year of winter " with corinna harfouch and karoline herfurth .
another berlin project is german producer bernd eichinger 's " the baader-meinhof complex " , starring german actor moritz bleibtreu as modern radical andreas baader .
the movie tackles an explosive period in germany 's post-war history when a group of urban terrorists known as the baader-meinhof gang , or red army faction , staged a series of murders , robberies and kidnappings during the 1970s and early 80s . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but times , it seems , have changed , and suddenly germany - and berlin in particular - is a moving-making magnet . tom 's controversial role from brangelina to tom cruise and matt damon to nicole kidman , berlin locations have been pulling in hollywood stars more and more regularly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise plays claus schenk von stauffenberg cruise has been staying in the city with his wife , katie holmes , and daughter suri during the shooting of the war movie " valkyrie " at locations in berlin and brandenburg , the eastern state that surrounds the capital city . the actor has stirred controversy , not only because of his famed devotion to scientology , but also his role in the movie about a key figure in the german resistance against adolf hitler .
cruise plays colonel count claus schenk von stauffenberg in the film , about stauffenberg 's failed bomb-plot bid to kill hitler on july 20 , 1944 .
the plot led to the colonel 's arrest and execution by firing squad in the courtyard of the bendlerblock , the current german army 's headquarters in berlin .
besides cruise , who has been tracked by paparazzi since his arrival in the capital , the actors kenneth branagh , bill nighy , tom wilkinson , eddie izzard , cristian berkel , thomas kretschmann and carice van houten belong to the cast .
' amazing ' period of growth " our studios are presently at full capacity , " eike wolf , a spokesperson at babelsberg , said of the berlin film boom .
" it 's amazing .
it 's the busiest period we 've experienced since the studios were privatized in 1992 . "
wolf said by the end of the year babelsberg will have handled a " record " 11 productions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : babelsberg says its undergoing a renaissance " last year we had just one full length feature , " she said .
carl woebcken , managing director of studio babelsberg motion pictures , said that despite doubling the studio capacity in 2005 , they have had to rent extra studio space in order to cope with the demand from international productions .
while the current rush of business is more than welcome , the number of films produced there in babelsberg in the past few years is a far cry from the studio 's heyday in the late 1920s , when it was hollywood 's strongest competitor .
back then , the studio pumped out almost 600 films a year , including classics such as fritz lang 's " metropolis " -lrb- 1927 -rrb- , and the 1930 josef von sternberg feature " blue angel , " which gave marlene dietrich her debut .
projects in the pipeline besides " valkyrie " , other films in progress at babelsberg this year include director tom tykwer 's " the international , " starring clive owen and naomi watts ; jan de bont 's thriller " stopping point , " with actor john cusack ; " mr.nobody , " starring jared leto ; and " speed racer , " a $ 53 million warner brothers production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich got her start in german film 's heyday in the pipeline for babelsberg are " the reader " , starring tom cruise 's ex-wife nicole kidman , and oscar prize-winning director caroline link 's " a year of winter " with corinna harfouch and karoline herfurth .
another berlin project is german producer bernd eichinger 's " the baader-meinhof complex " , starring german actor moritz bleibtreu as modern radical andreas baader .
the movie tackles an explosive period in germany 's post-war history when a group of urban terrorists known as the baader-meinhof gang , or red army faction , staged a series of murders , robberies and kidnappings during the 1970s and early 80s . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the frankfurt-based central bank has injected over 200 million euros into the financial system since thursday .
thanks in part to a several central banks intervening worldwide , t he ecb described conditions in the money market as now " close to normal . "
dw-world.de spoke with ulrich kater , of germany 's dekabank , who said that market participants underestimated risks involved in the us federal reserve bank 's low-interest-rate policies .
dw-world.de : the central banks have been massively pumping money into markets - in unheard of amounts since the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the us .
are the banks living up to their responsibilities , or is this a sign of a real crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich kater , of the dekabank ulrich kater : the central banks have a responsibility to ensure that the money markets can function .
if the demand for liquidity rises to a point that money markets can not satisfy , then it is clearly the obligation of the central banks to provide liquidity .
but one can see that the amounts the banks have pumped into the markets in this very short-term liquidity intervention have continually decreased ; that was already evident last week , although it was often portrayed differently .
that speaks to conditions on the markets that are getting back to normal . how much responsibility do the central banks carry in whether the financial markets continue to calm down , or whether there will be more panicked reactions ?
the central banks are simply the fundament on which the money markets are based .
the markets , however , are currently suffering from an intense phenomenon of the masses : even though trust in one 's business partner is the most important commodity on the markets , every market participant is under the general suspicion of not being able to live up to his promises .
the central banks are there to ease fears so that so that things will settle down .
i think confidence in the markets will return , especially given the basic economic data .
is n't there a risk that investors can now rely on the banks too much ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's up to central banks to make sure credit markets have the liquidity they need no .
the central banks have an obligation only for short-term interventions .
investors , on the other hand , plan months , quarters and years in advance .
in moments of crisis , everything always appears very dramatic , but at second glance , when the markets return to normal , the investors will also see that the basic economic figures are on track and that the global economy continues to be very dynamic .
how were things in the past ?
did the central banks , especially the federal reserve bank under alan greenspan at that time , always fulfill their obligations ?
could interest rate policies in the us have been one of the reasons for the current crisis ?
there were good reasons back then for lowering the interest rates so much .
the fed wanted to control the macro-economic consequences of the stock market bubble that burst in 2001 , and it managed to do that .
but now we are seeing the collateral damage of these interest rate policies .
the sense of danger among market participants became too sedated by the " medicine " of low interest rates .
in hindsight , it probably would have been better if the central banks had started raising their interest rates a year earlier .
but even central bank professionals do not have 20/20 vision for the future .
the lesson that should be learned from this is not to underestimate the danger of interest rates that are too low for loans .
the lack of liquidity on the global markets has also highlighted the interest policies of the bank of japan .
can we expect it to raise its rates , thus intensifying the crisis ?
even last year , japan 's central bank policies were slower to move than expected .
it is possible that , due to liquidity shortages on the markets , the bank of japan will postpone its plans for raising interest rates in august - perhaps just for a month .
but generally speaking , it will also be pushing for a normalization of economic policies and will have to raise interest rates . angela göpfert interviewed ulrich kater -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin fashion week recently featured " green living " in all its sexy , multi-colored glory .
eco-clothing has broken free of the " grim ethics of sacrifice " that defined the 1980s . europe 's fashionistas can now wear organic cotton and still make it past the bouncers .
spectacular growth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : not just for hippies organic cotton is forecast to have an annual growth rate of 116 percent between 2006 and 2008 and to reach $ 2.6 billion -lrb- 1.9 billion euros -rrb- in global retail sales , according to an organic exchange 's cotton market report .
globally , the organic cotton market is evenly split between europe and the united states .
german consumers led europe 's organic cotton demand in the 1990s , with mail order companies such as hess natur making it a cornerstone of its strategy .
demand in great britain and france is quickly eclipsing germany , said damien sanfilippo , cotton project officer for the pesticide action network -lrb- pan . -rrb-

eco-chic in the big leagues bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : farmers benefit from organic cotton organic cotton clothing lines are showing up both in europe 's high-end fashion boutiques and stores for the masses such as h & m and zara .
last year swedish-based h & m used 30 tons of organic cotton .
this year it expects to use 1,100 tons .
the organic clothing lines are selling so well that the company has expanded it to be available in all departments , including men 's clothing , said karolina dubowicz , a project leader in h & m 's press relations department .
customers have shown they 'll buy organic if the clothes look good and are priced right , she said .
using organic cotton is part of the company 's corporate responsibility plan .
" we do a lot of things to contribute to a better environment , " dubowicz said .
" this is one of the ways that we do this .
it 's an investment in a better environment . "
inditex , the spanish retail giant which owns zara , announced a green strategy which will slash energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions in the upcoming years .
zara , famous for bringing the latest trends to market quickly and inexpensively , sells organic cotton t-shirt for about 10 euros .
too good to be true ?

many consumers feel an organic peach is healthier than a conventional one and will spend the extra money to buy it .
and retailers in germany are finding that many shoppers are willing to do the same for clothes , according to simon ferrigno of the organic exchange , a nonprofit trade association working to expand the use of organically-grown cotton .
but consumers only experience a health benefit if the cotton is processed in an environmentally friendly way without harsh chemicals , said katharina schaus , a garment engineer who founded the german company it fits .
schaus has helped develop standards that allow companies to certify the entire process as organic .
most retailers want to label the entire product , not just the cotton , as organic , she said .
h & m uses the same techniques and dyes for all its cotton , which dubowicz said is strictly regulated to make sure it poses no risk to consumers ' health .
fickle fashion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are often recruited to help with the cotton harvest there has been some concern as cotton has become big business that some of the gains organic farmers have made will be lost .
" now that the big retailers are involved , they have a way to do business which is a different way than the specialized organic cotton companies , " said sanfilippo of pan .
" we hope that they 'll promote organic agriculture overall . "
while this year 's obsession with african prints will be in next year 's trash bins , organic cotton seems to have staying power . companies have shown long-term commitment to organic cotton by making big changes to their supply chains , experts said .

"
it was gul 's attempt to run for the presidency that triggered early parliamentary elections in july and saw prime minister recep tayyip erdogan 's akp returned to power with a parliamentary majority .
millions protested bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-secular demonstrators with a portrait of turkey 's founder atatürk in april millions of people urged on by retired generals took to the streets in april and june to protest against the akp and the prospect of gül becoming president .
they objected to gül 's past involvement in conservative islamist groups , the fact that his wife wears an islamic-style headscarf - no president 's wife in turkey has ever worn one - and also at the prospect of the akp controlling the government , the parliament and presidency .
gül 's original attempt failed thanks to a boycott of the presidential vote by opposition parties . " if gul is elected , turkey 's political balances will change , " deniz baykal , head of the main opposition republican people 's party , was quoted as saying in the radikal newspaper .
" turkey will be transformed into a country with an overbearing religious and middle eastern identity . "
after a late-night warning from the military that it would do whatever necessary to protect secularism , the constitutional court ruled that at least two-thirds of deputies in the parliament must be present for the vote to go ahead .

gül is not expected to win the two-thirds of the vote necessary to be elected in the first or second rounds , but with the akp holding a strong majority in parliament , he is expected to be elected in the third round .

reinhard grindel , of the chrisitian democrats - part of the government 's ruling coalition - said the review of the stasi documents should not be left up to the " birthler authority , " the unofficial name given to the government office , headed by marianne birthler , responsible for researching the history of the gdr 's stasi .
grindel said the mistakes made regarding the recent resurfacing of documents about the " shoot-to-kill " policy of the stasi at the berlin wall showed that the responsibility for the investigation of such texts should be given to a research association , to which the birthler office should belong .
" it is now clear that the processing of these documents should not be exclusively left up to the birthler authority , " grindel told broadcaster rbb .
grindel also recommended that the stasi document office be integrated into the german federal archives in koblenz .

berlin fashion week recently featured " green living " in all its sexy , multi-colored glory .
eco-clothing has broken free of the " grim ethics of sacrifice " that defined the 1980s . europe 's fashionistas can now wear organic cotton and still make it past the bouncers .

globally , the organic cotton market is evenly split between europe and the united states .
german consumers led europe 's organic cotton demand in the 1990s , with mail order companies such as hess natur making it a cornerstone of its strategy .
demand in great britain and france is quickly eclipsing germany , said damien sanfilippo , cotton project officer for the pesticide action network -lrb- pan . -rrb-
he estimates that three out of every four high street retailers in the britain now offer organic cotton products , nearly all of them since 2003 .

this year it expects to use 1,100 tons .
the organic clothing lines are selling so well that the company has expanded it to be available in all departments , including men 's clothing , said karolina dubowicz , a project leader in h & m 's press relations department .
customers have shown they 'll buy organic if the clothes look good and are priced right , she said .
using organic cotton is part of the company 's corporate responsibility plan .
" we do a lot of things to contribute to a better environment , " dubowicz said .
" this is one of the ways that we do this .
it 's an investment in a better environment . "
inditex , the spanish retail giant which owns zara , announced a green strategy which will slash energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions in the upcoming years .
zara , famous for bringing the latest trends to market quickly and inexpensively , sells organic cotton t-shirt for about 10 euros .

many consumers feel an organic peach is healthier than a conventional one and will spend the extra money to buy it .
and retailers in germany are finding that many shoppers are willing to do the same for clothes , according to simon ferrigno of the organic exchange , a nonprofit trade association working to expand the use of organically-grown cotton .
but consumers only experience a health benefit if the cotton is processed in an environmentally friendly way without harsh chemicals , said katharina schaus , a garment engineer who founded the german company it fits .
schaus has helped develop standards that allow companies to certify the entire process as organic .
most retailers want to label the entire product , not just the cotton , as organic , she said .
h & m uses the same techniques and dyes for all its cotton , which dubowicz said is strictly regulated to make sure it poses no risk to consumers ' health .
fickle fashion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are often recruited to help with the cotton harvest there has been some concern as cotton has become big business that some of the gains organic farmers have made will be lost .
" now that the big retailers are involved , they have a way to do business which is a different way than the specialized organic cotton companies , " said sanfilippo of pan .
" we hope that they 'll promote organic agriculture overall . "
while this year 's obsession with african prints will be in next year 's trash bins , organic cotton seems to have staying power . companies have shown long-term commitment to organic cotton by making big changes to their supply chains , experts said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de east germany -pipe- 14.08.2007 expert : no hard proof for east german shoot-to-kill order großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a preserved section of the former german-german border an expert on killings along the former german-german border told dw-world.de that a recently discovered shoot-to-kill order is irrelevant and will not spark new criminal probes that some politicians are calling for . berlin state prosecutors have said they 're considering opening a new criminal investigation into deaths at the berlin wall after a document resurfaced that contains orders to " stop or liquidate " anyone trying to escape to the west , including women and children . dw-world.de talked about the document with ferdinand von schirach , a berlin-based lawyer .
in the 1990s , schirach defended günter schabowksi in a trial of high-ranking east german officials for their role in the killings of people who had attempted to flee across the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schirach -lrb- left -rrb- and schabowski during the trial schabowski , a member of the east german politburo who became famous for announcing the fall of the berlin wall , was convicted of manslaughter and accepted moral responsibility for the killings .
he was sentenced to three years in prison and pardoned after six months behind bars . schirach 's involvement in the case also made headlines because he is the grandson of baldur von schirach , the former leader of the nazi hitler youth , who was found guilty of crimes against humanity and served 20 years in prison . dw-world.de : what 's the significance of the resurfaced shoot-to-kill order ? ferdinand von schirach : it 's negligible .
it 's a document that 's been known for a long time to everyone involved , including the berlin state prosecutor 's office , which now claims that it has to investigate this again .
this piece of paper has no known author and no clear addressee .
it 's a simple piece of paper that could have been written by anyone and that will not hold up for convictions or even the initiation of a criminal investigation . of course you have to say - and that 's probably the best thing that can be said about this piece of paper - that it 's circumstantial evidence for the cruelty of the border fortifications and the guarding of the border .
but one should n't think that this is a piece of paper that the courts have been looking for for years and that places guilt on a certain person without a doubt or is able to describe the system as a whole . could you say then that it 's a historically interesting but legally irrelevant document ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler , the head of the agency that administers the stasi files it 's not irrelevant from a legal standpoint , because even circumstantial evidence is relevant .
it 's certainly interesting from a historic perspective , but it 's not unique - there were several of these documents . the thing that 's maybe interesting from a historic perspective is that the head of a federal agency has gone so far off the rails that she thinks that she can make policy with this on the anniversary of the construction of the wall .
-lrb- marianne birthler heads the so-called " birthler authority , " the unofficial name given to the government office responsible for researching the history of the gdr 's secret police , the stasi -rrb- .we need to get away from handling these issues in a sensationalist way . it 's a serious issue and as the head of such an agency , you can not push such a paper into the public realm and claim to reveal something completely new even though it 's been known for a long time .
in my opinion , it will also have to lead to a discussion about what should be done with the agency . why do you think that this surfaced right now ? because of the anniversary of the construction of the wall .
-lrb- this week marked the 46th anniversary of the building of the berlin wall -rrb- there 's no other reason in my opinion .
the paper has been known , the state prosecutors received a number of such papers for investigations years ago , and none of them played any role in any of the trials .
it 's a little trite to say : i have now found the document that offers conclusive proof for everything . let 's take a step back and think about what this shoot-to-kill order actually means .
it meant that the gdr forcefully prevented its people from doing nothing more than trying to leave the country .
that 's what 's condemnable about this system and the courts ruled accordingly .
they declared - questionable from a legal standpoint but correct from a moral one - that such systems are inhuman and that this deserves to be punished . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : white crosses serve as memorials to those killed while trying to cross the wall now , many years after the trials , someone comes and says : now , i have the piece of paper that makes it perfectly clear that the gdr had such an order -lsb- to shoot and kill -rsb- .
but that was n't the case .
this clear-cut order was n't confirmed by any of the witnesses or any outsider .
it did not exist in a single document . it 's not a secret that these young border patrols shot at people and that many people died there .
it is a historic fact .
but that does n't mean that we can turn around and say : there was a clear order to shoot women and children .
i think that 's nonsense .
these systems were also too intelligent to do something like this .
the border patrols were put under oath every morning and had to swear on all sorts of orders that were given there .
for all intents and purposes , it did what 's written in this ominous paper , but no one in the gdr would have said something like this . several politicians have called for an investigation into possible legal action .
do you think any legal action will be taken ? it definitely wo n't happen .
the prosecutor 's office already had these papers and could have checked them a long time ago .
i 'm absolutely certain that nothing that 's relevant in terms of criminal law can come from this kind of document . mathis winkler interviewed ferdinand von schirach send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

berlin fashion week recently featured " green living " in all its sexy , multi-colored glory .
eco-clothing has broken free of the " grim ethics of sacrifice " that defined the 1980s . europe 's fashionistas can now wear organic cotton and still make it past the bouncers .

globally , the organic cotton market is evenly split between europe and the united states .
german consumers led europe 's organic cotton demand in the 1990s , with mail order companies such as hess natur making it a cornerstone of its strategy .
demand in great britain and france is quickly eclipsing germany , said damien sanfilippo , cotton project officer for the pesticide action network -lrb- pan . -rrb-

this year it expects to use 1,100 tons .
the organic clothing lines are selling so well that the company has expanded it to be available in all departments , including men 's clothing , said karolina dubowicz , a project leader in h & m 's press relations department .
customers have shown they 'll buy organic if the clothes look good and are priced right , she said .
using organic cotton is part of the company 's corporate responsibility plan .
" we do a lot of things to contribute to a better environment , " dubowicz said .
" this is one of the ways that we do this .
it 's an investment in a better environment . "
inditex , the spanish retail giant which owns zara , announced a green strategy which will slash energy consumption and carbon dioxide emissions in the upcoming years .

many consumers feel an organic peach is healthier than a conventional one and will spend the extra money to buy it .
and retailers in germany are finding that many shoppers are willing to do the same for clothes , according to simon ferrigno of the organic exchange , a nonprofit trade association working to expand the use of organically-grown cotton .
but consumers only experience a health benefit if the cotton is processed in an environmentally friendly way without harsh chemicals , said katharina schaus , a garment engineer who founded the german company it fits .
schaus has helped develop standards that allow companies to certify the entire process as organic .
most retailers want to label the entire product , not just the cotton , as organic , she said .
h & m uses the same techniques and dyes for all its cotton , which dubowicz said is strictly regulated to make sure it poses no risk to consumers ' health .
fickle fashion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : children are often recruited to help with the cotton harvest there has been some concern as cotton has become big business that some of the gains organic farmers have made will be lost .
" now that the big retailers are involved , they have a way to do business which is a different way than the specialized organic cotton companies , " said sanfilippo of pan .
" we hope that they 'll promote organic agriculture overall . "
while this year 's obsession with african prints will be in next year 's trash bins , organic cotton seems to have staying power . companies have shown long-term commitment to organic cotton by making big changes to their supply chains , experts said . " it 's for the long term , " ferrigno said of the interest in organic cotton .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de peacekeeping -pipe- 14.08.2007 politician wants more german help for darfur großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 300,000 people have been killed and 2 million displaced in darfur since 2003 wolfgang gerhard , foreign policy advisor for the opposition free-market liberal fdp , spoke to deutsche welle about german concerns regarding international peacekeeping missions and why germany 's army should be in darfur . at present the german army , the bundeswehr , is taking part in nine missions abroad .
but is often criticized for lacking a consistent strategy , especially in afghanistan , where troops serve under three different mandates . the deployments are also stretching the bundeswehr , which is one of the reason 's chancellor merkel 's coalition gave for waving aside french president nicolas sarkozy 's call for european troops to protect refugees from darfur , according to the government . but many german parliamentarians consider the argument of depleted capacities an insufficient one .
they say this mission is necessary , precisely because it is a humanitarian one . at the same time , they want a debate about which missions the bundeswehr should take part in , and which should have priority . deutsche welle : mr. gerhardt , considering the drop in public acceptance of foreign peacekeeping missions , is there - at the least - a problem of communication between politicians and the people ?
is n't it time for a general debate on the purpose of the individual missions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang gerhardt wolfgang gerhard : yes .
as a government , or as a member of parliament or the opposition , each day you have to justify to society why you mobilize soldiers .
you have to have clear criteria .
and you have to go into this debate convincingly , with political leadership .
the security of our country is threatened by places in the world where there are problems , and it can only be ensured if we , along with other democratic nations , and with united nations mandates , can to some degree calm the world 's hot spots . but the priorities are also unclear .
some say the missions must be in germany 's interest .
is that definition justified ? in the interest of human dignity and in the interest of freedom and security in the world , i would add that is in germany 's interest .
that may sound generalized , but it can be more precise .
if we are unable to offer people in afghanistan an alternative to poppy-growing , where they supply practically the entire world with drugs , then deploying all those soldiers there is useless .
so a political solution must always accompany a military mission . so in addition to the military deployment , we have to think much more intensely about social structures there , with participation by the european union .
in darfur , where women are being raped , and human suffering is everywhere , it 's not a place where we can stay away - if the bundeswehr is capable of involvement - on moral or ethical grounds .
anyone who goes into congo to monitor elections should have strong arguments for not going into darfur . so you 're in favor of an engagement , of a bundeswehr mission to darfur ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african union said it could provide enough troops to protect darfur the first question is does the bundeswehr have the capacity to take part in what maybe action in darfur .
and the second reason is a moral question for me - the responsibility to protect is one of the important points of foreign policy in our times .
we see worldwide that there are governments who do not like to protect their own people , and though it is a responsibility for the community of democratic nations , with a legitimate mandate from the united nations to protect people , that 's a main reason for me to advocate participation of the bundeswehr if the bundeswehr is capable of doing so . can the bundeswehr do that ? if it can , then we should not stand on the sidelines .
my moral justification for that does n't exist in a vacuum of course - we have to know if the bundeswehr can do it , if it has the capacities to get involved .
and who else would take part ?
all of that has not yet been answered .
but if there is a special humane reason to protect people , then darfur is an important place for it . why do you think then that the german government is being so reticent about committing troops to darfur ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suffering of sudan 's refugees needs to be made clear to germans , gerhardt said i believe the government has a hard time with this rejection .
for moral and ethical reasons , it must realize this responsibility to protect , when human rights are discussed , for instance in the united nations .
we have to clear all the deployment mandates and all the soldiers we have worldwide .
we have to ask ourselves what is the reason , what is the aim , where is the escape , is the task fulfilled ? we had a mission in congo , it was not a mission i would like to have .
it was for one day , or two days , we left congo and nothing is better there .
we have been in afghanistan for years , we have n't given the people an alternative for social security ; we have only deployed soldiers .
we have to fulfill mandates but not only with soldiers .
we have been looking on for years at the rape in darfur , at the brutality in darfur and we know that the government of sudan is not able to protect the people there . given the low support in germany for foreign peacekeeping missions , how will you sell this mission to darfur ? every conflict has a variety of reasons - the agricultural structure in the region , the ethnic split in this region .
but at the end of the day you have to convince people in which world we would like to live , and what is security for the federal republic of germany , and what are the necessary steps to protect europe .
if we are not able to calm conflicts in worldwide hotspots , we can not contribute to security policy in europe . dw-tv 's christopher springate interviewed wolfgang gerhardt -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case was brought by a 52-year-old secondary school teacher , who said she would appeal tuesday 's ruling .
the teacher had argued that her headscarf was a " fashion accessory à la grace kelly " that was in line with christian-occidental values .
the judges did not accept the argument , pointing out that since the teacher always wore the scarf , it was a symbol of her religous beliefs .
authorities in north rhine-westphalia imposed a ban on headscarves in june 2006 .
a similar ban was introduced in the southern state of bavaria in 2005 with the aim of protecting children from the influence of islamic fundamentalists .
rules vary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german flag as headscarf headscarves are banned in eight of germany 's 16 states , but laws vary about other headdress .
after the headscarf prohibition came into effect in june 2006 in north rhine-westphalia , one teacher appeared at school wearing a beret .
a court said the beret fell under the headscarf rule and asked the teacher to consider wearing a wig instead , which she refused .
in bavaria , on the other hand , teachers may wear hats in school .
at an administrative court in stuttgart in the state of baden-württemburg , judges in july 2006 reversed an earlier decision .
there , muslim teachers may now wear headscarves since nuns are also permitted to wear their habits in public schools . article based on news reports -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

reinhard grindel , of the chrisitian democrats - part of the government 's ruling coalition - said the review of the stasi documents should not be left up to the " birthler authority , " the unofficial name given to the government office , headed by marianne birthler , responsible for researching the history of the gdr 's stasi .

he added that his party continued to find the office 's work important and worth supporting . birthler has had to deflect criticism over the past few days that she made the announcement of the stasi " shoot-to-kill " policy just days before the 46th anniversary of the start of the construction of the berlin wall .
some have accused her of " sensationalizing " information to gain attention for her office , particularly because the data had already surfaced 10 years ago in a scientific journal .
klaus schroeder , of the research center " sed-staat " at the university of berlin , told the daily leipziger volkszeitung that birthler " without doing thorough research beforehand , left herself get caught up in the idea of announcing information that made it appear like an historically new , sensational discovery . "
information surfaced a decade ago " that discredits the institution , " he added .
" when the birthler authority knew about this 10 years ago , why was no one commissioned to research the matter further ? " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " shoot-to-kill " documents surfaced ten years ago the " shoot-to-kill " order , dated oct .
1 , 1973 was found last week in the regional archive office in the eastern city of magdeburg and shows that the stasi had told guards that they must " stop or liquidate " would-be defectors .
on sunday , a spokesman for the stasi archive confirmed that the " shoot-to-kill " passage had been printed in a historian 's book on east germany in 1997 but said it had not reached a wider audience . article based on news reports -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case was brought by a 52-year-old secondary school teacher , who said she would appeal tuesday 's ruling .
the teacher had argued that her headscarf was a " fashion accessory à la grace kelly " that was in line with christian-occidental values .
the judges did not accept the argument , pointing out that since the teacher always wore the scarf , it was a symbol of her religous beliefs .
authorities in north rhine-westphalia imposed a ban on headscarves in june 2006 .
a similar ban was introduced in the southern state of bavaria in 2005 with the aim of protecting children from the influence of islamic fundamentalists .
rules vary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german flag as headscarf headscarves are banned in eight of germany 's 16 states , but laws vary about other headdress .
after the headscarf prohibition came into effect in june 2006 in north rhine-westphalia , one teacher appeared at school wearing a beret .
a court said the beret fell under the headscarf rule and asked the teacher to consider wearing a wig instead , which she refused .
in bavaria , on the other hand , teachers may wear hats in school .
at an administrative court in stuttgart in the state of baden-württemburg , judges in july 2006 reversed an earlier decision .
there , muslim teachers may now wear headscarves since nuns are also permitted to wear their habits in public schools . article based on news reports -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the 1990s , schirach defended günter schabowksi in a trial of high-ranking east german officials for their role in the killings of people who had attempted to flee across the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schirach -lrb- left -rrb- and schabowski during the trial schabowski , a member of the east german politburo who became famous for announcing the fall of the berlin wall , was convicted of manslaughter and accepted moral responsibility for the killings .
he was sentenced to three years in prison and pardoned after six months behind bars . schirach 's involvement in the case also made headlines because he is the grandson of baldur von schirach , the former leader of the nazi hitler youth , who was found guilty of crimes against humanity and served 20 years in prison . dw-world.de : what 's the significance of the resurfaced shoot-to-kill order ? ferdinand von schirach : it 's negligible .
it 's a document that 's been known for a long time to everyone involved , including the berlin state prosecutor 's office , which now claims that it has to investigate this again .
this piece of paper has no known author and no clear addressee .
it 's a simple piece of paper that could have been written by anyone and that will not hold up for convictions or even the initiation of a criminal investigation . of course you have to say - and that 's probably the best thing that can be said about this piece of paper - that it 's circumstantial evidence for the cruelty of the border fortifications and the guarding of the border .
but one should n't think that this is a piece of paper that the courts have been looking for for years and that places guilt on a certain person without a doubt or is able to describe the system as a whole . could you say then that it 's a historically interesting but legally irrelevant document ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler , the head of the agency that administers the stasi files it 's not irrelevant from a legal standpoint , because even circumstantial evidence is relevant .
it 's certainly interesting from a historic perspective , but it 's not unique - there were several of these documents . the thing that 's maybe interesting from a historic perspective is that the head of a federal agency has gone so far off the rails that she thinks that she can make policy with this on the anniversary of the construction of the wall .
-lrb- marianne birthler heads the so-called " birthler authority , " the unofficial name given to the government office responsible for researching the history of the gdr 's secret police , the stasi -rrb- .we need to get away from handling these issues in a sensationalist way . it 's a serious issue and as the head of such an agency , you can not push such a paper into the public realm and claim to reveal something completely new even though it 's been known for a long time .
in my opinion , it will also have to lead to a discussion about what should be done with the agency . why do you think that this surfaced right now ? because of the anniversary of the construction of the wall .
-lrb- this week marked the 46th anniversary of the building of the berlin wall -rrb- there 's no other reason in my opinion .
the paper has been known , the state prosecutors received a number of such papers for investigations years ago , and none of them played any role in any of the trials .
it 's a little trite to say : i have now found the document that offers conclusive proof for everything . let 's take a step back and think about what this shoot-to-kill order actually means .
it meant that the gdr forcefully prevented its people from doing nothing more than trying to leave the country .
that 's what 's condemnable about this system and the courts ruled accordingly .
they declared - questionable from a legal standpoint but correct from a moral one - that such systems are inhuman and that this deserves to be punished . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : white crosses serve as memorials to those killed while trying to cross the wall now , many years after the trials , someone comes and says : now , i have the piece of paper that makes it perfectly clear that the gdr had such an order -lsb- to shoot and kill -rsb- .
but that was n't the case .
this clear-cut order was n't confirmed by any of the witnesses or any outsider .
it did not exist in a single document . it 's not a secret that these young border patrols shot at people and that many people died there .
it is a historic fact .
but that does n't mean that we can turn around and say : there was a clear order to shoot women and children .
i think that 's nonsense .
these systems were also too intelligent to do something like this .
the border patrols were put under oath every morning and had to swear on all sorts of orders that were given there .
for all intents and purposes , it did what 's written in this ominous paper , but no one in the gdr would have said something like this . several politicians have called for an investigation into possible legal action .
do you think any legal action will be taken ? it definitely wo n't happen .
the prosecutor 's office already had these papers and could have checked them a long time ago .
i 'm absolutely certain that nothing that 's relevant in terms of criminal law can come from this kind of document . mathis winkler interviewed ferdinand von schirach send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

rules vary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german flag as headscarf headscarves are banned in eight of germany 's 16 states , but laws vary about other headdress .
after the headscarf prohibition came into effect in june 2006 in north rhine-westphalia , one teacher appeared at school wearing a beret .
a court said the beret fell under the headscarf rule and asked the teacher to consider wearing a wig instead , which she refused .
in bavaria , on the other hand , teachers may wear hats in school .
at an administrative court in stuttgart in the state of baden-württemburg , judges in july 2006 reversed an earlier decision .
there , muslim teachers may now wear headscarves since nuns are also permitted to wear their habits in public schools . article based on news reports -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

nearly 2 million toys sold in britain and ireland were being recalled due to concerns linked to small magnetic toys .
recalls of thousands of toys were also confirmed in the netherlands , belgium and luxembourg . a total of 18.2 million toys around the world are being recalled , the company said . the european commission , which oversees consumer safety across the european union , said it had not been notified of any recalls under rapex , the bloc 's rapid alert system under which countries must immediately report any cases of unsafe products . us toy market badly hit more than 9 million of the toys , which include barbie and batman figures , are being recalled in the united states and canada , and the rest in other countries , mattel said in a statement . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some sesame street characters too are being recalled in the us the recalls - the second this month - have also hit mattel toys in america .
more than 250,000 jeep-like toy cars sold as promotional products for the animated film cars were recalled because they contain more lead than us rules allow . mattel also recalled about 1 million fisher-price brand toys , including some sesame street characters , on august 1 because of lead paint . " i 'm deeply apologetic to everyone affected , " mattel chief executive bob eckert said in a videotaped statement .
" we 'll continue to enforce ... the highest level of quality and safety . " if children swallow or inhale several magnets , the parts could bond inside the body and block or injure the intestine , said nancy nord , head of the us government 's consumer product safety commission . most of the recall , 7.3 million items , involves polly pocket doll sets .
in november , mattel recalled 2.4 million of the toy sets in the us and canada after three reports of serious injuries to children who swallowed more than one magnet .
the children , aged two to eight , suffered intestinal perforations that required surgery , the government said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there are worries about the amounts of lead in some of the chinese-made toys mattel has stepped up testing of paint and finished toys at its vendors since the november recall , eckert said .
the company has also developed ways to attach magnets more firmly , he said . chinese-made products take battering problems with chinese products , including tainted pet food , seafood for human consumption and toothpaste , have generated bad publicity in the united states and europe in recent months and underscored consumers ' dependence on competitively priced imports from china . the food scandals in particular have led to calls in the us for tighter supervision of chinese imports .
chinese authorities say they have taken steps to boost product safety . last week , the co-owner of a chinese toymaker killed himself after products from his plant were included in the fisher-price recall . in july , china executed the former head of its state food and drug administration after convicting him of corruption .
he reportedly took bribes from companies to certify drugs that were not fully tested . article based on news reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the frankfurt-based central bank has injected over 200 million euros into the financial system since thursday .
thanks in part to a several central banks intervening worldwide , t he ecb described conditions in the money market as now " close to normal . "
dw-world.de spoke with ulrich kater , of germany 's dekabank , who said that market participants underestimated risks involved in the us federal reserve bank 's low-interest-rate policies .
dw-world.de : the central banks have been massively pumping money into markets - in unheard of amounts since the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the us .
are the banks living up to their responsibilities , or is this a sign of a real crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich kater , of the dekabank ulrich kater : the central banks have a responsibility to ensure that the money markets can function .
if the demand for liquidity rises to a point that money markets can not satisfy , then it is clearly the obligation of the central banks to provide liquidity .
but one can see that the amounts the banks have pumped into the markets in this very short-term liquidity intervention have continually decreased ; that was already evident last week , although it was often portrayed differently .
that speaks to conditions on the markets that are getting back to normal . how much responsibility do the central banks carry in whether the financial markets continue to calm down , or whether there will be more panicked reactions ?
the central banks are simply the fundament on which the money markets are based .
the markets , however , are currently suffering from an intense phenomenon of the masses : even though trust in one 's business partner is the most important commodity on the markets , every market participant is under the general suspicion of not being able to live up to his promises .
the central banks are there to ease fears so that so that things will settle down .
i think confidence in the markets will return , especially given the basic economic data .
is n't there a risk that investors can now rely on the banks too much ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's up to central banks to make sure credit markets have the liquidity they need no .
the central banks have an obligation only for short-term interventions .
investors , on the other hand , plan months , quarters and years in advance .
in moments of crisis , everything always appears very dramatic , but at second glance , when the markets return to normal , the investors will also see that the basic economic figures are on track and that the global economy continues to be very dynamic .
how were things in the past ?
did the central banks , especially the federal reserve bank under alan greenspan at that time , always fulfill their obligations ?
could interest rate policies in the us have been one of the reasons for the current crisis ?
there were good reasons back then for lowering the interest rates so much .
the fed wanted to control the macro-economic consequences of the stock market bubble that burst in 2001 , and it managed to do that .
but now we are seeing the collateral damage of these interest rate policies .
the sense of danger among market participants became too sedated by the " medicine " of low interest rates .
in hindsight , it probably would have been better if the central banks had started raising their interest rates a year earlier .
but even central bank professionals do not have 20/20 vision for the future .
the lesson that should be learned from this is not to underestimate the danger of interest rates that are too low for loans .
the lack of liquidity on the global markets has also highlighted the interest policies of the bank of japan .
can we expect it to raise its rates , thus intensifying the crisis ?
even last year , japan 's central bank policies were slower to move than expected .
it is possible that , due to liquidity shortages on the markets , the bank of japan will postpone its plans for raising interest rates in august - perhaps just for a month .
but generally speaking , it will also be pushing for a normalization of economic policies and will have to raise interest rates . angela göpfert interviewed ulrich kater -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the case was brought by a 52-year-old secondary school teacher , who said she would appeal tuesday 's ruling .
the teacher had argued that her headscarf was a " fashion accessory à la grace kelly " that was in line with christian-occidental values .
the judges did not accept the argument , pointing out that since the teacher always wore the scarf , it was a symbol of her religous beliefs .
authorities in north rhine-westphalia imposed a ban on headscarves in june 2006 .
a similar ban was introduced in the southern state of bavaria in 2005 with the aim of protecting children from the influence of islamic fundamentalists .
rules vary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german flag as headscarf headscarves are banned in eight of germany 's 16 states , but laws vary about other headdress .
after the headscarf prohibition came into effect in june 2006 in north rhine-westphalia , one teacher appeared at school wearing a beret .
a court said the beret fell under the headscarf rule and asked the teacher to consider wearing a wig instead , which she refused .
in bavaria , on the other hand , teachers may wear hats in school .
at an administrative court in stuttgart in the state of baden-württemburg , judges in july 2006 reversed an earlier decision .
there , muslim teachers may now wear headscarves since nuns are also permitted to wear their habits in public schools . article based on news reports -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke with ulrich kater , of germany 's dekabank , who said that market participants underestimated risks involved in the us federal reserve bank 's low-interest-rate policies .
dw-world.de : the central banks have been massively pumping money into markets - in unheard of amounts since the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the us .
are the banks living up to their responsibilities , or is this a sign of a real crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich kater , of the dekabank ulrich kater : the central banks have a responsibility to ensure that the money markets can function .
if the demand for liquidity rises to a point that money markets can not satisfy , then it is clearly the obligation of the central banks to provide liquidity .
but one can see that the amounts the banks have pumped into the markets in this very short-term liquidity intervention have continually decreased ; that was already evident last week , although it was often portrayed differently .
that speaks to conditions on the markets that are getting back to normal . how much responsibility do the central banks carry in whether the financial markets continue to calm down , or whether there will be more panicked reactions ?
the central banks are simply the fundament on which the money markets are based .
the markets , however , are currently suffering from an intense phenomenon of the masses : even though trust in one 's business partner is the most important commodity on the markets , every market participant is under the general suspicion of not being able to live up to his promises .
the central banks are there to ease fears so that so that things will settle down .
i think confidence in the markets will return , especially given the basic economic data .
is n't there a risk that investors can now rely on the banks too much ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's up to central banks to make sure credit markets have the liquidity they need no .
the central banks have an obligation only for short-term interventions .
investors , on the other hand , plan months , quarters and years in advance .
in moments of crisis , everything always appears very dramatic , but at second glance , when the markets return to normal , the investors will also see that the basic economic figures are on track and that the global economy continues to be very dynamic .
how were things in the past ?
did the central banks , especially the federal reserve bank under alan greenspan at that time , always fulfill their obligations ?
could interest rate policies in the us have been one of the reasons for the current crisis ?
there were good reasons back then for lowering the interest rates so much .
the fed wanted to control the macro-economic consequences of the stock market bubble that burst in 2001 , and it managed to do that .
but now we are seeing the collateral damage of these interest rate policies .
the sense of danger among market participants became too sedated by the " medicine " of low interest rates .
in hindsight , it probably would have been better if the central banks had started raising their interest rates a year earlier .
but even central bank professionals do not have 20/20 vision for the future .
the lesson that should be learned from this is not to underestimate the danger of interest rates that are too low for loans .
the lack of liquidity on the global markets has also highlighted the interest policies of the bank of japan .
can we expect it to raise its rates , thus intensifying the crisis ?
even last year , japan 's central bank policies were slower to move than expected .
it is possible that , due to liquidity shortages on the markets , the bank of japan will postpone its plans for raising interest rates in august - perhaps just for a month .
but generally speaking , it will also be pushing for a normalization of economic policies and will have to raise interest rates . angela göpfert interviewed ulrich kater -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but one can see that the amounts the banks have pumped into the markets in this very short-term liquidity intervention have continually decreased ; that was already evident last week , although it was often portrayed differently .
that speaks to conditions on the markets that are getting back to normal . how much responsibility do the central banks carry in whether the financial markets continue to calm down , or whether there will be more panicked reactions ?
the central banks are simply the fundament on which the money markets are based .
the markets , however , are currently suffering from an intense phenomenon of the masses : even though trust in one 's business partner is the most important commodity on the markets , every market participant is under the general suspicion of not being able to live up to his promises .
the central banks are there to ease fears so that so that things will settle down .
i think confidence in the markets will return , especially given the basic economic data .
is n't there a risk that investors can now rely on the banks too much ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's up to central banks to make sure credit markets have the liquidity they need no .
the central banks have an obligation only for short-term interventions .
investors , on the other hand , plan months , quarters and years in advance .
in moments of crisis , everything always appears very dramatic , but at second glance , when the markets return to normal , the investors will also see that the basic economic figures are on track and that the global economy continues to be very dynamic .
how were things in the past ?
did the central banks , especially the federal reserve bank under alan greenspan at that time , always fulfill their obligations ?
could interest rate policies in the us have been one of the reasons for the current crisis ?
there were good reasons back then for lowering the interest rates so much .
the fed wanted to control the macro-economic consequences of the stock market bubble that burst in 2001 , and it managed to do that .
but now we are seeing the collateral damage of these interest rate policies .
the sense of danger among market participants became too sedated by the " medicine " of low interest rates .
in hindsight , it probably would have been better if the central banks had started raising their interest rates a year earlier .
but even central bank professionals do not have 20/20 vision for the future .
the lesson that should be learned from this is not to underestimate the danger of interest rates that are too low for loans .
the lack of liquidity on the global markets has also highlighted the interest policies of the bank of japan .
can we expect it to raise its rates , thus intensifying the crisis ?
even last year , japan 's central bank policies were slower to move than expected .
it is possible that , due to liquidity shortages on the markets , the bank of japan will postpone its plans for raising interest rates in august - perhaps just for a month .
but generally speaking , it will also be pushing for a normalization of economic policies and will have to raise interest rates . angela göpfert interviewed ulrich kater -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but is often criticized for lacking a consistent strategy , especially in afghanistan , where troops serve under three different mandates . the deployments are also stretching the bundeswehr , which is one of the reason 's chancellor merkel 's coalition gave for waving aside french president nicolas sarkozy 's call for european troops to protect refugees from darfur , according to the government . but many german parliamentarians consider the argument of depleted capacities an insufficient one .
they say this mission is necessary , precisely because it is a humanitarian one . at the same time , they want a debate about which missions the bundeswehr should take part in , and which should have priority . deutsche welle : mr. gerhardt , considering the drop in public acceptance of foreign peacekeeping missions , is there - at the least - a problem of communication between politicians and the people ?
is n't it time for a general debate on the purpose of the individual missions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang gerhardt wolfgang gerhard : yes .
as a government , or as a member of parliament or the opposition , each day you have to justify to society why you mobilize soldiers .
you have to have clear criteria .
and you have to go into this debate convincingly , with political leadership .
the security of our country is threatened by places in the world where there are problems , and it can only be ensured if we , along with other democratic nations , and with united nations mandates , can to some degree calm the world 's hot spots . but the priorities are also unclear .
some say the missions must be in germany 's interest .
is that definition justified ? in the interest of human dignity and in the interest of freedom and security in the world , i would add that is in germany 's interest .
that may sound generalized , but it can be more precise .
if we are unable to offer people in afghanistan an alternative to poppy-growing , where they supply practically the entire world with drugs , then deploying all those soldiers there is useless .
so a political solution must always accompany a military mission . so in addition to the military deployment , we have to think much more intensely about social structures there , with participation by the european union .
in darfur , where women are being raped , and human suffering is everywhere , it 's not a place where we can stay away - if the bundeswehr is capable of involvement - on moral or ethical grounds .
anyone who goes into congo to monitor elections should have strong arguments for not going into darfur . so you 're in favor of an engagement , of a bundeswehr mission to darfur ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african union said it could provide enough troops to protect darfur the first question is does the bundeswehr have the capacity to take part in what maybe action in darfur .
and the second reason is a moral question for me - the responsibility to protect is one of the important points of foreign policy in our times .
we see worldwide that there are governments who do not like to protect their own people , and though it is a responsibility for the community of democratic nations , with a legitimate mandate from the united nations to protect people , that 's a main reason for me to advocate participation of the bundeswehr if the bundeswehr is capable of doing so . can the bundeswehr do that ? if it can , then we should not stand on the sidelines .
my moral justification for that does n't exist in a vacuum of course - we have to know if the bundeswehr can do it , if it has the capacities to get involved .
and who else would take part ?
all of that has not yet been answered .
but if there is a special humane reason to protect people , then darfur is an important place for it . why do you think then that the german government is being so reticent about committing troops to darfur ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suffering of sudan 's refugees needs to be made clear to germans , gerhardt said i believe the government has a hard time with this rejection .
for moral and ethical reasons , it must realize this responsibility to protect , when human rights are discussed , for instance in the united nations .
we have to clear all the deployment mandates and all the soldiers we have worldwide .
we have to ask ourselves what is the reason , what is the aim , where is the escape , is the task fulfilled ? we had a mission in congo , it was not a mission i would like to have .
it was for one day , or two days , we left congo and nothing is better there .
we have been in afghanistan for years , we have n't given the people an alternative for social security ; we have only deployed soldiers .
we have to fulfill mandates but not only with soldiers .
we have been looking on for years at the rape in darfur , at the brutality in darfur and we know that the government of sudan is not able to protect the people there . given the low support in germany for foreign peacekeeping missions , how will you sell this mission to darfur ? every conflict has a variety of reasons - the agricultural structure in the region , the ethnic split in this region .
but at the end of the day you have to convince people in which world we would like to live , and what is security for the federal republic of germany , and what are the necessary steps to protect europe .
if we are not able to calm conflicts in worldwide hotspots , we can not contribute to security policy in europe . dw-tv 's christopher springate interviewed wolfgang gerhardt -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts say a decline in construction is to blame . the seasonally-adjusted figure released by officials at the federal statistics office on tuesday came in well below the 0.5-percent growth in gross domestic product recorded in the first quarter .
exports continued to provide most of the impetus , although there were also indications of growing domestic expenditure .
domestic investment in machines and equipment rose significantly , while construction declined . " economic growth was based especially on the highly dynamic foreign trade , " the statistical office said , adding that domestic demand had made a " positive , though smaller contribution to growth . "
past the peak financial analysts said they were disappointed with the growth , adding that they had expected a slightly higher figure of 0.4 percent .
" a few weeks ago , we thought that it was going to be significantly stronger because of the good mood among companies and the labor market situation , " dirk schumacher of goldman sachs told reuters news service .
he added that the dip should be seen as a slip-up and that growth would again pick up in the third quarter .
" but we 've definitely surpassed the growth peak , " he added .
strong 2006 revised figures for 2006 meanwhile indicated that the economy grew faster than previously announced , with growth for the full year coming in at 2.9 percent , against the 2.8 percent previously reported .
government officials are forecasting growth of 2.3 percent in 2007 . article based on news reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de east germany -pipe- 14.08.2007 expert : no hard proof for east german shoot-to-kill order großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a preserved section of the former german-german border an expert on killings along the former german-german border told dw-world.de that a recently discovered shoot-to-kill order is irrelevant and will not spark new criminal probes that some politicians are calling for . berlin state prosecutors have said they 're considering opening a new criminal investigation into deaths at the berlin wall after a document resurfaced that contains orders to " stop or liquidate " anyone trying to escape to the west , including women and children . dw-world.de talked about the document with ferdinand von schirach , a berlin-based lawyer .
in the 1990s , schirach defended günter schabowksi in a trial of high-ranking east german officials for their role in the killings of people who had attempted to flee across the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schirach -lrb- left -rrb- and schabowski during the trial schabowski , a member of the east german politburo who became famous for announcing the fall of the berlin wall , was convicted of manslaughter and accepted moral responsibility for the killings .
he was sentenced to three years in prison and pardoned after six months behind bars . schirach 's involvement in the case also made headlines because he is the grandson of baldur von schirach , the former leader of the nazi hitler youth , who was found guilty of crimes against humanity and served 20 years in prison . dw-world.de : what 's the significance of the resurfaced shoot-to-kill order ? ferdinand von schirach : it 's negligible .
it 's a document that 's been known for a long time to everyone involved , including the berlin state prosecutor 's office , which now claims that it has to investigate this again .
this piece of paper has no known author and no clear addressee .
it 's a simple piece of paper that could have been written by anyone and that will not hold up for convictions or even the initiation of a criminal investigation . of course you have to say - and that 's probably the best thing that can be said about this piece of paper - that it 's circumstantial evidence for the cruelty of the border fortifications and the guarding of the border .
but one should n't think that this is a piece of paper that the courts have been looking for for years and that places guilt on a certain person without a doubt or is able to describe the system as a whole . could you say then that it 's a historically interesting but legally irrelevant document ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler , the head of the agency that administers the stasi files it 's not irrelevant from a legal standpoint , because even circumstantial evidence is relevant .
it 's certainly interesting from a historic perspective , but it 's not unique - there were several of these documents . the thing that 's maybe interesting from a historic perspective is that the head of a federal agency has gone so far off the rails that she thinks that she can make policy with this on the anniversary of the construction of the wall .
-lrb- marianne birthler heads the so-called " birthler authority , " the unofficial name given to the government office responsible for researching the history of the gdr 's secret police , the stasi -rrb- .we need to get away from handling these issues in a sensationalist way . it 's a serious issue and as the head of such an agency , you can not push such a paper into the public realm and claim to reveal something completely new even though it 's been known for a long time .
in my opinion , it will also have to lead to a discussion about what should be done with the agency . why do you think that this surfaced right now ? because of the anniversary of the construction of the wall .
-lrb- this week marked the 46th anniversary of the building of the berlin wall -rrb- there 's no other reason in my opinion .
the paper has been known , the state prosecutors received a number of such papers for investigations years ago , and none of them played any role in any of the trials .
it 's a little trite to say : i have now found the document that offers conclusive proof for everything . let 's take a step back and think about what this shoot-to-kill order actually means .
it meant that the gdr forcefully prevented its people from doing nothing more than trying to leave the country .
that 's what 's condemnable about this system and the courts ruled accordingly .
they declared - questionable from a legal standpoint but correct from a moral one - that such systems are inhuman and that this deserves to be punished . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : white crosses serve as memorials to those killed while trying to cross the wall now , many years after the trials , someone comes and says : now , i have the piece of paper that makes it perfectly clear that the gdr had such an order -lsb- to shoot and kill -rsb- .
but that was n't the case .
this clear-cut order was n't confirmed by any of the witnesses or any outsider .
it did not exist in a single document . it 's not a secret that these young border patrols shot at people and that many people died there .
it is a historic fact .
but that does n't mean that we can turn around and say : there was a clear order to shoot women and children .
i think that 's nonsense .
these systems were also too intelligent to do something like this .
the border patrols were put under oath every morning and had to swear on all sorts of orders that were given there .
for all intents and purposes , it did what 's written in this ominous paper , but no one in the gdr would have said something like this . several politicians have called for an investigation into possible legal action .
do you think any legal action will be taken ? it definitely wo n't happen .
the prosecutor 's office already had these papers and could have checked them a long time ago .
i 'm absolutely certain that nothing that 's relevant in terms of criminal law can come from this kind of document . mathis winkler interviewed ferdinand von schirach send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but is often criticized for lacking a consistent strategy , especially in afghanistan , where troops serve under three different mandates . the deployments are also stretching the bundeswehr , which is one of the reason 's chancellor merkel 's coalition gave for waving aside french president nicolas sarkozy 's call for european troops to protect refugees from darfur , according to the government . but many german parliamentarians consider the argument of depleted capacities an insufficient one .
they say this mission is necessary , precisely because it is a humanitarian one . at the same time , they want a debate about which missions the bundeswehr should take part in , and which should have priority . deutsche welle : mr. gerhardt , considering the drop in public acceptance of foreign peacekeeping missions , is there - at the least - a problem of communication between politicians and the people ?
is n't it time for a general debate on the purpose of the individual missions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang gerhardt wolfgang gerhard : yes .
as a government , or as a member of parliament or the opposition , each day you have to justify to society why you mobilize soldiers .
you have to have clear criteria .
and you have to go into this debate convincingly , with political leadership .
the security of our country is threatened by places in the world where there are problems , and it can only be ensured if we , along with other democratic nations , and with united nations mandates , can to some degree calm the world 's hot spots . but the priorities are also unclear .
some say the missions must be in germany 's interest .
is that definition justified ? in the interest of human dignity and in the interest of freedom and security in the world , i would add that is in germany 's interest .
that may sound generalized , but it can be more precise .
if we are unable to offer people in afghanistan an alternative to poppy-growing , where they supply practically the entire world with drugs , then deploying all those soldiers there is useless .
so a political solution must always accompany a military mission . so in addition to the military deployment , we have to think much more intensely about social structures there , with participation by the european union .
in darfur , where women are being raped , and human suffering is everywhere , it 's not a place where we can stay away - if the bundeswehr is capable of involvement - on moral or ethical grounds .
anyone who goes into congo to monitor elections should have strong arguments for not going into darfur . so you 're in favor of an engagement , of a bundeswehr mission to darfur ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african union said it could provide enough troops to protect darfur the first question is does the bundeswehr have the capacity to take part in what maybe action in darfur .
and the second reason is a moral question for me - the responsibility to protect is one of the important points of foreign policy in our times .
we see worldwide that there are governments who do not like to protect their own people , and though it is a responsibility for the community of democratic nations , with a legitimate mandate from the united nations to protect people , that 's a main reason for me to advocate participation of the bundeswehr if the bundeswehr is capable of doing so . can the bundeswehr do that ? if it can , then we should not stand on the sidelines .
my moral justification for that does n't exist in a vacuum of course - we have to know if the bundeswehr can do it , if it has the capacities to get involved .
and who else would take part ?
all of that has not yet been answered .
but if there is a special humane reason to protect people , then darfur is an important place for it . why do you think then that the german government is being so reticent about committing troops to darfur ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suffering of sudan 's refugees needs to be made clear to germans , gerhardt said i believe the government has a hard time with this rejection .
for moral and ethical reasons , it must realize this responsibility to protect , when human rights are discussed , for instance in the united nations .
we have to clear all the deployment mandates and all the soldiers we have worldwide .
we have to ask ourselves what is the reason , what is the aim , where is the escape , is the task fulfilled ? we had a mission in congo , it was not a mission i would like to have .
it was for one day , or two days , we left congo and nothing is better there .
we have been in afghanistan for years , we have n't given the people an alternative for social security ; we have only deployed soldiers .
we have to fulfill mandates but not only with soldiers .
we have been looking on for years at the rape in darfur , at the brutality in darfur and we know that the government of sudan is not able to protect the people there . given the low support in germany for foreign peacekeeping missions , how will you sell this mission to darfur ? every conflict has a variety of reasons - the agricultural structure in the region , the ethnic split in this region .
but at the end of the day you have to convince people in which world we would like to live , and what is security for the federal republic of germany , and what are the necessary steps to protect europe .
if we are not able to calm conflicts in worldwide hotspots , we can not contribute to security policy in europe . dw-tv 's christopher springate interviewed wolfgang gerhardt -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but is often criticized for lacking a consistent strategy , especially in afghanistan , where troops serve under three different mandates . the deployments are also stretching the bundeswehr , which is one of the reason 's chancellor merkel 's coalition gave for waving aside french president nicolas sarkozy 's call for european troops to protect refugees from darfur , according to the government . but many german parliamentarians consider the argument of depleted capacities an insufficient one .
they say this mission is necessary , precisely because it is a humanitarian one . at the same time , they want a debate about which missions the bundeswehr should take part in , and which should have priority . deutsche welle : mr. gerhardt , considering the drop in public acceptance of foreign peacekeeping missions , is there - at the least - a problem of communication between politicians and the people ?
is n't it time for a general debate on the purpose of the individual missions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang gerhardt wolfgang gerhard : yes .
as a government , or as a member of parliament or the opposition , each day you have to justify to society why you mobilize soldiers .
you have to have clear criteria .
and you have to go into this debate convincingly , with political leadership .
the security of our country is threatened by places in the world where there are problems , and it can only be ensured if we , along with other democratic nations , and with united nations mandates , can to some degree calm the world 's hot spots . but the priorities are also unclear .
some say the missions must be in germany 's interest .
is that definition justified ? in the interest of human dignity and in the interest of freedom and security in the world , i would add that is in germany 's interest .
that may sound generalized , but it can be more precise .
if we are unable to offer people in afghanistan an alternative to poppy-growing , where they supply practically the entire world with drugs , then deploying all those soldiers there is useless .
so a political solution must always accompany a military mission . so in addition to the military deployment , we have to think much more intensely about social structures there , with participation by the european union .
in darfur , where women are being raped , and human suffering is everywhere , it 's not a place where we can stay away - if the bundeswehr is capable of involvement - on moral or ethical grounds .
anyone who goes into congo to monitor elections should have strong arguments for not going into darfur . so you 're in favor of an engagement , of a bundeswehr mission to darfur ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african union said it could provide enough troops to protect darfur the first question is does the bundeswehr have the capacity to take part in what maybe action in darfur .
and the second reason is a moral question for me - the responsibility to protect is one of the important points of foreign policy in our times .
we see worldwide that there are governments who do not like to protect their own people , and though it is a responsibility for the community of democratic nations , with a legitimate mandate from the united nations to protect people , that 's a main reason for me to advocate participation of the bundeswehr if the bundeswehr is capable of doing so . can the bundeswehr do that ? if it can , then we should not stand on the sidelines .
my moral justification for that does n't exist in a vacuum of course - we have to know if the bundeswehr can do it , if it has the capacities to get involved .
and who else would take part ?
all of that has not yet been answered .
but if there is a special humane reason to protect people , then darfur is an important place for it . why do you think then that the german government is being so reticent about committing troops to darfur ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suffering of sudan 's refugees needs to be made clear to germans , gerhardt said i believe the government has a hard time with this rejection .
for moral and ethical reasons , it must realize this responsibility to protect , when human rights are discussed , for instance in the united nations .

the security of our country is threatened by places in the world where there are problems , and it can only be ensured if we , along with other democratic nations , and with united nations mandates , can to some degree calm the world 's hot spots . but the priorities are also unclear .
some say the missions must be in germany 's interest .
is that definition justified ? in the interest of human dignity and in the interest of freedom and security in the world , i would add that is in germany 's interest .
that may sound generalized , but it can be more precise .
if we are unable to offer people in afghanistan an alternative to poppy-growing , where they supply practically the entire world with drugs , then deploying all those soldiers there is useless .
so a political solution must always accompany a military mission . so in addition to the military deployment , we have to think much more intensely about social structures there , with participation by the european union .
in darfur , where women are being raped , and human suffering is everywhere , it 's not a place where we can stay away - if the bundeswehr is capable of involvement - on moral or ethical grounds .
anyone who goes into congo to monitor elections should have strong arguments for not going into darfur . so you 're in favor of an engagement , of a bundeswehr mission to darfur ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african union said it could provide enough troops to protect darfur the first question is does the bundeswehr have the capacity to take part in what maybe action in darfur .
and the second reason is a moral question for me - the responsibility to protect is one of the important points of foreign policy in our times .
we see worldwide that there are governments who do not like to protect their own people , and though it is a responsibility for the community of democratic nations , with a legitimate mandate from the united nations to protect people , that 's a main reason for me to advocate participation of the bundeswehr if the bundeswehr is capable of doing so . can the bundeswehr do that ? if it can , then we should not stand on the sidelines .
my moral justification for that does n't exist in a vacuum of course - we have to know if the bundeswehr can do it , if it has the capacities to get involved .
and who else would take part ?
all of that has not yet been answered .
but if there is a special humane reason to protect people , then darfur is an important place for it . why do you think then that the german government is being so reticent about committing troops to darfur ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suffering of sudan 's refugees needs to be made clear to germans , gerhardt said i believe the government has a hard time with this rejection .
for moral and ethical reasons , it must realize this responsibility to protect , when human rights are discussed , for instance in the united nations .
we have to clear all the deployment mandates and all the soldiers we have worldwide .
we have to ask ourselves what is the reason , what is the aim , where is the escape , is the task fulfilled ? we had a mission in congo , it was not a mission i would like to have .
it was for one day , or two days , we left congo and nothing is better there .
we have been in afghanistan for years , we have n't given the people an alternative for social security ; we have only deployed soldiers .
we have to fulfill mandates but not only with soldiers .
we have been looking on for years at the rape in darfur , at the brutality in darfur and we know that the government of sudan is not able to protect the people there . given the low support in germany for foreign peacekeeping missions , how will you sell this mission to darfur ? every conflict has a variety of reasons - the agricultural structure in the region , the ethnic split in this region .
but at the end of the day you have to convince people in which world we would like to live , and what is security for the federal republic of germany , and what are the necessary steps to protect europe .
if we are not able to calm conflicts in worldwide hotspots , we can not contribute to security policy in europe . dw-tv 's christopher springate interviewed wolfgang gerhardt -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

experts say a decline in construction is to blame . the seasonally-adjusted figure released by officials at the federal statistics office on tuesday came in well below the 0.5-percent growth in gross domestic product recorded in the first quarter .
exports continued to provide most of the impetus , although there were also indications of growing domestic expenditure .
domestic investment in machines and equipment rose significantly , while construction declined . " economic growth was based especially on the highly dynamic foreign trade , " the statistical office said , adding that domestic demand had made a " positive , though smaller contribution to growth . "
past the peak financial analysts said they were disappointed with the growth , adding that they had expected a slightly higher figure of 0.4 percent .
" a few weeks ago , we thought that it was going to be significantly stronger because of the good mood among companies and the labor market situation , " dirk schumacher of goldman sachs told reuters news service .

the frankfurt-based central bank has injected over 200 million euros into the financial system since thursday .
thanks in part to a several central banks intervening worldwide , t he ecb described conditions in the money market as now " close to normal . "
dw-world.de spoke with ulrich kater , of germany 's dekabank , who said that market participants underestimated risks involved in the us federal reserve bank 's low-interest-rate policies .
dw-world.de : the central banks have been massively pumping money into markets - in unheard of amounts since the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the us .
are the banks living up to their responsibilities , or is this a sign of a real crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich kater , of the dekabank ulrich kater : the central banks have a responsibility to ensure that the money markets can function .
if the demand for liquidity rises to a point that money markets can not satisfy , then it is clearly the obligation of the central banks to provide liquidity .
but one can see that the amounts the banks have pumped into the markets in this very short-term liquidity intervention have continually decreased ; that was already evident last week , although it was often portrayed differently .
that speaks to conditions on the markets that are getting back to normal . how much responsibility do the central banks carry in whether the financial markets continue to calm down , or whether there will be more panicked reactions ?
the central banks are simply the fundament on which the money markets are based .
the markets , however , are currently suffering from an intense phenomenon of the masses : even though trust in one 's business partner is the most important commodity on the markets , every market participant is under the general suspicion of not being able to live up to his promises .
the central banks are there to ease fears so that so that things will settle down .
i think confidence in the markets will return , especially given the basic economic data .
is n't there a risk that investors can now rely on the banks too much ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's up to central banks to make sure credit markets have the liquidity they need no .
the central banks have an obligation only for short-term interventions .
investors , on the other hand , plan months , quarters and years in advance .
in moments of crisis , everything always appears very dramatic , but at second glance , when the markets return to normal , the investors will also see that the basic economic figures are on track and that the global economy continues to be very dynamic .
how were things in the past ?
did the central banks , especially the federal reserve bank under alan greenspan at that time , always fulfill their obligations ?
could interest rate policies in the us have been one of the reasons for the current crisis ?
there were good reasons back then for lowering the interest rates so much .
the fed wanted to control the macro-economic consequences of the stock market bubble that burst in 2001 , and it managed to do that .
but now we are seeing the collateral damage of these interest rate policies .
the sense of danger among market participants became too sedated by the " medicine " of low interest rates .
in hindsight , it probably would have been better if the central banks had started raising their interest rates a year earlier .
but even central bank professionals do not have 20/20 vision for the future .
the lesson that should be learned from this is not to underestimate the danger of interest rates that are too low for loans .
the lack of liquidity on the global markets has also highlighted the interest policies of the bank of japan .
can we expect it to raise its rates , thus intensifying the crisis ?
even last year , japan 's central bank policies were slower to move than expected .
it is possible that , due to liquidity shortages on the markets , the bank of japan will postpone its plans for raising interest rates in august - perhaps just for a month .
but generally speaking , it will also be pushing for a normalization of economic policies and will have to raise interest rates . angela göpfert interviewed ulrich kater -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

dw-world.de spoke with ulrich kater , of germany 's dekabank , who said that market participants underestimated risks involved in the us federal reserve bank 's low-interest-rate policies .
dw-world.de : the central banks have been massively pumping money into markets - in unheard of amounts since the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the us .
are the banks living up to their responsibilities , or is this a sign of a real crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich kater , of the dekabank ulrich kater : the central banks have a responsibility to ensure that the money markets can function .
if the demand for liquidity rises to a point that money markets can not satisfy , then it is clearly the obligation of the central banks to provide liquidity .
but one can see that the amounts the banks have pumped into the markets in this very short-term liquidity intervention have continually decreased ; that was already evident last week , although it was often portrayed differently .
that speaks to conditions on the markets that are getting back to normal . how much responsibility do the central banks carry in whether the financial markets continue to calm down , or whether there will be more panicked reactions ?
the central banks are simply the fundament on which the money markets are based .
the markets , however , are currently suffering from an intense phenomenon of the masses : even though trust in one 's business partner is the most important commodity on the markets , every market participant is under the general suspicion of not being able to live up to his promises .
the central banks are there to ease fears so that so that things will settle down .
i think confidence in the markets will return , especially given the basic economic data .
is n't there a risk that investors can now rely on the banks too much ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's up to central banks to make sure credit markets have the liquidity they need no .
the central banks have an obligation only for short-term interventions .
investors , on the other hand , plan months , quarters and years in advance .
in moments of crisis , everything always appears very dramatic , but at second glance , when the markets return to normal , the investors will also see that the basic economic figures are on track and that the global economy continues to be very dynamic .
how were things in the past ?
did the central banks , especially the federal reserve bank under alan greenspan at that time , always fulfill their obligations ?
could interest rate policies in the us have been one of the reasons for the current crisis ?
there were good reasons back then for lowering the interest rates so much .
the fed wanted to control the macro-economic consequences of the stock market bubble that burst in 2001 , and it managed to do that .
but now we are seeing the collateral damage of these interest rate policies .
the sense of danger among market participants became too sedated by the " medicine " of low interest rates .
in hindsight , it probably would have been better if the central banks had started raising their interest rates a year earlier .
but even central bank professionals do not have 20/20 vision for the future .
the lesson that should be learned from this is not to underestimate the danger of interest rates that are too low for loans .
the lack of liquidity on the global markets has also highlighted the interest policies of the bank of japan .
can we expect it to raise its rates , thus intensifying the crisis ?
even last year , japan 's central bank policies were slower to move than expected .
it is possible that , due to liquidity shortages on the markets , the bank of japan will postpone its plans for raising interest rates in august - perhaps just for a month .
but generally speaking , it will also be pushing for a normalization of economic policies and will have to raise interest rates . angela göpfert interviewed ulrich kater -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

i think confidence in the markets will return , especially given the basic economic data .
is n't there a risk that investors can now rely on the banks too much ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's up to central banks to make sure credit markets have the liquidity they need no .
the central banks have an obligation only for short-term interventions .
investors , on the other hand , plan months , quarters and years in advance .
in moments of crisis , everything always appears very dramatic , but at second glance , when the markets return to normal , the investors will also see that the basic economic figures are on track and that the global economy continues to be very dynamic .
how were things in the past ?
did the central banks , especially the federal reserve bank under alan greenspan at that time , always fulfill their obligations ?
could interest rate policies in the us have been one of the reasons for the current crisis ?
there were good reasons back then for lowering the interest rates so much .
the fed wanted to control the macro-economic consequences of the stock market bubble that burst in 2001 , and it managed to do that .
but now we are seeing the collateral damage of these interest rate policies .
the sense of danger among market participants became too sedated by the " medicine " of low interest rates .
in hindsight , it probably would have been better if the central banks had started raising their interest rates a year earlier .
but even central bank professionals do not have 20/20 vision for the future .
the lesson that should be learned from this is not to underestimate the danger of interest rates that are too low for loans .
the lack of liquidity on the global markets has also highlighted the interest policies of the bank of japan .
can we expect it to raise its rates , thus intensifying the crisis ?
even last year , japan 's central bank policies were slower to move than expected .
it is possible that , due to liquidity shortages on the markets , the bank of japan will postpone its plans for raising interest rates in august - perhaps just for a month .
but generally speaking , it will also be pushing for a normalization of economic policies and will have to raise interest rates . angela göpfert interviewed ulrich kater -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it 's a document that 's been known for a long time to everyone involved , including the berlin state prosecutor 's office , which now claims that it has to investigate this again .

this piece of paper has no known author and no clear addressee .
it 's a simple piece of paper that could have been written by anyone and that will not hold up for convictions or even the initiation of a criminal investigation . of course you have to say - and that 's probably the best thing that can be said about this piece of paper - that it 's circumstantial evidence for the cruelty of the border fortifications and the guarding of the border .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de peacekeeping -pipe- 14.08.2007 politician wants more german help for darfur großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 300,000 people have been killed and 2 million displaced in darfur since 2003 wolfgang gerhard , foreign policy advisor for the opposition free-market liberal fdp , spoke to deutsche welle about german concerns regarding international peacekeeping missions and why germany 's army should be in darfur . at present the german army , the bundeswehr , is taking part in nine missions abroad .
but is often criticized for lacking a consistent strategy , especially in afghanistan , where troops serve under three different mandates . the deployments are also stretching the bundeswehr , which is one of the reason 's chancellor merkel 's coalition gave for waving aside french president nicolas sarkozy 's call for european troops to protect refugees from darfur , according to the government . but many german parliamentarians consider the argument of depleted capacities an insufficient one .
they say this mission is necessary , precisely because it is a humanitarian one . at the same time , they want a debate about which missions the bundeswehr should take part in , and which should have priority . deutsche welle : mr. gerhardt , considering the drop in public acceptance of foreign peacekeeping missions , is there - at the least - a problem of communication between politicians and the people ?
is n't it time for a general debate on the purpose of the individual missions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang gerhardt wolfgang gerhard : yes .
as a government , or as a member of parliament or the opposition , each day you have to justify to society why you mobilize soldiers .
you have to have clear criteria .
and you have to go into this debate convincingly , with political leadership .
the security of our country is threatened by places in the world where there are problems , and it can only be ensured if we , along with other democratic nations , and with united nations mandates , can to some degree calm the world 's hot spots . but the priorities are also unclear .
some say the missions must be in germany 's interest .
is that definition justified ? in the interest of human dignity and in the interest of freedom and security in the world , i would add that is in germany 's interest .
that may sound generalized , but it can be more precise .
if we are unable to offer people in afghanistan an alternative to poppy-growing , where they supply practically the entire world with drugs , then deploying all those soldiers there is useless .
so a political solution must always accompany a military mission . so in addition to the military deployment , we have to think much more intensely about social structures there , with participation by the european union .
in darfur , where women are being raped , and human suffering is everywhere , it 's not a place where we can stay away - if the bundeswehr is capable of involvement - on moral or ethical grounds .
anyone who goes into congo to monitor elections should have strong arguments for not going into darfur . so you 're in favor of an engagement , of a bundeswehr mission to darfur ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african union said it could provide enough troops to protect darfur the first question is does the bundeswehr have the capacity to take part in what maybe action in darfur .
and the second reason is a moral question for me - the responsibility to protect is one of the important points of foreign policy in our times .
we see worldwide that there are governments who do not like to protect their own people , and though it is a responsibility for the community of democratic nations , with a legitimate mandate from the united nations to protect people , that 's a main reason for me to advocate participation of the bundeswehr if the bundeswehr is capable of doing so . can the bundeswehr do that ? if it can , then we should not stand on the sidelines .
my moral justification for that does n't exist in a vacuum of course - we have to know if the bundeswehr can do it , if it has the capacities to get involved .
and who else would take part ?
all of that has not yet been answered .
but if there is a special humane reason to protect people , then darfur is an important place for it . why do you think then that the german government is being so reticent about committing troops to darfur ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suffering of sudan 's refugees needs to be made clear to germans , gerhardt said i believe the government has a hard time with this rejection .
for moral and ethical reasons , it must realize this responsibility to protect , when human rights are discussed , for instance in the united nations .
we have to clear all the deployment mandates and all the soldiers we have worldwide .
we have to ask ourselves what is the reason , what is the aim , where is the escape , is the task fulfilled ? we had a mission in congo , it was not a mission i would like to have .
it was for one day , or two days , we left congo and nothing is better there .
we have been in afghanistan for years , we have n't given the people an alternative for social security ; we have only deployed soldiers .
we have to fulfill mandates but not only with soldiers .
we have been looking on for years at the rape in darfur , at the brutality in darfur and we know that the government of sudan is not able to protect the people there . given the low support in germany for foreign peacekeeping missions , how will you sell this mission to darfur ? every conflict has a variety of reasons - the agricultural structure in the region , the ethnic split in this region .
but at the end of the day you have to convince people in which world we would like to live , and what is security for the federal republic of germany , and what are the necessary steps to protect europe .
if we are not able to calm conflicts in worldwide hotspots , we can not contribute to security policy in europe . dw-tv 's christopher springate interviewed wolfgang gerhardt -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de un approves largest-ever peace mission for darfur after months of a tug-of-war with sudan , the un security council has authorized the deployment of some 26,000 un and african union troops to the darfur region .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de peacekeeping -pipe- 14.08.2007 politician wants more german help for darfur großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 300,000 people have been killed and 2 million displaced in darfur since 2003 wolfgang gerhard , foreign policy advisor for the opposition free-market liberal fdp , spoke to deutsche welle about german concerns regarding international peacekeeping missions and why germany 's army should be in darfur . at present the german army , the bundeswehr , is taking part in nine missions abroad .
but is often criticized for lacking a consistent strategy , especially in afghanistan , where troops serve under three different mandates . the deployments are also stretching the bundeswehr , which is one of the reason 's chancellor merkel 's coalition gave for waving aside french president nicolas sarkozy 's call for european troops to protect refugees from darfur , according to the government . but many german parliamentarians consider the argument of depleted capacities an insufficient one .
they say this mission is necessary , precisely because it is a humanitarian one . at the same time , they want a debate about which missions the bundeswehr should take part in , and which should have priority . deutsche welle : mr. gerhardt , considering the drop in public acceptance of foreign peacekeeping missions , is there - at the least - a problem of communication between politicians and the people ?
is n't it time for a general debate on the purpose of the individual missions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang gerhardt wolfgang gerhard : yes .
as a government , or as a member of parliament or the opposition , each day you have to justify to society why you mobilize soldiers .
you have to have clear criteria .
and you have to go into this debate convincingly , with political leadership .
the security of our country is threatened by places in the world where there are problems , and it can only be ensured if we , along with other democratic nations , and with united nations mandates , can to some degree calm the world 's hot spots . but the priorities are also unclear .
some say the missions must be in germany 's interest .
is that definition justified ? in the interest of human dignity and in the interest of freedom and security in the world , i would add that is in germany 's interest .
that may sound generalized , but it can be more precise .
if we are unable to offer people in afghanistan an alternative to poppy-growing , where they supply practically the entire world with drugs , then deploying all those soldiers there is useless .
so a political solution must always accompany a military mission . so in addition to the military deployment , we have to think much more intensely about social structures there , with participation by the european union .
in darfur , where women are being raped , and human suffering is everywhere , it 's not a place where we can stay away - if the bundeswehr is capable of involvement - on moral or ethical grounds .
anyone who goes into congo to monitor elections should have strong arguments for not going into darfur . so you 're in favor of an engagement , of a bundeswehr mission to darfur ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african union said it could provide enough troops to protect darfur the first question is does the bundeswehr have the capacity to take part in what maybe action in darfur .
and the second reason is a moral question for me - the responsibility to protect is one of the important points of foreign policy in our times .
we see worldwide that there are governments who do not like to protect their own people , and though it is a responsibility for the community of democratic nations , with a legitimate mandate from the united nations to protect people , that 's a main reason for me to advocate participation of the bundeswehr if the bundeswehr is capable of doing so . can the bundeswehr do that ? if it can , then we should not stand on the sidelines .
my moral justification for that does n't exist in a vacuum of course - we have to know if the bundeswehr can do it , if it has the capacities to get involved .
and who else would take part ?
all of that has not yet been answered .
but if there is a special humane reason to protect people , then darfur is an important place for it . why do you think then that the german government is being so reticent about committing troops to darfur ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suffering of sudan 's refugees needs to be made clear to germans , gerhardt said i believe the government has a hard time with this rejection .
for moral and ethical reasons , it must realize this responsibility to protect , when human rights are discussed , for instance in the united nations .
we have to clear all the deployment mandates and all the soldiers we have worldwide .
we have to ask ourselves what is the reason , what is the aim , where is the escape , is the task fulfilled ? we had a mission in congo , it was not a mission i would like to have .
it was for one day , or two days , we left congo and nothing is better there .
we have been in afghanistan for years , we have n't given the people an alternative for social security ; we have only deployed soldiers .
we have to fulfill mandates but not only with soldiers .
we have been looking on for years at the rape in darfur , at the brutality in darfur and we know that the government of sudan is not able to protect the people there . given the low support in germany for foreign peacekeeping missions , how will you sell this mission to darfur ? every conflict has a variety of reasons - the agricultural structure in the region , the ethnic split in this region .
but at the end of the day you have to convince people in which world we would like to live , and what is security for the federal republic of germany , and what are the necessary steps to protect europe .
if we are not able to calm conflicts in worldwide hotspots , we can not contribute to security policy in europe . dw-tv 's christopher springate interviewed wolfgang gerhardt -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but is often criticized for lacking a consistent strategy , especially in afghanistan , where troops serve under three different mandates . the deployments are also stretching the bundeswehr , which is one of the reason 's chancellor merkel 's coalition gave for waving aside french president nicolas sarkozy 's call for european troops to protect refugees from darfur , according to the government . but many german parliamentarians consider the argument of depleted capacities an insufficient one .
they say this mission is necessary , precisely because it is a humanitarian one . at the same time , they want a debate about which missions the bundeswehr should take part in , and which should have priority . deutsche welle : mr. gerhardt , considering the drop in public acceptance of foreign peacekeeping missions , is there - at the least - a problem of communication between politicians and the people ?
is n't it time for a general debate on the purpose of the individual missions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang gerhardt wolfgang gerhard : yes .
as a government , or as a member of parliament or the opposition , each day you have to justify to society why you mobilize soldiers .
you have to have clear criteria .
and you have to go into this debate convincingly , with political leadership .
the security of our country is threatened by places in the world where there are problems , and it can only be ensured if we , along with other democratic nations , and with united nations mandates , can to some degree calm the world 's hot spots . but the priorities are also unclear .
some say the missions must be in germany 's interest .
is that definition justified ? in the interest of human dignity and in the interest of freedom and security in the world , i would add that is in germany 's interest .
that may sound generalized , but it can be more precise .
if we are unable to offer people in afghanistan an alternative to poppy-growing , where they supply practically the entire world with drugs , then deploying all those soldiers there is useless .
so a political solution must always accompany a military mission . so in addition to the military deployment , we have to think much more intensely about social structures there , with participation by the european union .
in darfur , where women are being raped , and human suffering is everywhere , it 's not a place where we can stay away - if the bundeswehr is capable of involvement - on moral or ethical grounds .
anyone who goes into congo to monitor elections should have strong arguments for not going into darfur . so you 're in favor of an engagement , of a bundeswehr mission to darfur ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african union said it could provide enough troops to protect darfur the first question is does the bundeswehr have the capacity to take part in what maybe action in darfur .
and the second reason is a moral question for me - the responsibility to protect is one of the important points of foreign policy in our times .
we see worldwide that there are governments who do not like to protect their own people , and though it is a responsibility for the community of democratic nations , with a legitimate mandate from the united nations to protect people , that 's a main reason for me to advocate participation of the bundeswehr if the bundeswehr is capable of doing so . can the bundeswehr do that ? if it can , then we should not stand on the sidelines .
my moral justification for that does n't exist in a vacuum of course - we have to know if the bundeswehr can do it , if it has the capacities to get involved .
and who else would take part ?
all of that has not yet been answered .
but if there is a special humane reason to protect people , then darfur is an important place for it . why do you think then that the german government is being so reticent about committing troops to darfur ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suffering of sudan 's refugees needs to be made clear to germans , gerhardt said i believe the government has a hard time with this rejection .
for moral and ethical reasons , it must realize this responsibility to protect , when human rights are discussed , for instance in the united nations .
we have to clear all the deployment mandates and all the soldiers we have worldwide .
we have to ask ourselves what is the reason , what is the aim , where is the escape , is the task fulfilled ? we had a mission in congo , it was not a mission i would like to have .
it was for one day , or two days , we left congo and nothing is better there .
we have been in afghanistan for years , we have n't given the people an alternative for social security ; we have only deployed soldiers .
we have to fulfill mandates but not only with soldiers .
we have been looking on for years at the rape in darfur , at the brutality in darfur and we know that the government of sudan is not able to protect the people there . given the low support in germany for foreign peacekeeping missions , how will you sell this mission to darfur ? every conflict has a variety of reasons - the agricultural structure in the region , the ethnic split in this region .
but at the end of the day you have to convince people in which world we would like to live , and what is security for the federal republic of germany , and what are the necessary steps to protect europe .

experts say a decline in construction is to blame . the seasonally-adjusted figure released by officials at the federal statistics office on tuesday came in well below the 0.5-percent growth in gross domestic product recorded in the first quarter .
exports continued to provide most of the impetus , although there were also indications of growing domestic expenditure .
domestic investment in machines and equipment rose significantly , while construction declined . " economic growth was based especially on the highly dynamic foreign trade , " the statistical office said , adding that domestic demand had made a " positive , though smaller contribution to growth . "
past the peak financial analysts said they were disappointed with the growth , adding that they had expected a slightly higher figure of 0.4 percent .
" a few weeks ago , we thought that it was going to be significantly stronger because of the good mood among companies and the labor market situation , " dirk schumacher of goldman sachs told reuters news service .
he added that the dip should be seen as a slip-up and that growth would again pick up in the third quarter .
" but we 've definitely surpassed the growth peak , " he added .
strong 2006 revised figures for 2006 meanwhile indicated that the economy grew faster than previously announced , with growth for the full year coming in at 2.9 percent , against the 2.8 percent previously reported .

the frankfurt-based central bank has injected over 200 million euros into the financial system since thursday .
thanks in part to a several central banks intervening worldwide , t he ecb described conditions in the money market as now " close to normal . "
dw-world.de spoke with ulrich kater , of germany 's dekabank , who said that market participants underestimated risks involved in the us federal reserve bank 's low-interest-rate policies .
dw-world.de : the central banks have been massively pumping money into markets - in unheard of amounts since the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the us .
are the banks living up to their responsibilities , or is this a sign of a real crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich kater , of the dekabank ulrich kater : the central banks have a responsibility to ensure that the money markets can function .
if the demand for liquidity rises to a point that money markets can not satisfy , then it is clearly the obligation of the central banks to provide liquidity .
but one can see that the amounts the banks have pumped into the markets in this very short-term liquidity intervention have continually decreased ; that was already evident last week , although it was often portrayed differently .
that speaks to conditions on the markets that are getting back to normal . how much responsibility do the central banks carry in whether the financial markets continue to calm down , or whether there will be more panicked reactions ?
the central banks are simply the fundament on which the money markets are based .
the markets , however , are currently suffering from an intense phenomenon of the masses : even though trust in one 's business partner is the most important commodity on the markets , every market participant is under the general suspicion of not being able to live up to his promises .
the central banks are there to ease fears so that so that things will settle down .
i think confidence in the markets will return , especially given the basic economic data .
is n't there a risk that investors can now rely on the banks too much ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's up to central banks to make sure credit markets have the liquidity they need no .
the central banks have an obligation only for short-term interventions .
investors , on the other hand , plan months , quarters and years in advance .
in moments of crisis , everything always appears very dramatic , but at second glance , when the markets return to normal , the investors will also see that the basic economic figures are on track and that the global economy continues to be very dynamic .
how were things in the past ?
did the central banks , especially the federal reserve bank under alan greenspan at that time , always fulfill their obligations ?
could interest rate policies in the us have been one of the reasons for the current crisis ?
there were good reasons back then for lowering the interest rates so much .
the fed wanted to control the macro-economic consequences of the stock market bubble that burst in 2001 , and it managed to do that .
but now we are seeing the collateral damage of these interest rate policies .
the sense of danger among market participants became too sedated by the " medicine " of low interest rates .
in hindsight , it probably would have been better if the central banks had started raising their interest rates a year earlier .
but even central bank professionals do not have 20/20 vision for the future .
the lesson that should be learned from this is not to underestimate the danger of interest rates that are too low for loans .
the lack of liquidity on the global markets has also highlighted the interest policies of the bank of japan .
can we expect it to raise its rates , thus intensifying the crisis ?
even last year , japan 's central bank policies were slower to move than expected .
it is possible that , due to liquidity shortages on the markets , the bank of japan will postpone its plans for raising interest rates in august - perhaps just for a month .
but generally speaking , it will also be pushing for a normalization of economic policies and will have to raise interest rates . angela göpfert interviewed ulrich kater -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the frankfurt-based central bank has injected over 200 million euros into the financial system since thursday .
thanks in part to a several central banks intervening worldwide , t he ecb described conditions in the money market as now " close to normal . "
dw-world.de spoke with ulrich kater , of germany 's dekabank , who said that market participants underestimated risks involved in the us federal reserve bank 's low-interest-rate policies .
dw-world.de : the central banks have been massively pumping money into markets - in unheard of amounts since the wake of the sept .
11 , 2001 terrorist attacks in the us .
are the banks living up to their responsibilities , or is this a sign of a real crisis ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ulrich kater , of the dekabank ulrich kater : the central banks have a responsibility to ensure that the money markets can function .
if the demand for liquidity rises to a point that money markets can not satisfy , then it is clearly the obligation of the central banks to provide liquidity .
but one can see that the amounts the banks have pumped into the markets in this very short-term liquidity intervention have continually decreased ; that was already evident last week , although it was often portrayed differently .
that speaks to conditions on the markets that are getting back to normal . how much responsibility do the central banks carry in whether the financial markets continue to calm down , or whether there will be more panicked reactions ?
the central banks are simply the fundament on which the money markets are based .
the markets , however , are currently suffering from an intense phenomenon of the masses : even though trust in one 's business partner is the most important commodity on the markets , every market participant is under the general suspicion of not being able to live up to his promises .
the central banks are there to ease fears so that so that things will settle down .
i think confidence in the markets will return , especially given the basic economic data .
is n't there a risk that investors can now rely on the banks too much ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's up to central banks to make sure credit markets have the liquidity they need no .
the central banks have an obligation only for short-term interventions .
investors , on the other hand , plan months , quarters and years in advance .
in moments of crisis , everything always appears very dramatic , but at second glance , when the markets return to normal , the investors will also see that the basic economic figures are on track and that the global economy continues to be very dynamic .
how were things in the past ?
did the central banks , especially the federal reserve bank under alan greenspan at that time , always fulfill their obligations ?
could interest rate policies in the us have been one of the reasons for the current crisis ?
there were good reasons back then for lowering the interest rates so much .
the fed wanted to control the macro-economic consequences of the stock market bubble that burst in 2001 , and it managed to do that .
but now we are seeing the collateral damage of these interest rate policies .
the sense of danger among market participants became too sedated by the " medicine " of low interest rates .
in hindsight , it probably would have been better if the central banks had started raising their interest rates a year earlier .
but even central bank professionals do not have 20/20 vision for the future .
the lesson that should be learned from this is not to underestimate the danger of interest rates that are too low for loans .
the lack of liquidity on the global markets has also highlighted the interest policies of the bank of japan .
can we expect it to raise its rates , thus intensifying the crisis ?
even last year , japan 's central bank policies were slower to move than expected .
it is possible that , due to liquidity shortages on the markets , the bank of japan will postpone its plans for raising interest rates in august - perhaps just for a month .
but generally speaking , it will also be pushing for a normalization of economic policies and will have to raise interest rates . angela göpfert interviewed ulrich kater -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in the 1990s , schirach defended günter schabowksi in a trial of high-ranking east german officials for their role in the killings of people who had attempted to flee across the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schirach -lrb- left -rrb- and schabowski during the trial schabowski , a member of the east german politburo who became famous for announcing the fall of the berlin wall , was convicted of manslaughter and accepted moral responsibility for the killings .
he was sentenced to three years in prison and pardoned after six months behind bars . schirach 's involvement in the case also made headlines because he is the grandson of baldur von schirach , the former leader of the nazi hitler youth , who was found guilty of crimes against humanity and served 20 years in prison . dw-world.de : what 's the significance of the resurfaced shoot-to-kill order ? ferdinand von schirach : it 's negligible .
it 's a document that 's been known for a long time to everyone involved , including the berlin state prosecutor 's office , which now claims that it has to investigate this again .
this piece of paper has no known author and no clear addressee .
it 's a simple piece of paper that could have been written by anyone and that will not hold up for convictions or even the initiation of a criminal investigation . of course you have to say - and that 's probably the best thing that can be said about this piece of paper - that it 's circumstantial evidence for the cruelty of the border fortifications and the guarding of the border .
but one should n't think that this is a piece of paper that the courts have been looking for for years and that places guilt on a certain person without a doubt or is able to describe the system as a whole . could you say then that it 's a historically interesting but legally irrelevant document ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler , the head of the agency that administers the stasi files it 's not irrelevant from a legal standpoint , because even circumstantial evidence is relevant .
it 's certainly interesting from a historic perspective , but it 's not unique - there were several of these documents . the thing that 's maybe interesting from a historic perspective is that the head of a federal agency has gone so far off the rails that she thinks that she can make policy with this on the anniversary of the construction of the wall .
-lrb- marianne birthler heads the so-called " birthler authority , " the unofficial name given to the government office responsible for researching the history of the gdr 's secret police , the stasi -rrb- .we need to get away from handling these issues in a sensationalist way . it 's a serious issue and as the head of such an agency , you can not push such a paper into the public realm and claim to reveal something completely new even though it 's been known for a long time .
in my opinion , it will also have to lead to a discussion about what should be done with the agency . why do you think that this surfaced right now ? because of the anniversary of the construction of the wall .
-lrb- this week marked the 46th anniversary of the building of the berlin wall -rrb- there 's no other reason in my opinion .
the paper has been known , the state prosecutors received a number of such papers for investigations years ago , and none of them played any role in any of the trials .
it 's a little trite to say : i have now found the document that offers conclusive proof for everything . let 's take a step back and think about what this shoot-to-kill order actually means .
it meant that the gdr forcefully prevented its people from doing nothing more than trying to leave the country .
that 's what 's condemnable about this system and the courts ruled accordingly .
they declared - questionable from a legal standpoint but correct from a moral one - that such systems are inhuman and that this deserves to be punished . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : white crosses serve as memorials to those killed while trying to cross the wall now , many years after the trials , someone comes and says : now , i have the piece of paper that makes it perfectly clear that the gdr had such an order -lsb- to shoot and kill -rsb- .
but that was n't the case .
this clear-cut order was n't confirmed by any of the witnesses or any outsider .
it did not exist in a single document . it 's not a secret that these young border patrols shot at people and that many people died there .
it is a historic fact .
but that does n't mean that we can turn around and say : there was a clear order to shoot women and children .
i think that 's nonsense .
these systems were also too intelligent to do something like this .
the border patrols were put under oath every morning and had to swear on all sorts of orders that were given there .
for all intents and purposes , it did what 's written in this ominous paper , but no one in the gdr would have said something like this . several politicians have called for an investigation into possible legal action .
do you think any legal action will be taken ? it definitely wo n't happen .
the prosecutor 's office already had these papers and could have checked them a long time ago .

in the 1990s , schirach defended günter schabowksi in a trial of high-ranking east german officials for their role in the killings of people who had attempted to flee across the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schirach -lrb- left -rrb- and schabowski during the trial schabowski , a member of the east german politburo who became famous for announcing the fall of the berlin wall , was convicted of manslaughter and accepted moral responsibility for the killings .
he was sentenced to three years in prison and pardoned after six months behind bars . schirach 's involvement in the case also made headlines because he is the grandson of baldur von schirach , the former leader of the nazi hitler youth , who was found guilty of crimes against humanity and served 20 years in prison . dw-world.de : what 's the significance of the resurfaced shoot-to-kill order ? ferdinand von schirach : it 's negligible .
it 's a document that 's been known for a long time to everyone involved , including the berlin state prosecutor 's office , which now claims that it has to investigate this again .
this piece of paper has no known author and no clear addressee .
it 's a simple piece of paper that could have been written by anyone and that will not hold up for convictions or even the initiation of a criminal investigation . of course you have to say - and that 's probably the best thing that can be said about this piece of paper - that it 's circumstantial evidence for the cruelty of the border fortifications and the guarding of the border .

the case was brought by a 52-year-old secondary school teacher , who said she would appeal tuesday 's ruling .
the teacher had argued that her headscarf was a " fashion accessory à la grace kelly " that was in line with christian-occidental values .
the judges did not accept the argument , pointing out that since the teacher always wore the scarf , it was a symbol of her religous beliefs .
authorities in north rhine-westphalia imposed a ban on headscarves in june 2006 .
a similar ban was introduced in the southern state of bavaria in 2005 with the aim of protecting children from the influence of islamic fundamentalists .

after the headscarf prohibition came into effect in june 2006 in north rhine-westphalia , one teacher appeared at school wearing a beret .
a court said the beret fell under the headscarf rule and asked the teacher to consider wearing a wig instead , which she refused .

the case was brought by a 52-year-old secondary school teacher , who said she would appeal tuesday 's ruling .
the teacher had argued that her headscarf was a " fashion accessory à la grace kelly " that was in line with christian-occidental values .
the judges did not accept the argument , pointing out that since the teacher always wore the scarf , it was a symbol of her religous beliefs .
authorities in north rhine-westphalia imposed a ban on headscarves in june 2006 .

experts say a decline in construction is to blame . the seasonally-adjusted figure released by officials at the federal statistics office on tuesday came in well below the 0.5-percent growth in gross domestic product recorded in the first quarter .
exports continued to provide most of the impetus , although there were also indications of growing domestic expenditure .
domestic investment in machines and equipment rose significantly , while construction declined . " economic growth was based especially on the highly dynamic foreign trade , " the statistical office said , adding that domestic demand had made a " positive , though smaller contribution to growth . "
past the peak financial analysts said they were disappointed with the growth , adding that they had expected a slightly higher figure of 0.4 percent .
" a few weeks ago , we thought that it was going to be significantly stronger because of the good mood among companies and the labor market situation , " dirk schumacher of goldman sachs told reuters news service .
he added that the dip should be seen as a slip-up and that growth would again pick up in the third quarter .
" but we 've definitely surpassed the growth peak , " he added .
strong 2006 revised figures for 2006 meanwhile indicated that the economy grew faster than previously announced , with growth for the full year coming in at 2.9 percent , against the 2.8 percent previously reported .
government officials are forecasting growth of 2.3 percent in 2007 . article based on news reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

grindel said the mistakes made regarding the recent resurfacing of documents about the " shoot-to-kill " policy of the stasi at the berlin wall showed that the responsibility for the investigation of such texts should be given to a research association , to which the birthler office should belong .
" it is now clear that the processing of these documents should not be exclusively left up to the birthler authority , " grindel told broadcaster rbb .
grindel also recommended that the stasi document office be integrated into the german federal archives in koblenz .

he added that his party continued to find the office 's work important and worth supporting . birthler has had to deflect criticism over the past few days that she made the announcement of the stasi " shoot-to-kill " policy just days before the 46th anniversary of the start of the construction of the berlin wall .
some have accused her of " sensationalizing " information to gain attention for her office , particularly because the data had already surfaced 10 years ago in a scientific journal .
klaus schroeder , of the research center " sed-staat " at the university of berlin , told the daily leipziger volkszeitung that birthler " without doing thorough research beforehand , left herself get caught up in the idea of announcing information that made it appear like an historically new , sensational discovery .

but times , it seems , have changed , and suddenly germany - and berlin in particular - is a moving-making magnet . tom 's controversial role from brangelina to tom cruise and matt damon to nicole kidman , berlin locations have been pulling in hollywood stars more and more regularly . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cruise plays claus schenk von stauffenberg cruise has been staying in the city with his wife , katie holmes , and daughter suri during the shooting of the war movie " valkyrie " at locations in berlin and brandenburg , the eastern state that surrounds the capital city . the actor has stirred controversy , not only because of his famed devotion to scientology , but also his role in the movie about a key figure in the german resistance against adolf hitler .
cruise plays colonel count claus schenk von stauffenberg in the film , about stauffenberg 's failed bomb-plot bid to kill hitler on july 20 , 1944 .
the plot led to the colonel 's arrest and execution by firing squad in the courtyard of the bendlerblock , the current german army 's headquarters in berlin .
besides cruise , who has been tracked by paparazzi since his arrival in the capital , the actors kenneth branagh , bill nighy , tom wilkinson , eddie izzard , cristian berkel , thomas kretschmann and carice van houten belong to the cast .
' amazing ' period of growth " our studios are presently at full capacity , " eike wolf , a spokesperson at babelsberg , said of the berlin film boom .
" it 's amazing .
it 's the busiest period we 've experienced since the studios were privatized in 1992 . "
wolf said by the end of the year babelsberg will have handled a " record " 11 productions .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : babelsberg says its undergoing a renaissance " last year we had just one full length feature , " she said .
carl woebcken , managing director of studio babelsberg motion pictures , said that despite doubling the studio capacity in 2005 , they have had to rent extra studio space in order to cope with the demand from international productions .
while the current rush of business is more than welcome , the number of films produced there in babelsberg in the past few years is a far cry from the studio 's heyday in the late 1920s , when it was hollywood 's strongest competitor .
back then , the studio pumped out almost 600 films a year , including classics such as fritz lang 's " metropolis " -lrb- 1927 -rrb- , and the 1930 josef von sternberg feature " blue angel , " which gave marlene dietrich her debut .
projects in the pipeline besides " valkyrie " , other films in progress at babelsberg this year include director tom tykwer 's " the international , " starring clive owen and naomi watts ; jan de bont 's thriller " stopping point , " with actor john cusack ; " mr.nobody , " starring jared leto ; and " speed racer , " a $ 53 million warner brothers production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich got her start in german film 's heyday in the pipeline for babelsberg are " the reader " , starring tom cruise 's ex-wife nicole kidman , and oscar prize-winning director caroline link 's " a year of winter " with corinna harfouch and karoline herfurth .
another berlin project is german producer bernd eichinger 's " the baader-meinhof complex " , starring german actor moritz bleibtreu as modern radical andreas baader .
the movie tackles an explosive period in germany 's post-war history when a group of urban terrorists known as the baader-meinhof gang , or red army faction , staged a series of murders , robberies and kidnappings during the 1970s and early 80s . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

back then , the studio pumped out almost 600 films a year , including classics such as fritz lang 's " metropolis " -lrb- 1927 -rrb- , and the 1930 josef von sternberg feature " blue angel , " which gave marlene dietrich her debut .
projects in the pipeline besides " valkyrie " , other films in progress at babelsberg this year include director tom tykwer 's " the international , " starring clive owen and naomi watts ; jan de bont 's thriller " stopping point , " with actor john cusack ; " mr.nobody , " starring jared leto ; and " speed racer , " a $ 53 million warner brothers production .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marlene dietrich got her start in german film 's heyday in the pipeline for babelsberg are " the reader " , starring tom cruise 's ex-wife nicole kidman , and oscar prize-winning director caroline link 's " a year of winter " with corinna harfouch and karoline herfurth .
another berlin project is german producer bernd eichinger 's " the baader-meinhof complex " , starring german actor moritz bleibtreu as modern radical andreas baader .
the movie tackles an explosive period in germany 's post-war history when a group of urban terrorists known as the baader-meinhof gang , or red army faction , staged a series of murders , robberies and kidnappings during the 1970s and early 80s . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but is often criticized for lacking a consistent strategy , especially in afghanistan , where troops serve under three different mandates . the deployments are also stretching the bundeswehr , which is one of the reason 's chancellor merkel 's coalition gave for waving aside french president nicolas sarkozy 's call for european troops to protect refugees from darfur , according to the government . but many german parliamentarians consider the argument of depleted capacities an insufficient one .
they say this mission is necessary , precisely because it is a humanitarian one . at the same time , they want a debate about which missions the bundeswehr should take part in , and which should have priority . deutsche welle : mr. gerhardt , considering the drop in public acceptance of foreign peacekeeping missions , is there - at the least - a problem of communication between politicians and the people ?
is n't it time for a general debate on the purpose of the individual missions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang gerhardt wolfgang gerhard : yes .
as a government , or as a member of parliament or the opposition , each day you have to justify to society why you mobilize soldiers .
you have to have clear criteria .
and you have to go into this debate convincingly , with political leadership .
the security of our country is threatened by places in the world where there are problems , and it can only be ensured if we , along with other democratic nations , and with united nations mandates , can to some degree calm the world 's hot spots . but the priorities are also unclear .
some say the missions must be in germany 's interest .
is that definition justified ? in the interest of human dignity and in the interest of freedom and security in the world , i would add that is in germany 's interest .
that may sound generalized , but it can be more precise .
if we are unable to offer people in afghanistan an alternative to poppy-growing , where they supply practically the entire world with drugs , then deploying all those soldiers there is useless .
so a political solution must always accompany a military mission . so in addition to the military deployment , we have to think much more intensely about social structures there , with participation by the european union .
in darfur , where women are being raped , and human suffering is everywhere , it 's not a place where we can stay away - if the bundeswehr is capable of involvement - on moral or ethical grounds .
anyone who goes into congo to monitor elections should have strong arguments for not going into darfur . so you 're in favor of an engagement , of a bundeswehr mission to darfur ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african union said it could provide enough troops to protect darfur the first question is does the bundeswehr have the capacity to take part in what maybe action in darfur .
and the second reason is a moral question for me - the responsibility to protect is one of the important points of foreign policy in our times .
we see worldwide that there are governments who do not like to protect their own people , and though it is a responsibility for the community of democratic nations , with a legitimate mandate from the united nations to protect people , that 's a main reason for me to advocate participation of the bundeswehr if the bundeswehr is capable of doing so . can the bundeswehr do that ? if it can , then we should not stand on the sidelines .
my moral justification for that does n't exist in a vacuum of course - we have to know if the bundeswehr can do it , if it has the capacities to get involved .
and who else would take part ?
all of that has not yet been answered .
but if there is a special humane reason to protect people , then darfur is an important place for it . why do you think then that the german government is being so reticent about committing troops to darfur ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suffering of sudan 's refugees needs to be made clear to germans , gerhardt said i believe the government has a hard time with this rejection .
for moral and ethical reasons , it must realize this responsibility to protect , when human rights are discussed , for instance in the united nations .
we have to clear all the deployment mandates and all the soldiers we have worldwide .
we have to ask ourselves what is the reason , what is the aim , where is the escape , is the task fulfilled ? we had a mission in congo , it was not a mission i would like to have .
it was for one day , or two days , we left congo and nothing is better there .
we have been in afghanistan for years , we have n't given the people an alternative for social security ; we have only deployed soldiers .
we have to fulfill mandates but not only with soldiers .
we have been looking on for years at the rape in darfur , at the brutality in darfur and we know that the government of sudan is not able to protect the people there . given the low support in germany for foreign peacekeeping missions , how will you sell this mission to darfur ? every conflict has a variety of reasons - the agricultural structure in the region , the ethnic split in this region .
but at the end of the day you have to convince people in which world we would like to live , and what is security for the federal republic of germany , and what are the necessary steps to protect europe .
if we are not able to calm conflicts in worldwide hotspots , we can not contribute to security policy in europe . dw-tv 's christopher springate interviewed wolfgang gerhardt -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany said it will not contribute additional soldiers .

the case was brought by a 52-year-old secondary school teacher , who said she would appeal tuesday 's ruling .
the teacher had argued that her headscarf was a " fashion accessory à la grace kelly " that was in line with christian-occidental values .
the judges did not accept the argument , pointing out that since the teacher always wore the scarf , it was a symbol of her religous beliefs .
authorities in north rhine-westphalia imposed a ban on headscarves in june 2006 .
a similar ban was introduced in the southern state of bavaria in 2005 with the aim of protecting children from the influence of islamic fundamentalists .
rules vary bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a german flag as headscarf headscarves are banned in eight of germany 's 16 states , but laws vary about other headdress .
after the headscarf prohibition came into effect in june 2006 in north rhine-westphalia , one teacher appeared at school wearing a beret .
a court said the beret fell under the headscarf rule and asked the teacher to consider wearing a wig instead , which she refused .
in bavaria , on the other hand , teachers may wear hats in school .
at an administrative court in stuttgart in the state of baden-württemburg , judges in july 2006 reversed an earlier decision .
there , muslim teachers may now wear headscarves since nuns are also permitted to wear their habits in public schools . article based on news reports -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the teacher had argued that her headscarf was a " fashion accessory à la grace kelly " that was in line with christian-occidental values .
the judges did not accept the argument , pointing out that since the teacher always wore the scarf , it was a symbol of her religous beliefs .
authorities in north rhine-westphalia imposed a ban on headscarves in june 2006 .

the case was brought by a 52-year-old secondary school teacher , who said she would appeal tuesday 's ruling .
the teacher had argued that her headscarf was a " fashion accessory à la grace kelly " that was in line with christian-occidental values .
the judges did not accept the argument , pointing out that since the teacher always wore the scarf , it was a symbol of her religous beliefs .

in the 1990s , schirach defended günter schabowksi in a trial of high-ranking east german officials for their role in the killings of people who had attempted to flee across the berlin wall . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schirach -lrb- left -rrb- and schabowski during the trial schabowski , a member of the east german politburo who became famous for announcing the fall of the berlin wall , was convicted of manslaughter and accepted moral responsibility for the killings .
he was sentenced to three years in prison and pardoned after six months behind bars . schirach 's involvement in the case also made headlines because he is the grandson of baldur von schirach , the former leader of the nazi hitler youth , who was found guilty of crimes against humanity and served 20 years in prison . dw-world.de : what 's the significance of the resurfaced shoot-to-kill order ? ferdinand von schirach : it 's negligible .
it 's a document that 's been known for a long time to everyone involved , including the berlin state prosecutor 's office , which now claims that it has to investigate this again .
this piece of paper has no known author and no clear addressee .
it 's a simple piece of paper that could have been written by anyone and that will not hold up for convictions or even the initiation of a criminal investigation . of course you have to say - and that 's probably the best thing that can be said about this piece of paper - that it 's circumstantial evidence for the cruelty of the border fortifications and the guarding of the border .
but one should n't think that this is a piece of paper that the courts have been looking for for years and that places guilt on a certain person without a doubt or is able to describe the system as a whole . could you say then that it 's a historically interesting but legally irrelevant document ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : marianne birthler , the head of the agency that administers the stasi files it 's not irrelevant from a legal standpoint , because even circumstantial evidence is relevant .
it 's certainly interesting from a historic perspective , but it 's not unique - there were several of these documents . the thing that 's maybe interesting from a historic perspective is that the head of a federal agency has gone so far off the rails that she thinks that she can make policy with this on the anniversary of the construction of the wall .
-lrb- marianne birthler heads the so-called " birthler authority , " the unofficial name given to the government office responsible for researching the history of the gdr 's secret police , the stasi -rrb- .we need to get away from handling these issues in a sensationalist way . it 's a serious issue and as the head of such an agency , you can not push such a paper into the public realm and claim to reveal something completely new even though it 's been known for a long time .
in my opinion , it will also have to lead to a discussion about what should be done with the agency . why do you think that this surfaced right now ? because of the anniversary of the construction of the wall .
-lrb- this week marked the 46th anniversary of the building of the berlin wall -rrb- there 's no other reason in my opinion .
the paper has been known , the state prosecutors received a number of such papers for investigations years ago , and none of them played any role in any of the trials .
it 's a little trite to say : i have now found the document that offers conclusive proof for everything . let 's take a step back and think about what this shoot-to-kill order actually means .
it meant that the gdr forcefully prevented its people from doing nothing more than trying to leave the country .
that 's what 's condemnable about this system and the courts ruled accordingly .
they declared - questionable from a legal standpoint but correct from a moral one - that such systems are inhuman and that this deserves to be punished . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : white crosses serve as memorials to those killed while trying to cross the wall now , many years after the trials , someone comes and says : now , i have the piece of paper that makes it perfectly clear that the gdr had such an order -lsb- to shoot and kill -rsb- .
but that was n't the case .
this clear-cut order was n't confirmed by any of the witnesses or any outsider .
it did not exist in a single document . it 's not a secret that these young border patrols shot at people and that many people died there .
it is a historic fact .
but that does n't mean that we can turn around and say : there was a clear order to shoot women and children .
i think that 's nonsense .
these systems were also too intelligent to do something like this .
the border patrols were put under oath every morning and had to swear on all sorts of orders that were given there .
for all intents and purposes , it did what 's written in this ominous paper , but no one in the gdr would have said something like this . several politicians have called for an investigation into possible legal action .
do you think any legal action will be taken ? it definitely wo n't happen .
the prosecutor 's office already had these papers and could have checked them a long time ago .
i 'm absolutely certain that nothing that 's relevant in terms of criminal law can come from this kind of document . mathis winkler interviewed ferdinand von schirach send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de peacekeeping -pipe- 14.08.2007 politician wants more german help for darfur großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : more than 300,000 people have been killed and 2 million displaced in darfur since 2003 wolfgang gerhard , foreign policy advisor for the opposition free-market liberal fdp , spoke to deutsche welle about german concerns regarding international peacekeeping missions and why germany 's army should be in darfur . at present the german army , the bundeswehr , is taking part in nine missions abroad .
but is often criticized for lacking a consistent strategy , especially in afghanistan , where troops serve under three different mandates . the deployments are also stretching the bundeswehr , which is one of the reason 's chancellor merkel 's coalition gave for waving aside french president nicolas sarkozy 's call for european troops to protect refugees from darfur , according to the government . but many german parliamentarians consider the argument of depleted capacities an insufficient one .
they say this mission is necessary , precisely because it is a humanitarian one . at the same time , they want a debate about which missions the bundeswehr should take part in , and which should have priority . deutsche welle : mr. gerhardt , considering the drop in public acceptance of foreign peacekeeping missions , is there - at the least - a problem of communication between politicians and the people ?
is n't it time for a general debate on the purpose of the individual missions ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang gerhardt wolfgang gerhard : yes .
as a government , or as a member of parliament or the opposition , each day you have to justify to society why you mobilize soldiers .
you have to have clear criteria .
and you have to go into this debate convincingly , with political leadership .
the security of our country is threatened by places in the world where there are problems , and it can only be ensured if we , along with other democratic nations , and with united nations mandates , can to some degree calm the world 's hot spots . but the priorities are also unclear .
some say the missions must be in germany 's interest .
is that definition justified ? in the interest of human dignity and in the interest of freedom and security in the world , i would add that is in germany 's interest .
that may sound generalized , but it can be more precise .
if we are unable to offer people in afghanistan an alternative to poppy-growing , where they supply practically the entire world with drugs , then deploying all those soldiers there is useless .
so a political solution must always accompany a military mission . so in addition to the military deployment , we have to think much more intensely about social structures there , with participation by the european union .
in darfur , where women are being raped , and human suffering is everywhere , it 's not a place where we can stay away - if the bundeswehr is capable of involvement - on moral or ethical grounds .
anyone who goes into congo to monitor elections should have strong arguments for not going into darfur . so you 're in favor of an engagement , of a bundeswehr mission to darfur ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the african union said it could provide enough troops to protect darfur the first question is does the bundeswehr have the capacity to take part in what maybe action in darfur .
and the second reason is a moral question for me - the responsibility to protect is one of the important points of foreign policy in our times .
we see worldwide that there are governments who do not like to protect their own people , and though it is a responsibility for the community of democratic nations , with a legitimate mandate from the united nations to protect people , that 's a main reason for me to advocate participation of the bundeswehr if the bundeswehr is capable of doing so . can the bundeswehr do that ? if it can , then we should not stand on the sidelines .
my moral justification for that does n't exist in a vacuum of course - we have to know if the bundeswehr can do it , if it has the capacities to get involved .
and who else would take part ?
all of that has not yet been answered .
but if there is a special humane reason to protect people , then darfur is an important place for it . why do you think then that the german government is being so reticent about committing troops to darfur ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the suffering of sudan 's refugees needs to be made clear to germans , gerhardt said i believe the government has a hard time with this rejection .
for moral and ethical reasons , it must realize this responsibility to protect , when human rights are discussed , for instance in the united nations .
we have to clear all the deployment mandates and all the soldiers we have worldwide .
we have to ask ourselves what is the reason , what is the aim , where is the escape , is the task fulfilled ? we had a mission in congo , it was not a mission i would like to have .
it was for one day , or two days , we left congo and nothing is better there .
we have been in afghanistan for years , we have n't given the people an alternative for social security ; we have only deployed soldiers .
we have to fulfill mandates but not only with soldiers .
we have been looking on for years at the rape in darfur , at the brutality in darfur and we know that the government of sudan is not able to protect the people there . given the low support in germany for foreign peacekeeping missions , how will you sell this mission to darfur ? every conflict has a variety of reasons - the agricultural structure in the region , the ethnic split in this region .
but at the end of the day you have to convince people in which world we would like to live , and what is security for the federal republic of germany , and what are the necessary steps to protect europe .
if we are not able to calm conflicts in worldwide hotspots , we can not contribute to security policy in europe . dw-tv 's christopher springate interviewed wolfgang gerhardt -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

mr ma was accused of misappropriating t $ 11.2m -lrb- $ 339,000 -rrb- in funds while he was mayor of the capital , taipei .
he resigned as head of the kuomintang party following the indictment but denied any wrongdoing .
the verdict is expected to boost his chances of succeeding president chen shui-bian in elections due next march , correspondents say .
his main rival , the governing party candidate frank hsieh , has also denied allegations of corruption .
china ties supporters of mr ma danced and cheered outside the court in taipei when the verdict was announced .
" this is good news because it not only involves my personal integrity but also the protection of human rights , " mr ma said afterwards .
" many defendants in the future could ... benefit from what this judgement has said . "
mr ma was accused of shifting money from a special fund into a personal account during his time as mayor , from 1998 to 2006 .
but his lawyers argued that the use of discretionary funds without providing detailed accounting had long been a common practice among thousands of other public official holders .
this has been a high-profile trial , especially damaging for a politician whose career has been built around his squeaky clean image , the bbc 's caroline gluck in taipei says .
the outcome is likely to prove a huge boost for his electoral chances , our correspondent adds .
taiwan 's stock market rebounded on the news .
this trial is the latest in a string of cases involving allegations of improper use of public funds by politicians .
mr hsieh , of the ruling democratic progressive party -lrb- dpp -rrb- , is facing allegations that he received kickbacks in connection with the construction of a subway system in the southern city of kaohsiung , where he once served as mayor .
he denies the allegations .
if the two men square up in a fight for the presidency next year , then their views on taiwan 's relations with china will play a key part .
mr ma 's faction of the kuomintang - which governed taiwan until 2000 - favours closer ties and more trade with china .
the dpp wants greater independence from china .
under president chen shui-bian the relationship between the two sides has been tense .
taiwan and china have been ruled by separate governments since the end of the chinese civil war in 1949 .
but beijing regards taiwan as part of its territory and believes that it should be reunited with the rest of china - by force if necessary .

idol : the musical , which was dubbed a " satirical musical comedy " , was originally previewed in july .
by the end of the month the entire cast had been replaced without explanation and fresh previews began on 1 august .
producer todd ellis said he had scrapped the show " due to a lack of advance ticket sales " .
he added that a " lack of positive feedback from audience members and critics and a lack of sustainable financial resources " had also fuelled his decision to close the show .
earlier this month , american idol judge simon cowell announced he was going to make a movie set behind the scenes of a tv talent show .
the film , currently titled star struck , will tell the fictional story of 10 contestants in a singing competition .
cowell will help pick the lead characters from open auditions like those used on american idol .
in may , 17-year-old jordin sparks became the youngest ever winner of the show .

the transport group was awarded the contract to run the east coast main line franchise by the department for transport after a bidding war .
national express beat off opposition from arriva , first group and a joint venture between virgin trains and stagecoach to win the contract .
the group will take over the operation from troubled gner in december .
the new franchise , covering the arterial north-south rail route , will be called national express east coast .
it links london with scotland , calling at peterborough , leeds , doncaster , york , newcastle , edinburgh , aberdeen and inverness .
the whole deal is very good news , not only for passengers but for the taxpayer transport minister tom harris it was put out to tender last year after the us parent firm of british rail firm gner was struck by financial troubles and could not afford to pay the £ 1.3bn it had promised the government for the right to run the service .
extra services " the whole deal is very good news , not only for passengers but for the taxpayer , " said transport minister tom harris , speaking to the bbc .
under the terms of the deal , national express has agreed to pay the treasury £ 1.4bn to operate the franchise until the end of march 2015 .
the group , which also operates the gatwick and stansted express and the inter-city services between yorkshire , the east midlands and london through midland mainline , has also pledged to invest in extra services , stations and on-board services .
national express said it would inject £ 7.4m to upgrade stations , including the creation of 2,000 extra car park spaces , over the course of the seven-and-a-half years .
it also said that from december 2010 , the number of weekday trains could rise from 136 to 161 and a new london-to-lincoln service would also be added .
the company will spend £ 400,000 in reducing energy use at stations and train depots .
gner had joined forces with virgin trains and stagecoach in their joint bid for the contract , in the hope it would retain a stake .
gner 's chief executive jonathan metcalfe said : " naturally , we are disappointed that our joint bid was unsuccessful , but we now have to look to the future and work with the successful bidder to create an even bigger and better railway .

allen ruilova from animation studio dreamworks has become the world expert on virtual honey while working on the forthcoming bee movie due for release in november 2007 .
as its title implies the film is about a bee , and honey forms a significant part of the setting for it .
initially , said mr ruilova , he spent time simply filming honey to see how it looked and reacted when being poured or pooling on a surface .
" we took a lot of reference , " he said .
this revealed , he said , that honey has a very particular dynamic when it is flowing that is very different to the flows seen in thinner liquids .
" the flow was a big challenge , " he said .
" honey tends to retain its structure , it tends to keep that but eventually transitions to something more liquidy-like . "
culinary problem mr ruilova initially thought that turning up the viscosity controls on dreamworks in-house fluid animating system would meet this challenge .
eggs caused particular headaches for the animators of ratatouille unfortunately , he said , that did not produce realistic virtual honey .
the solution to getting honey-like movement was adding separate elastic forces to the fluid simulation .
this meant that the virtual honey , just like its real counterpart , retained some of its structure as it flowed .
but , once a set stiffness value was exceeded , the virtual flowed more like a liquid .
also tricky , said mr ruilova , was getting the look of the digital honey right .

the computer model of the fat and protein content of milk was developed by professor henrik jensen , an oscar-winning computer graphics researcher in the computer science department at uc san diego .
professor jensen said milk presented a particular problem for simulators because of the way that the substances of which it is composed absorb and reflect light .

by contrast the model developed by professor jensen and his colleagues can automatically simulate milk samples even if they have very different concentrations of fat and protein .
the use of the model was not limited to just depicting milk in films or animated works , said professor jensen .
as well , he said , it can be a diagnostic tool to work out the fat and protein content of a glass of milk from a digital image .

allen ruilova from animation studio dreamworks has become the world expert on virtual honey while working on the forthcoming bee movie due for release in november 2007 .
as its title implies the film is about a bee , and honey forms a significant part of the setting for it .
initially , said mr ruilova , he spent time simply filming honey to see how it looked and reacted when being poured or pooling on a surface .
" we took a lot of reference , " he said .
this revealed , he said , that honey has a very particular dynamic when it is flowing that is very different to the flows seen in thinner liquids .
" the flow was a big challenge , " he said .
" honey tends to retain its structure , it tends to keep that but eventually transitions to something more liquidy-like . "
culinary problem mr ruilova initially thought that turning up the viscosity controls on dreamworks in-house fluid animating system would meet this challenge .
eggs caused particular headaches for the animators of ratatouille unfortunately , he said , that did not produce realistic virtual honey .
the solution to getting honey-like movement was adding separate elastic forces to the fluid simulation .
this meant that the virtual honey , just like its real counterpart , retained some of its structure as it flowed .
but , once a set stiffness value was exceeded , the virtual flowed more like a liquid .
also tricky , said mr ruilova , was getting the look of the digital honey right .

in the summer of 1954 , a skinny 19-year-old singer put on a show for students at a school in memphis , tennessee .
the singer was causing a lot of interest locally .
he had just released his first single , that 's all right -lrb- mama -rrb- , on the sun records label .
among the audience was 16-year-old sonny west who , like his friends , was keen to find out what all the fuss was about .
what sonny saw was one of the first performances by a young artist who would become a global icon and lifelong friend - elvis presley .
" i saw something different , the way he moved around , his voice and style , " remembers sonny .
" i thought he was pretty good . "
it was four years after first seeing elvis perform that sonny got to meet the man who would become known as the king of rock ' n ' roll .
it was at a party , soon after elvis had completed the movie king creole and just weeks before he went into the us army .
" he was very shy , and just a sweet guy , " sonny says .
" when i properly met him , i was very impressed .
" he was a superstar by then .
yet he was interested in you .
he said : ' good to meet you , man . '
he just wanted to talk . "
sonny became a trusted friend of elvis and soon entered the inner circle that the media dubbed the " memphis mafia " .
not only was he a friend , but elvis also wanted sonny to become his employee .
when sonny asked what he would be doing , the star 's response was : " everything .
whatever i need you to do - performing errands , looking after my cars , keeping jealous boyfriends off my back . "
" it 's a sad time , but it 's really more of a time for celebration , to remember him and his music " sonny west one of sonny 's first jobs was to accompany elvis to the set of the 1961 movie wild in the country .
sonny also landed a role in the production .
" i was the one who drove the highway police car that arrested elvis ' character in the movie , " smiles sonny , who went on to work for the king for 16 years .
" the movie years were my favourite time with elvis , " he says .
" the tours in the ' 70s were a business .
i did lots of security then .
" but it was n't needed in the ' 60s as the movie lots had guards .
so we had a lot of fun . "
elvis may have been an idol to millions , but to sonny he was his best friend , and best man at his wedding .
" asking elvis to be my best man was a natural thing , " he says .
" he was a very dear friend of mine .
to have elvis presley as your best man was an extreme honour .
" i look back now and i realise it was a really big thing .
but at the time , it seemed natural that he should be the one to do that . "
security fears by the 1970s , the gruelling schedule of three movies a year had been replaced by almost constant touring around the us .
with each sell-out show came essential duties for members of elvis ' circle .
sonny became the chief of security - and recalls one concert in 1970 when he feared his boss 's life may have been in danger .
" i was sitting behind the organ on the stage and i was watching the whole of the audience , " explains sonny .
" i saw a guy sitting four rows back .
he was n't applauding and he looked bored .
he wore dark glasses .
" i thought ' oh man , this could be the guy ' .
i knew that i would have to run at him if he tried anything .
he did n't do anything .
but i learned to develop a fast draw just in case i ever needed to use the gun to protect elvis . "
now 69 , sonny has written a book about his experiences - a process he admits was an emotional rollercoaster that took some time .
" there were times when i would laugh at some of the crazy things we did , " sonny says .
" but there were many sad times too .
it did help to write them all down in my book . "
each anniversary of elvis ' death is a time of mixed emotions for sonny .
he chooses to use it to tell the legions of fans all over the world about his friend .
special presence this year , he is leaving his home in hendersonville , tennessee , to travel to derby , england , for the elvis party in the park on saturday .
" it 's a sad time , but it 's really more of a time for celebration , to remember him and his music , " sonny says .
" the fans show their appreciation and love .
that means a lot to me because to be around elvis was a special opportunity .
to know someone so magical was amazing .
" you can try and put it into words , but you just had to be there in his presence .
when he touched you , he touched you for life . "

in the summer of 1954 , a skinny 19-year-old singer put on a show for students at a school in memphis , tennessee .
the singer was causing a lot of interest locally .
he had just released his first single , that 's all right -lrb- mama -rrb- , on the sun records label .
among the audience was 16-year-old sonny west who , like his friends , was keen to find out what all the fuss was about .
what sonny saw was one of the first performances by a young artist who would become a global icon and lifelong friend - elvis presley .
" i saw something different , the way he moved around , his voice and style , " remembers sonny .
" i thought he was pretty good . "
elvis was best man at sonny 's wedding it was four years after first seeing elvis perform that sonny got to meet the man who would become known as the king of rock ' n ' roll .
it was at a party , soon after elvis had completed the movie king creole and just weeks before he went into the us army .
" he was very shy , and just a sweet guy , " sonny says .
" when i properly met him , i was very impressed .
" he was a superstar by then .
yet he was interested in you .
he said : ' good to meet you , man . '
he just wanted to talk . "
sonny became a trusted friend of elvis and soon entered the inner circle that the media dubbed the " memphis mafia " .
not only was he a friend , but elvis also wanted sonny to become his employee .
when sonny asked what he would be doing , the star 's response was : " everything .
whatever i need you to do - performing errands , looking after my cars , keeping jealous boyfriends off my back . "
it 's a sad time , but it 's really more of a time for celebration , to remember him and his music sonny west one of sonny 's first jobs was to accompany elvis to the set of the 1961 movie wild in the country .
sonny also landed a role in the production .
" i was the one who drove the highway police car that arrested elvis ' character in the movie , " smiles sonny , who went on to work for the king for 16 years .
" the movie years were my favourite time with elvis , " he says .
" the tours in the ' 70s were a business .
i did lots of security then .
" but it was n't needed in the ' 60s as the movie lots had guards .
so we had a lot of fun . "
elvis may have been an idol to millions , but to sonny he was his best friend , and best man at his wedding .
" asking elvis to be my best man was a natural thing , " he says .
" he was a very dear friend of mine .
to have elvis presley as your best man was an extreme honour .
" i look back now and i realise it was a really big thing .
but at the time , it seemed natural that he should be the one to do that . "
security fears by the 1970s , the gruelling schedule of three movies a year had been replaced by almost constant touring around the us .
with each sell-out show came essential duties for members of elvis ' circle .
sonny became the chief of security - and recalls one concert in 1970 when he feared his boss 's life may have been in danger .
" i was sitting behind the organ on the stage and i was watching the whole of the audience , " explains sonny .
sonny 's duties included guarding elvis and girlfriend linda thompson " i saw a guy sitting four rows back .
he was n't applauding and he looked bored .
he wore dark glasses .
" i thought ' oh man , this could be the guy ' .
i knew that i would have to run at him if he tried anything .
he did n't do anything .
but i learned to develop a fast draw just in case i ever needed to use the gun to protect elvis . "
now 69 , sonny has written a book about his experiences - a process he admits was an emotional rollercoaster that took some time .
" there were times when i would laugh at some of the crazy things we did , " sonny says .
" but there were many sad times too .
it did help to write them all down in my book . "
each anniversary of elvis ' death is a time of mixed emotions for sonny .
he chooses to use it to tell the legions of fans all over the world about his friend .
special presence this year , he is leaving his home in hendersonville , tennessee , to travel to derby , england , for the elvis party in the park on saturday .
" it 's a sad time , but it 's really more of a time for celebration , to remember him and his music , " sonny says .
" the fans show their appreciation and love .
that means a lot to me because to be around elvis was a special opportunity .
to know someone so magical was amazing .
" you can try and put it into words , but you just had to be there in his presence .

this year china is celebrating the 80th anniversary of the peoples ' liberation army .
but its traditional strategic thinking is undergoing a huge shift , prompting fears in the united states that china might pose a threat to american diplomatic and military power with a naval arms race in the pacific .
the capitulation of sadam hussein 's army in the face of a hi-tech american onslaught in desert storm , with land , air and sea forces enabling a rapid us advance across large areas of land , gave a fresh impetus to military modernisation , according to christian lemiere , china expert at jane 's country risk .
" china had always relied upon the idea that if attacked it had large areas of land .
it could fall back with these areas but if one power is able to take that and very quickly , it rapidly negates any advantage . "

this year china is celebrating the 80th anniversary of the peoples ' liberation army .
but its traditional strategic thinking is undergoing a huge shift , prompting fears in the united states that china might pose a threat to american diplomatic and military power with a naval arms race in the pacific .
the capitulation of sadam hussein 's army in the face of a hi-tech american onslaught in desert storm , with land , air and sea forces enabling a rapid us advance across large areas of land , gave a fresh impetus to military modernisation , according to christian lemiere , china expert at jane 's country risk .
" china had always relied upon the idea that if attacked it had large areas of land .
it could fall back with these areas but if one power is able to take that and very quickly , it rapidly negates any advantage . "
china 's armed forces are over two million strong china has been looking to match us military technology and launched an anti-satellite missile as part of this process .
joseph lin , a military affairs analyst with the jamestown foundation in washington said this development has unnerved the pentagon .
" the united states is heavily dependent upon satellites for all matters of communications , especially the military , which would be crippled and completely ineffectual without any sort of satellite coverage either for imaging , navigation or for communications . "
at the same time , china 's naval build-up has alerted american military officials to the previously unthinkable possibility that they might face competition in the pacific ocean , where the us has enjoyed naval dominance since the world war two .
richard lawless , deputy undersecretary of defence for asia and pacific security affairs , believes it is the biggest shift in the region 's power balance for more than 60 years .
a country that depends on sea-trading faces the greatest threat to its survival in areas outside its own borders .
because of this , we need to have a stronger navy to protect our trading interests prof nie youli , of east china normal university and he is especially concerned with the development of new classes of submarine , including two of them nuclear : one an attack submarine class , the other a ballistic missile submarine .
since 2000 china 's official military budget has leaped from $ 15bn to $ 45bn .
some us estimates say these figures exclude a range of defence-related outlays such as arms purchases from abroad and put the true figure for china 's annual military spending at up to $ 122bn .
deterrence tactic professor yan xuetong , director of the international studies institute at tsinghua university in beijing , and an analyst whose voice is heard by chinese and american decision makers , said china needs submarines to deter the us navy .
" every major power when they increase the military budget will bring about this kind of suspicion , " he added .
china 's official pronouncements stress a commitment to " peaceful development " .
prof nie youli , of the east china normal university , is an influential advocate of building up china 's navy for economic security .
more than 80 % of the imported oil which fuels china 's economy has to pass through the narrow straits of malacca " a country that depends on sea-trading faces the greatest threat to its survival in areas outside its own borders .
because of this , we need to have a stronger navy to protect our trading interests . "
some chinese observers feel their vulnerability is most clearly demonstrated by " the malacca dilemma . "
more than 80 % of the imported oil which fuels china 's expanding economy has to pass through the narrow straits of malacca which link the indian and pacific oceans .
one school of thought in beijing worries that if relations with the us were to break down , washington might block the straits and cut off its oil .
others warn that developing a much more powerful chinese navy capable of keeping the oil flowing might unnecessarily provoke america .
professor zha daojiong , director of the centre for international energy security at renmin university , concedes that opinion is divided .
but he is not convinced by the blockade threat , pointing out that this would also hit supplies to american regional allies like japan and korea .
nonetheless , china 's navy is growing , with the acquisition of new missile destroyers and submarines .
this process is sparking a new arms race in the pacific , according to naval expert paul kennedy , professor of history at yale university .
the united states must invest especially in the technologies and in the science that will allow us to maintain the superiority that will impress the communist leadership in beijing that wars are futile rick fisher , the international assessment and strategy centre " when i was in south korea recently i quizzed the naval ministry about the construction of some very large , 7000 ton missile guided destroyers .
they said : ' well look at how many destroyers japan is building ' , and if you ask the japanese navy they would say : ' well look how many destroyers china is building . " '
dr john chipman , director of the international institute for strategic studies , said japan - china 's historic enemy - is also quietly strengthening its navy , which will soon be larger than britain 's royal navy .
this naval build-up is fuelling the debate in washington about how the us should respond to china .
one side , seizing on pentagon warnings , argues that the united states needs to act decisively to halt the rise of the " china threat . "
rick fisher of the international assessment and strategy centre , said : " the united states has a period in which it can expand upon its current military technical superiority and form a kind of hard basis for deterring conflict , but that requires that the united states understands that we 're now in an arms race .
china says its navy is needed to protect trade interests " the united states must invest especially in the technologies and in the science that will allow us to maintain the superiority that will impress the communist leadership in beijing that wars are futile . "
but others , like congressman adam smith from washington state , argue the danger is that the united states will create an enemy and talk itself into another cold war .
" i see no reason that we need to view them as a military threat and to get involved in an arms race build up . "
a concerned pentagon , however , made its anxieties clear to the us congress this spring in its latest report on china 's military capabilities .
the us still has overwhelming naval superiority no official chinese government spokesman accepted the bbc 's invitation for an interview .
however , earlier this summer , lieutenant general zhang qinsheng , a senior general in the peoples ' liberation army responded to american anxieties at an international conference in singapore .
he said the pentagon report was unreliable , a product of " the cold war mindset " and detrimental to china-us relations .
iiss director john chipman , who chaired the conference said : " i think the majority of people in the conference were reassured by his attempt to demonstrate that chinese defence expenditure was uniquely for self-defence , but the same majority were also certain that increased chinese force projection capabilities ... would help china to confront - if it ever came to that - larger navies around the region which would include the united states .

here are five ways that wilson changed the music industry .
bringing punk to the mainstream wilson , who was working as a reporter at granada tv , gave the sex pistols their television debut in 1976 .
wilson booked the sex pistols for his music programme so it goes he had seen the punk pioneers ' legendary gig at the manchester lesser free trade hall that june .
only about 40 people were in the crowd , according to author david nolan , who wrote a book hailing the concert as the gig that changed the world .
but they included future stars such as morrissey , mark e smith and mick hucknall , who were inspired by the event to form their own bands .
and wilson was inspired to book them for the second series of his regional music programme so it goes .
the jam and elvis costello also got their tv debuts on the show .
in the late 1980s , wilson also presented a friday night arts show , the other side of midnight , which gave the stone roses , 808 state and the happy mondays their first appearances on tv .
setting up factory records joy division , who went on to become new order , and the happy mondays were among the acts on the roster at manchester 's factory records .
new order 's hits included true faith , world in motion and blue monday it has often been said that wilson wrote contracts in his own blood , saying the artists owned everything and the label owned nothing .
whether this story was true or not , the principle was .
it was a powerful and revolutionary statement of creative freedom - but it was also financial suicide .
wilson once said it " resulted in my entire catalogue being owned by somebody else " .
but he added : " i ca n't regret it , because the idea was not to own the past but to present the future . "
new order 's blue monday became the biggest-selling 12-inch single in uk history - but factory lost money on every copy because of the intricate sleeve design .
other local heroes such as the durutti column , a certain ratio and james were also on the label - as well as a host of others who never quite lived up to their billing -lrb- like the wendys and northside -rrb- .
wilson claimed factory was on the verge of signing oasis and pulp before it went bankrupt in 1992 .
establishing the hacienda nightclub joy division and new order manager rob gretton decided there should be a venue that played the kind of music he liked .
the hacienda was an integral part of 2002 film 24-hour party people the club , which opened in 1982 , was one of the first to play house music in the uk and went on to become the spiritual home of the " madchester " scene in the late-80s , with acid house and ecstasy at its heart .
the hacienda was funded by new order and factory records , and as well as being a magnet for clubbers , it also hosted gigs .
along with the factory bands , the performers included the smiths , the stone roses , oasis and madonna in her first uk appearance .
" the hacienda changed manchester forever , " said vaughan allen , chief executive of the city 's urbis centre , which is currently hosting an exhibition about the club .
" it did 25 years ago what myspace does today , bringing together creative people to create something new , " he told the bbc last month .
but like factory records , the hacienda lost money , and the heavy drug use meant gangs and dealers moved in , leading to regular violence .
the club closed in 1997 .
running the " in the city " conference set up in 1992 , in the city is the uk 's largest and most influential forum for finding new talent and discussing the future of the industry .
oasis played at in the city in 1992 , two years before their first single it allows the music industry to run the rule over the cream of the uk 's new and unsigned bands .
and it has helped launch almost every major british act of the last 15 years .
oasis , radiohead and suede played at the first in the city .
muse and coldplay appeared in 1998 , snow patrol performed in 2000 and the arctic monkeys put in an appearance two years ago .
wilson was renowned as " one of the great spotters of music talent " , according to alan mcgee , who founded creation - the home of oasis and primal scream .
" he was a complete inspiration , " mcgee told the nme website following wilson 's death .
pioneering legal music downloads wilson was one of the first people to realise the full implications of the illegal downloading revolution that napster ushered in at the turn of the millennium , and to turn it into an opportunity .
napster let fans download songs without paying royalties back in 1999 - four years before itunes was launched - wilson was preparing a site called music33 , which sold tracks from local labels for 33p each .
he said the 33p price-tag was based on an honest assessment of the costs of digital delivery .
however , the site failed to take off and the cost of digital music was set much higher by the major players in the coming years .

here are five ways that wilson changed the music industry .
bringing punk to the mainstream wilson , who was working as a reporter at granada tv , gave the sex pistols their television debut in 1976 .
wilson booked the sex pistols for his music programme so it goes he had seen the punk pioneers ' legendary gig at the manchester lesser free trade hall that june .
only about 40 people were in the crowd , according to author david nolan , who wrote a book hailing the concert as the gig that changed the world .
but they included future stars such as morrissey , mark e smith and mick hucknall , who were inspired by the event to form their own bands .
and wilson was inspired to book them for the second series of his regional music programme so it goes .
the jam and elvis costello also got their tv debuts on the show .
in the late 1980s , wilson also presented a friday night arts show , the other side of midnight , which gave the stone roses , 808 state and the happy mondays their first appearances on tv .
setting up factory records joy division , who went on to become new order , and the happy mondays were among the acts on the roster at manchester 's factory records .
new order 's hits included true faith , world in motion and blue monday it has often been said that wilson wrote contracts in his own blood , saying the artists owned everything and the label owned nothing .
whether this story was true or not , the principle was .
it was a powerful and revolutionary statement of creative freedom - but it was also financial suicide .
wilson once said it " resulted in my entire catalogue being owned by somebody else " .
but he added : " i ca n't regret it , because the idea was not to own the past but to present the future . "
new order 's blue monday became the biggest-selling 12-inch single in uk history - but factory lost money on every copy because of the intricate sleeve design .
other local heroes such as the durutti column , a certain ratio and james were also on the label - as well as a host of others who never quite lived up to their billing -lrb- like the wendys and northside -rrb- .
wilson claimed factory was on the verge of signing oasis and pulp before it went bankrupt in 1992 .
establishing the hacienda nightclub joy division and new order manager rob gretton decided there should be a venue that played the kind of music he liked .
the hacienda was an integral part of 2002 film 24-hour party people the club , which opened in 1982 , was one of the first to play house music in the uk and went on to become the spiritual home of the " madchester " scene in the late-80s , with acid house and ecstasy at its heart .
the hacienda was funded by new order and factory records , and as well as being a magnet for clubbers , it also hosted gigs .
along with the factory bands , the performers included the smiths , the stone roses , oasis and madonna in her first uk appearance .
" the hacienda changed manchester forever , " said vaughan allen , chief executive of the city 's urbis centre , which is currently hosting an exhibition about the club .
" it did 25 years ago what myspace does today , bringing together creative people to create something new , " he told the bbc last month .
but like factory records , the hacienda lost money , and the heavy drug use meant gangs and dealers moved in , leading to regular violence .
the club closed in 1997 .
running the " in the city " conference set up in 1992 , in the city is the uk 's largest and most influential forum for finding new talent and discussing the future of the industry .
oasis played at in the city in 1992 , two years before their first single it allows the music industry to run the rule over the cream of the uk 's new and unsigned bands .
and it has helped launch almost every major british act of the last 15 years .

pamela northcott , from dyserth , denbigshire , died on sunday aged 58 .
she was given the palliative drug nexavar on a trial basis after her two daughters interrupted a health trust meeting to protest .
daughter kate spall said the pamela northcott fund was a " fitting tribute " to continue to help other patients .
nexavar is not ordinarily available in wales , meaning health officials refuse to fund it .
the drug , which can cost up to £ 40,000 , is not a cure , but can help some patients .
although not yet recognised by the national institute of clinical excellence -lrb- nice -rrb- , mrs northcott 's family claimed the drug was available in more than 70 english nhs trusts .
i have no sense of relief or peace ... for now i am raging at the unfairness of it all kate spall , daughter in may , sisters kate spall and emma northcott interrupted a board meeting of conwy and denbighshire nhs trust to demand their mother be given the drug .
within days , they were told that the drug - which can help slow the progress of a tumour - would be made available to their mother on a two-month trial basis .
the trust had said it was required to follow the recommendations of the all wales medicines strategy group , which ruled out the drug , in all but " exceptional circumstances " .
mrs northcott fell unconscious last thursday , before passing away at st kentigern hospice in st asaph on sunday .
mrs spall said : " by the time she got it , we knew it could n't save her , but it did enable us to have a few more precious months together .
" she hung in there even when unconscious .
the nurses had n't seen anything like it .
they told us she sensed we were there .
emma northcott -lrb- top -rrb- helped her sister to demand nexavar " they said if we went outside she would go .
i went outside with my dad , and we were talking about the fund .
and that 's when she passed away . "
mrs spall now plans to help other patients win the right to have nexavar and a similar drug , sutent .
" there are no words in the world to describe the horror of this journey .
" i have no sense of relief or peace - maybe that will come later - for now i am raging at the unfairness of it all .
" mum and i had some beautiful conversations in the last week .
" she wants me to put my energy into my family and ensuring all kidney cancer patients get the treatment they deserve .
" we decided to set up a specific fighting fund , the pamela northcott fund - the right treatment at the right time for kidney cancer patients .
" mum came up with the strapline as this epitomises where it all went wrong for her .
" so far i 've already been involved in helping 35 patients win their appeals to have the drug treatment and another 15 are in progress .
" i feel this is a most fitting tribute to an inspirational woman . "

alistair leithead reports on the mixed legacy for those living in the border zone .
thousands gather at the border to watch the sunset ceremony the soldiers are more than 7ft tall -lrb- 2.13m -rrb- if you count the huge fan-shaped headdresses they waggle at each other like peacocks , just inches apart either side of the india-pakistan border .
for 45 minutes every sunset they high kick , stamp , speed march and shout their way through a choreographed routine that ends in the lowering of both flags and the slamming of the border gates .
the " retreat ceremony " , the traditional way to end hostilities for the day , is a lot less aggressive than it used to be - and any tension is cheered away by the baying crowd of thousands who pack the stadiums on either side every night .
at least now the posturing border guards , yelled on from the stands by chants of india and pakistan , afford themselves the briefest of handshakes .
divided communities after the ceremony the crowds stand within touching distance of each other , but the two countries are not supposed to be on speaking terms .
" best wishes from india ! " says one man .
but he is warned that too much interaction is banned and over the line a whistle is blown .
a soldier pushes the crowd back with his hand , a gun firmly held on his shoulder .
if partition had not happened it would have been the best thing .
we were living like brothers and there was a lot of love between us raghbir singh in pictures : celebration memories of a family torn sixty years since the two countries were created , the wagah border is still the only road link between india and pakistan .
the narrow white line on the tarmac is the physical representation of a line drawn on a map between amritsar and lahore and beyond in 1947 , which divided communities and families , and saw millions flee from one new country to another .
muslims rushed to pakistan , hindus and sikhs to india .
hundreds of thousands died on the journey as religious factions fought where their paths crossed .
raghbir singh slowly walked along the platform at the railway station on the indian side of the border , remembering what he saw there 60 years ago .
he was 19 at partition and can still picture the violence that accompanied it : " it was really a bad time .
there were trainloads coming from the pakistani side - there were dead bodies and a lot of injured people on the trains , " he said .
" there were people who were crying and running to the hospitals .
it was a really bad time .
i felt very sad and very down . "
hundreds of thousands died , but despite all that happened he still thinks the anniversary should be marked .
" it 's worth celebrating as it brings people together - there are those who used to live in one country still alive and we can meet .
" if partition had n't happened it would have been the best thing .
we were living like brothers and there was a lot of love between us - everyone was doing well . "
even today trucks are not allowed to cross the border road , so a small army of porters waits on either side with different coloured bibs identifying them as indian or pakistani .
the trucks unload 100m away and the men rush backwards and forwards with sack-loads on their heads , transferring them to the corresponding heads on the other side of the white line , while the two sets of tall border guards watch intently on .
even the postmen have a hard time - the two vans are backed up and sack-loads of mail are dismissively thrown over the line .
' soft ' borders it makes life very inconvenient for those living along the border .
hardev singh is a farmer , working his family 's land which was marooned in no-man 's land in 1947 .
nations torn apart now he needs a special permit to reach his lush , green rice paddy fields which are on the other side of a high , wide and rusty barbed-wire fence .
only he is allowed access to work the fields alone at specific times in the heat of every other day , there are limits on crop sizes and there is the degrading need for body searches when he goes in and out .
he hates the crowds and the military posturing just up the fence at the sunset ceremony .
" people who come to see it say relations between india and pakistan are getting better but it 's not changed for us , " he said .
" when i stand in my farm i do n't feel india is even an independent country . "
despite the bitterness and the bureaucracy there is some optimism that change will come .
kuldeep nayyar was formerly an indian high commissioner to britain but is now an activist for peace between pakistan and india .
" we want to foster the india-pakistan friendship , " he said , welcoming a pakistani delegation at the border ahead of a midnight peace ceremony .
" my dream is that the borders should become soft - from afghanistan to burma - and we can have a common market like europe .
identities will remain , but we will work on fighting poverty . "
that dream is still a long way off , but he hopes every anniversary of partition will bring better relations that little bit closer .

alistair leithead reports on the mixed legacy for those living in the border zone .
thousands gather at the border to watch the sunset ceremony the soldiers are more than 7ft tall -lrb- 2.13m -rrb- if you count the huge fan-shaped headdresses they waggle at each other like peacocks , just inches apart either side of the india-pakistan border .
for 45 minutes every sunset they high kick , stamp , speed march and shout their way through a choreographed routine that ends in the lowering of both flags and the slamming of the border gates .
the " retreat ceremony " , the traditional way to end hostilities for the day , is a lot less aggressive than it used to be - and any tension is cheered away by the baying crowd of thousands who pack the stadiums on either side every night .
at least now the posturing border guards , yelled on from the stands by chants of india and pakistan , afford themselves the briefest of handshakes .
divided communities after the ceremony the crowds stand within touching distance of each other , but the two countries are not supposed to be on speaking terms .
" best wishes from india ! " says one man .
but he is warned that too much interaction is banned and over the line a whistle is blown .
a soldier pushes the crowd back with his hand , a gun firmly held on his shoulder .
if partition had not happened it would have been the best thing .
we were living like brothers and there was a lot of love between us raghbir singh in pictures : celebration memories of a family torn sixty years since the two countries were created , the wagah border is still the only road link between india and pakistan .
the narrow white line on the tarmac is the physical representation of a line drawn on a map between amritsar and lahore and beyond in 1947 , which divided communities and families , and saw millions flee from one new country to another .
muslims rushed to pakistan , hindus and sikhs to india .
hundreds of thousands died on the journey as religious factions fought where their paths crossed .
raghbir singh slowly walked along the platform at the railway station on the indian side of the border , remembering what he saw there 60 years ago .
he was 19 at partition and can still picture the violence that accompanied it : " it was really a bad time .
there were trainloads coming from the pakistani side - there were dead bodies and a lot of injured people on the trains , " he said .
" there were people who were crying and running to the hospitals .
it was a really bad time .
i felt very sad and very down . "
hundreds of thousands died , but despite all that happened he still thinks the anniversary should be marked .
" it 's worth celebrating as it brings people together - there are those who used to live in one country still alive and we can meet .
" if partition had n't happened it would have been the best thing .
we were living like brothers and there was a lot of love between us - everyone was doing well . "
even today trucks are not allowed to cross the border road , so a small army of porters waits on either side with different coloured bibs identifying them as indian or pakistani .
the trucks unload 100m away and the men rush backwards and forwards with sack-loads on their heads , transferring them to the corresponding heads on the other side of the white line , while the two sets of tall border guards watch intently on .
even the postmen have a hard time - the two vans are backed up and sack-loads of mail are dismissively thrown over the line .
' soft ' borders it makes life very inconvenient for those living along the border .
hardev singh is a farmer , working his family 's land which was marooned in no-man 's land in 1947 .
nations torn apart now he needs a special permit to reach his lush , green rice paddy fields which are on the other side of a high , wide and rusty barbed-wire fence .
only he is allowed access to work the fields alone at specific times in the heat of every other day , there are limits on crop sizes and there is the degrading need for body searches when he goes in and out .
he hates the crowds and the military posturing just up the fence at the sunset ceremony .
" people who come to see it say relations between india and pakistan are getting better but it 's not changed for us , " he said .
" when i stand in my farm i do n't feel india is even an independent country . "
despite the bitterness and the bureaucracy there is some optimism that change will come .
