women are the main takers . microcredit lending schemes may have originated in the developing world , but they are no stranger to western europe .
for people wanting to set up their own small business but without the means to access loans from commercial banks , taking out a microcredit loan is one way to set up a business .
microfinance experts in europe , who recently attended a conference on the issue in berlin , say the practice is especially well suited to women .
in europe , women on average usually earn 15 percent less than their male counterparts for the same work and are more often threatened by poverty and unemployment .
banks often not interested tamara underwood of the paris-based european microfinance network told deutsche welle that though there 's no evidence that women are specifically discriminated against when it comes to getting access to bank loans , their customer profile doesn ’ t exactly match the loan requirements of the banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are often at a disadvantage when it comes to applying for bank loans " because women have often been unemployed or been housewives , they do n't have much of their own money , " underwood said .
" that 's why they often ca n't provide the collateral needed by the banks - unless they own a house and can mortgage it . "
retail , hospitality and the service sector are typically dominated by female entrepreneurs .
but since most of them have modest start-up capital and usually work part-time , banks often are n't interested in having them as customers , experts added .
for instance , the state-owned finnish bank finnvera refused for a long time to finance the service sector because it was linked with high start-up costs and risks , underwood said .
the bank , however , did change its policies over the years , with the result that it today counts many women among its customers .
reaffirming female solidarity women also make for loyal and reliable customers , according to experts familiar with microfinance .
" women who get credit often feel like they are a part of the project , " brigitte maas , an executive at goldrausch , a german organization that offers small loans to women wanting to set up their own business .
" the women who come to us also know well that if they do n't pay back , then we ca n't offer them any new credit .
the pay-back rate is really very high . "
raina timtscheva of a microfinance organization in bulgaria echoed the view .
in my experience , " there 's less bad credit with women than there is with men , " timtscheva told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bangladeshi nobel peace prize winner muhammad yunus is a microcredit pioneer experts point out that microfinance also plays an important role in creating a sense of female solidarity and bonding , for instance among african immigrants in france or communities in rural england .
" if one of them -lrb- the women -rrb- has difficulties paying back their loan , then the other women can step in to help , " underwood said .
" thus there 's a kind of social pressure to pay back the loan . "
spain leads the way in europe an estimated 39 percent of all microcredit lending schemes in western europe are used by women .
though that figure could be much higher , experts said , there are some countries in europe that fare better than others .
" in spain , almost 60 percent of all microfinance takers are women , " said underwood , who added that spain had taken a very clear stance on the issue .
" in spain , they want to reach women and help them out of their fringe position , " she added .
" the country has taken concrete steps : targeted advertising campaigns and special training programs so that women can achieve their goals . " microfinance : just like marketing jeans ?
in germany , microfinance is still in its infancy .
brigitte maas , who heads the german microfinance institute said the country still had to find out how the system worked best in the country .
maas pointed out that one microfinance institute , kiz from offenbach , near the german city of frankfurt , had found out in a study that microcredit lending schemes needed to be marketed just like washing powder or jeans .
maas said the city was plastered with big posters with pictures of a variety of tough-looking women , even older ones and some with headscarves with the slogan " does an entrepreneur look like this ? "

"
right-wing candidate nicolas sarkozy handily won the french presidential election with 53 percent of the vote ; some 85 percent of those eligible came to the polls . shouts of joy and cries of " nicolas - president ! " erupted from sarkozy 's supporters as it became clear he had defeated his socialist opponent , segolene royal . the significant lead at the polls appears to be a clear mandate for his plan for tough economic and social reforms .
ump party candidate sarkozy will replace conservative jacques chirac , who is stepping down after 12 years in office . biggest turnout since de gaulle the hard-fought race for chirac 's successor was the first in which a woman tried to win the french presidency .

" together we are going to write a new page of history .
the page , i am sure , will be great and it will be beautiful . " and he told cheering crowds that he promised to be " president for all the french without exception . "

" and to the us he had a message on global warming , saying , " france will always be by -lrb- the us 's -rrb- side when they need her .
but ... a great nation like the united states has the duty to not obstruct the fight against global warming , but on the contrary to head this struggle .
because what is at stake is the future of all humanity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal cast a ballot in her home district meanwhile , royal , who took around 47 percent of the vote , conceded defeat .

" and , she added : " i will continue with you and near you ... you can count on me to deepen the renovation of the left .

" fear of rioting thousands of police were on standby in paris and its high-immigrant suburbs in case a sarkozy victory sparks trouble .
but preparations went ahead for celebrations into the night . technicians erected a stage in the central place de la concorde , at the spot where the sarkozy camp planned its main events . the strong participation underscored the exceptional interest generated by the left-right battle for the elysee palace . sarkozy arrived at his paris campaign headquarters in the late afternoon , smiling broadly and shaking hands with members of the crowd that gathered outside . platform focussed on jobs the former interior minister earlier cast his ballot in the chic paris suburb of neuilly sur seine , where he was greeted with cheers of " nicolas president . "
his wife cecilia was not present however . royal said the choice for her " had not been difficult " after voting in the town of melle in her constituency in western france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sego vs. sarko : the race that mobilized a nation sarkozy , 52 , who has been leading in public opinion polls , says he wants to get france " back to work " and is proposing tax cuts and incentives to free up the labor market .
he also supports tougher controls on immigration . royal , 53 , had proposed to safeguard france 's generous social net , create jobs and carry out institutional reform to bring government closer to the people . winds of change ? " today we are making a choice as a society , " said guillaume bellequic , 28 , a computer expert who emphasized the differences between the two candidates after he voted in the western city of nantes . " there is change in the air , " said gaelle bernard , 30 , a psychologist .
" and i am mostly hopeful . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large majority of voters decided who would move in to the elysee palace but the election marks a shift to a new generation of leaders who are promising to tackle the huge national debt , high unemployment and simmering tensions in the suburbs . the first round on april 22 was marked by a near-record turnout of 84 percent .
sarkozy and royal advanced from a list of 12 candidates . the new president is expected to take office around may 16 , and launch into the campaign for legislative elections to be held in june to fill all 577 seats in the national assembly . dw staff / afp -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de sarkozy favored as french elect new president french voters cast ballots on sunday to choose a new president , with right-winger and clear favorite nicolas sarkozy squaring off against socialist segolene royal in a bid to win a mandate for sweeping change .

women are the main takers . microcredit lending schemes may have originated in the developing world , but they are no stranger to western europe .
for people wanting to set up their own small business but without the means to access loans from commercial banks , taking out a microcredit loan is one way to set up a business .
microfinance experts in europe , who recently attended a conference on the issue in berlin , say the practice is especially well suited to women .
in europe , women on average usually earn 15 percent less than their male counterparts for the same work and are more often threatened by poverty and unemployment .
banks often not interested tamara underwood of the paris-based european microfinance network told deutsche welle that though there 's no evidence that women are specifically discriminated against when it comes to getting access to bank loans , their customer profile doesn ’ t exactly match the loan requirements of the banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are often at a disadvantage when it comes to applying for bank loans " because women have often been unemployed or been housewives , they do n't have much of their own money , " underwood said .
" that 's why they often ca n't provide the collateral needed by the banks - unless they own a house and can mortgage it . "
retail , hospitality and the service sector are typically dominated by female entrepreneurs .
but since most of them have modest start-up capital and usually work part-time , banks often are n't interested in having them as customers , experts added .
for instance , the state-owned finnish bank finnvera refused for a long time to finance the service sector because it was linked with high start-up costs and risks , underwood said .
the bank , however , did change its policies over the years , with the result that it today counts many women among its customers .
reaffirming female solidarity women also make for loyal and reliable customers , according to experts familiar with microfinance .
" women who get credit often feel like they are a part of the project , " brigitte maas , an executive at goldrausch , a german organization that offers small loans to women wanting to set up their own business .
" the women who come to us also know well that if they do n't pay back , then we ca n't offer them any new credit .
the pay-back rate is really very high . "
raina timtscheva of a microfinance organization in bulgaria echoed the view .
in my experience , " there 's less bad credit with women than there is with men , " timtscheva told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bangladeshi nobel peace prize winner muhammad yunus is a microcredit pioneer experts point out that microfinance also plays an important role in creating a sense of female solidarity and bonding , for instance among african immigrants in france or communities in rural england .
" if one of them -lrb- the women -rrb- has difficulties paying back their loan , then the other women can step in to help , " underwood said .
" thus there 's a kind of social pressure to pay back the loan . "
spain leads the way in europe an estimated 39 percent of all microcredit lending schemes in western europe are used by women .
though that figure could be much higher , experts said , there are some countries in europe that fare better than others .
" in spain , almost 60 percent of all microfinance takers are women , " said underwood , who added that spain had taken a very clear stance on the issue .
" in spain , they want to reach women and help them out of their fringe position , " she added .
" the country has taken concrete steps : targeted advertising campaigns and special training programs so that women can achieve their goals . " microfinance : just like marketing jeans ?
in germany , microfinance is still in its infancy .
brigitte maas , who heads the german microfinance institute said the country still had to find out how the system worked best in the country .
maas pointed out that one microfinance institute , kiz from offenbach , near the german city of frankfurt , had found out in a study that microcredit lending schemes needed to be marketed just like washing powder or jeans .
maas said the city was plastered with big posters with pictures of a variety of tough-looking women , even older ones and some with headscarves with the slogan " does an entrepreneur look like this ? "
" and suddenly there were so many women with immigrant backgrounds who you had n't seen before flooding to the microfinance institute , " she added . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 to offer micro-credit help , step up aids funding for africa development ministers from the g8 undertook in berlin on tuesday to set up micro-credit facilities for african nations with the help of the world bank and increase funds for the fight against aids .

women are the main takers . microcredit lending schemes may have originated in the developing world , but they are no stranger to western europe .
for people wanting to set up their own small business but without the means to access loans from commercial banks , taking out a microcredit loan is one way to set up a business .
microfinance experts in europe , who recently attended a conference on the issue in berlin , say the practice is especially well suited to women .
in europe , women on average usually earn 15 percent less than their male counterparts for the same work and are more often threatened by poverty and unemployment .
banks often not interested tamara underwood of the paris-based european microfinance network told deutsche welle that though there 's no evidence that women are specifically discriminated against when it comes to getting access to bank loans , their customer profile doesn ’ t exactly match the loan requirements of the banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are often at a disadvantage when it comes to applying for bank loans " because women have often been unemployed or been housewives , they do n't have much of their own money , " underwood said .
" that 's why they often ca n't provide the collateral needed by the banks - unless they own a house and can mortgage it . "
retail , hospitality and the service sector are typically dominated by female entrepreneurs .
but since most of them have modest start-up capital and usually work part-time , banks often are n't interested in having them as customers , experts added .
for instance , the state-owned finnish bank finnvera refused for a long time to finance the service sector because it was linked with high start-up costs and risks , underwood said .
the bank , however , did change its policies over the years , with the result that it today counts many women among its customers .
reaffirming female solidarity women also make for loyal and reliable customers , according to experts familiar with microfinance .
" women who get credit often feel like they are a part of the project , " brigitte maas , an executive at goldrausch , a german organization that offers small loans to women wanting to set up their own business .
" the women who come to us also know well that if they do n't pay back , then we ca n't offer them any new credit .
the pay-back rate is really very high . "
raina timtscheva of a microfinance organization in bulgaria echoed the view .
in my experience , " there 's less bad credit with women than there is with men , " timtscheva told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bangladeshi nobel peace prize winner muhammad yunus is a microcredit pioneer experts point out that microfinance also plays an important role in creating a sense of female solidarity and bonding , for instance among african immigrants in france or communities in rural england .
" if one of them -lrb- the women -rrb- has difficulties paying back their loan , then the other women can step in to help , " underwood said .
" thus there 's a kind of social pressure to pay back the loan . "
spain leads the way in europe an estimated 39 percent of all microcredit lending schemes in western europe are used by women .
though that figure could be much higher , experts said , there are some countries in europe that fare better than others .
" in spain , almost 60 percent of all microfinance takers are women , " said underwood , who added that spain had taken a very clear stance on the issue .
" in spain , they want to reach women and help them out of their fringe position , " she added .
" the country has taken concrete steps : targeted advertising campaigns and special training programs so that women can achieve their goals . " microfinance : just like marketing jeans ?
in germany , microfinance is still in its infancy .
brigitte maas , who heads the german microfinance institute said the country still had to find out how the system worked best in the country .
maas pointed out that one microfinance institute , kiz from offenbach , near the german city of frankfurt , had found out in a study that microcredit lending schemes needed to be marketed just like washing powder or jeans .
maas said the city was plastered with big posters with pictures of a variety of tough-looking women , even older ones and some with headscarves with the slogan " does an entrepreneur look like this ? "
" and suddenly there were so many women with immigrant backgrounds who you had n't seen before flooding to the microfinance institute , " she added . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 to offer micro-credit help , step up aids funding for africa development ministers from the g8 undertook in berlin on tuesday to set up micro-credit facilities for african nations with the help of the world bank and increase funds for the fight against aids .

women are the main takers . microcredit lending schemes may have originated in the developing world , but they are no stranger to western europe .
for people wanting to set up their own small business but without the means to access loans from commercial banks , taking out a microcredit loan is one way to set up a business .
microfinance experts in europe , who recently attended a conference on the issue in berlin , say the practice is especially well suited to women .
in europe , women on average usually earn 15 percent less than their male counterparts for the same work and are more often threatened by poverty and unemployment .
banks often not interested tamara underwood of the paris-based european microfinance network told deutsche welle that though there 's no evidence that women are specifically discriminated against when it comes to getting access to bank loans , their customer profile doesn ’ t exactly match the loan requirements of the banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are often at a disadvantage when it comes to applying for bank loans " because women have often been unemployed or been housewives , they do n't have much of their own money , " underwood said .
" that 's why they often ca n't provide the collateral needed by the banks - unless they own a house and can mortgage it . "
retail , hospitality and the service sector are typically dominated by female entrepreneurs .
but since most of them have modest start-up capital and usually work part-time , banks often are n't interested in having them as customers , experts added .
for instance , the state-owned finnish bank finnvera refused for a long time to finance the service sector because it was linked with high start-up costs and risks , underwood said .
the bank , however , did change its policies over the years , with the result that it today counts many women among its customers .
reaffirming female solidarity women also make for loyal and reliable customers , according to experts familiar with microfinance .
" women who get credit often feel like they are a part of the project , " brigitte maas , an executive at goldrausch , a german organization that offers small loans to women wanting to set up their own business .
" the women who come to us also know well that if they do n't pay back , then we ca n't offer them any new credit .
the pay-back rate is really very high . "
raina timtscheva of a microfinance organization in bulgaria echoed the view .
in my experience , " there 's less bad credit with women than there is with men , " timtscheva told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bangladeshi nobel peace prize winner muhammad yunus is a microcredit pioneer experts point out that microfinance also plays an important role in creating a sense of female solidarity and bonding , for instance among african immigrants in france or communities in rural england .
" if one of them -lrb- the women -rrb- has difficulties paying back their loan , then the other women can step in to help , " underwood said .
" thus there 's a kind of social pressure to pay back the loan . "
spain leads the way in europe an estimated 39 percent of all microcredit lending schemes in western europe are used by women .
though that figure could be much higher , experts said , there are some countries in europe that fare better than others .
" in spain , almost 60 percent of all microfinance takers are women , " said underwood , who added that spain had taken a very clear stance on the issue .
" in spain , they want to reach women and help them out of their fringe position , " she added .
" the country has taken concrete steps : targeted advertising campaigns and special training programs so that women can achieve their goals . " microfinance : just like marketing jeans ?
in germany , microfinance is still in its infancy .
brigitte maas , who heads the german microfinance institute said the country still had to find out how the system worked best in the country .
maas pointed out that one microfinance institute , kiz from offenbach , near the german city of frankfurt , had found out in a study that microcredit lending schemes needed to be marketed just like washing powder or jeans .
maas said the city was plastered with big posters with pictures of a variety of tough-looking women , even older ones and some with headscarves with the slogan " does an entrepreneur look like this ? "
" and suddenly there were so many women with immigrant backgrounds who you had n't seen before flooding to the microfinance institute , " she added . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 to offer micro-credit help , step up aids funding for africa development ministers from the g8 undertook in berlin on tuesday to set up micro-credit facilities for african nations with the help of the world bank and increase funds for the fight against aids .

for people wanting to set up their own small business but without the means to access loans from commercial banks , taking out a microcredit loan is one way to set up a business .
microfinance experts in europe , who recently attended a conference on the issue in berlin , say the practice is especially well suited to women .
in europe , women on average usually earn 15 percent less than their male counterparts for the same work and are more often threatened by poverty and unemployment .
banks often not interested tamara underwood of the paris-based european microfinance network told deutsche welle that though there 's no evidence that women are specifically discriminated against when it comes to getting access to bank loans , their customer profile doesn ’ t exactly match the loan requirements of the banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are often at a disadvantage when it comes to applying for bank loans " because women have often been unemployed or been housewives , they do n't have much of their own money , " underwood said .
" that 's why they often ca n't provide the collateral needed by the banks - unless they own a house and can mortgage it . "
retail , hospitality and the service sector are typically dominated by female entrepreneurs .
but since most of them have modest start-up capital and usually work part-time , banks often are n't interested in having them as customers , experts added .
for instance , the state-owned finnish bank finnvera refused for a long time to finance the service sector because it was linked with high start-up costs and risks , underwood said .
the bank , however , did change its policies over the years , with the result that it today counts many women among its customers .
reaffirming female solidarity women also make for loyal and reliable customers , according to experts familiar with microfinance .
" women who get credit often feel like they are a part of the project , " brigitte maas , an executive at goldrausch , a german organization that offers small loans to women wanting to set up their own business .
" the women who come to us also know well that if they do n't pay back , then we ca n't offer them any new credit .
the pay-back rate is really very high . "
raina timtscheva of a microfinance organization in bulgaria echoed the view .
in my experience , " there 's less bad credit with women than there is with men , " timtscheva told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bangladeshi nobel peace prize winner muhammad yunus is a microcredit pioneer experts point out that microfinance also plays an important role in creating a sense of female solidarity and bonding , for instance among african immigrants in france or communities in rural england .
" if one of them -lrb- the women -rrb- has difficulties paying back their loan , then the other women can step in to help , " underwood said .
" thus there 's a kind of social pressure to pay back the loan . "
spain leads the way in europe an estimated 39 percent of all microcredit lending schemes in western europe are used by women .
though that figure could be much higher , experts said , there are some countries in europe that fare better than others .
" in spain , almost 60 percent of all microfinance takers are women , " said underwood , who added that spain had taken a very clear stance on the issue .
" in spain , they want to reach women and help them out of their fringe position , " she added .
" the country has taken concrete steps : targeted advertising campaigns and special training programs so that women can achieve their goals . " microfinance : just like marketing jeans ?
in germany , microfinance is still in its infancy .
brigitte maas , who heads the german microfinance institute said the country still had to find out how the system worked best in the country .
maas pointed out that one microfinance institute , kiz from offenbach , near the german city of frankfurt , had found out in a study that microcredit lending schemes needed to be marketed just like washing powder or jeans .
maas said the city was plastered with big posters with pictures of a variety of tough-looking women , even older ones and some with headscarves with the slogan " does an entrepreneur look like this ? "
" and suddenly there were so many women with immigrant backgrounds who you had n't seen before flooding to the microfinance institute , " she added . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 to offer micro-credit help , step up aids funding for africa development ministers from the g8 undertook in berlin on tuesday to set up micro-credit facilities for african nations with the help of the world bank and increase funds for the fight against aids .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.05.2007 in europe , microcredit helps women stand on own feet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an increasing number of women in europe are turning to microcredit to finance start-ups in europe , a financial loan of less than 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 34,000 -rrb- is usually offered by microfinance institutions to people without access to commercial bank loans .
women are the main takers . microcredit lending schemes may have originated in the developing world , but they are no stranger to western europe .
for people wanting to set up their own small business but without the means to access loans from commercial banks , taking out a microcredit loan is one way to set up a business .
microfinance experts in europe , who recently attended a conference on the issue in berlin , say the practice is especially well suited to women .
in europe , women on average usually earn 15 percent less than their male counterparts for the same work and are more often threatened by poverty and unemployment .
banks often not interested tamara underwood of the paris-based european microfinance network told deutsche welle that though there 's no evidence that women are specifically discriminated against when it comes to getting access to bank loans , their customer profile doesn ’ t exactly match the loan requirements of the banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are often at a disadvantage when it comes to applying for bank loans " because women have often been unemployed or been housewives , they do n't have much of their own money , " underwood said .
" that 's why they often ca n't provide the collateral needed by the banks - unless they own a house and can mortgage it . "
retail , hospitality and the service sector are typically dominated by female entrepreneurs .
but since most of them have modest start-up capital and usually work part-time , banks often are n't interested in having them as customers , experts added .
for instance , the state-owned finnish bank finnvera refused for a long time to finance the service sector because it was linked with high start-up costs and risks , underwood said .
the bank , however , did change its policies over the years , with the result that it today counts many women among its customers .
reaffirming female solidarity women also make for loyal and reliable customers , according to experts familiar with microfinance .
" women who get credit often feel like they are a part of the project , " brigitte maas , an executive at goldrausch , a german organization that offers small loans to women wanting to set up their own business .
" the women who come to us also know well that if they do n't pay back , then we ca n't offer them any new credit .
the pay-back rate is really very high . "
raina timtscheva of a microfinance organization in bulgaria echoed the view .
in my experience , " there 's less bad credit with women than there is with men , " timtscheva told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bangladeshi nobel peace prize winner muhammad yunus is a microcredit pioneer experts point out that microfinance also plays an important role in creating a sense of female solidarity and bonding , for instance among african immigrants in france or communities in rural england .
" if one of them -lrb- the women -rrb- has difficulties paying back their loan , then the other women can step in to help , " underwood said .
" thus there 's a kind of social pressure to pay back the loan . "
spain leads the way in europe an estimated 39 percent of all microcredit lending schemes in western europe are used by women .
though that figure could be much higher , experts said , there are some countries in europe that fare better than others .
" in spain , almost 60 percent of all microfinance takers are women , " said underwood , who added that spain had taken a very clear stance on the issue .
" in spain , they want to reach women and help them out of their fringe position , " she added .
" the country has taken concrete steps : targeted advertising campaigns and special training programs so that women can achieve their goals . " microfinance : just like marketing jeans ?
in germany , microfinance is still in its infancy .
brigitte maas , who heads the german microfinance institute said the country still had to find out how the system worked best in the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.05.2007 in europe , microcredit helps women stand on own feet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an increasing number of women in europe are turning to microcredit to finance start-ups in europe , a financial loan of less than 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 34,000 -rrb- is usually offered by microfinance institutions to people without access to commercial bank loans .
women are the main takers . microcredit lending schemes may have originated in the developing world , but they are no stranger to western europe .
for people wanting to set up their own small business but without the means to access loans from commercial banks , taking out a microcredit loan is one way to set up a business .
microfinance experts in europe , who recently attended a conference on the issue in berlin , say the practice is especially well suited to women .
in europe , women on average usually earn 15 percent less than their male counterparts for the same work and are more often threatened by poverty and unemployment .
banks often not interested tamara underwood of the paris-based european microfinance network told deutsche welle that though there 's no evidence that women are specifically discriminated against when it comes to getting access to bank loans , their customer profile doesn ’ t exactly match the loan requirements of the banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are often at a disadvantage when it comes to applying for bank loans " because women have often been unemployed or been housewives , they do n't have much of their own money , " underwood said .
" that 's why they often ca n't provide the collateral needed by the banks - unless they own a house and can mortgage it . "
retail , hospitality and the service sector are typically dominated by female entrepreneurs .
but since most of them have modest start-up capital and usually work part-time , banks often are n't interested in having them as customers , experts added .
for instance , the state-owned finnish bank finnvera refused for a long time to finance the service sector because it was linked with high start-up costs and risks , underwood said .
the bank , however , did change its policies over the years , with the result that it today counts many women among its customers .
reaffirming female solidarity women also make for loyal and reliable customers , according to experts familiar with microfinance .
" women who get credit often feel like they are a part of the project , " brigitte maas , an executive at goldrausch , a german organization that offers small loans to women wanting to set up their own business .
" the women who come to us also know well that if they do n't pay back , then we ca n't offer them any new credit .
the pay-back rate is really very high . "
raina timtscheva of a microfinance organization in bulgaria echoed the view .
in my experience , " there 's less bad credit with women than there is with men , " timtscheva told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bangladeshi nobel peace prize winner muhammad yunus is a microcredit pioneer experts point out that microfinance also plays an important role in creating a sense of female solidarity and bonding , for instance among african immigrants in france or communities in rural england .
" if one of them -lrb- the women -rrb- has difficulties paying back their loan , then the other women can step in to help , " underwood said .
" thus there 's a kind of social pressure to pay back the loan . "
spain leads the way in europe an estimated 39 percent of all microcredit lending schemes in western europe are used by women .
though that figure could be much higher , experts said , there are some countries in europe that fare better than others .
" in spain , almost 60 percent of all microfinance takers are women , " said underwood , who added that spain had taken a very clear stance on the issue .
" in spain , they want to reach women and help them out of their fringe position , " she added .
" the country has taken concrete steps : targeted advertising campaigns and special training programs so that women can achieve their goals . " microfinance : just like marketing jeans ?
in germany , microfinance is still in its infancy .
brigitte maas , who heads the german microfinance institute said the country still had to find out how the system worked best in the country .
maas pointed out that one microfinance institute , kiz from offenbach , near the german city of frankfurt , had found out in a study that microcredit lending schemes needed to be marketed just like washing powder or jeans .
maas said the city was plastered with big posters with pictures of a variety of tough-looking women , even older ones and some with headscarves with the slogan " does an entrepreneur look like this ? "

ump party candidate sarkozy will replace conservative jacques chirac , who is stepping down after 12 years in office . biggest turnout since de gaulle the hard-fought race for chirac 's successor was the first in which a woman tried to win the french presidency .
that , and the clear left-right divison of the candidates ' ideologies , brought voters flocking to the polls . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy 's clear win has been called a mandate for change turnout was estimated at around 85 percent of france 's 44.5 million eligible voters - the highest percentage since the 1965 election won by charles de gaulle . thousands of sarkozy supporters gathered on the historic place de la concorde in central paris , where sarkozy gave a victory speech . " now is the time for me to give back to france what france has given to me , " sarkozy told delighted supporters .
" together we are going to write a new page of history .
the page , i am sure , will be great and it will be beautiful . " and he told cheering crowds that he promised to be " president for all the french without exception . "
forays into diplomacy " to all those french who did not vote for me , i want to say , beyond political battles , beyond differences of opinion , for me there is only one france . ...
i will be president of all the french , " sarkozy said .
he made his first forays as president into international relations when he said , " i want to launch a call to our european partners , with whom our destiny is deeply linked , to tell them that i have been european all my life , that i believe deeply , that i believe sincerely , in european construction , and that tonight france is back in europe . " and to the us he had a message on global warming , saying , " france will always be by -lrb- the us 's -rrb- side when they need her .
but ... a great nation like the united states has the duty to not obstruct the fight against global warming , but on the contrary to head this struggle .
because what is at stake is the future of all humanity . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal cast a ballot in her home district meanwhile , royal , who took around 47 percent of the vote , conceded defeat .
speaking to her supporters at her election headquarters , she said she hoped that " the next president of the republic will accomplish his mandate for the service of all french people . " and , she added : " i will continue with you and near you ... you can count on me to deepen the renovation of the left . " jean-louis borloo , who is tipped as a possible prime minister under a sarkozy presidency , hailed the right-winger 's election victory as being " beautiful because it was unambiguous . " fear of rioting thousands of police were on standby in paris and its high-immigrant suburbs in case a sarkozy victory sparks trouble .
but preparations went ahead for celebrations into the night . technicians erected a stage in the central place de la concorde , at the spot where the sarkozy camp planned its main events . the strong participation underscored the exceptional interest generated by the left-right battle for the elysee palace . sarkozy arrived at his paris campaign headquarters in the late afternoon , smiling broadly and shaking hands with members of the crowd that gathered outside . platform focussed on jobs the former interior minister earlier cast his ballot in the chic paris suburb of neuilly sur seine , where he was greeted with cheers of " nicolas president . "
his wife cecilia was not present however . royal said the choice for her " had not been difficult " after voting in the town of melle in her constituency in western france . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sego vs. sarko : the race that mobilized a nation sarkozy , 52 , who has been leading in public opinion polls , says he wants to get france " back to work " and is proposing tax cuts and incentives to free up the labor market .
he also supports tougher controls on immigration . royal , 53 , had proposed to safeguard france 's generous social net , create jobs and carry out institutional reform to bring government closer to the people . winds of change ? " today we are making a choice as a society , " said guillaume bellequic , 28 , a computer expert who emphasized the differences between the two candidates after he voted in the western city of nantes . " there is change in the air , " said gaelle bernard , 30 , a psychologist .
" and i am mostly hopeful . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a large majority of voters decided who would move in to the elysee palace but the election marks a shift to a new generation of leaders who are promising to tackle the huge national debt , high unemployment and simmering tensions in the suburbs . the first round on april 22 was marked by a near-record turnout of 84 percent .

he also supports tougher controls on immigration . royal , a 53-year-old former adviser to president francois mitterrand , is proposing to safeguard generous social protection , create jobs and carry out institutional reform to bring government closer to the people . bildunterschrift : candidates ended the election campaigns on friday night royal fears riots if sarkozy wins with the final polls showing sarkozy on course for victory , royal on friday warned that his victory could re-ignite violence in the high-immigrant suburbs following riots in late 2005 . royal has described sarkozy as a " dangerous " leader who would divide rather than unite the french people and urged voters to show that the polls " were lying . " sarkozy responded by labeling royal 's attacks as " outrageous " and prompted by desperation . sarkozy , the 52-year-old former interior minister , is hated by many arab and african immigrants in the suburbs that were rocked by three weeks of rioting in late 2005 in which hundreds of buildings and thousands of cars were burned . his tough approach to law and order and pledges to purge the suburbs of " scum " has turned him into an enemy of the poor neighborhoods where many descendants of north african immigrants say they are shut out of mainstream france . security beefed up in paris suburbs bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy is rumored to have already made plans for a victory celebration security has been stepped up in paris and the suburbs to prevent possible violence in the event of a sarkozy victory , with some 3,000 riot police on alert for trouble . in argenteuil , one of the suburbs at the center of the 2005 riots , a steady stream of voters calmly turned out to render their verdict at the end of one of the hardest fought campaigns in decades . aurelie , a 21-year-old student from the french island of la reunion , said she voted for royal to try to block a sarkozy victory . " people say that if he wins there will be more violence so naturally it makes you think , " she said . large voter turn-out expected early polling was also brisk at a station on ile saint-louis , in the heart of paris . francois , who declined to give his last name , said he was voting for sarkozy because he felt that " instinctively " he was better suited for the post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist candidate royal is hoping for this much more support royal battled throughout the campaign to dispel doubts about her presidential stature , while sarkozy faced voter concerns that his hyper-active personality was a liability . the election marks a shift to a younger generation of leaders born after world war ii , who are promising to tackle the huge national debt , high unemployment and simmering tensions in the suburbs . fight for the center a first round of voting was held on april 22 marked by a near-record turnout of 84 percent .
ten of the 12 candidates in that election were eliminated , allowing sarkozy and royal to advance . the run-off focused on winning over the 6.8 million voters who backed centrist francois bayrou after he campaigned on a platform that rejected the left-right divide . polling stations close at 8:00 p.m. local time , with first unofficial estimates expected immediately after . confident of a victory , sarkozy 's supporters are planning a celebration near paris ' famed champs elysees late sunday with rock star johnny hallyday , the french elvis , and rai artist faudel set to appear . the new president is expected to take office around may 17 , and set his or her sights on the legislative elections to be held in two rounds in june to fill all 577 seats in the national assembly . dw staff / afp -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de president chirac bids adieu to chancellor merkel outgoing french president jacques chirac was praised by german chancellor angela merkel for strengthening franco-german relations as he paid a farewell visit to berlin on thursday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.05.2007 in europe , microcredit helps women stand on own feet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an increasing number of women in europe are turning to microcredit to finance start-ups in europe , a financial loan of less than 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 34,000 -rrb- is usually offered by microfinance institutions to people without access to commercial bank loans .
women are the main takers . microcredit lending schemes may have originated in the developing world , but they are no stranger to western europe .
for people wanting to set up their own small business but without the means to access loans from commercial banks , taking out a microcredit loan is one way to set up a business .
microfinance experts in europe , who recently attended a conference on the issue in berlin , say the practice is especially well suited to women .
in europe , women on average usually earn 15 percent less than their male counterparts for the same work and are more often threatened by poverty and unemployment .
banks often not interested tamara underwood of the paris-based european microfinance network told deutsche welle that though there 's no evidence that women are specifically discriminated against when it comes to getting access to bank loans , their customer profile doesn ’ t exactly match the loan requirements of the banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are often at a disadvantage when it comes to applying for bank loans " because women have often been unemployed or been housewives , they do n't have much of their own money , " underwood said .
" that 's why they often ca n't provide the collateral needed by the banks - unless they own a house and can mortgage it . "
retail , hospitality and the service sector are typically dominated by female entrepreneurs .
but since most of them have modest start-up capital and usually work part-time , banks often are n't interested in having them as customers , experts added .
for instance , the state-owned finnish bank finnvera refused for a long time to finance the service sector because it was linked with high start-up costs and risks , underwood said .
the bank , however , did change its policies over the years , with the result that it today counts many women among its customers .
reaffirming female solidarity women also make for loyal and reliable customers , according to experts familiar with microfinance .
" women who get credit often feel like they are a part of the project , " brigitte maas , an executive at goldrausch , a german organization that offers small loans to women wanting to set up their own business .
" the women who come to us also know well that if they do n't pay back , then we ca n't offer them any new credit .
the pay-back rate is really very high . "
raina timtscheva of a microfinance organization in bulgaria echoed the view .
in my experience , " there 's less bad credit with women than there is with men , " timtscheva told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bangladeshi nobel peace prize winner muhammad yunus is a microcredit pioneer experts point out that microfinance also plays an important role in creating a sense of female solidarity and bonding , for instance among african immigrants in france or communities in rural england .
" if one of them -lrb- the women -rrb- has difficulties paying back their loan , then the other women can step in to help , " underwood said .
" thus there 's a kind of social pressure to pay back the loan . "
spain leads the way in europe an estimated 39 percent of all microcredit lending schemes in western europe are used by women .
though that figure could be much higher , experts said , there are some countries in europe that fare better than others .
" in spain , almost 60 percent of all microfinance takers are women , " said underwood , who added that spain had taken a very clear stance on the issue .
" in spain , they want to reach women and help them out of their fringe position , " she added .
" the country has taken concrete steps : targeted advertising campaigns and special training programs so that women can achieve their goals . " microfinance : just like marketing jeans ?
in germany , microfinance is still in its infancy .
brigitte maas , who heads the german microfinance institute said the country still had to find out how the system worked best in the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.05.2007 in europe , microcredit helps women stand on own feet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an increasing number of women in europe are turning to microcredit to finance start-ups in europe , a financial loan of less than 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 34,000 -rrb- is usually offered by microfinance institutions to people without access to commercial bank loans .
women are the main takers . microcredit lending schemes may have originated in the developing world , but they are no stranger to western europe .
for people wanting to set up their own small business but without the means to access loans from commercial banks , taking out a microcredit loan is one way to set up a business .
microfinance experts in europe , who recently attended a conference on the issue in berlin , say the practice is especially well suited to women .
in europe , women on average usually earn 15 percent less than their male counterparts for the same work and are more often threatened by poverty and unemployment .
banks often not interested tamara underwood of the paris-based european microfinance network told deutsche welle that though there 's no evidence that women are specifically discriminated against when it comes to getting access to bank loans , their customer profile doesn ’ t exactly match the loan requirements of the banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are often at a disadvantage when it comes to applying for bank loans " because women have often been unemployed or been housewives , they do n't have much of their own money , " underwood said .
" that 's why they often ca n't provide the collateral needed by the banks - unless they own a house and can mortgage it . "
retail , hospitality and the service sector are typically dominated by female entrepreneurs .
but since most of them have modest start-up capital and usually work part-time , banks often are n't interested in having them as customers , experts added .
for instance , the state-owned finnish bank finnvera refused for a long time to finance the service sector because it was linked with high start-up costs and risks , underwood said .
the bank , however , did change its policies over the years , with the result that it today counts many women among its customers .
reaffirming female solidarity women also make for loyal and reliable customers , according to experts familiar with microfinance .
" women who get credit often feel like they are a part of the project , " brigitte maas , an executive at goldrausch , a german organization that offers small loans to women wanting to set up their own business .
" the women who come to us also know well that if they do n't pay back , then we ca n't offer them any new credit .
the pay-back rate is really very high . "
raina timtscheva of a microfinance organization in bulgaria echoed the view .
in my experience , " there 's less bad credit with women than there is with men , " timtscheva told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bangladeshi nobel peace prize winner muhammad yunus is a microcredit pioneer experts point out that microfinance also plays an important role in creating a sense of female solidarity and bonding , for instance among african immigrants in france or communities in rural england .
" if one of them -lrb- the women -rrb- has difficulties paying back their loan , then the other women can step in to help , " underwood said .
" thus there 's a kind of social pressure to pay back the loan . "
spain leads the way in europe an estimated 39 percent of all microcredit lending schemes in western europe are used by women .
though that figure could be much higher , experts said , there are some countries in europe that fare better than others .
" in spain , almost 60 percent of all microfinance takers are women , " said underwood , who added that spain had taken a very clear stance on the issue .
" in spain , they want to reach women and help them out of their fringe position , " she added .
" the country has taken concrete steps : targeted advertising campaigns and special training programs so that women can achieve their goals . " microfinance : just like marketing jeans ?
in germany , microfinance is still in its infancy .
brigitte maas , who heads the german microfinance institute said the country still had to find out how the system worked best in the country .
maas pointed out that one microfinance institute , kiz from offenbach , near the german city of frankfurt , had found out in a study that microcredit lending schemes needed to be marketed just like washing powder or jeans .
maas said the city was plastered with big posters with pictures of a variety of tough-looking women , even older ones and some with headscarves with the slogan " does an entrepreneur look like this ? "
" and suddenly there were so many women with immigrant backgrounds who you had n't seen before flooding to the microfinance institute , " she added . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 to offer micro-credit help , step up aids funding for africa development ministers from the g8 undertook in berlin on tuesday to set up micro-credit facilities for african nations with the help of the world bank and increase funds for the fight against aids .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.05.2007 in europe , microcredit helps women stand on own feet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an increasing number of women in europe are turning to microcredit to finance start-ups in europe , a financial loan of less than 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 34,000 -rrb- is usually offered by microfinance institutions to people without access to commercial bank loans .
women are the main takers . microcredit lending schemes may have originated in the developing world , but they are no stranger to western europe .
for people wanting to set up their own small business but without the means to access loans from commercial banks , taking out a microcredit loan is one way to set up a business .
microfinance experts in europe , who recently attended a conference on the issue in berlin , say the practice is especially well suited to women .
in europe , women on average usually earn 15 percent less than their male counterparts for the same work and are more often threatened by poverty and unemployment .
banks often not interested tamara underwood of the paris-based european microfinance network told deutsche welle that though there 's no evidence that women are specifically discriminated against when it comes to getting access to bank loans , their customer profile doesn ’ t exactly match the loan requirements of the banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are often at a disadvantage when it comes to applying for bank loans " because women have often been unemployed or been housewives , they do n't have much of their own money , " underwood said .
" that 's why they often ca n't provide the collateral needed by the banks - unless they own a house and can mortgage it . "
retail , hospitality and the service sector are typically dominated by female entrepreneurs .
but since most of them have modest start-up capital and usually work part-time , banks often are n't interested in having them as customers , experts added .
for instance , the state-owned finnish bank finnvera refused for a long time to finance the service sector because it was linked with high start-up costs and risks , underwood said .
the bank , however , did change its policies over the years , with the result that it today counts many women among its customers .
reaffirming female solidarity women also make for loyal and reliable customers , according to experts familiar with microfinance .
" women who get credit often feel like they are a part of the project , " brigitte maas , an executive at goldrausch , a german organization that offers small loans to women wanting to set up their own business .
" the women who come to us also know well that if they do n't pay back , then we ca n't offer them any new credit .
the pay-back rate is really very high . "
raina timtscheva of a microfinance organization in bulgaria echoed the view .
in my experience , " there 's less bad credit with women than there is with men , " timtscheva told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bangladeshi nobel peace prize winner muhammad yunus is a microcredit pioneer experts point out that microfinance also plays an important role in creating a sense of female solidarity and bonding , for instance among african immigrants in france or communities in rural england .
" if one of them -lrb- the women -rrb- has difficulties paying back their loan , then the other women can step in to help , " underwood said .
" thus there 's a kind of social pressure to pay back the loan . "
spain leads the way in europe an estimated 39 percent of all microcredit lending schemes in western europe are used by women .
though that figure could be much higher , experts said , there are some countries in europe that fare better than others .
" in spain , almost 60 percent of all microfinance takers are women , " said underwood , who added that spain had taken a very clear stance on the issue .
" in spain , they want to reach women and help them out of their fringe position , " she added .
" the country has taken concrete steps : targeted advertising campaigns and special training programs so that women can achieve their goals . " microfinance : just like marketing jeans ?
in germany , microfinance is still in its infancy .
brigitte maas , who heads the german microfinance institute said the country still had to find out how the system worked best in the country .
maas pointed out that one microfinance institute , kiz from offenbach , near the german city of frankfurt , had found out in a study that microcredit lending schemes needed to be marketed just like washing powder or jeans .
maas said the city was plastered with big posters with pictures of a variety of tough-looking women , even older ones and some with headscarves with the slogan " does an entrepreneur look like this ? "
" and suddenly there were so many women with immigrant backgrounds who you had n't seen before flooding to the microfinance institute , " she added . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 to offer micro-credit help , step up aids funding for africa development ministers from the g8 undertook in berlin on tuesday to set up micro-credit facilities for african nations with the help of the world bank and increase funds for the fight against aids .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.05.2007 in europe , microcredit helps women stand on own feet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an increasing number of women in europe are turning to microcredit to finance start-ups in europe , a financial loan of less than 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 34,000 -rrb- is usually offered by microfinance institutions to people without access to commercial bank loans .
women are the main takers . microcredit lending schemes may have originated in the developing world , but they are no stranger to western europe .
for people wanting to set up their own small business but without the means to access loans from commercial banks , taking out a microcredit loan is one way to set up a business .
microfinance experts in europe , who recently attended a conference on the issue in berlin , say the practice is especially well suited to women .
in europe , women on average usually earn 15 percent less than their male counterparts for the same work and are more often threatened by poverty and unemployment .
banks often not interested tamara underwood of the paris-based european microfinance network told deutsche welle that though there 's no evidence that women are specifically discriminated against when it comes to getting access to bank loans , their customer profile doesn ’ t exactly match the loan requirements of the banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are often at a disadvantage when it comes to applying for bank loans " because women have often been unemployed or been housewives , they do n't have much of their own money , " underwood said .
" that 's why they often ca n't provide the collateral needed by the banks - unless they own a house and can mortgage it . "
retail , hospitality and the service sector are typically dominated by female entrepreneurs .
but since most of them have modest start-up capital and usually work part-time , banks often are n't interested in having them as customers , experts added .
for instance , the state-owned finnish bank finnvera refused for a long time to finance the service sector because it was linked with high start-up costs and risks , underwood said .
the bank , however , did change its policies over the years , with the result that it today counts many women among its customers .
reaffirming female solidarity women also make for loyal and reliable customers , according to experts familiar with microfinance .
" women who get credit often feel like they are a part of the project , " brigitte maas , an executive at goldrausch , a german organization that offers small loans to women wanting to set up their own business .
" the women who come to us also know well that if they do n't pay back , then we ca n't offer them any new credit .
the pay-back rate is really very high . "
raina timtscheva of a microfinance organization in bulgaria echoed the view .
in my experience , " there 's less bad credit with women than there is with men , " timtscheva told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bangladeshi nobel peace prize winner muhammad yunus is a microcredit pioneer experts point out that microfinance also plays an important role in creating a sense of female solidarity and bonding , for instance among african immigrants in france or communities in rural england .
" if one of them -lrb- the women -rrb- has difficulties paying back their loan , then the other women can step in to help , " underwood said .
" thus there 's a kind of social pressure to pay back the loan . "

but preparations went ahead for celebrations into the night . technicians erected a stage in the central place de la concorde , at the spot where the sarkozy camp planned its main events . the strong participation underscored the exceptional interest generated by the left-right battle for the elysee palace . sarkozy arrived at his paris campaign headquarters in the late afternoon , smiling broadly and shaking hands with members of the crowd that gathered outside . platform focussed on jobs the former interior minister earlier cast his ballot in the chic paris suburb of neuilly sur seine , where he was greeted with cheers of " nicolas president .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.05.2007 in europe , microcredit helps women stand on own feet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an increasing number of women in europe are turning to microcredit to finance start-ups in europe , a financial loan of less than 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 34,000 -rrb- is usually offered by microfinance institutions to people without access to commercial bank loans .
women are the main takers . microcredit lending schemes may have originated in the developing world , but they are no stranger to western europe .
for people wanting to set up their own small business but without the means to access loans from commercial banks , taking out a microcredit loan is one way to set up a business .
microfinance experts in europe , who recently attended a conference on the issue in berlin , say the practice is especially well suited to women .
in europe , women on average usually earn 15 percent less than their male counterparts for the same work and are more often threatened by poverty and unemployment .
banks often not interested tamara underwood of the paris-based european microfinance network told deutsche welle that though there 's no evidence that women are specifically discriminated against when it comes to getting access to bank loans , their customer profile doesn ’ t exactly match the loan requirements of the banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are often at a disadvantage when it comes to applying for bank loans " because women have often been unemployed or been housewives , they do n't have much of their own money , " underwood said .
" that 's why they often ca n't provide the collateral needed by the banks - unless they own a house and can mortgage it . "
retail , hospitality and the service sector are typically dominated by female entrepreneurs .
but since most of them have modest start-up capital and usually work part-time , banks often are n't interested in having them as customers , experts added .
for instance , the state-owned finnish bank finnvera refused for a long time to finance the service sector because it was linked with high start-up costs and risks , underwood said .
the bank , however , did change its policies over the years , with the result that it today counts many women among its customers .
reaffirming female solidarity women also make for loyal and reliable customers , according to experts familiar with microfinance .
" women who get credit often feel like they are a part of the project , " brigitte maas , an executive at goldrausch , a german organization that offers small loans to women wanting to set up their own business .
" the women who come to us also know well that if they do n't pay back , then we ca n't offer them any new credit .
the pay-back rate is really very high . "
raina timtscheva of a microfinance organization in bulgaria echoed the view .
in my experience , " there 's less bad credit with women than there is with men , " timtscheva told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bangladeshi nobel peace prize winner muhammad yunus is a microcredit pioneer experts point out that microfinance also plays an important role in creating a sense of female solidarity and bonding , for instance among african immigrants in france or communities in rural england .
" if one of them -lrb- the women -rrb- has difficulties paying back their loan , then the other women can step in to help , " underwood said .
" thus there 's a kind of social pressure to pay back the loan . "
spain leads the way in europe an estimated 39 percent of all microcredit lending schemes in western europe are used by women .
though that figure could be much higher , experts said , there are some countries in europe that fare better than others .
" in spain , almost 60 percent of all microfinance takers are women , " said underwood , who added that spain had taken a very clear stance on the issue .
" in spain , they want to reach women and help them out of their fringe position , " she added .
" the country has taken concrete steps : targeted advertising campaigns and special training programs so that women can achieve their goals . " microfinance : just like marketing jeans ?
in germany , microfinance is still in its infancy .
brigitte maas , who heads the german microfinance institute said the country still had to find out how the system worked best in the country .
maas pointed out that one microfinance institute , kiz from offenbach , near the german city of frankfurt , had found out in a study that microcredit lending schemes needed to be marketed just like washing powder or jeans .
maas said the city was plastered with big posters with pictures of a variety of tough-looking women , even older ones and some with headscarves with the slogan " does an entrepreneur look like this ? "
" and suddenly there were so many women with immigrant backgrounds who you had n't seen before flooding to the microfinance institute , " she added . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 to offer micro-credit help , step up aids funding for africa development ministers from the g8 undertook in berlin on tuesday to set up micro-credit facilities for african nations with the help of the world bank and increase funds for the fight against aids .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.05.2007 in europe , microcredit helps women stand on own feet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an increasing number of women in europe are turning to microcredit to finance start-ups in europe , a financial loan of less than 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 34,000 -rrb- is usually offered by microfinance institutions to people without access to commercial bank loans .
women are the main takers . microcredit lending schemes may have originated in the developing world , but they are no stranger to western europe .
for people wanting to set up their own small business but without the means to access loans from commercial banks , taking out a microcredit loan is one way to set up a business .
microfinance experts in europe , who recently attended a conference on the issue in berlin , say the practice is especially well suited to women .
in europe , women on average usually earn 15 percent less than their male counterparts for the same work and are more often threatened by poverty and unemployment .
banks often not interested tamara underwood of the paris-based european microfinance network told deutsche welle that though there 's no evidence that women are specifically discriminated against when it comes to getting access to bank loans , their customer profile doesn ’ t exactly match the loan requirements of the banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are often at a disadvantage when it comes to applying for bank loans " because women have often been unemployed or been housewives , they do n't have much of their own money , " underwood said .
" that 's why they often ca n't provide the collateral needed by the banks - unless they own a house and can mortgage it . "
retail , hospitality and the service sector are typically dominated by female entrepreneurs .
but since most of them have modest start-up capital and usually work part-time , banks often are n't interested in having them as customers , experts added .
for instance , the state-owned finnish bank finnvera refused for a long time to finance the service sector because it was linked with high start-up costs and risks , underwood said .
the bank , however , did change its policies over the years , with the result that it today counts many women among its customers .
reaffirming female solidarity women also make for loyal and reliable customers , according to experts familiar with microfinance .
" women who get credit often feel like they are a part of the project , " brigitte maas , an executive at goldrausch , a german organization that offers small loans to women wanting to set up their own business .
" the women who come to us also know well that if they do n't pay back , then we ca n't offer them any new credit .
the pay-back rate is really very high . "
raina timtscheva of a microfinance organization in bulgaria echoed the view .
in my experience , " there 's less bad credit with women than there is with men , " timtscheva told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bangladeshi nobel peace prize winner muhammad yunus is a microcredit pioneer experts point out that microfinance also plays an important role in creating a sense of female solidarity and bonding , for instance among african immigrants in france or communities in rural england .
" if one of them -lrb- the women -rrb- has difficulties paying back their loan , then the other women can step in to help , " underwood said .
" thus there 's a kind of social pressure to pay back the loan . "
spain leads the way in europe an estimated 39 percent of all microcredit lending schemes in western europe are used by women .
though that figure could be much higher , experts said , there are some countries in europe that fare better than others .
" in spain , almost 60 percent of all microfinance takers are women , " said underwood , who added that spain had taken a very clear stance on the issue .
" in spain , they want to reach women and help them out of their fringe position , " she added .
" the country has taken concrete steps : targeted advertising campaigns and special training programs so that women can achieve their goals . " microfinance : just like marketing jeans ?
in germany , microfinance is still in its infancy .
brigitte maas , who heads the german microfinance institute said the country still had to find out how the system worked best in the country .
maas pointed out that one microfinance institute , kiz from offenbach , near the german city of frankfurt , had found out in a study that microcredit lending schemes needed to be marketed just like washing powder or jeans .
maas said the city was plastered with big posters with pictures of a variety of tough-looking women , even older ones and some with headscarves with the slogan " does an entrepreneur look like this ? "
" and suddenly there were so many women with immigrant backgrounds who you had n't seen before flooding to the microfinance institute , " she added . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 to offer micro-credit help , step up aids funding for africa development ministers from the g8 undertook in berlin on tuesday to set up micro-credit facilities for african nations with the help of the world bank and increase funds for the fight against aids .

" people say that if he wins there will be more violence so naturally it makes you think , " she said . large voter turn-out expected early polling was also brisk at a station on ile saint-louis , in the heart of paris . francois , who declined to give his last name , said he was voting for sarkozy because he felt that " instinctively " he was better suited for the post . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : socialist candidate royal is hoping for this much more support royal battled throughout the campaign to dispel doubts about her presidential stature , while sarkozy faced voter concerns that his hyper-active personality was a liability . the election marks a shift to a younger generation of leaders born after world war ii , who are promising to tackle the huge national debt , high unemployment and simmering tensions in the suburbs . fight for the center a first round of voting was held on april 22 marked by a near-record turnout of 84 percent .

women are the main takers . microcredit lending schemes may have originated in the developing world , but they are no stranger to western europe .
for people wanting to set up their own small business but without the means to access loans from commercial banks , taking out a microcredit loan is one way to set up a business .
microfinance experts in europe , who recently attended a conference on the issue in berlin , say the practice is especially well suited to women .
in europe , women on average usually earn 15 percent less than their male counterparts for the same work and are more often threatened by poverty and unemployment .
banks often not interested tamara underwood of the paris-based european microfinance network told deutsche welle that though there 's no evidence that women are specifically discriminated against when it comes to getting access to bank loans , their customer profile doesn ’ t exactly match the loan requirements of the banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are often at a disadvantage when it comes to applying for bank loans " because women have often been unemployed or been housewives , they do n't have much of their own money , " underwood said .
" that 's why they often ca n't provide the collateral needed by the banks - unless they own a house and can mortgage it . "
retail , hospitality and the service sector are typically dominated by female entrepreneurs .
but since most of them have modest start-up capital and usually work part-time , banks often are n't interested in having them as customers , experts added .
for instance , the state-owned finnish bank finnvera refused for a long time to finance the service sector because it was linked with high start-up costs and risks , underwood said .
the bank , however , did change its policies over the years , with the result that it today counts many women among its customers .
reaffirming female solidarity women also make for loyal and reliable customers , according to experts familiar with microfinance .
" women who get credit often feel like they are a part of the project , " brigitte maas , an executive at goldrausch , a german organization that offers small loans to women wanting to set up their own business .
" the women who come to us also know well that if they do n't pay back , then we ca n't offer them any new credit .
the pay-back rate is really very high . "
raina timtscheva of a microfinance organization in bulgaria echoed the view .

spain leads the way in europe an estimated 39 percent of all microcredit lending schemes in western europe are used by women .
though that figure could be much higher , experts said , there are some countries in europe that fare better than others .
" in spain , almost 60 percent of all microfinance takers are women , " said underwood , who added that spain had taken a very clear stance on the issue .
" in spain , they want to reach women and help them out of their fringe position , " she added .
" the country has taken concrete steps : targeted advertising campaigns and special training programs so that women can achieve their goals . " microfinance : just like marketing jeans ?
in germany , microfinance is still in its infancy .
brigitte maas , who heads the german microfinance institute said the country still had to find out how the system worked best in the country .
maas pointed out that one microfinance institute , kiz from offenbach , near the german city of frankfurt , had found out in a study that microcredit lending schemes needed to be marketed just like washing powder or jeans .
maas said the city was plastered with big posters with pictures of a variety of tough-looking women , even older ones and some with headscarves with the slogan " does an entrepreneur look like this ? "

right-wing candidate nicolas sarkozy handily won the french presidential election with 53 percent of the vote ; some 85 percent of those eligible came to the polls . shouts of joy and cries of " nicolas - president !

women are the main takers . microcredit lending schemes may have originated in the developing world , but they are no stranger to western europe .
for people wanting to set up their own small business but without the means to access loans from commercial banks , taking out a microcredit loan is one way to set up a business .
microfinance experts in europe , who recently attended a conference on the issue in berlin , say the practice is especially well suited to women .
in europe , women on average usually earn 15 percent less than their male counterparts for the same work and are more often threatened by poverty and unemployment .
banks often not interested tamara underwood of the paris-based european microfinance network told deutsche welle that though there 's no evidence that women are specifically discriminated against when it comes to getting access to bank loans , their customer profile doesn ’ t exactly match the loan requirements of the banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are often at a disadvantage when it comes to applying for bank loans " because women have often been unemployed or been housewives , they do n't have much of their own money , " underwood said .
" that 's why they often ca n't provide the collateral needed by the banks - unless they own a house and can mortgage it . "
retail , hospitality and the service sector are typically dominated by female entrepreneurs .
but since most of them have modest start-up capital and usually work part-time , banks often are n't interested in having them as customers , experts added .
for instance , the state-owned finnish bank finnvera refused for a long time to finance the service sector because it was linked with high start-up costs and risks , underwood said .
the bank , however , did change its policies over the years , with the result that it today counts many women among its customers .
reaffirming female solidarity women also make for loyal and reliable customers , according to experts familiar with microfinance .
" women who get credit often feel like they are a part of the project , " brigitte maas , an executive at goldrausch , a german organization that offers small loans to women wanting to set up their own business .
" the women who come to us also know well that if they do n't pay back , then we ca n't offer them any new credit .
the pay-back rate is really very high . "
raina timtscheva of a microfinance organization in bulgaria echoed the view .
in my experience , " there 's less bad credit with women than there is with men , " timtscheva told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bangladeshi nobel peace prize winner muhammad yunus is a microcredit pioneer experts point out that microfinance also plays an important role in creating a sense of female solidarity and bonding , for instance among african immigrants in france or communities in rural england .
" if one of them -lrb- the women -rrb- has difficulties paying back their loan , then the other women can step in to help , " underwood said .
" thus there 's a kind of social pressure to pay back the loan . "
spain leads the way in europe an estimated 39 percent of all microcredit lending schemes in western europe are used by women .
though that figure could be much higher , experts said , there are some countries in europe that fare better than others .
" in spain , almost 60 percent of all microfinance takers are women , " said underwood , who added that spain had taken a very clear stance on the issue .
" in spain , they want to reach women and help them out of their fringe position , " she added .
" the country has taken concrete steps : targeted advertising campaigns and special training programs so that women can achieve their goals . " microfinance : just like marketing jeans ?
in germany , microfinance is still in its infancy .
brigitte maas , who heads the german microfinance institute said the country still had to find out how the system worked best in the country .
maas pointed out that one microfinance institute , kiz from offenbach , near the german city of frankfurt , had found out in a study that microcredit lending schemes needed to be marketed just like washing powder or jeans .
maas said the city was plastered with big posters with pictures of a variety of tough-looking women , even older ones and some with headscarves with the slogan " does an entrepreneur look like this ? "
" and suddenly there were so many women with immigrant backgrounds who you had n't seen before flooding to the microfinance institute , " she added . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de g8 to offer micro-credit help , step up aids funding for africa development ministers from the g8 undertook in berlin on tuesday to set up micro-credit facilities for african nations with the help of the world bank and increase funds for the fight against aids .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 06.05.2007 in europe , microcredit helps women stand on own feet großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : an increasing number of women in europe are turning to microcredit to finance start-ups in europe , a financial loan of less than 25,000 euros -lrb- $ 34,000 -rrb- is usually offered by microfinance institutions to people without access to commercial bank loans .
women are the main takers . microcredit lending schemes may have originated in the developing world , but they are no stranger to western europe .
for people wanting to set up their own small business but without the means to access loans from commercial banks , taking out a microcredit loan is one way to set up a business .
microfinance experts in europe , who recently attended a conference on the issue in berlin , say the practice is especially well suited to women .
in europe , women on average usually earn 15 percent less than their male counterparts for the same work and are more often threatened by poverty and unemployment .
banks often not interested tamara underwood of the paris-based european microfinance network told deutsche welle that though there 's no evidence that women are specifically discriminated against when it comes to getting access to bank loans , their customer profile doesn ’ t exactly match the loan requirements of the banks .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : women are often at a disadvantage when it comes to applying for bank loans " because women have often been unemployed or been housewives , they do n't have much of their own money , " underwood said .
" that 's why they often ca n't provide the collateral needed by the banks - unless they own a house and can mortgage it . "
retail , hospitality and the service sector are typically dominated by female entrepreneurs .
but since most of them have modest start-up capital and usually work part-time , banks often are n't interested in having them as customers , experts added .
for instance , the state-owned finnish bank finnvera refused for a long time to finance the service sector because it was linked with high start-up costs and risks , underwood said .
the bank , however , did change its policies over the years , with the result that it today counts many women among its customers .
reaffirming female solidarity women also make for loyal and reliable customers , according to experts familiar with microfinance .
" women who get credit often feel like they are a part of the project , " brigitte maas , an executive at goldrausch , a german organization that offers small loans to women wanting to set up their own business .
" the women who come to us also know well that if they do n't pay back , then we ca n't offer them any new credit .
the pay-back rate is really very high . "
raina timtscheva of a microfinance organization in bulgaria echoed the view .
in my experience , " there 's less bad credit with women than there is with men , " timtscheva told deutsche welle . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bangladeshi nobel peace prize winner muhammad yunus is a microcredit pioneer experts point out that microfinance also plays an important role in creating a sense of female solidarity and bonding , for instance among african immigrants in france or communities in rural england .
" if one of them -lrb- the women -rrb- has difficulties paying back their loan , then the other women can step in to help , " underwood said .
" thus there 's a kind of social pressure to pay back the loan . "
spain leads the way in europe an estimated 39 percent of all microcredit lending schemes in western europe are used by women .
though that figure could be much higher , experts said , there are some countries in europe that fare better than others .
" in spain , almost 60 percent of all microfinance takers are women , " said underwood , who added that spain had taken a very clear stance on the issue .
" in spain , they want to reach women and help them out of their fringe position , " she added .
" the country has taken concrete steps : targeted advertising campaigns and special training programs so that women can achieve their goals . " microfinance : just like marketing jeans ?
in germany , microfinance is still in its infancy .
brigitte maas , who heads the german microfinance institute said the country still had to find out how the system worked best in the country .
maas pointed out that one microfinance institute , kiz from offenbach , near the german city of frankfurt , had found out in a study that microcredit lending schemes needed to be marketed just like washing powder or jeans .
maas said the city was plastered with big posters with pictures of a variety of tough-looking women , even older ones and some with headscarves with the slogan " does an entrepreneur look like this ? "
" and suddenly there were so many women with immigrant backgrounds who you had n't seen before flooding to the microfinance institute , " she added . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : g8 to offer micro-credit help , step up aids funding for africa development ministers from the g8 undertook in berlin on tuesday to set up micro-credit facilities for african nations with the help of the world bank and increase funds for the fight against aids .

viewed by many as the best player to have come from wales , the former leeds and juventus star died three years ago .
the bust on a granite plinth with a plate detailing his career will stand as a permanent tribute at the ground .
family and friends of the man known as the gentle giant were at the ceremony , along with invited guests .
it took place before the swans ' final league one game against blackpool , although the home club were disappointed to see their promotion play-off hopes disappear in a 6-3 defeat .
charles signed for swansea at the age of 15 , but moved to leeds united in 1949 .

charity worker marilyn willis was sorting through contributions at bangor 's oxfam shop when she found the copy of le ballet by boris kochno .
the book will now be sold in the charity 's valued in wales auction in cardiff in july .
mrs willis said : " it was a very special book - you could not miss it . "
the copy of le ballet , which was compiled in the 1950s , is covered in red cloth and is still kept in the original acetate and cardboard cover .
the picasso lithograph depicts a dancer and the book also features photographs of nijinsky and set designs by parisian artist toulouse-lautrec .
what is a lithograph ?
it can be used to print text or artwork onto paper it works because of the repulsion of oil and water modern high-volume lithography is used to produce posters , books and credit cards in the 1890s colour lithography became popular with french artists including toulouse-lautrec mrs willis said it was obvious the book , which came from a mystery donor , was out of the ordinary because it stood out so much from the works she usually sifts through .
