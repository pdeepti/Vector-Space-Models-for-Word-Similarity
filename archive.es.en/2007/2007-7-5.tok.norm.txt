according to the environmental organization , this was an obvious attempt to avoid conflict at germany 's third annual energy summit in berlin . contrary to initial reports , the fire had in fact led to problems at the plant 's nuclear reactor , the schleswig-holstein state social affairs ministry , which is responsible for the region 's power plants , said in a statement released thursday . last week , local police had stated that the fire , which started when coolant in a large electric power transformer substation ignited due to a short circuit , had been isolated from the atomic reactor . however experts investigating the incident found " several unusual things when the reactor was shut down " including evidence of damage related to the fire .
but they said there was no radiation leak . politicians from germany 's opposition green party as well as some from the ruling christian democratic party have said they want energy company vattenfall to explain why it remained silent for almost a week on the consequences of the incident .
some say vattenfall 's stance is undermining the credibility of the nuclear power industry in germany . vattenfall defends itself bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters dousing the blase at the nuclear plant last week in germany european energy group vattenfall however defended itself , saying it had acted quickly . a company spokesman dismissed the criticism , saying it had provided quick and comprehensive information on the accident to the authorities . " we informed the public immediately , " said ceo bruno thomauske in hamburg wednesday .
" at no point was the public at risk . " " this was nothing to do with the summit , " said oliver breuer from schleswig-holstein 's state social affairs ministry in an interview with spiegel online .
" we have no intention of covering anything up . " nuclear phase-out still an incendiary issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is reluctant to increase its dependancy on russian energy germany has begun a long-term phase-out of its 17 nuclear energy reactors and expects to mothball its last plant around 2020 . the plan was approved by the previous social democrat and green government , but chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives argue that abandoning nuclear energy would seriously undermine the country 's chances of slashing greenhouse gas emissions , as well as increase reliance on russian fossil fuel and make it harder to keep in check energy prices . the european union has set a goal of a 20-percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared with 1990 levels , but germany is aiming for a cut of up to 40 percent . merkel has come under increasing pressure from brussels to renegotiate the phase-out deal . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" sports not violence " is a project based in lower saxony that aims to turn around soccer 's rough-and-ready reputation . with what should be a beautiful game overshadowed in europe by the brutish specter of hooliganism , the organization wants to return good sportsmanship to the pitch .
its latest attempt , however , failed miserably . in an admirably optimistic spirit , it recently teamed up with the police department in the city of aachen to schedule a goodwill game that was supposed to demonstrate to local kids that despite its tarnished image , playing soccer " is a meaningful way of spending their spare time , " as one policeman poignantly put it . but boys will be boys - and the organizers obviously overestimated the power of good intentions .
the fun soon turned into fisticuffs , with the match fast deteriorating into a punch-up when five players set upon a heckler who protested against a perceived lack of fair play . other players and fans soon waded in to the fray , while the original perpetrators fled the melee leaving mayhem in their wake . an experiment in peace turned into an orgy of violence .

germany 's leading muslim associations say the government 's new immigration law smacks of hypocrisy , and that berlin has failed to come good on promises made at last year 's integration summit . hailed by the head of germany 's turkish community , kenan kolat , as an " historic day " which ushered in a " new era of immigration policy , " the first ever integration summit held in chancellor angela merkel 's office last summer was broadly seen as a resounding success . but one year on , the euphoria has faded .
the fly in the ointment is the german parliament 's newly approved immigration law , which has angered muslim groups to such an extent that many feel the upcoming second integration summit on july 12 is nothing but a farce . betrayed this time round , kenan kolat still has n't decided whether he 'll even attend . together with yasar bilgin , who heads up the council of turkish citizens in german , he feels betrayed by berlin 's latest amendments to the immigration law passed in 2005 . " we are considering whether we will voice our protest at the new changes to the law at the summit or whether we will refuse to appear , " he told spiegel online , stressing that he sees the new law as hostile to turks and unconstitutional . " the government makes out to us that everything is hunky dory , " he said .

it 's hypocrisy . " united in anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year 's summit was upbeat anger has united many of the turkish community 's otherwise divided representative groups .

" this is political duplicity and there is no point taking part in the summit . " " we are not interested in playing bit parts at this meeting and thereby legitimating the law , " he added . he said that his organization would not be attending unless the immigration law is rejected by the german council at the imminent vote . the brunt of alboga 's criticism is directed at the new clause on spousal immigration , which states that a foreigner who wants to bring his wife to germany must be able to prove that she can earn her own living .
were a german national to bring a foreign wife to the country , this would not apply . " at last year 's summit , the government reiterated the importance of talking to us , not about us , " he said .

" it is in the interests of germany 's 2.5 million turks to be represented by these organizations at the summit , " she said . a spokesman at the interior ministry stressed it would be counter-productive for germany 's minorities to express their dissatisfaction with berlin by sitting out the debate . " integration must be based on active participation , not lack of it , " he said . the government estimates that 15 million people living in germany , which has a total population of 82 million , have an immigrant background of some kind - either with roots outside the country or as ethnic germans from the former soviet union . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" integration must be based on active participation , not lack of it , " he said . the government estimates that 15 million people living in germany , which has a total population of 82 million , have an immigrant background of some kind - either with roots outside the country or as ethnic germans from the former soviet union . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last year , the number of people who entered into self-employment by setting up a new business , taking over an existing enterprise or an equity stake dropped by 200,000 to 1.1 million persons . this is the lowest number of business start-ups recorded in germany since kfw began its " start-up monitor " in the year 2000 .

according to kfw , it is the most comprehensive source of information on this sector in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthäus-maier hopes for a turnaround in 2007 ingrid matthäus-maier , spokeswoman of the kfw management board , said the latest figures should be food for thought .

for one , they create jobs .
secondly , they had a positive impact on the country 's economy and , therefore , increase germany 's international competitiveness . " heinz klandt , a professor at the prestigious european business school in oestrich-winkel , said it was important for companies to be founded particularly in those sectors with a future . " this will really have a strong impact on the economy and create jobs in growth-oriented sectors , " said klandt , who holds the first chair for entrepreneurship to have been set up in germany in 1998 . according to klandt , more needs to be done to stimulate these sectors .

" the money being sunk into subsidizing coal , for example , is missing in areas such as biotech , nanotechnology or other sectors with a future . " a matter of attitude but german attitudes towards self-employment also play a decisive role .
in comparison to other highly developed economies , such as the united states , there is a pessimistic start-up climate in germany . " our analyses on the influence of personal attitudes show that a positive approach to entrepreneurship , the willingness to take risk and optimism are major prerequisites for successfully starting into self-employment , " matthäus-maier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entrepreneurial spirit can already be learned at an early age but this necessary ideology is missing in germany , said klandt .

entrepreneurship did not have the same status in the german education system as it did in other countries , he said . " in finland , for example , the ideas behind entrepreneurship such as creativity or independence are already taught in kindergarten , " klandt said .
" in our education system , these things are pushed back . " germans were also often much more focused on security than risk in their thinking . " we 'd rather buy life insurance policies than stocks , " klandt said .
this was due to the strong safety net which existed in germany . matthäus-maier said a broad package of measures was required to improve the start-up climate in germany .
these needed to be " firmly anchored in the education and training system , " she said .
but society 's attitudes also needed to change , she added . " if we want to have more lively and sustainable start-up activity , we have to improve the subjective attitudes towards entrepreneurship , " matthäus-maier said . hope for 2007 germany 's current economic upswing has also contributed to the dip in self-employment .

" there is hope that a turnaround will take place in the course of the year , " she said , since the number of planned business start-ups was " extraordinarily high . "
as a result of the current stable upswing , many more people were expected to venture into self-employment in 2007 , she said .

" we will not solve all the doping problems in sport with this law but we do make a clear statement that we will not surrender , " said federal minister of the interior wolfgang schäuble . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble said the law made a clear statement " we have targeted these substances because their use has made doping highly criminalized , " he added .
" with the new laws , the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- can intervene and surveillance operations can be used to fight these criminal structures . "
the law will go before the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , on september 21 and could then come into force in october .
the government had come under fire recently for failing to act strongly enough in the battle against doping in sport , with federal sports committee chairperson peter danckert accusing the coalition of lacking the stomach for the fight .
after thursday 's announcement , however , danckert conceded : " we are satisfied that the government has shown support for sport with the law . "
the german olympic sports union -lrb- dosb -rrb- chief michael vesper was also pleased with the decision .
" i am glad that this proposal has found such wide approval . " criminal networks to be targeted by law vesper cautioned that the new legal framework must now prove itself but added : " i am optimistic .
the jörg jaksche case shows that there are networks in sport which allow doping but these structures are now going to be vulnerable to the authorities and courts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaksche , center , revealed a permissive culture in sport german rider jaksche became the first rider to admit using blood doping prepared by a spanish doctor in the " operation puerto " scandal .
jaksche told germany 's spiegel magazine in june that he had used performance-enhancing drugs since 1997 , while riding for a number of teams .
he told spiegel that doping was either actively conducted by team leaders or at least tolerated .
the government also pledged to increase its financial support by increasing the budget for organized sport in germany to 125.8 million euros -lrb- $ 171.5m -rrb- by 2008 , a huge rise from the current level of 17.3 million .
included in this new budget is an increase in funding for the national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- from 1.1 to 3.9 million euros . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" sports not violence " is a project based in lower saxony that aims to turn around soccer 's rough-and-ready reputation . with what should be a beautiful game overshadowed in europe by the brutish specter of hooliganism , the organization wants to return good sportsmanship to the pitch .
its latest attempt , however , failed miserably . in an admirably optimistic spirit , it recently teamed up with the police department in the city of aachen to schedule a goodwill game that was supposed to demonstrate to local kids that despite its tarnished image , playing soccer " is a meaningful way of spending their spare time , " as one policeman poignantly put it . but boys will be boys - and the organizers obviously overestimated the power of good intentions .
the fun soon turned into fisticuffs , with the match fast deteriorating into a punch-up when five players set upon a heckler who protested against a perceived lack of fair play . other players and fans soon waded in to the fray , while the original perpetrators fled the melee leaving mayhem in their wake . an experiment in peace turned into an orgy of violence .

last year , the number of people who entered into self-employment by setting up a new business , taking over an existing enterprise or an equity stake dropped by 200,000 to 1.1 million persons . this is the lowest number of business start-ups recorded in germany since kfw began its " start-up monitor " in the year 2000 .
every year , kfw surveys 40,000 randomly selected german residents .
according to kfw , it is the most comprehensive source of information on this sector in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthäus-maier hopes for a turnaround in 2007 ingrid matthäus-maier , spokeswoman of the kfw management board , said the latest figures should be food for thought .

for one , they create jobs .
secondly , they had a positive impact on the country 's economy and , therefore , increase germany 's international competitiveness . " heinz klandt , a professor at the prestigious european business school in oestrich-winkel , said it was important for companies to be founded particularly in those sectors with a future . " this will really have a strong impact on the economy and create jobs in growth-oriented sectors , " said klandt , who holds the first chair for entrepreneurship to have been set up in germany in 1998 . according to klandt , more needs to be done to stimulate these sectors . " there need to be more structural changes to develop new sectors , " klandt said .
" the money being sunk into subsidizing coal , for example , is missing in areas such as biotech , nanotechnology or other sectors with a future . " a matter of attitude but german attitudes towards self-employment also play a decisive role .
in comparison to other highly developed economies , such as the united states , there is a pessimistic start-up climate in germany .

entrepreneurship did not have the same status in the german education system as it did in other countries , he said . " in finland , for example , the ideas behind entrepreneurship such as creativity or independence are already taught in kindergarten , " klandt said .
" in our education system , these things are pushed back . " germans were also often much more focused on security than risk in their thinking . " we 'd rather buy life insurance policies than stocks , " klandt said .
this was due to the strong safety net which existed in germany . matthäus-maier said a broad package of measures was required to improve the start-up climate in germany .
these needed to be " firmly anchored in the education and training system , " she said .
but society 's attitudes also needed to change , she added . " if we want to have more lively and sustainable start-up activity , we have to improve the subjective attitudes towards entrepreneurship , " matthäus-maier said . hope for 2007 germany 's current economic upswing has also contributed to the dip in self-employment .

" the money being sunk into subsidizing coal , for example , is missing in areas such as biotech , nanotechnology or other sectors with a future . " a matter of attitude but german attitudes towards self-employment also play a decisive role .
in comparison to other highly developed economies , such as the united states , there is a pessimistic start-up climate in germany . " our analyses on the influence of personal attitudes show that a positive approach to entrepreneurship , the willingness to take risk and optimism are major prerequisites for successfully starting into self-employment , " matthäus-maier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entrepreneurial spirit can already be learned at an early age but this necessary ideology is missing in germany , said klandt . " there is n't this pioneering spirit here , " he said .
" we do n't have the american dream . "
entrepreneurship did not have the same status in the german education system as it did in other countries , he said . " in finland , for example , the ideas behind entrepreneurship such as creativity or independence are already taught in kindergarten , " klandt said .
" in our education system , these things are pushed back . " germans were also often much more focused on security than risk in their thinking . " we 'd rather buy life insurance policies than stocks , " klandt said .
this was due to the strong safety net which existed in germany . matthäus-maier said a broad package of measures was required to improve the start-up climate in germany .
these needed to be " firmly anchored in the education and training system , " she said .
but society 's attitudes also needed to change , she added . " if we want to have more lively and sustainable start-up activity , we have to improve the subjective attitudes towards entrepreneurship , " matthäus-maier said . hope for 2007 germany 's current economic upswing has also contributed to the dip in self-employment .
many people previously had no other option than to start their own company , since they often had difficulty finding a job . " but during an economic upswing , there are a lot of attractive jobs out there again , " klandt said . but times could change , according to matthäus-maier .
" there is hope that a turnaround will take place in the course of the year , " she said , since the number of planned business start-ups was " extraordinarily high . "
as a result of the current stable upswing , many more people were expected to venture into self-employment in 2007 , she said . " this is urgently required because without strong start-up intensity , and the related creation of jobs and innovation , germany 's economic efficiency might be hurt , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

separately , another nuclear power plant in schleswig-holstein , brunsbüttel , was temporarily shut down last thursday about two hours before the krümmel fire because its capacity was overloaded . the incident triggered a fresh national debate about the safety of nuclear energy just days before an annual energy summit in berlin focused on exploring ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb global warming . environmental organization bund demanded the immediate closure of both plants . irregularities discovered greenpeace also accused vattenfall and the local government in kiel of withholding important information on the consequences of the incident .
according to the environmental organization , this was an obvious attempt to avoid conflict at germany 's third annual energy summit in berlin . contrary to initial reports , the fire had in fact led to problems at the plant 's nuclear reactor , the schleswig-holstein state social affairs ministry , which is responsible for the region 's power plants , said in a statement released thursday . last week , local police had stated that the fire , which started when coolant in a large electric power transformer substation ignited due to a short circuit , had been isolated from the atomic reactor . however experts investigating the incident found " several unusual things when the reactor was shut down " including evidence of damage related to the fire .
but they said there was no radiation leak . politicians from germany 's opposition green party as well as some from the ruling christian democratic party have said they want energy company vattenfall to explain why it remained silent for almost a week on the consequences of the incident .
some say vattenfall 's stance is undermining the credibility of the nuclear power industry in germany . vattenfall defends itself bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters dousing the blase at the nuclear plant last week in germany european energy group vattenfall however defended itself , saying it had acted quickly . a company spokesman dismissed the criticism , saying it had provided quick and comprehensive information on the accident to the authorities . " we informed the public immediately , " said ceo bruno thomauske in hamburg wednesday .
" at no point was the public at risk . " " this was nothing to do with the summit , " said oliver breuer from schleswig-holstein 's state social affairs ministry in an interview with spiegel online .
" we have no intention of covering anything up . " nuclear phase-out still an incendiary issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is reluctant to increase its dependancy on russian energy germany has begun a long-term phase-out of its 17 nuclear energy reactors and expects to mothball its last plant around 2020 . the plan was approved by the previous social democrat and green government , but chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives argue that abandoning nuclear energy would seriously undermine the country 's chances of slashing greenhouse gas emissions , as well as increase reliance on russian fossil fuel and make it harder to keep in check energy prices . the european union has set a goal of a 20-percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared with 1990 levels , but germany is aiming for a cut of up to 40 percent . merkel has come under increasing pressure from brussels to renegotiate the phase-out deal . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we will not solve all the doping problems in sport with this law but we do make a clear statement that we will not surrender , " said federal minister of the interior wolfgang schäuble . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble said the law made a clear statement " we have targeted these substances because their use has made doping highly criminalized , " he added .
" with the new laws , the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- can intervene and surveillance operations can be used to fight these criminal structures . "
the law will go before the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , on september 21 and could then come into force in october .
the government had come under fire recently for failing to act strongly enough in the battle against doping in sport , with federal sports committee chairperson peter danckert accusing the coalition of lacking the stomach for the fight .
after thursday 's announcement , however , danckert conceded : " we are satisfied that the government has shown support for sport with the law . "
the german olympic sports union -lrb- dosb -rrb- chief michael vesper was also pleased with the decision .
" i am glad that this proposal has found such wide approval . " criminal networks to be targeted by law vesper cautioned that the new legal framework must now prove itself but added : " i am optimistic .
the jörg jaksche case shows that there are networks in sport which allow doping but these structures are now going to be vulnerable to the authorities and courts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaksche , center , revealed a permissive culture in sport german rider jaksche became the first rider to admit using blood doping prepared by a spanish doctor in the " operation puerto " scandal .
jaksche told germany 's spiegel magazine in june that he had used performance-enhancing drugs since 1997 , while riding for a number of teams .
he told spiegel that doping was either actively conducted by team leaders or at least tolerated .
the government also pledged to increase its financial support by increasing the budget for organized sport in germany to 125.8 million euros -lrb- $ 171.5m -rrb- by 2008 , a huge rise from the current level of 17.3 million .
included in this new budget is an increase in funding for the national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- from 1.1 to 3.9 million euros . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's leading muslim associations say the government 's new immigration law smacks of hypocrisy , and that berlin has failed to come good on promises made at last year 's integration summit . hailed by the head of germany 's turkish community , kenan kolat , as an " historic day " which ushered in a " new era of immigration policy , " the first ever integration summit held in chancellor angela merkel 's office last summer was broadly seen as a resounding success . but one year on , the euphoria has faded .
the fly in the ointment is the german parliament 's newly approved immigration law , which has angered muslim groups to such an extent that many feel the upcoming second integration summit on july 12 is nothing but a farce . betrayed this time round , kenan kolat still has n't decided whether he 'll even attend . together with yasar bilgin , who heads up the council of turkish citizens in german , he feels betrayed by berlin 's latest amendments to the immigration law passed in 2005 . " we are considering whether we will voice our protest at the new changes to the law at the summit or whether we will refuse to appear , " he told spiegel online , stressing that he sees the new law as hostile to turks and unconstitutional . " the government makes out to us that everything is hunky dory , " he said .
" they tell us that we 're making progress on the integration front and then they make a decision completely over our heads .
it 's hypocrisy . " united in anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year 's summit was upbeat anger has united many of the turkish community 's otherwise divided representative groups .
across the board , there is agreement that the government has left them out in the cold . " i am deeply disappointed , " said bekir alboga from the turkish directorate for religious affairs -lrb- ditib -rrb- in an interview with spiegel online .
" this is political duplicity and there is no point taking part in the summit . " " we are not interested in playing bit parts at this meeting and thereby legitimating the law , " he added . he said that his organization would not be attending unless the immigration law is rejected by the german council at the imminent vote . the brunt of alboga 's criticism is directed at the new clause on spousal immigration , which states that a foreigner who wants to bring his wife to germany must be able to prove that she can earn her own living .
were a german national to bring a foreign wife to the country , this would not apply . " at last year 's summit , the government reiterated the importance of talking to us , not about us , " he said .
" but we were never told about the tightening of residency regulations .
we were excluded from these discussions . " taking part , not sitting out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria böhmer the upcoming summit will be led by maria böhmer of the cdu , who is in charge of immigration issues in the government .
she feels that organizations such as those fronted by kolat and alboga have devoted years to securing participation in the integration debate , and that they will undo all the good work by refusing to sit at a table with the chancellor . " it is in the interests of germany 's 2.5 million turks to be represented by these organizations at the summit , " she said . a spokesman at the interior ministry stressed it would be counter-productive for germany 's minorities to express their dissatisfaction with berlin by sitting out the debate . " integration must be based on active participation , not lack of it , " he said . the government estimates that 15 million people living in germany , which has a total population of 82 million , have an immigrant background of some kind - either with roots outside the country or as ethnic germans from the former soviet union . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the fun soon turned into fisticuffs , with the match fast deteriorating into a punch-up when five players set upon a heckler who protested against a perceived lack of fair play . other players and fans soon waded in to the fray , while the original perpetrators fled the melee leaving mayhem in their wake . an experiment in peace turned into an orgy of violence .
perhaps the next time the project tries to stage of sporting match for peace , the game should be croquet .

germany 's leading muslim associations say the government 's new immigration law smacks of hypocrisy , and that berlin has failed to come good on promises made at last year 's integration summit . hailed by the head of germany 's turkish community , kenan kolat , as an " historic day " which ushered in a " new era of immigration policy , " the first ever integration summit held in chancellor angela merkel 's office last summer was broadly seen as a resounding success . but one year on , the euphoria has faded .
the fly in the ointment is the german parliament 's newly approved immigration law , which has angered muslim groups to such an extent that many feel the upcoming second integration summit on july 12 is nothing but a farce . betrayed this time round , kenan kolat still has n't decided whether he 'll even attend . together with yasar bilgin , who heads up the council of turkish citizens in german , he feels betrayed by berlin 's latest amendments to the immigration law passed in 2005 . " we are considering whether we will voice our protest at the new changes to the law at the summit or whether we will refuse to appear , " he told spiegel online , stressing that he sees the new law as hostile to turks and unconstitutional . " the government makes out to us that everything is hunky dory , " he said .
" they tell us that we 're making progress on the integration front and then they make a decision completely over our heads .
it 's hypocrisy . " united in anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year 's summit was upbeat anger has united many of the turkish community 's otherwise divided representative groups .
across the board , there is agreement that the government has left them out in the cold . " i am deeply disappointed , " said bekir alboga from the turkish directorate for religious affairs -lrb- ditib -rrb- in an interview with spiegel online .
" this is political duplicity and there is no point taking part in the summit . " " we are not interested in playing bit parts at this meeting and thereby legitimating the law , " he added . he said that his organization would not be attending unless the immigration law is rejected by the german council at the imminent vote . the brunt of alboga 's criticism is directed at the new clause on spousal immigration , which states that a foreigner who wants to bring his wife to germany must be able to prove that she can earn her own living .
were a german national to bring a foreign wife to the country , this would not apply . " at last year 's summit , the government reiterated the importance of talking to us , not about us , " he said .
" but we were never told about the tightening of residency regulations .
we were excluded from these discussions . " taking part , not sitting out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria böhmer the upcoming summit will be led by maria böhmer of the cdu , who is in charge of immigration issues in the government .
she feels that organizations such as those fronted by kolat and alboga have devoted years to securing participation in the integration debate , and that they will undo all the good work by refusing to sit at a table with the chancellor . " it is in the interests of germany 's 2.5 million turks to be represented by these organizations at the summit , " she said . a spokesman at the interior ministry stressed it would be counter-productive for germany 's minorities to express their dissatisfaction with berlin by sitting out the debate . " integration must be based on active participation , not lack of it , " he said . the government estimates that 15 million people living in germany , which has a total population of 82 million , have an immigrant background of some kind - either with roots outside the country or as ethnic germans from the former soviet union . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" sports not violence " is a project based in lower saxony that aims to turn around soccer 's rough-and-ready reputation . with what should be a beautiful game overshadowed in europe by the brutish specter of hooliganism , the organization wants to return good sportsmanship to the pitch .
its latest attempt , however , failed miserably . in an admirably optimistic spirit , it recently teamed up with the police department in the city of aachen to schedule a goodwill game that was supposed to demonstrate to local kids that despite its tarnished image , playing soccer " is a meaningful way of spending their spare time , " as one policeman poignantly put it . but boys will be boys - and the organizers obviously overestimated the power of good intentions .
the fun soon turned into fisticuffs , with the match fast deteriorating into a punch-up when five players set upon a heckler who protested against a perceived lack of fair play . other players and fans soon waded in to the fray , while the original perpetrators fled the melee leaving mayhem in their wake . an experiment in peace turned into an orgy of violence .
perhaps the next time the project tries to stage of sporting match for peace , the game should be croquet .

she got the necessary financing .
the risk was high .
if she failed , the bank would take her home . but luck was on her side .
the people in this area south of kaiserslautern in rhineland-palatinate took to the us-style playground with its jungle gym and inflatable slides .
hock-wagner is happy and the region is profiting from her idea , as well .
after all , visitors to " meer4kids " come from all over , bringing valuable euros to the area . start-ups crucial for germany 's economy a study published by the government-owned kfw banking group showed a strong decline in business start-ups in 2006 .
last year , the number of people who entered into self-employment by setting up a new business , taking over an existing enterprise or an equity stake dropped by 200,000 to 1.1 million persons . this is the lowest number of business start-ups recorded in germany since kfw began its " start-up monitor " in the year 2000 .
every year , kfw surveys 40,000 randomly selected german residents .
according to kfw , it is the most comprehensive source of information on this sector in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthäus-maier hopes for a turnaround in 2007 ingrid matthäus-maier , spokeswoman of the kfw management board , said the latest figures should be food for thought . " start-ups are important for our economy , " matthäus-maier said at the presentation of the study last week .
for one , they create jobs .
secondly , they had a positive impact on the country 's economy and , therefore , increase germany 's international competitiveness . " heinz klandt , a professor at the prestigious european business school in oestrich-winkel , said it was important for companies to be founded particularly in those sectors with a future . " this will really have a strong impact on the economy and create jobs in growth-oriented sectors , " said klandt , who holds the first chair for entrepreneurship to have been set up in germany in 1998 . according to klandt , more needs to be done to stimulate these sectors . " there need to be more structural changes to develop new sectors , " klandt said .
" the money being sunk into subsidizing coal , for example , is missing in areas such as biotech , nanotechnology or other sectors with a future . " a matter of attitude but german attitudes towards self-employment also play a decisive role .
in comparison to other highly developed economies , such as the united states , there is a pessimistic start-up climate in germany . " our analyses on the influence of personal attitudes show that a positive approach to entrepreneurship , the willingness to take risk and optimism are major prerequisites for successfully starting into self-employment , " matthäus-maier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entrepreneurial spirit can already be learned at an early age but this necessary ideology is missing in germany , said klandt . " there is n't this pioneering spirit here , " he said .
" we do n't have the american dream . "
entrepreneurship did not have the same status in the german education system as it did in other countries , he said . " in finland , for example , the ideas behind entrepreneurship such as creativity or independence are already taught in kindergarten , " klandt said .
" in our education system , these things are pushed back . " germans were also often much more focused on security than risk in their thinking . " we 'd rather buy life insurance policies than stocks , " klandt said .
this was due to the strong safety net which existed in germany . matthäus-maier said a broad package of measures was required to improve the start-up climate in germany .
these needed to be " firmly anchored in the education and training system , " she said .
but society 's attitudes also needed to change , she added . " if we want to have more lively and sustainable start-up activity , we have to improve the subjective attitudes towards entrepreneurship , " matthäus-maier said . hope for 2007 germany 's current economic upswing has also contributed to the dip in self-employment .
many people previously had no other option than to start their own company , since they often had difficulty finding a job . " but during an economic upswing , there are a lot of attractive jobs out there again , " klandt said . but times could change , according to matthäus-maier .
" there is hope that a turnaround will take place in the course of the year , " she said , since the number of planned business start-ups was " extraordinarily high . "
as a result of the current stable upswing , many more people were expected to venture into self-employment in 2007 , she said . " this is urgently required because without strong start-up intensity , and the related creation of jobs and innovation , germany 's economic efficiency might be hurt , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

separately , another nuclear power plant in schleswig-holstein , brunsbüttel , was temporarily shut down last thursday about two hours before the krümmel fire because its capacity was overloaded . the incident triggered a fresh national debate about the safety of nuclear energy just days before an annual energy summit in berlin focused on exploring ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb global warming . environmental organization bund demanded the immediate closure of both plants . irregularities discovered greenpeace also accused vattenfall and the local government in kiel of withholding important information on the consequences of the incident .
according to the environmental organization , this was an obvious attempt to avoid conflict at germany 's third annual energy summit in berlin . contrary to initial reports , the fire had in fact led to problems at the plant 's nuclear reactor , the schleswig-holstein state social affairs ministry , which is responsible for the region 's power plants , said in a statement released thursday . last week , local police had stated that the fire , which started when coolant in a large electric power transformer substation ignited due to a short circuit , had been isolated from the atomic reactor . however experts investigating the incident found " several unusual things when the reactor was shut down " including evidence of damage related to the fire .
but they said there was no radiation leak . politicians from germany 's opposition green party as well as some from the ruling christian democratic party have said they want energy company vattenfall to explain why it remained silent for almost a week on the consequences of the incident .
some say vattenfall 's stance is undermining the credibility of the nuclear power industry in germany . vattenfall defends itself bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters dousing the blase at the nuclear plant last week in germany european energy group vattenfall however defended itself , saying it had acted quickly . a company spokesman dismissed the criticism , saying it had provided quick and comprehensive information on the accident to the authorities . " we informed the public immediately , " said ceo bruno thomauske in hamburg wednesday .
" at no point was the public at risk . " " this was nothing to do with the summit , " said oliver breuer from schleswig-holstein 's state social affairs ministry in an interview with spiegel online .
" we have no intention of covering anything up . " nuclear phase-out still an incendiary issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is reluctant to increase its dependancy on russian energy germany has begun a long-term phase-out of its 17 nuclear energy reactors and expects to mothball its last plant around 2020 . the plan was approved by the previous social democrat and green government , but chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives argue that abandoning nuclear energy would seriously undermine the country 's chances of slashing greenhouse gas emissions , as well as increase reliance on russian fossil fuel and make it harder to keep in check energy prices . the european union has set a goal of a 20-percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared with 1990 levels , but germany is aiming for a cut of up to 40 percent . merkel has come under increasing pressure from brussels to renegotiate the phase-out deal . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" our analyses on the influence of personal attitudes show that a positive approach to entrepreneurship , the willingness to take risk and optimism are major prerequisites for successfully starting into self-employment , " matthäus-maier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entrepreneurial spirit can already be learned at an early age but this necessary ideology is missing in germany , said klandt . " there is n't this pioneering spirit here , " he said .
" we do n't have the american dream . "
entrepreneurship did not have the same status in the german education system as it did in other countries , he said . " in finland , for example , the ideas behind entrepreneurship such as creativity or independence are already taught in kindergarten , " klandt said .
" in our education system , these things are pushed back . " germans were also often much more focused on security than risk in their thinking . " we 'd rather buy life insurance policies than stocks , " klandt said .
this was due to the strong safety net which existed in germany . matthäus-maier said a broad package of measures was required to improve the start-up climate in germany .
these needed to be " firmly anchored in the education and training system , " she said .
but society 's attitudes also needed to change , she added . " if we want to have more lively and sustainable start-up activity , we have to improve the subjective attitudes towards entrepreneurship , " matthäus-maier said . hope for 2007 germany 's current economic upswing has also contributed to the dip in self-employment .
many people previously had no other option than to start their own company , since they often had difficulty finding a job . " but during an economic upswing , there are a lot of attractive jobs out there again , " klandt said . but times could change , according to matthäus-maier .
" there is hope that a turnaround will take place in the course of the year , " she said , since the number of planned business start-ups was " extraordinarily high . "
as a result of the current stable upswing , many more people were expected to venture into self-employment in 2007 , she said . " this is urgently required because without strong start-up intensity , and the related creation of jobs and innovation , germany 's economic efficiency might be hurt , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" sports not violence " is a project based in lower saxony that aims to turn around soccer 's rough-and-ready reputation . with what should be a beautiful game overshadowed in europe by the brutish specter of hooliganism , the organization wants to return good sportsmanship to the pitch .
its latest attempt , however , failed miserably . in an admirably optimistic spirit , it recently teamed up with the police department in the city of aachen to schedule a goodwill game that was supposed to demonstrate to local kids that despite its tarnished image , playing soccer " is a meaningful way of spending their spare time , " as one policeman poignantly put it . but boys will be boys - and the organizers obviously overestimated the power of good intentions .
the fun soon turned into fisticuffs , with the match fast deteriorating into a punch-up when five players set upon a heckler who protested against a perceived lack of fair play . other players and fans soon waded in to the fray , while the original perpetrators fled the melee leaving mayhem in their wake . an experiment in peace turned into an orgy of violence .
perhaps the next time the project tries to stage of sporting match for peace , the game should be croquet .

separately , another nuclear power plant in schleswig-holstein , brunsbüttel , was temporarily shut down last thursday about two hours before the krümmel fire because its capacity was overloaded . the incident triggered a fresh national debate about the safety of nuclear energy just days before an annual energy summit in berlin focused on exploring ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb global warming . environmental organization bund demanded the immediate closure of both plants . irregularities discovered greenpeace also accused vattenfall and the local government in kiel of withholding important information on the consequences of the incident .
according to the environmental organization , this was an obvious attempt to avoid conflict at germany 's third annual energy summit in berlin . contrary to initial reports , the fire had in fact led to problems at the plant 's nuclear reactor , the schleswig-holstein state social affairs ministry , which is responsible for the region 's power plants , said in a statement released thursday . last week , local police had stated that the fire , which started when coolant in a large electric power transformer substation ignited due to a short circuit , had been isolated from the atomic reactor . however experts investigating the incident found " several unusual things when the reactor was shut down " including evidence of damage related to the fire .

most would still prefer dependent employment in a country where the pioneering spirit has still not caught on . anja hock-wagner belongs to a dwindling breed of people in germany - those who choose to take a financial risk over the security of a job and set up their own business . despite the high investment involved , hock-wagner , a single mother of four , managed to convince a bank of her dream project of an indoor playground .
she got the necessary financing .
the risk was high .
if she failed , the bank would take her home . but luck was on her side .
the people in this area south of kaiserslautern in rhineland-palatinate took to the us-style playground with its jungle gym and inflatable slides .
hock-wagner is happy and the region is profiting from her idea , as well .
after all , visitors to " meer4kids " come from all over , bringing valuable euros to the area . start-ups crucial for germany 's economy a study published by the government-owned kfw banking group showed a strong decline in business start-ups in 2006 .
last year , the number of people who entered into self-employment by setting up a new business , taking over an existing enterprise or an equity stake dropped by 200,000 to 1.1 million persons . this is the lowest number of business start-ups recorded in germany since kfw began its " start-up monitor " in the year 2000 .
every year , kfw surveys 40,000 randomly selected german residents .
according to kfw , it is the most comprehensive source of information on this sector in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthäus-maier hopes for a turnaround in 2007 ingrid matthäus-maier , spokeswoman of the kfw management board , said the latest figures should be food for thought . " start-ups are important for our economy , " matthäus-maier said at the presentation of the study last week .
for one , they create jobs .
secondly , they had a positive impact on the country 's economy and , therefore , increase germany 's international competitiveness . " heinz klandt , a professor at the prestigious european business school in oestrich-winkel , said it was important for companies to be founded particularly in those sectors with a future . " this will really have a strong impact on the economy and create jobs in growth-oriented sectors , " said klandt , who holds the first chair for entrepreneurship to have been set up in germany in 1998 . according to klandt , more needs to be done to stimulate these sectors . " there need to be more structural changes to develop new sectors , " klandt said .
" the money being sunk into subsidizing coal , for example , is missing in areas such as biotech , nanotechnology or other sectors with a future . " a matter of attitude but german attitudes towards self-employment also play a decisive role .
in comparison to other highly developed economies , such as the united states , there is a pessimistic start-up climate in germany . " our analyses on the influence of personal attitudes show that a positive approach to entrepreneurship , the willingness to take risk and optimism are major prerequisites for successfully starting into self-employment , " matthäus-maier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entrepreneurial spirit can already be learned at an early age but this necessary ideology is missing in germany , said klandt . " there is n't this pioneering spirit here , " he said .
" we do n't have the american dream . "
entrepreneurship did not have the same status in the german education system as it did in other countries , he said . " in finland , for example , the ideas behind entrepreneurship such as creativity or independence are already taught in kindergarten , " klandt said .
" in our education system , these things are pushed back . " germans were also often much more focused on security than risk in their thinking . " we 'd rather buy life insurance policies than stocks , " klandt said .
this was due to the strong safety net which existed in germany . matthäus-maier said a broad package of measures was required to improve the start-up climate in germany .
these needed to be " firmly anchored in the education and training system , " she said .
but society 's attitudes also needed to change , she added . " if we want to have more lively and sustainable start-up activity , we have to improve the subjective attitudes towards entrepreneurship , " matthäus-maier said . hope for 2007 germany 's current economic upswing has also contributed to the dip in self-employment .
many people previously had no other option than to start their own company , since they often had difficulty finding a job . " but during an economic upswing , there are a lot of attractive jobs out there again , " klandt said . but times could change , according to matthäus-maier .
" there is hope that a turnaround will take place in the course of the year , " she said , since the number of planned business start-ups was " extraordinarily high . "
as a result of the current stable upswing , many more people were expected to venture into self-employment in 2007 , she said . " this is urgently required because without strong start-up intensity , and the related creation of jobs and innovation , germany 's economic efficiency might be hurt , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . scientology and tom cruise should stay in the united states .
tom cruise is an actor but also a flamboyant scientologist .
also , his sexual orientation is a matter of dispute .
scientologists believe that mankind originates from outer space aliens .
there is a special sense of weirdness about tom cruise and other actors who belong to the same cult .
granting tax-free status to a cult is nonsense . - evi pickavance , usa i suggest researchers and media do their homework on tom cruise 's so-called religion , scientology , which is solidly based solely on l. ron hubbard - an american college dropout , moderately successful pulp fiction writer , questionable us navy officer , and scientology movement founder .
sidestep the name calling and please engage in a debate with hubbard 's bad ideas .
his followers will not be shaken of their glowing admiration of hubbard and their " religion " until the bad ideas of scientology , which are all entirely hubbard 's fault , are inspected and debated . - chuck beatty , usa tom cruise seems to lose more friends then he 's able to make .
maybe he should follow the saying , " you can win more friends with your ears than with your mouth . "
i 'm not saying that cruise is an " evil " man out to hurt people , but i do feel that he carries a certain arrogance , control , and opens his mouth at the wrong time for the wrong reason .
as for germany , i can imagine that is not the feeling they want for have for an actor portraying count claus schenk von stauffenberg . - stayduhar , usa scientology is a cult , not a valid religion .
it has engaged in criminal fraud and deceit and hides behind first amendment rights .
i have been involved with that cult in the past , so i know its evils first hand .
it is no secret why the us federal and state governments have charged it with crimes and have imposed taxes on its profiteering .
the government of germany should ban its evil activities . - rick , usa smoking on tv bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would censorship of smoking scenes only make cigarettes more attractive ?
i live in a country were media , including tv , is highly regulated and censored .
smoking , drinking and any kind of nudity -lrb- even perceived -rrb- is blurred , blackened out or otherwise censored .
does it reduce smoking and drinking ?
does it give our young people better role models ?
no .
as far as i see , the old saying of " what 's forbidden is just more attractive " seems to be true .
please do not patronize viewers ; they have their own opinion about what is suitable and what is not . - siegfried gohlke , thailand people that appeared on tv are role models for good and bad .
they should ban it -lrb- smoking on television -rrb- . - claudia molina , argentina compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drug commissioner : german tv should stub out smoking germany 's federal drug commissioner hopes that tv stations will join her battle against smoking .

last year , the number of people who entered into self-employment by setting up a new business , taking over an existing enterprise or an equity stake dropped by 200,000 to 1.1 million persons . this is the lowest number of business start-ups recorded in germany since kfw began its " start-up monitor " in the year 2000 .
every year , kfw surveys 40,000 randomly selected german residents .
according to kfw , it is the most comprehensive source of information on this sector in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthäus-maier hopes for a turnaround in 2007 ingrid matthäus-maier , spokeswoman of the kfw management board , said the latest figures should be food for thought . " start-ups are important for our economy , " matthäus-maier said at the presentation of the study last week .
for one , they create jobs .
secondly , they had a positive impact on the country 's economy and , therefore , increase germany 's international competitiveness . " heinz klandt , a professor at the prestigious european business school in oestrich-winkel , said it was important for companies to be founded particularly in those sectors with a future . " this will really have a strong impact on the economy and create jobs in growth-oriented sectors , " said klandt , who holds the first chair for entrepreneurship to have been set up in germany in 1998 . according to klandt , more needs to be done to stimulate these sectors . " there need to be more structural changes to develop new sectors , " klandt said .
" the money being sunk into subsidizing coal , for example , is missing in areas such as biotech , nanotechnology or other sectors with a future . " a matter of attitude but german attitudes towards self-employment also play a decisive role .
in comparison to other highly developed economies , such as the united states , there is a pessimistic start-up climate in germany . " our analyses on the influence of personal attitudes show that a positive approach to entrepreneurship , the willingness to take risk and optimism are major prerequisites for successfully starting into self-employment , " matthäus-maier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entrepreneurial spirit can already be learned at an early age but this necessary ideology is missing in germany , said klandt . " there is n't this pioneering spirit here , " he said .
" we do n't have the american dream . "
entrepreneurship did not have the same status in the german education system as it did in other countries , he said . " in finland , for example , the ideas behind entrepreneurship such as creativity or independence are already taught in kindergarten , " klandt said .
" in our education system , these things are pushed back . " germans were also often much more focused on security than risk in their thinking . " we 'd rather buy life insurance policies than stocks , " klandt said .
this was due to the strong safety net which existed in germany . matthäus-maier said a broad package of measures was required to improve the start-up climate in germany .
these needed to be " firmly anchored in the education and training system , " she said .
but society 's attitudes also needed to change , she added . " if we want to have more lively and sustainable start-up activity , we have to improve the subjective attitudes towards entrepreneurship , " matthäus-maier said . hope for 2007 germany 's current economic upswing has also contributed to the dip in self-employment .
many people previously had no other option than to start their own company , since they often had difficulty finding a job . " but during an economic upswing , there are a lot of attractive jobs out there again , " klandt said . but times could change , according to matthäus-maier .
" there is hope that a turnaround will take place in the course of the year , " she said , since the number of planned business start-ups was " extraordinarily high . "
as a result of the current stable upswing , many more people were expected to venture into self-employment in 2007 , she said .

last year , the number of people who entered into self-employment by setting up a new business , taking over an existing enterprise or an equity stake dropped by 200,000 to 1.1 million persons . this is the lowest number of business start-ups recorded in germany since kfw began its " start-up monitor " in the year 2000 .

for one , they create jobs .
secondly , they had a positive impact on the country 's economy and , therefore , increase germany 's international competitiveness . " heinz klandt , a professor at the prestigious european business school in oestrich-winkel , said it was important for companies to be founded particularly in those sectors with a future . " this will really have a strong impact on the economy and create jobs in growth-oriented sectors , " said klandt , who holds the first chair for entrepreneurship to have been set up in germany in 1998 . according to klandt , more needs to be done to stimulate these sectors .

in comparison to other highly developed economies , such as the united states , there is a pessimistic start-up climate in germany .

entrepreneurship did not have the same status in the german education system as it did in other countries , he said . " in finland , for example , the ideas behind entrepreneurship such as creativity or independence are already taught in kindergarten , " klandt said .
" in our education system , these things are pushed back . " germans were also often much more focused on security than risk in their thinking . " we 'd rather buy life insurance policies than stocks , " klandt said .
this was due to the strong safety net which existed in germany . matthäus-maier said a broad package of measures was required to improve the start-up climate in germany .
these needed to be " firmly anchored in the education and training system , " she said .
but society 's attitudes also needed to change , she added . " if we want to have more lively and sustainable start-up activity , we have to improve the subjective attitudes towards entrepreneurship , " matthäus-maier said . hope for 2007 germany 's current economic upswing has also contributed to the dip in self-employment .

" there is hope that a turnaround will take place in the course of the year , " she said , since the number of planned business start-ups was " extraordinarily high . "
as a result of the current stable upswing , many more people were expected to venture into self-employment in 2007 , she said .

" we will not solve all the doping problems in sport with this law but we do make a clear statement that we will not surrender , " said federal minister of the interior wolfgang schäuble . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble said the law made a clear statement " we have targeted these substances because their use has made doping highly criminalized , " he added .
" with the new laws , the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- can intervene and surveillance operations can be used to fight these criminal structures . "
the law will go before the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , on september 21 and could then come into force in october .
the government had come under fire recently for failing to act strongly enough in the battle against doping in sport , with federal sports committee chairperson peter danckert accusing the coalition of lacking the stomach for the fight .
after thursday 's announcement , however , danckert conceded : " we are satisfied that the government has shown support for sport with the law . "
the german olympic sports union -lrb- dosb -rrb- chief michael vesper was also pleased with the decision .
" i am glad that this proposal has found such wide approval . " criminal networks to be targeted by law vesper cautioned that the new legal framework must now prove itself but added : " i am optimistic .
the jörg jaksche case shows that there are networks in sport which allow doping but these structures are now going to be vulnerable to the authorities and courts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaksche , center , revealed a permissive culture in sport german rider jaksche became the first rider to admit using blood doping prepared by a spanish doctor in the " operation puerto " scandal .
jaksche told germany 's spiegel magazine in june that he had used performance-enhancing drugs since 1997 , while riding for a number of teams .
he told spiegel that doping was either actively conducted by team leaders or at least tolerated .
the government also pledged to increase its financial support by increasing the budget for organized sport in germany to 125.8 million euros -lrb- $ 171.5m -rrb- by 2008 , a huge rise from the current level of 17.3 million .
included in this new budget is an increase in funding for the national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- from 1.1 to 3.9 million euros . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" sports not violence " is a project based in lower saxony that aims to turn around soccer 's rough-and-ready reputation . with what should be a beautiful game overshadowed in europe by the brutish specter of hooliganism , the organization wants to return good sportsmanship to the pitch .
its latest attempt , however , failed miserably . in an admirably optimistic spirit , it recently teamed up with the police department in the city of aachen to schedule a goodwill game that was supposed to demonstrate to local kids that despite its tarnished image , playing soccer " is a meaningful way of spending their spare time , " as one policeman poignantly put it . but boys will be boys - and the organizers obviously overestimated the power of good intentions .
the fun soon turned into fisticuffs , with the match fast deteriorating into a punch-up when five players set upon a heckler who protested against a perceived lack of fair play . other players and fans soon waded in to the fray , while the original perpetrators fled the melee leaving mayhem in their wake . an experiment in peace turned into an orgy of violence .

germany 's leading muslim associations say the government 's new immigration law smacks of hypocrisy , and that berlin has failed to come good on promises made at last year 's integration summit . hailed by the head of germany 's turkish community , kenan kolat , as an " historic day " which ushered in a " new era of immigration policy , " the first ever integration summit held in chancellor angela merkel 's office last summer was broadly seen as a resounding success . but one year on , the euphoria has faded .
the fly in the ointment is the german parliament 's newly approved immigration law , which has angered muslim groups to such an extent that many feel the upcoming second integration summit on july 12 is nothing but a farce . betrayed this time round , kenan kolat still has n't decided whether he 'll even attend . together with yasar bilgin , who heads up the council of turkish citizens in german , he feels betrayed by berlin 's latest amendments to the immigration law passed in 2005 . " we are considering whether we will voice our protest at the new changes to the law at the summit or whether we will refuse to appear , " he told spiegel online , stressing that he sees the new law as hostile to turks and unconstitutional . " the government makes out to us that everything is hunky dory , " he said .
" they tell us that we 're making progress on the integration front and then they make a decision completely over our heads .
it 's hypocrisy . " united in anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year 's summit was upbeat anger has united many of the turkish community 's otherwise divided representative groups .

germany 's leading muslim associations say the government 's new immigration law smacks of hypocrisy , and that berlin has failed to come good on promises made at last year 's integration summit . hailed by the head of germany 's turkish community , kenan kolat , as an " historic day " which ushered in a " new era of immigration policy , " the first ever integration summit held in chancellor angela merkel 's office last summer was broadly seen as a resounding success . but one year on , the euphoria has faded .
the fly in the ointment is the german parliament 's newly approved immigration law , which has angered muslim groups to such an extent that many feel the upcoming second integration summit on july 12 is nothing but a farce . betrayed this time round , kenan kolat still has n't decided whether he 'll even attend . together with yasar bilgin , who heads up the council of turkish citizens in german , he feels betrayed by berlin 's latest amendments to the immigration law passed in 2005 .

" we will not solve all the doping problems in sport with this law but we do make a clear statement that we will not surrender , " said federal minister of the interior wolfgang schäuble . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble said the law made a clear statement " we have targeted these substances because their use has made doping highly criminalized , " he added .
" with the new laws , the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- can intervene and surveillance operations can be used to fight these criminal structures . "
the law will go before the upper house of parliament , the bundesrat , on september 21 and could then come into force in october .
the government had come under fire recently for failing to act strongly enough in the battle against doping in sport , with federal sports committee chairperson peter danckert accusing the coalition of lacking the stomach for the fight .
after thursday 's announcement , however , danckert conceded : " we are satisfied that the government has shown support for sport with the law . "
the german olympic sports union -lrb- dosb -rrb- chief michael vesper was also pleased with the decision .
" i am glad that this proposal has found such wide approval . " criminal networks to be targeted by law vesper cautioned that the new legal framework must now prove itself but added : " i am optimistic .
the jörg jaksche case shows that there are networks in sport which allow doping but these structures are now going to be vulnerable to the authorities and courts . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaksche , center , revealed a permissive culture in sport german rider jaksche became the first rider to admit using blood doping prepared by a spanish doctor in the " operation puerto " scandal .
jaksche told germany 's spiegel magazine in june that he had used performance-enhancing drugs since 1997 , while riding for a number of teams .
he told spiegel that doping was either actively conducted by team leaders or at least tolerated .
the government also pledged to increase its financial support by increasing the budget for organized sport in germany to 125.8 million euros -lrb- $ 171.5m -rrb- by 2008 , a huge rise from the current level of 17.3 million .
included in this new budget is an increase in funding for the national anti-doping agency -lrb- nada -rrb- from 1.1 to 3.9 million euros . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

most would still prefer dependent employment in a country where the pioneering spirit has still not caught on . anja hock-wagner belongs to a dwindling breed of people in germany - those who choose to take a financial risk over the security of a job and set up their own business . despite the high investment involved , hock-wagner , a single mother of four , managed to convince a bank of her dream project of an indoor playground .
she got the necessary financing .
the risk was high .
if she failed , the bank would take her home . but luck was on her side .
the people in this area south of kaiserslautern in rhineland-palatinate took to the us-style playground with its jungle gym and inflatable slides .
hock-wagner is happy and the region is profiting from her idea , as well .
after all , visitors to " meer4kids " come from all over , bringing valuable euros to the area . start-ups crucial for germany 's economy a study published by the government-owned kfw banking group showed a strong decline in business start-ups in 2006 .
last year , the number of people who entered into self-employment by setting up a new business , taking over an existing enterprise or an equity stake dropped by 200,000 to 1.1 million persons . this is the lowest number of business start-ups recorded in germany since kfw began its " start-up monitor " in the year 2000 .
every year , kfw surveys 40,000 randomly selected german residents .
according to kfw , it is the most comprehensive source of information on this sector in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthäus-maier hopes for a turnaround in 2007 ingrid matthäus-maier , spokeswoman of the kfw management board , said the latest figures should be food for thought . " start-ups are important for our economy , " matthäus-maier said at the presentation of the study last week .
for one , they create jobs .
secondly , they had a positive impact on the country 's economy and , therefore , increase germany 's international competitiveness . " heinz klandt , a professor at the prestigious european business school in oestrich-winkel , said it was important for companies to be founded particularly in those sectors with a future . " this will really have a strong impact on the economy and create jobs in growth-oriented sectors , " said klandt , who holds the first chair for entrepreneurship to have been set up in germany in 1998 . according to klandt , more needs to be done to stimulate these sectors . " there need to be more structural changes to develop new sectors , " klandt said .
" the money being sunk into subsidizing coal , for example , is missing in areas such as biotech , nanotechnology or other sectors with a future . " a matter of attitude but german attitudes towards self-employment also play a decisive role .
in comparison to other highly developed economies , such as the united states , there is a pessimistic start-up climate in germany . " our analyses on the influence of personal attitudes show that a positive approach to entrepreneurship , the willingness to take risk and optimism are major prerequisites for successfully starting into self-employment , " matthäus-maier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entrepreneurial spirit can already be learned at an early age but this necessary ideology is missing in germany , said klandt . " there is n't this pioneering spirit here , " he said .
" we do n't have the american dream . "
entrepreneurship did not have the same status in the german education system as it did in other countries , he said . " in finland , for example , the ideas behind entrepreneurship such as creativity or independence are already taught in kindergarten , " klandt said .
" in our education system , these things are pushed back . " germans were also often much more focused on security than risk in their thinking . " we 'd rather buy life insurance policies than stocks , " klandt said .
this was due to the strong safety net which existed in germany . matthäus-maier said a broad package of measures was required to improve the start-up climate in germany .
these needed to be " firmly anchored in the education and training system , " she said .
but society 's attitudes also needed to change , she added . " if we want to have more lively and sustainable start-up activity , we have to improve the subjective attitudes towards entrepreneurship , " matthäus-maier said . hope for 2007 germany 's current economic upswing has also contributed to the dip in self-employment .
many people previously had no other option than to start their own company , since they often had difficulty finding a job . " but during an economic upswing , there are a lot of attractive jobs out there again , " klandt said . but times could change , according to matthäus-maier .
" there is hope that a turnaround will take place in the course of the year , " she said , since the number of planned business start-ups was " extraordinarily high . "
as a result of the current stable upswing , many more people were expected to venture into self-employment in 2007 , she said . " this is urgently required because without strong start-up intensity , and the related creation of jobs and innovation , germany 's economic efficiency might be hurt , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

last year , the number of people who entered into self-employment by setting up a new business , taking over an existing enterprise or an equity stake dropped by 200,000 to 1.1 million persons . this is the lowest number of business start-ups recorded in germany since kfw began its " start-up monitor " in the year 2000 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de labor market -pipe- 05.07.2007 risk-averse germans shy away from self-employment großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a shrinking number of germans are willing to dive into self-employment a decreasing number of germans are willing to take the plunge and found their own company .
most would still prefer dependent employment in a country where the pioneering spirit has still not caught on . anja hock-wagner belongs to a dwindling breed of people in germany - those who choose to take a financial risk over the security of a job and set up their own business . despite the high investment involved , hock-wagner , a single mother of four , managed to convince a bank of her dream project of an indoor playground .
she got the necessary financing .
the risk was high .
if she failed , the bank would take her home . but luck was on her side .
the people in this area south of kaiserslautern in rhineland-palatinate took to the us-style playground with its jungle gym and inflatable slides .
hock-wagner is happy and the region is profiting from her idea , as well .
after all , visitors to " meer4kids " come from all over , bringing valuable euros to the area . start-ups crucial for germany 's economy a study published by the government-owned kfw banking group showed a strong decline in business start-ups in 2006 .
last year , the number of people who entered into self-employment by setting up a new business , taking over an existing enterprise or an equity stake dropped by 200,000 to 1.1 million persons . this is the lowest number of business start-ups recorded in germany since kfw began its " start-up monitor " in the year 2000 .
every year , kfw surveys 40,000 randomly selected german residents .
according to kfw , it is the most comprehensive source of information on this sector in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthäus-maier hopes for a turnaround in 2007 ingrid matthäus-maier , spokeswoman of the kfw management board , said the latest figures should be food for thought . " start-ups are important for our economy , " matthäus-maier said at the presentation of the study last week .
for one , they create jobs .
secondly , they had a positive impact on the country 's economy and , therefore , increase germany 's international competitiveness . " heinz klandt , a professor at the prestigious european business school in oestrich-winkel , said it was important for companies to be founded particularly in those sectors with a future . " this will really have a strong impact on the economy and create jobs in growth-oriented sectors , " said klandt , who holds the first chair for entrepreneurship to have been set up in germany in 1998 . according to klandt , more needs to be done to stimulate these sectors . " there need to be more structural changes to develop new sectors , " klandt said .
" the money being sunk into subsidizing coal , for example , is missing in areas such as biotech , nanotechnology or other sectors with a future . " a matter of attitude but german attitudes towards self-employment also play a decisive role .
in comparison to other highly developed economies , such as the united states , there is a pessimistic start-up climate in germany . " our analyses on the influence of personal attitudes show that a positive approach to entrepreneurship , the willingness to take risk and optimism are major prerequisites for successfully starting into self-employment , " matthäus-maier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entrepreneurial spirit can already be learned at an early age but this necessary ideology is missing in germany , said klandt . " there is n't this pioneering spirit here , " he said .
" we do n't have the american dream . "
entrepreneurship did not have the same status in the german education system as it did in other countries , he said . " in finland , for example , the ideas behind entrepreneurship such as creativity or independence are already taught in kindergarten , " klandt said .
" in our education system , these things are pushed back . " germans were also often much more focused on security than risk in their thinking . " we 'd rather buy life insurance policies than stocks , " klandt said .
this was due to the strong safety net which existed in germany . matthäus-maier said a broad package of measures was required to improve the start-up climate in germany .
these needed to be " firmly anchored in the education and training system , " she said .
but society 's attitudes also needed to change , she added . " if we want to have more lively and sustainable start-up activity , we have to improve the subjective attitudes towards entrepreneurship , " matthäus-maier said . hope for 2007 germany 's current economic upswing has also contributed to the dip in self-employment .
many people previously had no other option than to start their own company , since they often had difficulty finding a job . " but during an economic upswing , there are a lot of attractive jobs out there again , " klandt said . but times could change , according to matthäus-maier .
" there is hope that a turnaround will take place in the course of the year , " she said , since the number of planned business start-ups was " extraordinarily high . "
as a result of the current stable upswing , many more people were expected to venture into self-employment in 2007 , she said . " this is urgently required because without strong start-up intensity , and the related creation of jobs and innovation , germany 's economic efficiency might be hurt , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

separately , another nuclear power plant in schleswig-holstein , brunsbüttel , was temporarily shut down last thursday about two hours before the krümmel fire because its capacity was overloaded . the incident triggered a fresh national debate about the safety of nuclear energy just days before an annual energy summit in berlin focused on exploring ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb global warming . environmental organization bund demanded the immediate closure of both plants . irregularities discovered greenpeace also accused vattenfall and the local government in kiel of withholding important information on the consequences of the incident .
according to the environmental organization , this was an obvious attempt to avoid conflict at germany 's third annual energy summit in berlin . contrary to initial reports , the fire had in fact led to problems at the plant 's nuclear reactor , the schleswig-holstein state social affairs ministry , which is responsible for the region 's power plants , said in a statement released thursday . last week , local police had stated that the fire , which started when coolant in a large electric power transformer substation ignited due to a short circuit , had been isolated from the atomic reactor . however experts investigating the incident found " several unusual things when the reactor was shut down " including evidence of damage related to the fire .
but they said there was no radiation leak . politicians from germany 's opposition green party as well as some from the ruling christian democratic party have said they want energy company vattenfall to explain why it remained silent for almost a week on the consequences of the incident .
some say vattenfall 's stance is undermining the credibility of the nuclear power industry in germany . vattenfall defends itself bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters dousing the blase at the nuclear plant last week in germany european energy group vattenfall however defended itself , saying it had acted quickly . a company spokesman dismissed the criticism , saying it had provided quick and comprehensive information on the accident to the authorities . " we informed the public immediately , " said ceo bruno thomauske in hamburg wednesday .

separately , another nuclear power plant in schleswig-holstein , brunsbüttel , was temporarily shut down last thursday about two hours before the krümmel fire because its capacity was overloaded . the incident triggered a fresh national debate about the safety of nuclear energy just days before an annual energy summit in berlin focused on exploring ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb global warming . environmental organization bund demanded the immediate closure of both plants . irregularities discovered greenpeace also accused vattenfall and the local government in kiel of withholding important information on the consequences of the incident .
according to the environmental organization , this was an obvious attempt to avoid conflict at germany 's third annual energy summit in berlin . contrary to initial reports , the fire had in fact led to problems at the plant 's nuclear reactor , the schleswig-holstein state social affairs ministry , which is responsible for the region 's power plants , said in a statement released thursday . last week , local police had stated that the fire , which started when coolant in a large electric power transformer substation ignited due to a short circuit , had been isolated from the atomic reactor . however experts investigating the incident found " several unusual things when the reactor was shut down " including evidence of damage related to the fire .
but they said there was no radiation leak . politicians from germany 's opposition green party as well as some from the ruling christian democratic party have said they want energy company vattenfall to explain why it remained silent for almost a week on the consequences of the incident .
some say vattenfall 's stance is undermining the credibility of the nuclear power industry in germany . vattenfall defends itself bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters dousing the blase at the nuclear plant last week in germany european energy group vattenfall however defended itself , saying it had acted quickly . a company spokesman dismissed the criticism , saying it had provided quick and comprehensive information on the accident to the authorities . " we informed the public immediately , " said ceo bruno thomauske in hamburg wednesday .
" at no point was the public at risk . " " this was nothing to do with the summit , " said oliver breuer from schleswig-holstein 's state social affairs ministry in an interview with spiegel online .
" we have no intention of covering anything up . " nuclear phase-out still an incendiary issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is reluctant to increase its dependancy on russian energy germany has begun a long-term phase-out of its 17 nuclear energy reactors and expects to mothball its last plant around 2020 . the plan was approved by the previous social democrat and green government , but chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives argue that abandoning nuclear energy would seriously undermine the country 's chances of slashing greenhouse gas emissions , as well as increase reliance on russian fossil fuel and make it harder to keep in check energy prices . the european union has set a goal of a 20-percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared with 1990 levels , but germany is aiming for a cut of up to 40 percent . merkel has come under increasing pressure from brussels to renegotiate the phase-out deal . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 05.07.2007 readers have harsh words for cruise and scientology großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : readers had little sympathy for cruise 's commitment to scientology tom cruise 's new movie , which the german government has not permitted him to film inside the defense ministry , continues to stir up controversy in germany and among our readers . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . scientology and tom cruise should stay in the united states .
tom cruise is an actor but also a flamboyant scientologist .
also , his sexual orientation is a matter of dispute .
scientologists believe that mankind originates from outer space aliens .
there is a special sense of weirdness about tom cruise and other actors who belong to the same cult .
granting tax-free status to a cult is nonsense . - evi pickavance , usa i suggest researchers and media do their homework on tom cruise 's so-called religion , scientology , which is solidly based solely on l. ron hubbard - an american college dropout , moderately successful pulp fiction writer , questionable us navy officer , and scientology movement founder .
sidestep the name calling and please engage in a debate with hubbard 's bad ideas .
his followers will not be shaken of their glowing admiration of hubbard and their " religion " until the bad ideas of scientology , which are all entirely hubbard 's fault , are inspected and debated . - chuck beatty , usa tom cruise seems to lose more friends then he 's able to make .
maybe he should follow the saying , " you can win more friends with your ears than with your mouth . "
i 'm not saying that cruise is an " evil " man out to hurt people , but i do feel that he carries a certain arrogance , control , and opens his mouth at the wrong time for the wrong reason .
as for germany , i can imagine that is not the feeling they want for have for an actor portraying count claus schenk von stauffenberg . - stayduhar , usa scientology is a cult , not a valid religion .
it has engaged in criminal fraud and deceit and hides behind first amendment rights .
i have been involved with that cult in the past , so i know its evils first hand .
it is no secret why the us federal and state governments have charged it with crimes and have imposed taxes on its profiteering .
the government of germany should ban its evil activities . - rick , usa smoking on tv bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would censorship of smoking scenes only make cigarettes more attractive ?
i live in a country were media , including tv , is highly regulated and censored .
smoking , drinking and any kind of nudity -lrb- even perceived -rrb- is blurred , blackened out or otherwise censored .
does it reduce smoking and drinking ?
does it give our young people better role models ?
no .
as far as i see , the old saying of " what 's forbidden is just more attractive " seems to be true .
please do not patronize viewers ; they have their own opinion about what is suitable and what is not . - siegfried gohlke , thailand people that appeared on tv are role models for good and bad .
they should ban it -lrb- smoking on television -rrb- . - claudia molina , argentina compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drug commissioner : german tv should stub out smoking germany 's federal drug commissioner hopes that tv stations will join her battle against smoking .
she says children and young people are particularly tempted to take up the habit by smoking scenes in films and on tv .

germany 's leading muslim associations say the government 's new immigration law smacks of hypocrisy , and that berlin has failed to come good on promises made at last year 's integration summit . hailed by the head of germany 's turkish community , kenan kolat , as an " historic day " which ushered in a " new era of immigration policy , " the first ever integration summit held in chancellor angela merkel 's office last summer was broadly seen as a resounding success . but one year on , the euphoria has faded .
the fly in the ointment is the german parliament 's newly approved immigration law , which has angered muslim groups to such an extent that many feel the upcoming second integration summit on july 12 is nothing but a farce . betrayed this time round , kenan kolat still has n't decided whether he 'll even attend . together with yasar bilgin , who heads up the council of turkish citizens in german , he feels betrayed by berlin 's latest amendments to the immigration law passed in 2005 . " we are considering whether we will voice our protest at the new changes to the law at the summit or whether we will refuse to appear , " he told spiegel online , stressing that he sees the new law as hostile to turks and unconstitutional .

separately , another nuclear power plant in schleswig-holstein , brunsbüttel , was temporarily shut down last thursday about two hours before the krümmel fire because its capacity was overloaded . the incident triggered a fresh national debate about the safety of nuclear energy just days before an annual energy summit in berlin focused on exploring ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb global warming . environmental organization bund demanded the immediate closure of both plants . irregularities discovered greenpeace also accused vattenfall and the local government in kiel of withholding important information on the consequences of the incident .
according to the environmental organization , this was an obvious attempt to avoid conflict at germany 's third annual energy summit in berlin . contrary to initial reports , the fire had in fact led to problems at the plant 's nuclear reactor , the schleswig-holstein state social affairs ministry , which is responsible for the region 's power plants , said in a statement released thursday . last week , local police had stated that the fire , which started when coolant in a large electric power transformer substation ignited due to a short circuit , had been isolated from the atomic reactor . however experts investigating the incident found " several unusual things when the reactor was shut down " including evidence of damage related to the fire .
but they said there was no radiation leak . politicians from germany 's opposition green party as well as some from the ruling christian democratic party have said they want energy company vattenfall to explain why it remained silent for almost a week on the consequences of the incident .
some say vattenfall 's stance is undermining the credibility of the nuclear power industry in germany . vattenfall defends itself bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters dousing the blase at the nuclear plant last week in germany european energy group vattenfall however defended itself , saying it had acted quickly . a company spokesman dismissed the criticism , saying it had provided quick and comprehensive information on the accident to the authorities . " we informed the public immediately , " said ceo bruno thomauske in hamburg wednesday .
" at no point was the public at risk . " " this was nothing to do with the summit , " said oliver breuer from schleswig-holstein 's state social affairs ministry in an interview with spiegel online .
" we have no intention of covering anything up . " nuclear phase-out still an incendiary issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is reluctant to increase its dependancy on russian energy germany has begun a long-term phase-out of its 17 nuclear energy reactors and expects to mothball its last plant around 2020 . the plan was approved by the previous social democrat and green government , but chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives argue that abandoning nuclear energy would seriously undermine the country 's chances of slashing greenhouse gas emissions , as well as increase reliance on russian fossil fuel and make it harder to keep in check energy prices . the european union has set a goal of a 20-percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared with 1990 levels , but germany is aiming for a cut of up to 40 percent . merkel has come under increasing pressure from brussels to renegotiate the phase-out deal . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . scientology and tom cruise should stay in the united states .
tom cruise is an actor but also a flamboyant scientologist .
also , his sexual orientation is a matter of dispute .
scientologists believe that mankind originates from outer space aliens .
there is a special sense of weirdness about tom cruise and other actors who belong to the same cult .
granting tax-free status to a cult is nonsense . - evi pickavance , usa i suggest researchers and media do their homework on tom cruise 's so-called religion , scientology , which is solidly based solely on l. ron hubbard - an american college dropout , moderately successful pulp fiction writer , questionable us navy officer , and scientology movement founder .
sidestep the name calling and please engage in a debate with hubbard 's bad ideas .
his followers will not be shaken of their glowing admiration of hubbard and their " religion " until the bad ideas of scientology , which are all entirely hubbard 's fault , are inspected and debated . - chuck beatty , usa tom cruise seems to lose more friends then he 's able to make .
maybe he should follow the saying , " you can win more friends with your ears than with your mouth . "
i 'm not saying that cruise is an " evil " man out to hurt people , but i do feel that he carries a certain arrogance , control , and opens his mouth at the wrong time for the wrong reason .
as for germany , i can imagine that is not the feeling they want for have for an actor portraying count claus schenk von stauffenberg . - stayduhar , usa scientology is a cult , not a valid religion .
it has engaged in criminal fraud and deceit and hides behind first amendment rights .
i have been involved with that cult in the past , so i know its evils first hand .
it is no secret why the us federal and state governments have charged it with crimes and have imposed taxes on its profiteering .
the government of germany should ban its evil activities . - rick , usa smoking on tv bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would censorship of smoking scenes only make cigarettes more attractive ?
i live in a country were media , including tv , is highly regulated and censored .
smoking , drinking and any kind of nudity -lrb- even perceived -rrb- is blurred , blackened out or otherwise censored .
does it reduce smoking and drinking ?
does it give our young people better role models ?
no .
as far as i see , the old saying of " what 's forbidden is just more attractive " seems to be true .
please do not patronize viewers ; they have their own opinion about what is suitable and what is not . - siegfried gohlke , thailand people that appeared on tv are role models for good and bad .
they should ban it -lrb- smoking on television -rrb- . - claudia molina , argentina compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drug commissioner : german tv should stub out smoking germany 's federal drug commissioner hopes that tv stations will join her battle against smoking .
she says children and young people are particularly tempted to take up the habit by smoking scenes in films and on tv .
-lrb- 03.07.2007 -rrb- oscar winner leads voices criticizing germany over cruise film a german government decision to prevent hollywood star tom cruise from filming scenes for his upcoming movie about a german aristocrat behind a daring plot to kill hitler has drawn criticism from a number of quarters .
-lrb- 04.07.2007 -rrb- readers wrote in on poland , tom cruise and cia readers shared their views on this week 's top news stories , from the post-summit state of german-polish relations to germany 's call for the extradition of 13 cia agents and tom cruise 's foiled plans to film in germany .
-lrb- 27.06.2007 -rrb- germany bans cruise film project from military sites a movie about an assasination attempt against adolf hitler has been barred from filming at german military sites because of us actor tom cruise 's membership in the church of scientology .

most would still prefer dependent employment in a country where the pioneering spirit has still not caught on . anja hock-wagner belongs to a dwindling breed of people in germany - those who choose to take a financial risk over the security of a job and set up their own business . despite the high investment involved , hock-wagner , a single mother of four , managed to convince a bank of her dream project of an indoor playground .
she got the necessary financing .
the risk was high .
if she failed , the bank would take her home . but luck was on her side .
the people in this area south of kaiserslautern in rhineland-palatinate took to the us-style playground with its jungle gym and inflatable slides .
hock-wagner is happy and the region is profiting from her idea , as well .
after all , visitors to " meer4kids " come from all over , bringing valuable euros to the area . start-ups crucial for germany 's economy a study published by the government-owned kfw banking group showed a strong decline in business start-ups in 2006 .
last year , the number of people who entered into self-employment by setting up a new business , taking over an existing enterprise or an equity stake dropped by 200,000 to 1.1 million persons . this is the lowest number of business start-ups recorded in germany since kfw began its " start-up monitor " in the year 2000 .
every year , kfw surveys 40,000 randomly selected german residents .
according to kfw , it is the most comprehensive source of information on this sector in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthäus-maier hopes for a turnaround in 2007 ingrid matthäus-maier , spokeswoman of the kfw management board , said the latest figures should be food for thought . " start-ups are important for our economy , " matthäus-maier said at the presentation of the study last week .
for one , they create jobs .

according to kfw , it is the most comprehensive source of information on this sector in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthäus-maier hopes for a turnaround in 2007 ingrid matthäus-maier , spokeswoman of the kfw management board , said the latest figures should be food for thought . " start-ups are important for our economy , " matthäus-maier said at the presentation of the study last week .
for one , they create jobs .
secondly , they had a positive impact on the country 's economy and , therefore , increase germany 's international competitiveness . " heinz klandt , a professor at the prestigious european business school in oestrich-winkel , said it was important for companies to be founded particularly in those sectors with a future . " this will really have a strong impact on the economy and create jobs in growth-oriented sectors , " said klandt , who holds the first chair for entrepreneurship to have been set up in germany in 1998 . according to klandt , more needs to be done to stimulate these sectors . " there need to be more structural changes to develop new sectors , " klandt said .
" the money being sunk into subsidizing coal , for example , is missing in areas such as biotech , nanotechnology or other sectors with a future . " a matter of attitude but german attitudes towards self-employment also play a decisive role .
in comparison to other highly developed economies , such as the united states , there is a pessimistic start-up climate in germany . " our analyses on the influence of personal attitudes show that a positive approach to entrepreneurship , the willingness to take risk and optimism are major prerequisites for successfully starting into self-employment , " matthäus-maier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entrepreneurial spirit can already be learned at an early age but this necessary ideology is missing in germany , said klandt . " there is n't this pioneering spirit here , " he said .
" we do n't have the american dream . "
entrepreneurship did not have the same status in the german education system as it did in other countries , he said . " in finland , for example , the ideas behind entrepreneurship such as creativity or independence are already taught in kindergarten , " klandt said .
" in our education system , these things are pushed back . " germans were also often much more focused on security than risk in their thinking . " we 'd rather buy life insurance policies than stocks , " klandt said .
this was due to the strong safety net which existed in germany . matthäus-maier said a broad package of measures was required to improve the start-up climate in germany .
these needed to be " firmly anchored in the education and training system , " she said .
but society 's attitudes also needed to change , she added . " if we want to have more lively and sustainable start-up activity , we have to improve the subjective attitudes towards entrepreneurship , " matthäus-maier said . hope for 2007 germany 's current economic upswing has also contributed to the dip in self-employment .
many people previously had no other option than to start their own company , since they often had difficulty finding a job . " but during an economic upswing , there are a lot of attractive jobs out there again , " klandt said . but times could change , according to matthäus-maier .
" there is hope that a turnaround will take place in the course of the year , " she said , since the number of planned business start-ups was " extraordinarily high . "
as a result of the current stable upswing , many more people were expected to venture into self-employment in 2007 , she said . " this is urgently required because without strong start-up intensity , and the related creation of jobs and innovation , germany 's economic efficiency might be hurt , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

most would still prefer dependent employment in a country where the pioneering spirit has still not caught on . anja hock-wagner belongs to a dwindling breed of people in germany - those who choose to take a financial risk over the security of a job and set up their own business . despite the high investment involved , hock-wagner , a single mother of four , managed to convince a bank of her dream project of an indoor playground .
she got the necessary financing .
the risk was high .
if she failed , the bank would take her home . but luck was on her side .
the people in this area south of kaiserslautern in rhineland-palatinate took to the us-style playground with its jungle gym and inflatable slides .
hock-wagner is happy and the region is profiting from her idea , as well .

germany 's leading muslim associations say the government 's new immigration law smacks of hypocrisy , and that berlin has failed to come good on promises made at last year 's integration summit . hailed by the head of germany 's turkish community , kenan kolat , as an " historic day " which ushered in a " new era of immigration policy , " the first ever integration summit held in chancellor angela merkel 's office last summer was broadly seen as a resounding success . but one year on , the euphoria has faded .
the fly in the ointment is the german parliament 's newly approved immigration law , which has angered muslim groups to such an extent that many feel the upcoming second integration summit on july 12 is nothing but a farce . betrayed this time round , kenan kolat still has n't decided whether he 'll even attend . together with yasar bilgin , who heads up the council of turkish citizens in german , he feels betrayed by berlin 's latest amendments to the immigration law passed in 2005 . " we are considering whether we will voice our protest at the new changes to the law at the summit or whether we will refuse to appear , " he told spiegel online , stressing that he sees the new law as hostile to turks and unconstitutional . " the government makes out to us that everything is hunky dory , " he said .
" they tell us that we 're making progress on the integration front and then they make a decision completely over our heads .
it 's hypocrisy . " united in anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year 's summit was upbeat anger has united many of the turkish community 's otherwise divided representative groups .
across the board , there is agreement that the government has left them out in the cold . " i am deeply disappointed , " said bekir alboga from the turkish directorate for religious affairs -lrb- ditib -rrb- in an interview with spiegel online .
" this is political duplicity and there is no point taking part in the summit . " " we are not interested in playing bit parts at this meeting and thereby legitimating the law , " he added . he said that his organization would not be attending unless the immigration law is rejected by the german council at the imminent vote . the brunt of alboga 's criticism is directed at the new clause on spousal immigration , which states that a foreigner who wants to bring his wife to germany must be able to prove that she can earn her own living .
were a german national to bring a foreign wife to the country , this would not apply . " at last year 's summit , the government reiterated the importance of talking to us , not about us , " he said .
" but we were never told about the tightening of residency regulations .
we were excluded from these discussions . " taking part , not sitting out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria böhmer the upcoming summit will be led by maria böhmer of the cdu , who is in charge of immigration issues in the government .
she feels that organizations such as those fronted by kolat and alboga have devoted years to securing participation in the integration debate , and that they will undo all the good work by refusing to sit at a table with the chancellor . " it is in the interests of germany 's 2.5 million turks to be represented by these organizations at the summit , " she said . a spokesman at the interior ministry stressed it would be counter-productive for germany 's minorities to express their dissatisfaction with berlin by sitting out the debate . " integration must be based on active participation , not lack of it , " he said . the government estimates that 15 million people living in germany , which has a total population of 82 million , have an immigrant background of some kind - either with roots outside the country or as ethnic germans from the former soviet union . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's leading muslim associations say the government 's new immigration law smacks of hypocrisy , and that berlin has failed to come good on promises made at last year 's integration summit . hailed by the head of germany 's turkish community , kenan kolat , as an " historic day " which ushered in a " new era of immigration policy , " the first ever integration summit held in chancellor angela merkel 's office last summer was broadly seen as a resounding success . but one year on , the euphoria has faded .
the fly in the ointment is the german parliament 's newly approved immigration law , which has angered muslim groups to such an extent that many feel the upcoming second integration summit on july 12 is nothing but a farce . betrayed this time round , kenan kolat still has n't decided whether he 'll even attend . together with yasar bilgin , who heads up the council of turkish citizens in german , he feels betrayed by berlin 's latest amendments to the immigration law passed in 2005 . " we are considering whether we will voice our protest at the new changes to the law at the summit or whether we will refuse to appear , " he told spiegel online , stressing that he sees the new law as hostile to turks and unconstitutional . " the government makes out to us that everything is hunky dory , " he said .
" they tell us that we 're making progress on the integration front and then they make a decision completely over our heads .
it 's hypocrisy . " united in anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year 's summit was upbeat anger has united many of the turkish community 's otherwise divided representative groups .
across the board , there is agreement that the government has left them out in the cold . " i am deeply disappointed , " said bekir alboga from the turkish directorate for religious affairs -lrb- ditib -rrb- in an interview with spiegel online .
" this is political duplicity and there is no point taking part in the summit . " " we are not interested in playing bit parts at this meeting and thereby legitimating the law , " he added . he said that his organization would not be attending unless the immigration law is rejected by the german council at the imminent vote . the brunt of alboga 's criticism is directed at the new clause on spousal immigration , which states that a foreigner who wants to bring his wife to germany must be able to prove that she can earn her own living .
were a german national to bring a foreign wife to the country , this would not apply . " at last year 's summit , the government reiterated the importance of talking to us , not about us , " he said .
" but we were never told about the tightening of residency regulations .
we were excluded from these discussions . " taking part , not sitting out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria böhmer the upcoming summit will be led by maria böhmer of the cdu , who is in charge of immigration issues in the government .
she feels that organizations such as those fronted by kolat and alboga have devoted years to securing participation in the integration debate , and that they will undo all the good work by refusing to sit at a table with the chancellor . " it is in the interests of germany 's 2.5 million turks to be represented by these organizations at the summit , " she said . a spokesman at the interior ministry stressed it would be counter-productive for germany 's minorities to express their dissatisfaction with berlin by sitting out the debate . " integration must be based on active participation , not lack of it , " he said . the government estimates that 15 million people living in germany , which has a total population of 82 million , have an immigrant background of some kind - either with roots outside the country or as ethnic germans from the former soviet union . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's leading muslim associations say the government 's new immigration law smacks of hypocrisy , and that berlin has failed to come good on promises made at last year 's integration summit . hailed by the head of germany 's turkish community , kenan kolat , as an " historic day " which ushered in a " new era of immigration policy , " the first ever integration summit held in chancellor angela merkel 's office last summer was broadly seen as a resounding success . but one year on , the euphoria has faded .
the fly in the ointment is the german parliament 's newly approved immigration law , which has angered muslim groups to such an extent that many feel the upcoming second integration summit on july 12 is nothing but a farce . betrayed this time round , kenan kolat still has n't decided whether he 'll even attend . together with yasar bilgin , who heads up the council of turkish citizens in german , he feels betrayed by berlin 's latest amendments to the immigration law passed in 2005 . " we are considering whether we will voice our protest at the new changes to the law at the summit or whether we will refuse to appear , " he told spiegel online , stressing that he sees the new law as hostile to turks and unconstitutional . " the government makes out to us that everything is hunky dory , " he said .
" they tell us that we 're making progress on the integration front and then they make a decision completely over our heads .
it 's hypocrisy . " united in anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year 's summit was upbeat anger has united many of the turkish community 's otherwise divided representative groups .
across the board , there is agreement that the government has left them out in the cold . " i am deeply disappointed , " said bekir alboga from the turkish directorate for religious affairs -lrb- ditib -rrb- in an interview with spiegel online .
" this is political duplicity and there is no point taking part in the summit . " " we are not interested in playing bit parts at this meeting and thereby legitimating the law , " he added . he said that his organization would not be attending unless the immigration law is rejected by the german council at the imminent vote . the brunt of alboga 's criticism is directed at the new clause on spousal immigration , which states that a foreigner who wants to bring his wife to germany must be able to prove that she can earn her own living .
were a german national to bring a foreign wife to the country , this would not apply . " at last year 's summit , the government reiterated the importance of talking to us , not about us , " he said .
" but we were never told about the tightening of residency regulations .
we were excluded from these discussions . " taking part , not sitting out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria böhmer the upcoming summit will be led by maria böhmer of the cdu , who is in charge of immigration issues in the government .
she feels that organizations such as those fronted by kolat and alboga have devoted years to securing participation in the integration debate , and that they will undo all the good work by refusing to sit at a table with the chancellor . " it is in the interests of germany 's 2.5 million turks to be represented by these organizations at the summit , " she said . a spokesman at the interior ministry stressed it would be counter-productive for germany 's minorities to express their dissatisfaction with berlin by sitting out the debate . " integration must be based on active participation , not lack of it , " he said . the government estimates that 15 million people living in germany , which has a total population of 82 million , have an immigrant background of some kind - either with roots outside the country or as ethnic germans from the former soviet union . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

separately , another nuclear power plant in schleswig-holstein , brunsbüttel , was temporarily shut down last thursday about two hours before the krümmel fire because its capacity was overloaded . the incident triggered a fresh national debate about the safety of nuclear energy just days before an annual energy summit in berlin focused on exploring ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb global warming . environmental organization bund demanded the immediate closure of both plants . irregularities discovered greenpeace also accused vattenfall and the local government in kiel of withholding important information on the consequences of the incident .
according to the environmental organization , this was an obvious attempt to avoid conflict at germany 's third annual energy summit in berlin . contrary to initial reports , the fire had in fact led to problems at the plant 's nuclear reactor , the schleswig-holstein state social affairs ministry , which is responsible for the region 's power plants , said in a statement released thursday . last week , local police had stated that the fire , which started when coolant in a large electric power transformer substation ignited due to a short circuit , had been isolated from the atomic reactor . however experts investigating the incident found " several unusual things when the reactor was shut down " including evidence of damage related to the fire .
but they said there was no radiation leak . politicians from germany 's opposition green party as well as some from the ruling christian democratic party have said they want energy company vattenfall to explain why it remained silent for almost a week on the consequences of the incident .
some say vattenfall 's stance is undermining the credibility of the nuclear power industry in germany . vattenfall defends itself bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters dousing the blase at the nuclear plant last week in germany european energy group vattenfall however defended itself , saying it had acted quickly . a company spokesman dismissed the criticism , saying it had provided quick and comprehensive information on the accident to the authorities .

separately , another nuclear power plant in schleswig-holstein , brunsbüttel , was temporarily shut down last thursday about two hours before the krümmel fire because its capacity was overloaded . the incident triggered a fresh national debate about the safety of nuclear energy just days before an annual energy summit in berlin focused on exploring ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb global warming . environmental organization bund demanded the immediate closure of both plants . irregularities discovered greenpeace also accused vattenfall and the local government in kiel of withholding important information on the consequences of the incident .
according to the environmental organization , this was an obvious attempt to avoid conflict at germany 's third annual energy summit in berlin . contrary to initial reports , the fire had in fact led to problems at the plant 's nuclear reactor , the schleswig-holstein state social affairs ministry , which is responsible for the region 's power plants , said in a statement released thursday . last week , local police had stated that the fire , which started when coolant in a large electric power transformer substation ignited due to a short circuit , had been isolated from the atomic reactor . however experts investigating the incident found " several unusual things when the reactor was shut down " including evidence of damage related to the fire .
but they said there was no radiation leak . politicians from germany 's opposition green party as well as some from the ruling christian democratic party have said they want energy company vattenfall to explain why it remained silent for almost a week on the consequences of the incident .
some say vattenfall 's stance is undermining the credibility of the nuclear power industry in germany . vattenfall defends itself bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters dousing the blase at the nuclear plant last week in germany european energy group vattenfall however defended itself , saying it had acted quickly . a company spokesman dismissed the criticism , saying it had provided quick and comprehensive information on the accident to the authorities . " we informed the public immediately , " said ceo bruno thomauske in hamburg wednesday .
" at no point was the public at risk . " " this was nothing to do with the summit , " said oliver breuer from schleswig-holstein 's state social affairs ministry in an interview with spiegel online .
" we have no intention of covering anything up . " nuclear phase-out still an incendiary issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is reluctant to increase its dependancy on russian energy germany has begun a long-term phase-out of its 17 nuclear energy reactors and expects to mothball its last plant around 2020 . the plan was approved by the previous social democrat and green government , but chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives argue that abandoning nuclear energy would seriously undermine the country 's chances of slashing greenhouse gas emissions , as well as increase reliance on russian fossil fuel and make it harder to keep in check energy prices . the european union has set a goal of a 20-percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared with 1990 levels , but germany is aiming for a cut of up to 40 percent . merkel has come under increasing pressure from brussels to renegotiate the phase-out deal . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" sports not violence " is a project based in lower saxony that aims to turn around soccer 's rough-and-ready reputation . with what should be a beautiful game overshadowed in europe by the brutish specter of hooliganism , the organization wants to return good sportsmanship to the pitch .

most would still prefer dependent employment in a country where the pioneering spirit has still not caught on . anja hock-wagner belongs to a dwindling breed of people in germany - those who choose to take a financial risk over the security of a job and set up their own business . despite the high investment involved , hock-wagner , a single mother of four , managed to convince a bank of her dream project of an indoor playground .
she got the necessary financing .
the risk was high .
if she failed , the bank would take her home . but luck was on her side .
the people in this area south of kaiserslautern in rhineland-palatinate took to the us-style playground with its jungle gym and inflatable slides .
hock-wagner is happy and the region is profiting from her idea , as well .
after all , visitors to " meer4kids " come from all over , bringing valuable euros to the area . start-ups crucial for germany 's economy a study published by the government-owned kfw banking group showed a strong decline in business start-ups in 2006 .
last year , the number of people who entered into self-employment by setting up a new business , taking over an existing enterprise or an equity stake dropped by 200,000 to 1.1 million persons . this is the lowest number of business start-ups recorded in germany since kfw began its " start-up monitor " in the year 2000 .
every year , kfw surveys 40,000 randomly selected german residents .
according to kfw , it is the most comprehensive source of information on this sector in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthäus-maier hopes for a turnaround in 2007 ingrid matthäus-maier , spokeswoman of the kfw management board , said the latest figures should be food for thought . " start-ups are important for our economy , " matthäus-maier said at the presentation of the study last week .
for one , they create jobs .
secondly , they had a positive impact on the country 's economy and , therefore , increase germany 's international competitiveness . " heinz klandt , a professor at the prestigious european business school in oestrich-winkel , said it was important for companies to be founded particularly in those sectors with a future . " this will really have a strong impact on the economy and create jobs in growth-oriented sectors , " said klandt , who holds the first chair for entrepreneurship to have been set up in germany in 1998 . according to klandt , more needs to be done to stimulate these sectors . " there need to be more structural changes to develop new sectors , " klandt said .
" the money being sunk into subsidizing coal , for example , is missing in areas such as biotech , nanotechnology or other sectors with a future . " a matter of attitude but german attitudes towards self-employment also play a decisive role .
in comparison to other highly developed economies , such as the united states , there is a pessimistic start-up climate in germany . " our analyses on the influence of personal attitudes show that a positive approach to entrepreneurship , the willingness to take risk and optimism are major prerequisites for successfully starting into self-employment , " matthäus-maier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entrepreneurial spirit can already be learned at an early age but this necessary ideology is missing in germany , said klandt . " there is n't this pioneering spirit here , " he said .
" we do n't have the american dream . "
entrepreneurship did not have the same status in the german education system as it did in other countries , he said . " in finland , for example , the ideas behind entrepreneurship such as creativity or independence are already taught in kindergarten , " klandt said .
" in our education system , these things are pushed back . " germans were also often much more focused on security than risk in their thinking . " we 'd rather buy life insurance policies than stocks , " klandt said .
this was due to the strong safety net which existed in germany . matthäus-maier said a broad package of measures was required to improve the start-up climate in germany .
these needed to be " firmly anchored in the education and training system , " she said .
but society 's attitudes also needed to change , she added . " if we want to have more lively and sustainable start-up activity , we have to improve the subjective attitudes towards entrepreneurship , " matthäus-maier said . hope for 2007 germany 's current economic upswing has also contributed to the dip in self-employment .
many people previously had no other option than to start their own company , since they often had difficulty finding a job . " but during an economic upswing , there are a lot of attractive jobs out there again , " klandt said . but times could change , according to matthäus-maier .
" there is hope that a turnaround will take place in the course of the year , " she said , since the number of planned business start-ups was " extraordinarily high . "
as a result of the current stable upswing , many more people were expected to venture into self-employment in 2007 , she said . " this is urgently required because without strong start-up intensity , and the related creation of jobs and innovation , germany 's economic efficiency might be hurt , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

after all , visitors to " meer4kids " come from all over , bringing valuable euros to the area . start-ups crucial for germany 's economy a study published by the government-owned kfw banking group showed a strong decline in business start-ups in 2006 .
last year , the number of people who entered into self-employment by setting up a new business , taking over an existing enterprise or an equity stake dropped by 200,000 to 1.1 million persons . this is the lowest number of business start-ups recorded in germany since kfw began its " start-up monitor " in the year 2000 .
every year , kfw surveys 40,000 randomly selected german residents .
according to kfw , it is the most comprehensive source of information on this sector in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthäus-maier hopes for a turnaround in 2007 ingrid matthäus-maier , spokeswoman of the kfw management board , said the latest figures should be food for thought . " start-ups are important for our economy , " matthäus-maier said at the presentation of the study last week .
for one , they create jobs .
secondly , they had a positive impact on the country 's economy and , therefore , increase germany 's international competitiveness . " heinz klandt , a professor at the prestigious european business school in oestrich-winkel , said it was important for companies to be founded particularly in those sectors with a future . " this will really have a strong impact on the economy and create jobs in growth-oriented sectors , " said klandt , who holds the first chair for entrepreneurship to have been set up in germany in 1998 . according to klandt , more needs to be done to stimulate these sectors . " there need to be more structural changes to develop new sectors , " klandt said .
" the money being sunk into subsidizing coal , for example , is missing in areas such as biotech , nanotechnology or other sectors with a future . " a matter of attitude but german attitudes towards self-employment also play a decisive role .
in comparison to other highly developed economies , such as the united states , there is a pessimistic start-up climate in germany . " our analyses on the influence of personal attitudes show that a positive approach to entrepreneurship , the willingness to take risk and optimism are major prerequisites for successfully starting into self-employment , " matthäus-maier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entrepreneurial spirit can already be learned at an early age but this necessary ideology is missing in germany , said klandt . " there is n't this pioneering spirit here , " he said .
" we do n't have the american dream . "
entrepreneurship did not have the same status in the german education system as it did in other countries , he said . " in finland , for example , the ideas behind entrepreneurship such as creativity or independence are already taught in kindergarten , " klandt said .
" in our education system , these things are pushed back . " germans were also often much more focused on security than risk in their thinking . " we 'd rather buy life insurance policies than stocks , " klandt said .
this was due to the strong safety net which existed in germany . matthäus-maier said a broad package of measures was required to improve the start-up climate in germany .
these needed to be " firmly anchored in the education and training system , " she said .
but society 's attitudes also needed to change , she added . " if we want to have more lively and sustainable start-up activity , we have to improve the subjective attitudes towards entrepreneurship , " matthäus-maier said . hope for 2007 germany 's current economic upswing has also contributed to the dip in self-employment .
many people previously had no other option than to start their own company , since they often had difficulty finding a job . " but during an economic upswing , there are a lot of attractive jobs out there again , " klandt said . but times could change , according to matthäus-maier .
" there is hope that a turnaround will take place in the course of the year , " she said , since the number of planned business start-ups was " extraordinarily high . "
as a result of the current stable upswing , many more people were expected to venture into self-employment in 2007 , she said . " this is urgently required because without strong start-up intensity , and the related creation of jobs and innovation , germany 's economic efficiency might be hurt , " she said . sabina casagrande send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's leading muslim associations say the government 's new immigration law smacks of hypocrisy , and that berlin has failed to come good on promises made at last year 's integration summit . hailed by the head of germany 's turkish community , kenan kolat , as an " historic day " which ushered in a " new era of immigration policy , " the first ever integration summit held in chancellor angela merkel 's office last summer was broadly seen as a resounding success . but one year on , the euphoria has faded .
the fly in the ointment is the german parliament 's newly approved immigration law , which has angered muslim groups to such an extent that many feel the upcoming second integration summit on july 12 is nothing but a farce . betrayed this time round , kenan kolat still has n't decided whether he 'll even attend . together with yasar bilgin , who heads up the council of turkish citizens in german , he feels betrayed by berlin 's latest amendments to the immigration law passed in 2005 . " we are considering whether we will voice our protest at the new changes to the law at the summit or whether we will refuse to appear , " he told spiegel online , stressing that he sees the new law as hostile to turks and unconstitutional .

" sports not violence " is a project based in lower saxony that aims to turn around soccer 's rough-and-ready reputation . with what should be a beautiful game overshadowed in europe by the brutish specter of hooliganism , the organization wants to return good sportsmanship to the pitch .
its latest attempt , however , failed miserably . in an admirably optimistic spirit , it recently teamed up with the police department in the city of aachen to schedule a goodwill game that was supposed to demonstrate to local kids that despite its tarnished image , playing soccer " is a meaningful way of spending their spare time , " as one policeman poignantly put it . but boys will be boys - and the organizers obviously overestimated the power of good intentions .
the fun soon turned into fisticuffs , with the match fast deteriorating into a punch-up when five players set upon a heckler who protested against a perceived lack of fair play . other players and fans soon waded in to the fray , while the original perpetrators fled the melee leaving mayhem in their wake . an experiment in peace turned into an orgy of violence .
perhaps the next time the project tries to stage of sporting match for peace , the game should be croquet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de immigration -pipe- 05.07.2007 muslim groups theaten to boycott integration summit großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will turkish groups turn their back on the summit ?
germany 's leading muslim associations say the government 's new immigration law smacks of hypocrisy , and that berlin has failed to come good on promises made at last year 's integration summit . hailed by the head of germany 's turkish community , kenan kolat , as an " historic day " which ushered in a " new era of immigration policy , " the first ever integration summit held in chancellor angela merkel 's office last summer was broadly seen as a resounding success . but one year on , the euphoria has faded .
the fly in the ointment is the german parliament 's newly approved immigration law , which has angered muslim groups to such an extent that many feel the upcoming second integration summit on july 12 is nothing but a farce . betrayed this time round , kenan kolat still has n't decided whether he 'll even attend . together with yasar bilgin , who heads up the council of turkish citizens in german , he feels betrayed by berlin 's latest amendments to the immigration law passed in 2005 . " we are considering whether we will voice our protest at the new changes to the law at the summit or whether we will refuse to appear , " he told spiegel online , stressing that he sees the new law as hostile to turks and unconstitutional . " the government makes out to us that everything is hunky dory , " he said .
" they tell us that we 're making progress on the integration front and then they make a decision completely over our heads .
it 's hypocrisy . " united in anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year 's summit was upbeat anger has united many of the turkish community 's otherwise divided representative groups .
across the board , there is agreement that the government has left them out in the cold . " i am deeply disappointed , " said bekir alboga from the turkish directorate for religious affairs -lrb- ditib -rrb- in an interview with spiegel online .
" this is political duplicity and there is no point taking part in the summit . " " we are not interested in playing bit parts at this meeting and thereby legitimating the law , " he added . he said that his organization would not be attending unless the immigration law is rejected by the german council at the imminent vote . the brunt of alboga 's criticism is directed at the new clause on spousal immigration , which states that a foreigner who wants to bring his wife to germany must be able to prove that she can earn her own living .
were a german national to bring a foreign wife to the country , this would not apply . " at last year 's summit , the government reiterated the importance of talking to us , not about us , " he said .
" but we were never told about the tightening of residency regulations .
we were excluded from these discussions . " taking part , not sitting out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria böhmer the upcoming summit will be led by maria böhmer of the cdu , who is in charge of immigration issues in the government .
she feels that organizations such as those fronted by kolat and alboga have devoted years to securing participation in the integration debate , and that they will undo all the good work by refusing to sit at a table with the chancellor . " it is in the interests of germany 's 2.5 million turks to be represented by these organizations at the summit , " she said . a spokesman at the interior ministry stressed it would be counter-productive for germany 's minorities to express their dissatisfaction with berlin by sitting out the debate . " integration must be based on active participation , not lack of it , " he said . the government estimates that 15 million people living in germany , which has a total population of 82 million , have an immigrant background of some kind - either with roots outside the country or as ethnic germans from the former soviet union . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

separately , another nuclear power plant in schleswig-holstein , brunsbüttel , was temporarily shut down last thursday about two hours before the krümmel fire because its capacity was overloaded . the incident triggered a fresh national debate about the safety of nuclear energy just days before an annual energy summit in berlin focused on exploring ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb global warming . environmental organization bund demanded the immediate closure of both plants . irregularities discovered greenpeace also accused vattenfall and the local government in kiel of withholding important information on the consequences of the incident .
according to the environmental organization , this was an obvious attempt to avoid conflict at germany 's third annual energy summit in berlin . contrary to initial reports , the fire had in fact led to problems at the plant 's nuclear reactor , the schleswig-holstein state social affairs ministry , which is responsible for the region 's power plants , said in a statement released thursday . last week , local police had stated that the fire , which started when coolant in a large electric power transformer substation ignited due to a short circuit , had been isolated from the atomic reactor . however experts investigating the incident found " several unusual things when the reactor was shut down " including evidence of damage related to the fire .
but they said there was no radiation leak . politicians from germany 's opposition green party as well as some from the ruling christian democratic party have said they want energy company vattenfall to explain why it remained silent for almost a week on the consequences of the incident .

separately , another nuclear power plant in schleswig-holstein , brunsbüttel , was temporarily shut down last thursday about two hours before the krümmel fire because its capacity was overloaded . the incident triggered a fresh national debate about the safety of nuclear energy just days before an annual energy summit in berlin focused on exploring ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb global warming . environmental organization bund demanded the immediate closure of both plants . irregularities discovered greenpeace also accused vattenfall and the local government in kiel of withholding important information on the consequences of the incident .
according to the environmental organization , this was an obvious attempt to avoid conflict at germany 's third annual energy summit in berlin . contrary to initial reports , the fire had in fact led to problems at the plant 's nuclear reactor , the schleswig-holstein state social affairs ministry , which is responsible for the region 's power plants , said in a statement released thursday . last week , local police had stated that the fire , which started when coolant in a large electric power transformer substation ignited due to a short circuit , had been isolated from the atomic reactor . however experts investigating the incident found " several unusual things when the reactor was shut down " including evidence of damage related to the fire .
but they said there was no radiation leak . politicians from germany 's opposition green party as well as some from the ruling christian democratic party have said they want energy company vattenfall to explain why it remained silent for almost a week on the consequences of the incident .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 05.07.2007 readers have harsh words for cruise and scientology großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : readers had little sympathy for cruise 's commitment to scientology tom cruise 's new movie , which the german government has not permitted him to film inside the defense ministry , continues to stir up controversy in germany and among our readers . the following comments reflect the views of dw-world.de readers .
not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . scientology and tom cruise should stay in the united states .
tom cruise is an actor but also a flamboyant scientologist .
also , his sexual orientation is a matter of dispute .
scientologists believe that mankind originates from outer space aliens .
there is a special sense of weirdness about tom cruise and other actors who belong to the same cult .
granting tax-free status to a cult is nonsense . - evi pickavance , usa i suggest researchers and media do their homework on tom cruise 's so-called religion , scientology , which is solidly based solely on l. ron hubbard - an american college dropout , moderately successful pulp fiction writer , questionable us navy officer , and scientology movement founder .
sidestep the name calling and please engage in a debate with hubbard 's bad ideas .
his followers will not be shaken of their glowing admiration of hubbard and their " religion " until the bad ideas of scientology , which are all entirely hubbard 's fault , are inspected and debated . - chuck beatty , usa tom cruise seems to lose more friends then he 's able to make .
maybe he should follow the saying , " you can win more friends with your ears than with your mouth . "
i 'm not saying that cruise is an " evil " man out to hurt people , but i do feel that he carries a certain arrogance , control , and opens his mouth at the wrong time for the wrong reason .
as for germany , i can imagine that is not the feeling they want for have for an actor portraying count claus schenk von stauffenberg . - stayduhar , usa scientology is a cult , not a valid religion .
it has engaged in criminal fraud and deceit and hides behind first amendment rights .
i have been involved with that cult in the past , so i know its evils first hand .
it is no secret why the us federal and state governments have charged it with crimes and have imposed taxes on its profiteering .
the government of germany should ban its evil activities . - rick , usa smoking on tv bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would censorship of smoking scenes only make cigarettes more attractive ?
i live in a country were media , including tv , is highly regulated and censored .
smoking , drinking and any kind of nudity -lrb- even perceived -rrb- is blurred , blackened out or otherwise censored .
does it reduce smoking and drinking ?
does it give our young people better role models ?
no .
as far as i see , the old saying of " what 's forbidden is just more attractive " seems to be true .
please do not patronize viewers ; they have their own opinion about what is suitable and what is not . - siegfried gohlke , thailand people that appeared on tv are role models for good and bad .
they should ban it -lrb- smoking on television -rrb- . - claudia molina , argentina compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drug commissioner : german tv should stub out smoking germany 's federal drug commissioner hopes that tv stations will join her battle against smoking .

" we will not solve all the doping problems in sport with this law but we do make a clear statement that we will not surrender , " said federal minister of the interior wolfgang schäuble . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schäuble said the law made a clear statement " we have targeted these substances because their use has made doping highly criminalized , " he added .
" with the new laws , the federal criminal police office -lrb- bka -rrb- can intervene and surveillance operations can be used to fight these criminal structures . "

germany 's leading muslim associations say the government 's new immigration law smacks of hypocrisy , and that berlin has failed to come good on promises made at last year 's integration summit . hailed by the head of germany 's turkish community , kenan kolat , as an " historic day " which ushered in a " new era of immigration policy , " the first ever integration summit held in chancellor angela merkel 's office last summer was broadly seen as a resounding success . but one year on , the euphoria has faded .
the fly in the ointment is the german parliament 's newly approved immigration law , which has angered muslim groups to such an extent that many feel the upcoming second integration summit on july 12 is nothing but a farce . betrayed this time round , kenan kolat still has n't decided whether he 'll even attend . together with yasar bilgin , who heads up the council of turkish citizens in german , he feels betrayed by berlin 's latest amendments to the immigration law passed in 2005 . " we are considering whether we will voice our protest at the new changes to the law at the summit or whether we will refuse to appear , " he told spiegel online , stressing that he sees the new law as hostile to turks and unconstitutional . " the government makes out to us that everything is hunky dory , " he said .
" they tell us that we 're making progress on the integration front and then they make a decision completely over our heads .
it 's hypocrisy . " united in anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year 's summit was upbeat anger has united many of the turkish community 's otherwise divided representative groups .
across the board , there is agreement that the government has left them out in the cold . " i am deeply disappointed , " said bekir alboga from the turkish directorate for religious affairs -lrb- ditib -rrb- in an interview with spiegel online .
" this is political duplicity and there is no point taking part in the summit .

germany 's leading muslim associations say the government 's new immigration law smacks of hypocrisy , and that berlin has failed to come good on promises made at last year 's integration summit . hailed by the head of germany 's turkish community , kenan kolat , as an " historic day " which ushered in a " new era of immigration policy , " the first ever integration summit held in chancellor angela merkel 's office last summer was broadly seen as a resounding success . but one year on , the euphoria has faded .
the fly in the ointment is the german parliament 's newly approved immigration law , which has angered muslim groups to such an extent that many feel the upcoming second integration summit on july 12 is nothing but a farce . betrayed this time round , kenan kolat still has n't decided whether he 'll even attend . together with yasar bilgin , who heads up the council of turkish citizens in german , he feels betrayed by berlin 's latest amendments to the immigration law passed in 2005 . " we are considering whether we will voice our protest at the new changes to the law at the summit or whether we will refuse to appear , " he told spiegel online , stressing that he sees the new law as hostile to turks and unconstitutional . " the government makes out to us that everything is hunky dory , " he said .
" they tell us that we 're making progress on the integration front and then they make a decision completely over our heads .
it 's hypocrisy . " united in anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year 's summit was upbeat anger has united many of the turkish community 's otherwise divided representative groups .
across the board , there is agreement that the government has left them out in the cold . " i am deeply disappointed , " said bekir alboga from the turkish directorate for religious affairs -lrb- ditib -rrb- in an interview with spiegel online .
" this is political duplicity and there is no point taking part in the summit . " " we are not interested in playing bit parts at this meeting and thereby legitimating the law , " he added . he said that his organization would not be attending unless the immigration law is rejected by the german council at the imminent vote . the brunt of alboga 's criticism is directed at the new clause on spousal immigration , which states that a foreigner who wants to bring his wife to germany must be able to prove that she can earn her own living .

most would still prefer dependent employment in a country where the pioneering spirit has still not caught on . anja hock-wagner belongs to a dwindling breed of people in germany - those who choose to take a financial risk over the security of a job and set up their own business . despite the high investment involved , hock-wagner , a single mother of four , managed to convince a bank of her dream project of an indoor playground .
she got the necessary financing .
the risk was high .
if she failed , the bank would take her home . but luck was on her side .
the people in this area south of kaiserslautern in rhineland-palatinate took to the us-style playground with its jungle gym and inflatable slides .
hock-wagner is happy and the region is profiting from her idea , as well .
after all , visitors to " meer4kids " come from all over , bringing valuable euros to the area . start-ups crucial for germany 's economy a study published by the government-owned kfw banking group showed a strong decline in business start-ups in 2006 .
last year , the number of people who entered into self-employment by setting up a new business , taking over an existing enterprise or an equity stake dropped by 200,000 to 1.1 million persons . this is the lowest number of business start-ups recorded in germany since kfw began its " start-up monitor " in the year 2000 .
every year , kfw surveys 40,000 randomly selected german residents .
according to kfw , it is the most comprehensive source of information on this sector in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthäus-maier hopes for a turnaround in 2007 ingrid matthäus-maier , spokeswoman of the kfw management board , said the latest figures should be food for thought . " start-ups are important for our economy , " matthäus-maier said at the presentation of the study last week .
for one , they create jobs .
secondly , they had a positive impact on the country 's economy and , therefore , increase germany 's international competitiveness . " heinz klandt , a professor at the prestigious european business school in oestrich-winkel , said it was important for companies to be founded particularly in those sectors with a future . " this will really have a strong impact on the economy and create jobs in growth-oriented sectors , " said klandt , who holds the first chair for entrepreneurship to have been set up in germany in 1998 . according to klandt , more needs to be done to stimulate these sectors .

most would still prefer dependent employment in a country where the pioneering spirit has still not caught on . anja hock-wagner belongs to a dwindling breed of people in germany - those who choose to take a financial risk over the security of a job and set up their own business . despite the high investment involved , hock-wagner , a single mother of four , managed to convince a bank of her dream project of an indoor playground .
she got the necessary financing .
the risk was high .
if she failed , the bank would take her home . but luck was on her side .
the people in this area south of kaiserslautern in rhineland-palatinate took to the us-style playground with its jungle gym and inflatable slides .
hock-wagner is happy and the region is profiting from her idea , as well .
after all , visitors to " meer4kids " come from all over , bringing valuable euros to the area . start-ups crucial for germany 's economy a study published by the government-owned kfw banking group showed a strong decline in business start-ups in 2006 .
last year , the number of people who entered into self-employment by setting up a new business , taking over an existing enterprise or an equity stake dropped by 200,000 to 1.1 million persons . this is the lowest number of business start-ups recorded in germany since kfw began its " start-up monitor " in the year 2000 .
every year , kfw surveys 40,000 randomly selected german residents .
according to kfw , it is the most comprehensive source of information on this sector in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthäus-maier hopes for a turnaround in 2007 ingrid matthäus-maier , spokeswoman of the kfw management board , said the latest figures should be food for thought . " start-ups are important for our economy , " matthäus-maier said at the presentation of the study last week .
for one , they create jobs .
secondly , they had a positive impact on the country 's economy and , therefore , increase germany 's international competitiveness . " heinz klandt , a professor at the prestigious european business school in oestrich-winkel , said it was important for companies to be founded particularly in those sectors with a future . " this will really have a strong impact on the economy and create jobs in growth-oriented sectors , " said klandt , who holds the first chair for entrepreneurship to have been set up in germany in 1998 . according to klandt , more needs to be done to stimulate these sectors . " there need to be more structural changes to develop new sectors , " klandt said .
" the money being sunk into subsidizing coal , for example , is missing in areas such as biotech , nanotechnology or other sectors with a future . " a matter of attitude but german attitudes towards self-employment also play a decisive role .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . scientology and tom cruise should stay in the united states .
tom cruise is an actor but also a flamboyant scientologist .
also , his sexual orientation is a matter of dispute .
scientologists believe that mankind originates from outer space aliens .
there is a special sense of weirdness about tom cruise and other actors who belong to the same cult .
granting tax-free status to a cult is nonsense . - evi pickavance , usa i suggest researchers and media do their homework on tom cruise 's so-called religion , scientology , which is solidly based solely on l. ron hubbard - an american college dropout , moderately successful pulp fiction writer , questionable us navy officer , and scientology movement founder .
sidestep the name calling and please engage in a debate with hubbard 's bad ideas .
his followers will not be shaken of their glowing admiration of hubbard and their " religion " until the bad ideas of scientology , which are all entirely hubbard 's fault , are inspected and debated . - chuck beatty , usa tom cruise seems to lose more friends then he 's able to make .
maybe he should follow the saying , " you can win more friends with your ears than with your mouth . "
i 'm not saying that cruise is an " evil " man out to hurt people , but i do feel that he carries a certain arrogance , control , and opens his mouth at the wrong time for the wrong reason .
as for germany , i can imagine that is not the feeling they want for have for an actor portraying count claus schenk von stauffenberg . - stayduhar , usa scientology is a cult , not a valid religion .
it has engaged in criminal fraud and deceit and hides behind first amendment rights .
i have been involved with that cult in the past , so i know its evils first hand .
it is no secret why the us federal and state governments have charged it with crimes and have imposed taxes on its profiteering .
the government of germany should ban its evil activities . - rick , usa smoking on tv bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would censorship of smoking scenes only make cigarettes more attractive ?
i live in a country were media , including tv , is highly regulated and censored .
smoking , drinking and any kind of nudity -lrb- even perceived -rrb- is blurred , blackened out or otherwise censored .
does it reduce smoking and drinking ?
does it give our young people better role models ?
no .
as far as i see , the old saying of " what 's forbidden is just more attractive " seems to be true .
please do not patronize viewers ; they have their own opinion about what is suitable and what is not . - siegfried gohlke , thailand people that appeared on tv are role models for good and bad .
they should ban it -lrb- smoking on television -rrb- . - claudia molina , argentina compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drug commissioner : german tv should stub out smoking germany 's federal drug commissioner hopes that tv stations will join her battle against smoking .
she says children and young people are particularly tempted to take up the habit by smoking scenes in films and on tv .
-lrb- 03.07.2007 -rrb- oscar winner leads voices criticizing germany over cruise film a german government decision to prevent hollywood star tom cruise from filming scenes for his upcoming movie about a german aristocrat behind a daring plot to kill hitler has drawn criticism from a number of quarters .

separately , another nuclear power plant in schleswig-holstein , brunsbüttel , was temporarily shut down last thursday about two hours before the krümmel fire because its capacity was overloaded . the incident triggered a fresh national debate about the safety of nuclear energy just days before an annual energy summit in berlin focused on exploring ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb global warming . environmental organization bund demanded the immediate closure of both plants . irregularities discovered greenpeace also accused vattenfall and the local government in kiel of withholding important information on the consequences of the incident .
according to the environmental organization , this was an obvious attempt to avoid conflict at germany 's third annual energy summit in berlin . contrary to initial reports , the fire had in fact led to problems at the plant 's nuclear reactor , the schleswig-holstein state social affairs ministry , which is responsible for the region 's power plants , said in a statement released thursday . last week , local police had stated that the fire , which started when coolant in a large electric power transformer substation ignited due to a short circuit , had been isolated from the atomic reactor . however experts investigating the incident found " several unusual things when the reactor was shut down " including evidence of damage related to the fire .

separately , another nuclear power plant in schleswig-holstein , brunsbüttel , was temporarily shut down last thursday about two hours before the krümmel fire because its capacity was overloaded . the incident triggered a fresh national debate about the safety of nuclear energy just days before an annual energy summit in berlin focused on exploring ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb global warming . environmental organization bund demanded the immediate closure of both plants . irregularities discovered greenpeace also accused vattenfall and the local government in kiel of withholding important information on the consequences of the incident .
according to the environmental organization , this was an obvious attempt to avoid conflict at germany 's third annual energy summit in berlin . contrary to initial reports , the fire had in fact led to problems at the plant 's nuclear reactor , the schleswig-holstein state social affairs ministry , which is responsible for the region 's power plants , said in a statement released thursday . last week , local police had stated that the fire , which started when coolant in a large electric power transformer substation ignited due to a short circuit , had been isolated from the atomic reactor . however experts investigating the incident found " several unusual things when the reactor was shut down " including evidence of damage related to the fire .
but they said there was no radiation leak . politicians from germany 's opposition green party as well as some from the ruling christian democratic party have said they want energy company vattenfall to explain why it remained silent for almost a week on the consequences of the incident .
some say vattenfall 's stance is undermining the credibility of the nuclear power industry in germany . vattenfall defends itself bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters dousing the blase at the nuclear plant last week in germany european energy group vattenfall however defended itself , saying it had acted quickly . a company spokesman dismissed the criticism , saying it had provided quick and comprehensive information on the accident to the authorities . " we informed the public immediately , " said ceo bruno thomauske in hamburg wednesday .
" at no point was the public at risk . " " this was nothing to do with the summit , " said oliver breuer from schleswig-holstein 's state social affairs ministry in an interview with spiegel online .

germany 's leading muslim associations say the government 's new immigration law smacks of hypocrisy , and that berlin has failed to come good on promises made at last year 's integration summit . hailed by the head of germany 's turkish community , kenan kolat , as an " historic day " which ushered in a " new era of immigration policy , " the first ever integration summit held in chancellor angela merkel 's office last summer was broadly seen as a resounding success . but one year on , the euphoria has faded .
the fly in the ointment is the german parliament 's newly approved immigration law , which has angered muslim groups to such an extent that many feel the upcoming second integration summit on july 12 is nothing but a farce . betrayed this time round , kenan kolat still has n't decided whether he 'll even attend . together with yasar bilgin , who heads up the council of turkish citizens in german , he feels betrayed by berlin 's latest amendments to the immigration law passed in 2005 . " we are considering whether we will voice our protest at the new changes to the law at the summit or whether we will refuse to appear , " he told spiegel online , stressing that he sees the new law as hostile to turks and unconstitutional . " the government makes out to us that everything is hunky dory , " he said .
" they tell us that we 're making progress on the integration front and then they make a decision completely over our heads .
it 's hypocrisy . " united in anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year 's summit was upbeat anger has united many of the turkish community 's otherwise divided representative groups .

" this is political duplicity and there is no point taking part in the summit . " " we are not interested in playing bit parts at this meeting and thereby legitimating the law , " he added . he said that his organization would not be attending unless the immigration law is rejected by the german council at the imminent vote . the brunt of alboga 's criticism is directed at the new clause on spousal immigration , which states that a foreigner who wants to bring his wife to germany must be able to prove that she can earn her own living .
were a german national to bring a foreign wife to the country , this would not apply . " at last year 's summit , the government reiterated the importance of talking to us , not about us , " he said .

germany 's leading muslim associations say the government 's new immigration law smacks of hypocrisy , and that berlin has failed to come good on promises made at last year 's integration summit . hailed by the head of germany 's turkish community , kenan kolat , as an " historic day " which ushered in a " new era of immigration policy , " the first ever integration summit held in chancellor angela merkel 's office last summer was broadly seen as a resounding success . but one year on , the euphoria has faded .
the fly in the ointment is the german parliament 's newly approved immigration law , which has angered muslim groups to such an extent that many feel the upcoming second integration summit on july 12 is nothing but a farce . betrayed this time round , kenan kolat still has n't decided whether he 'll even attend . together with yasar bilgin , who heads up the council of turkish citizens in german , he feels betrayed by berlin 's latest amendments to the immigration law passed in 2005 . " we are considering whether we will voice our protest at the new changes to the law at the summit or whether we will refuse to appear , " he told spiegel online , stressing that he sees the new law as hostile to turks and unconstitutional . " the government makes out to us that everything is hunky dory , " he said .
" they tell us that we 're making progress on the integration front and then they make a decision completely over our heads .
it 's hypocrisy . " united in anger bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : last year 's summit was upbeat anger has united many of the turkish community 's otherwise divided representative groups .
across the board , there is agreement that the government has left them out in the cold . " i am deeply disappointed , " said bekir alboga from the turkish directorate for religious affairs -lrb- ditib -rrb- in an interview with spiegel online .
" this is political duplicity and there is no point taking part in the summit . " " we are not interested in playing bit parts at this meeting and thereby legitimating the law , " he added . he said that his organization would not be attending unless the immigration law is rejected by the german council at the imminent vote . the brunt of alboga 's criticism is directed at the new clause on spousal immigration , which states that a foreigner who wants to bring his wife to germany must be able to prove that she can earn her own living .
were a german national to bring a foreign wife to the country , this would not apply . " at last year 's summit , the government reiterated the importance of talking to us , not about us , " he said .
" but we were never told about the tightening of residency regulations .
we were excluded from these discussions . " taking part , not sitting out bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : maria böhmer the upcoming summit will be led by maria böhmer of the cdu , who is in charge of immigration issues in the government .
she feels that organizations such as those fronted by kolat and alboga have devoted years to securing participation in the integration debate , and that they will undo all the good work by refusing to sit at a table with the chancellor . " it is in the interests of germany 's 2.5 million turks to be represented by these organizations at the summit , " she said . a spokesman at the interior ministry stressed it would be counter-productive for germany 's minorities to express their dissatisfaction with berlin by sitting out the debate . " integration must be based on active participation , not lack of it , " he said . the government estimates that 15 million people living in germany , which has a total population of 82 million , have an immigrant background of some kind - either with roots outside the country or as ethnic germans from the former soviet union . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . scientology and tom cruise should stay in the united states .
tom cruise is an actor but also a flamboyant scientologist .
also , his sexual orientation is a matter of dispute .
scientologists believe that mankind originates from outer space aliens .
there is a special sense of weirdness about tom cruise and other actors who belong to the same cult .
granting tax-free status to a cult is nonsense . - evi pickavance , usa i suggest researchers and media do their homework on tom cruise 's so-called religion , scientology , which is solidly based solely on l. ron hubbard - an american college dropout , moderately successful pulp fiction writer , questionable us navy officer , and scientology movement founder .
sidestep the name calling and please engage in a debate with hubbard 's bad ideas .
his followers will not be shaken of their glowing admiration of hubbard and their " religion " until the bad ideas of scientology , which are all entirely hubbard 's fault , are inspected and debated . - chuck beatty , usa tom cruise seems to lose more friends then he 's able to make .
maybe he should follow the saying , " you can win more friends with your ears than with your mouth . "
i 'm not saying that cruise is an " evil " man out to hurt people , but i do feel that he carries a certain arrogance , control , and opens his mouth at the wrong time for the wrong reason .
as for germany , i can imagine that is not the feeling they want for have for an actor portraying count claus schenk von stauffenberg . - stayduhar , usa scientology is a cult , not a valid religion .
it has engaged in criminal fraud and deceit and hides behind first amendment rights .
i have been involved with that cult in the past , so i know its evils first hand .
it is no secret why the us federal and state governments have charged it with crimes and have imposed taxes on its profiteering .
the government of germany should ban its evil activities . - rick , usa smoking on tv bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would censorship of smoking scenes only make cigarettes more attractive ?
i live in a country were media , including tv , is highly regulated and censored .
smoking , drinking and any kind of nudity -lrb- even perceived -rrb- is blurred , blackened out or otherwise censored .
does it reduce smoking and drinking ?
does it give our young people better role models ?
no .
as far as i see , the old saying of " what 's forbidden is just more attractive " seems to be true .
please do not patronize viewers ; they have their own opinion about what is suitable and what is not . - siegfried gohlke , thailand people that appeared on tv are role models for good and bad .

most would still prefer dependent employment in a country where the pioneering spirit has still not caught on . anja hock-wagner belongs to a dwindling breed of people in germany - those who choose to take a financial risk over the security of a job and set up their own business . despite the high investment involved , hock-wagner , a single mother of four , managed to convince a bank of her dream project of an indoor playground .
she got the necessary financing .
the risk was high .
if she failed , the bank would take her home . but luck was on her side .
the people in this area south of kaiserslautern in rhineland-palatinate took to the us-style playground with its jungle gym and inflatable slides .
hock-wagner is happy and the region is profiting from her idea , as well .
after all , visitors to " meer4kids " come from all over , bringing valuable euros to the area . start-ups crucial for germany 's economy a study published by the government-owned kfw banking group showed a strong decline in business start-ups in 2006 .
last year , the number of people who entered into self-employment by setting up a new business , taking over an existing enterprise or an equity stake dropped by 200,000 to 1.1 million persons . this is the lowest number of business start-ups recorded in germany since kfw began its " start-up monitor " in the year 2000 .
every year , kfw surveys 40,000 randomly selected german residents .
according to kfw , it is the most comprehensive source of information on this sector in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : matthäus-maier hopes for a turnaround in 2007 ingrid matthäus-maier , spokeswoman of the kfw management board , said the latest figures should be food for thought . " start-ups are important for our economy , " matthäus-maier said at the presentation of the study last week .
for one , they create jobs .
secondly , they had a positive impact on the country 's economy and , therefore , increase germany 's international competitiveness . " heinz klandt , a professor at the prestigious european business school in oestrich-winkel , said it was important for companies to be founded particularly in those sectors with a future . " this will really have a strong impact on the economy and create jobs in growth-oriented sectors , " said klandt , who holds the first chair for entrepreneurship to have been set up in germany in 1998 . according to klandt , more needs to be done to stimulate these sectors . " there need to be more structural changes to develop new sectors , " klandt said .
" the money being sunk into subsidizing coal , for example , is missing in areas such as biotech , nanotechnology or other sectors with a future . " a matter of attitude but german attitudes towards self-employment also play a decisive role .
in comparison to other highly developed economies , such as the united states , there is a pessimistic start-up climate in germany . " our analyses on the influence of personal attitudes show that a positive approach to entrepreneurship , the willingness to take risk and optimism are major prerequisites for successfully starting into self-employment , " matthäus-maier said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the entrepreneurial spirit can already be learned at an early age but this necessary ideology is missing in germany , said klandt . " there is n't this pioneering spirit here , " he said .
" we do n't have the american dream . "
entrepreneurship did not have the same status in the german education system as it did in other countries , he said . " in finland , for example , the ideas behind entrepreneurship such as creativity or independence are already taught in kindergarten , " klandt said .

not all reader comments have been published .
dw-world.de reserves the right to edit for length and appropriateness of content . scientology and tom cruise should stay in the united states .
tom cruise is an actor but also a flamboyant scientologist .
also , his sexual orientation is a matter of dispute .
scientologists believe that mankind originates from outer space aliens .
there is a special sense of weirdness about tom cruise and other actors who belong to the same cult .
granting tax-free status to a cult is nonsense . - evi pickavance , usa i suggest researchers and media do their homework on tom cruise 's so-called religion , scientology , which is solidly based solely on l. ron hubbard - an american college dropout , moderately successful pulp fiction writer , questionable us navy officer , and scientology movement founder .
sidestep the name calling and please engage in a debate with hubbard 's bad ideas .
his followers will not be shaken of their glowing admiration of hubbard and their " religion " until the bad ideas of scientology , which are all entirely hubbard 's fault , are inspected and debated . - chuck beatty , usa tom cruise seems to lose more friends then he 's able to make .
maybe he should follow the saying , " you can win more friends with your ears than with your mouth . "
i 'm not saying that cruise is an " evil " man out to hurt people , but i do feel that he carries a certain arrogance , control , and opens his mouth at the wrong time for the wrong reason .
as for germany , i can imagine that is not the feeling they want for have for an actor portraying count claus schenk von stauffenberg . - stayduhar , usa scientology is a cult , not a valid religion .
it has engaged in criminal fraud and deceit and hides behind first amendment rights .
i have been involved with that cult in the past , so i know its evils first hand .
it is no secret why the us federal and state governments have charged it with crimes and have imposed taxes on its profiteering .
the government of germany should ban its evil activities . - rick , usa smoking on tv bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : would censorship of smoking scenes only make cigarettes more attractive ?
i live in a country were media , including tv , is highly regulated and censored .
smoking , drinking and any kind of nudity -lrb- even perceived -rrb- is blurred , blackened out or otherwise censored .
does it reduce smoking and drinking ?
does it give our young people better role models ?
no .
as far as i see , the old saying of " what 's forbidden is just more attractive " seems to be true .
please do not patronize viewers ; they have their own opinion about what is suitable and what is not . - siegfried gohlke , thailand people that appeared on tv are role models for good and bad .
they should ban it -lrb- smoking on television -rrb- . - claudia molina , argentina compiled by dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de drug commissioner : german tv should stub out smoking germany 's federal drug commissioner hopes that tv stations will join her battle against smoking .

" sports not violence " is a project based in lower saxony that aims to turn around soccer 's rough-and-ready reputation . with what should be a beautiful game overshadowed in europe by the brutish specter of hooliganism , the organization wants to return good sportsmanship to the pitch .
its latest attempt , however , failed miserably . in an admirably optimistic spirit , it recently teamed up with the police department in the city of aachen to schedule a goodwill game that was supposed to demonstrate to local kids that despite its tarnished image , playing soccer " is a meaningful way of spending their spare time , " as one policeman poignantly put it . but boys will be boys - and the organizers obviously overestimated the power of good intentions .
the fun soon turned into fisticuffs , with the match fast deteriorating into a punch-up when five players set upon a heckler who protested against a perceived lack of fair play . other players and fans soon waded in to the fray , while the original perpetrators fled the melee leaving mayhem in their wake . an experiment in peace turned into an orgy of violence .
perhaps the next time the project tries to stage of sporting match for peace , the game should be croquet .

separately , another nuclear power plant in schleswig-holstein , brunsbüttel , was temporarily shut down last thursday about two hours before the krümmel fire because its capacity was overloaded . the incident triggered a fresh national debate about the safety of nuclear energy just days before an annual energy summit in berlin focused on exploring ways to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and curb global warming . environmental organization bund demanded the immediate closure of both plants . irregularities discovered greenpeace also accused vattenfall and the local government in kiel of withholding important information on the consequences of the incident .
according to the environmental organization , this was an obvious attempt to avoid conflict at germany 's third annual energy summit in berlin . contrary to initial reports , the fire had in fact led to problems at the plant 's nuclear reactor , the schleswig-holstein state social affairs ministry , which is responsible for the region 's power plants , said in a statement released thursday . last week , local police had stated that the fire , which started when coolant in a large electric power transformer substation ignited due to a short circuit , had been isolated from the atomic reactor . however experts investigating the incident found " several unusual things when the reactor was shut down " including evidence of damage related to the fire .
but they said there was no radiation leak . politicians from germany 's opposition green party as well as some from the ruling christian democratic party have said they want energy company vattenfall to explain why it remained silent for almost a week on the consequences of the incident .
some say vattenfall 's stance is undermining the credibility of the nuclear power industry in germany . vattenfall defends itself bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : firefighters dousing the blase at the nuclear plant last week in germany european energy group vattenfall however defended itself , saying it had acted quickly . a company spokesman dismissed the criticism , saying it had provided quick and comprehensive information on the accident to the authorities . " we informed the public immediately , " said ceo bruno thomauske in hamburg wednesday .
" at no point was the public at risk . " " this was nothing to do with the summit , " said oliver breuer from schleswig-holstein 's state social affairs ministry in an interview with spiegel online .
" we have no intention of covering anything up . " nuclear phase-out still an incendiary issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is reluctant to increase its dependancy on russian energy germany has begun a long-term phase-out of its 17 nuclear energy reactors and expects to mothball its last plant around 2020 . the plan was approved by the previous social democrat and green government , but chancellor angela merkel 's conservatives argue that abandoning nuclear energy would seriously undermine the country 's chances of slashing greenhouse gas emissions , as well as increase reliance on russian fossil fuel and make it harder to keep in check energy prices . the european union has set a goal of a 20-percent cut in greenhouse gas emissions by 2020 compared with 1990 levels , but germany is aiming for a cut of up to 40 percent . merkel has come under increasing pressure from brussels to renegotiate the phase-out deal . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" sports not violence " is a project based in lower saxony that aims to turn around soccer 's rough-and-ready reputation . with what should be a beautiful game overshadowed in europe by the brutish specter of hooliganism , the organization wants to return good sportsmanship to the pitch .
its latest attempt , however , failed miserably . in an admirably optimistic spirit , it recently teamed up with the police department in the city of aachen to schedule a goodwill game that was supposed to demonstrate to local kids that despite its tarnished image , playing soccer " is a meaningful way of spending their spare time , " as one policeman poignantly put it . but boys will be boys - and the organizers obviously overestimated the power of good intentions .
the fun soon turned into fisticuffs , with the match fast deteriorating into a punch-up when five players set upon a heckler who protested against a perceived lack of fair play . other players and fans soon waded in to the fray , while the original perpetrators fled the melee leaving mayhem in their wake . an experiment in peace turned into an orgy of violence .
perhaps the next time the project tries to stage of sporting match for peace , the game should be croquet .

ten terror suspects placed under the measures - at least two of whom are on the run - will argue they violate their rights to liberty and a fair trial .
five law lords will also consider home secretary jacqui smith 's appeal against a ruling which said orders imposed on six iraqis breached their human rights .
control orders place terror suspects under curfews of up to 18 hours a day .
opponents say they amount to " virtual house arrest " and are often based on evidence which is not made public .
eric metcalfe , of human rights and law reform organisation justice , said : " we can not allow the fight against terrorism to compromise basic fairness .
" no-one should be subject to virtual house arrest without knowing the evidence against him and being able to challenge it in a fair and open manner . "
' not rigorous ' counter-terrorism experts have urged the government to prosecute more terrorism suspects rather than over-use control orders .
among them is the government 's own independent terror watchdog lord carlile .
labelling people as terrorists and leaving them in the community makes a mockery of security james welch , liberty earlier this week , home office minister tony mcnulty said the control order system might be " inappropriate " .
" it may be that we have n't thought in rigorous enough terms on how we capture these individuals under the law , " mr mcnulty said .
the six iraqis won a victory in the court of appeal last year when it was ruled that control orders placed on them were incompatible with article 5 of the european convention on human rights .

" labelling people as terrorists and leaving them in the community makes a mockery of security .

control orders were introduced in 2005 after law lords ruled it was unlawful to incarcerate , without trial , terror suspects who could not be prosecuted or deported because of concerns over their human rights .
the home office has said seven out of 17 individuals currently on control orders have absconded , although one has since handed himself in .
the judges , headed by lord bingham of cornhill , are expected to deliberate for six days .

ten terror suspects placed under the measures - at least two of whom are on the run - will argue they violate their rights to liberty and a fair trial .
five law lords will also consider home secretary jacqui smith 's appeal against a ruling which said orders imposed on six iraqis breached their human rights .
control orders place terror suspects under curfews of up to 18 hours a day .
opponents say they amount to " virtual house arrest " and are often based on evidence which is not made public .
eric metcalfe , of human rights and law reform organisation justice , said : " we can not allow the fight against terrorism to compromise basic fairness .
" no-one should be subject to virtual house arrest without knowing the evidence against him and being able to challenge it in a fair and open manner . "
' not rigorous ' counter-terrorism experts have urged the government to prosecute more terrorism suspects rather than over-use control orders .
among them is the government 's own independent terror watchdog lord carlile .

an expert report from health commission wales recommended one site for brain surgery in south wales based in cardiff .
but health minister edwina hart has now announced she would keep the unit at morriston hospital in swansea as well .
consultant neurosurgeon richard hatfield said the move was detrimental to the needs of patients and staff .
mr hatfield , who works at university hospital wales cardiff , said he thought it was " very bad news " .
" we have two units which are non-viable in today 's terms and to try and keep them both open will mean that it 's almost certain that eventually , both will fail , " he said .
protesters have held marches opposed to the closure of morriston " the failure to organise neurosurgery on a proper footing now will mean that it will have no long-term future . "
he said politicians were not prepared to face reality and consolidate services because it would be " a very unpopular decision " .
" mainstream neurosurgery has to be consolidated in bigger centres because you do not have the critical mass in a small centre to provide a safe , effective service . "
he added that there was a " real risk " the decision could result in the loss of all neurosurgery from south wales .
campaign neurosurgery treats disorders of the nervous system including diseases of the head , brain and spine .
currently , adult neurosurgery is performed in both cardiff and swansea .
swansea previously lost its child neurosurgery operations to cardiff in november 2004 .
the plans to centralise neurosurgery in cardiff were announced in 2006 after a health commission wales report .
dr gibbons delayed the decision when he was health minister since the overall move to cardiff was proposed a year ago , a high profile campaign of opposition has been underway in swansea and more than 100,000 people signed a petition opposing the change .
in october , five ams from south west wales constituencies wrote to the then health minister brian gibbons asking him to consider other factors before moving neurosurgery between the two cities .
in november , dr gibbons then decided to delay the controversial decision until after the assembly election .
elin ifan from the wales neurological alliance , an umbrella group that represents patients , warned that south wales did not have big enough a population to sustain two specialist centres for neurosurgery .

the canadian company said beijing had given the green light to sell the handsets after an eight-year battle .
the device is expected to be available in shops in the country from august , according to reports , with 5,000 advance orders already received .
the plans come as us regulators investigate the firm 's stock options .
in april , the firm announced that an informal internal probe into backdated options approved after rim 's initial public offering in 1997 had become a formal investigation by the securities and exchange commission .
backdating can increase the value of the shares to the owner .
while it is legal , a company has to fully inform shareholders of the practice and make sure it is properly accounted for .
demand strong despite the investigation , rim continues to perform strongly as customer demand for the blackberry continues to grow .
earnings for the first three months of the year rose 10-fold , soaring to $ 187m -lrb- £ 94m -rrb- from $ 18.4m a year earlier .
its subscriber base grew by about 1.2 million during the quarter , taking the total number to 9.2 million .
however , industry observers say the product 's market share could now be threatened by apple 's much-hyped iphone , which launched last week and offers phone calls , e-mail , internet access , music and video access .
the firm has linked up with china 's biggest mobile phone network china mobile to launch the blackberry .

mi5 and the joint terrorism analysis centre -lrb- jtac -rrb- said an attack was no longer expected imminently .
the move comes after eight migrants with nhs links were arrested over the london and glasgow failed bomb attacks .
earlier , more background checks on migrant workers were announced by prime minister gordon brown .
the threat level was reduced after the first phase of the investigation - rounding up suspects - drew to a close .
it indicates that the manhunt is over , says bbc correspondent daniel sandford .
the reduced level is likely to mean a slight reduction in security procedures and controls .
threat levels critical - an attack is expected imminently severe - an attack is highly likely substantial - an attack is a strong possibility moderate - an attack is possible but not likely low - an attack is unlikely source : home office timeline : failed bomb attacks who are the suspects ?
ms smith said although there was no intelligence to suggest another attack was imminent , it did not mean the overall threat had disappeared , and she urged the public to remain vigilant .
in his first question time as prime minister , mr brown ordered an urgent review of nhs recruitment .
the suspects have links to the health service , with some working in hospitals as doctors .
mr brown said it was " vitally important that the message is sent out to the rest of the world that we will stand strong , steadfast and united in the face of terror " .
the new terrorism minister sir alan west will carry out the review of nhs recruitment .
' recruiters ' concern ' the recruitment and employment confederation -lrb- rec -rrb- , which represents the uk recruitment industry , said mr brown 's call for more checks on highly-skilled migrants was a " step in the right direction " .
anne fairweather , external relations manager for the trade body , said : " recruiters have been concerned for some time that crb checks do not necessarily cover offences committed outside of the uk .
" one way to tackle this complex issue is to be more stringent when issuing foreigners with permits to work in the uk . "
she added : " ultimately it is for the border and immigration agency to decide whether it is appropriate for someone to work in the uk .
" agencies and employers responsibility lies with checking that a candidate is suitable for the job . "
mr brown also told the commons that sponsors of skilled workers would be asked to provide background checks on them .
among other measures , he also said a watch list of potential suspects would be expanded to warn authorities across the world , and the admissibility of intercept evidence in court would be reviewed .
new agreements will be signed with countries around the world to ensure a co-ordinated response to the terror threat .

mi5 and the joint terrorism analysis centre -lrb- jtac -rrb- said an attack was no longer expected imminently .
the move comes after eight migrants with nhs links were arrested over the london and glasgow failed bomb attacks .
earlier , more background checks on migrant workers were announced by prime minister gordon brown .
the threat level was reduced after the first phase of the investigation - rounding up suspects - drew to a close .
it indicates that the manhunt is over , says bbc correspondent daniel sandford .
the reduced level is likely to mean a slight reduction in security procedures and controls .
threat levels critical - an attack is expected imminently severe - an attack is highly likely substantial - an attack is a strong possibility moderate - an attack is possible but not likely low - an attack is unlikely source : home office timeline : failed bomb attacks who are the suspects ?
ms smith said although there was no intelligence to suggest another attack was imminent , it did not mean the overall threat had disappeared , and she urged the public to remain vigilant .
in his first question time as prime minister , mr brown ordered an urgent review of nhs recruitment .
the suspects have links to the health service , with some working in hospitals as doctors .
mr brown said it was " vitally important that the message is sent out to the rest of the world that we will stand strong , steadfast and united in the face of terror " .
the new terrorism minister sir alan west will carry out the review of nhs recruitment .
' recruiters ' concern ' the recruitment and employment confederation -lrb- rec -rrb- , which represents the uk recruitment industry , said mr brown 's call for more checks on highly-skilled migrants was a " step in the right direction " .
anne fairweather , external relations manager for the trade body , said : " recruiters have been concerned for some time that crb checks do not necessarily cover offences committed outside of the uk .
" one way to tackle this complex issue is to be more stringent when issuing foreigners with permits to work in the uk . "
she added : " ultimately it is for the border and immigration agency to decide whether it is appropriate for someone to work in the uk .
" agencies and employers responsibility lies with checking that a candidate is suitable for the job . "
mr brown also told the commons that sponsors of skilled workers would be asked to provide background checks on them .
among other measures , he also said a watch list of potential suspects would be expanded to warn authorities across the world , and the admissibility of intercept evidence in court would be reviewed .
new agreements will be signed with countries around the world to ensure a co-ordinated response to the terror threat .

mi5 and the joint terrorism analysis centre -lrb- jtac -rrb- said an attack was no longer expected imminently .
the move comes after eight migrants with nhs links were arrested over the london and glasgow failed bomb attacks .
earlier , more background checks on migrant workers were announced by prime minister gordon brown .
the threat level was reduced after the first phase of the investigation - rounding up suspects - drew to a close .
it indicates that the manhunt is over , says bbc correspondent daniel sandford .
the reduced level is likely to mean a slight reduction in security procedures and controls .
threat levels critical - an attack is expected imminently severe - an attack is highly likely substantial - an attack is a strong possibility moderate - an attack is possible but not likely low - an attack is unlikely source : home office timeline : failed bomb attacks who are the suspects ?
ms smith said although there was no intelligence to suggest another attack was imminent , it did not mean the overall threat had disappeared , and she urged the public to remain vigilant .
in his first question time as prime minister , mr brown ordered an urgent review of nhs recruitment .
the suspects have links to the health service , with some working in hospitals as doctors .
mr brown said it was " vitally important that the message is sent out to the rest of the world that we will stand strong , steadfast and united in the face of terror " .
the new terrorism minister sir alan west will carry out the review of nhs recruitment .
' recruiters ' concern ' the recruitment and employment confederation -lrb- rec -rrb- , which represents the uk recruitment industry , said mr brown 's call for more checks on highly-skilled migrants was a " step in the right direction " .
anne fairweather , external relations manager for the trade body , said : " recruiters have been concerned for some time that crb checks do not necessarily cover offences committed outside of the uk .
" one way to tackle this complex issue is to be more stringent when issuing foreigners with permits to work in the uk . "
she added : " ultimately it is for the border and immigration agency to decide whether it is appropriate for someone to work in the uk .
" agencies and employers responsibility lies with checking that a candidate is suitable for the job . "
mr brown also told the commons that sponsors of skilled workers would be asked to provide background checks on them .
among other measures , he also said a watch list of potential suspects would be expanded to warn authorities across the world , and the admissibility of intercept evidence in court would be reviewed .
new agreements will be signed with countries around the world to ensure a co-ordinated response to the terror threat .
on saturday afternoon , a burning green jeep cherokee loaded with gas cylinders crashed into the doors of glasgow airport .
the previous day two mercedes containing petrol , gas cylinders and nails were found in central london .
arrests timeline 30 june dr kafeel ahmed and dr bilal abdulla arrested at glasgow airport after burning car driven into doors of main terminal 30 june dr mohammed asha , 26 , and his wife dana asha , 27 , arrested on the m6 near sandbach , cheshire 30 june / 1 july dr sabeel ahmed -lrb- brother of kafeel -rrb- , 26 , arrested near liverpool 's lime street station 1 july a 28-year-old man and a 25-year-old man , thought to be medical students or doctors from saudi arabia , arrested in paisley 2 july dr mohammed haneef , 27 , detained in australia , and a second doctor is questioned 3 july second doctor questioned in australia is released without charge send us your comments brown and cameron clash extremists ' hounded out ' seven of those arrested are believed to be doctors or medical students and one used to work as a laboratory technician .
six are being questioned at london 's paddington green police station .
the seventh remains in hospital after the glasgow attack , and the eighth is still being questioned in australia after his arrest at brisbane airport .
meanwhile , calor is writing to its 10,000 local retailers to remind them of its policy on the way it sells its gas , after reports that its canisters were used in the attacks .
new customers must fill in a form which asks for their name , address and other personal details when they get their first calor gas canister .
' kicking and punching ' a man who grappled with one of the suspects after he saw the attack at glasgow airport has described how his leg was broken in two places in the tussle .
" one of the guys got out of the car and went for the police officer .
i just ran over to help the police officer , " said 40-year-old heating engineer michael kerr .
" i tried my best to get the guy .
i tried punching and kicking him but punching him i fell back and broke my leg . "
mr kerr , who also lost several teeth , told the bbc that he was no hero but just doing his duty .

the troops set off blasts outside the mosque , as negotiations continue with hundreds of students still inside .
at least 16 people have died in recent clashes at the complex .
the students have kidnapped police officers and people they accuse of involvement in " immoral " acts such as prostitution .
the bbc 's barbara plett in islamabad says the radicals do not have much support in islamabad and people are quite glad to see the government taking them on .
but the authorities ' action is likely to upset people in the more conservative north-west frontier province , where most of the students come from .
' they want martyrdom ' the government said more than 1,200 students had surrendered so far , and that their details were being recorded at a camp set up near the mosque .

maryam qayyeum , 15 , one of those who surrendered , told the associated press news agency that those who were staying back in the mosque " only wanted martyrdom " .
" they are happy .
they do n't want to go home , " she said .
another student , johar ali , 20 , said he had not seen any suicide bombers among the students .
some children are thought to be in the mosque , but the mosque 's deputy head reportedly refused to allow their release despite requests from parents .
deputy head abdul rashid ghazi said the radicals would not surrender unless troops pulled back .
our correspondent says the threat of force is likely to remain but that talks are expected to continue .
cleric captured pakistani security forces set off a series of eight explosions outside the mosque before dawn .
no casualties have been reported but there was some damage to the mosque .
" all people in the mosque should surrender or they will be responsible for losses , " said the police warning broadcast over loudspeakers , according to witnesses quoted by reuters news agency .
the mosque 's head cleric was captured by police as he tried to leave the building disguised as a woman .
maulana abdul aziz was caught wearing the burqa , an all-enveloping sheet-like dress adopted by some muslim women .
a security official told the afp news agency the cleric was noticed because his height and his large stomach set him apart from the women he was with .
pakistani president , gen pervez musharraf , has long been criticised for failing to clamp down on the mosque 's activities .
the latest confrontation reportedly started when security forces tried to place barriers around the mosque .
on tuesday , women students of one of two seminaries attached to the mosque protested in the street , while their male counterparts traded gunfire with security forces .
at least 16 people died in the violence and scores were hurt .

pakistani troops are tightening their grip around the mosque , which is at the forefront of a vigilante campaign to enforce a form of islamic sharia law .
the troops set off blasts outside the mosque , as negotiations continue with hundreds of students still inside .
at least 16 people have died in recent clashes at the complex .
the students have kidnapped police officers and people they accuse of involvement in " immoral " acts such as prostitution .
the bbc 's barbara plett in islamabad says the radicals do not have much support in islamabad and people are quite glad to see the government taking them on .
but the authorities ' action is likely to upset people in the more conservative north-west frontier province , where most of the students come from .
' they want martyrdom ' the government said more than 1,200 students had surrendered so far , and that their details were being recorded at a camp set up near the mosque .
in pictures : after violence profile : red mosque anguish of mosque parents following the expiry of an 0900 local time -lrb- 0500 gmt -rrb- deadline on thursday , at least four more female students and one male student were seen giving themselves up .
maryam qayyeum , 15 , one of those who surrendered , told the associated press news agency that those who were staying back in the mosque " only wanted martyrdom " .
" they are happy .
they do n't want to go home , " she said .
another student , johar ali , 20 , said he had not seen any suicide bombers among the students .
some children are thought to be in the mosque , but the mosque 's deputy head reportedly refused to allow their release despite requests from parents .
deputy head abdul rashid ghazi said the radicals would not surrender unless troops pulled back .
our correspondent says the threat of force is likely to remain but that talks are expected to continue .
cleric captured pakistani security forces set off a series of eight explosions outside the mosque before dawn .
no casualties have been reported but there was some damage to the mosque .
maulana abdul aziz was caught as he tried to escape in a burqa " all people in the mosque should surrender or they will be responsible for losses , " said the police warning broadcast over loudspeakers , according to witnesses quoted by reuters news agency .
the mosque 's head cleric was captured by police as he tried to leave the building disguised as a woman .
maulana abdul aziz was caught wearing the burqa , an all-enveloping sheet-like dress adopted by some muslim women .
a security official told the afp news agency the cleric was noticed because his height and his large stomach set him apart from the women he was with .
pakistani president , gen pervez musharraf , has long been criticised for failing to clamp down on the mosque 's activities .
the latest confrontation reportedly started when security forces tried to place barriers around the mosque .
on tuesday , women students of one of two seminaries attached to the mosque protested in the street , while their male counterparts traded gunfire with security forces .
at least 16 people died in the violence and scores were hurt .

mike barnett , 28 , became stuck in neck-high water in a drain in hessle , near hull , on 25 june .
he is understood to have died from hypothermia after a desperate four-hour rescue operation failed to free him .
mr barnett 's family said fire crews did not do enough to save him .
fire chiefs said they made a " concerted " effort .
on thursday , mr barnett 's father , also called mike , said the emergency services were " virtually arguing " about what to do .
he told sky news : " they could 've pulled him out and even if it had broken his leg or pulled his foot off , at least he 'd be alive . "
they did n't have a clue how to get him out " geoffrey claxton , father of victim 's employer " but they just left him to die . "
mr barnett snr was talking after agreeing to dramatic footage of the failed rescue bid being screened .
at the beginning of the crisis one neighbour dived down several times to try to free mr barnett but without success .
firefighters then attempted to cut the grate , which was actually a piece of fencing material put in place after the original grille was damaged in previous flooding .
it is thought mr barnett got his foot trapped in the makeshift metal grille as he tried to clear some debris .
' concerted ' effort last week , geoffrey claxton , whose son , andrew , runs kingston koi company where mr barnett worked , also expressed concern at how the emergency services reacted to the rescue .
he said : " it was quite a while before the firemen came .
he was getting weaker and weaker .
they did n't have a clue how to get him out .
" all they needed was a chain and a land rover and that would have pulled him out . "
mr claxton described how he had gone into the water first to try to clear the drain but mr barnett had told him to get out and went in himself .
glenn ramsden , from humberside fire and rescue service , declined to " speculate " on the rescue , adding : " we made a concerted rescue operation .
it was very concerted with the resources available . "
he said the circumstances surrounding the death were now a matter for the coroner 's inquest .

mr barnett 's family said fire crews did not do enough to save him .
fire chiefs said they made a " concerted " effort .
on thursday , mr barnett 's father , also called mike , said the emergency services were " virtually arguing " about what to do .
he told sky news : " they could 've pulled him out and even if it had broken his leg or pulled his foot off , at least he 'd be alive .
they did n't have a clue how to get him out geoffrey claxton , father of victim 's employer " but they just left him to die . "
mr barnett snr was talking after agreeing to dramatic footage of the failed rescue bid being screened .
at the beginning of the crisis one neighbour dived down several times to try to free mr barnett but without success .
firefighters then attempted to cut the grate , which was actually a piece of fencing material put in place after the original grille was damaged in previous flooding .
it is thought mr barnett got his foot trapped in the makeshift metal grille as he tried to clear some debris .
' concerted ' effort last week , geoffrey claxton , whose son , andrew , runs kingston koi company where mr barnett worked , also expressed concern at how the emergency services reacted to the rescue .
he said : " it was quite a while before the firemen came .
he was getting weaker and weaker .
they did n't have a clue how to get him out .
" all they needed was a chain and a land rover and that would have pulled him out . "
mr claxton described how he had gone into the water first to try to clear the drain but mr barnett had told him to get out and went in himself .
glenn ramsden , from humberside fire and rescue service , declined to " speculate " on the rescue , adding : " we made a concerted rescue operation .
it was very concerted with the resources available . "
he said the circumstances surrounding the death were now a matter for the coroner 's inquest .
