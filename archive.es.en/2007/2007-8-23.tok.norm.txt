but in freiburg , anyone with an exceptionally high iq does n't have to pay up . ever since universities began charging for their services , the tuition fee debate has remained an inflammatory one .
the latest development looks set to fan the flames even more .
in germany , each federal state can decide how many students to exempt from tuition fees and the reasons why , such as whether a student has a disability , a serious illness or a young child .
but it is up to the university itself to decide which students will get an exemption from fees that can reach 500 euros -lrb- $ 674 -rrb- per semester .
in baden-württemberg , some universities recently decided that students with exceptional mental skills can also be excused .
in freiburg , 21 students have already been exempted from the fee requirement on the basis of their iq scores .
a class issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german universities are now in stiff competition to become " elite " at the root of this controversial move is the increased competition among the german universities to attract the nation 's most promising scholars , thereby boosting their chances of gaining " elite school " status , and more federal funding .
" we want to give this a go , " freiburg university 's spokesman rudolf-werner dreier told the daily taz .
" we want to attract the best minds without erecting social obstacles . "
but critics of the program doubt it will benefit the right students .
talking to taz , michael hartmann from the darmstadt technical university said he felt iq tests were not an efficient way of identifying students with the most potential .
" students from what are known as educated backgrounds are better equipped to learn , " he argued .
" they are also familiar with selection procedures and feel less intimidated by them . "
not such a clever idea ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher education is no longer free in germany other universities have similar policies .
tübingen university waives first-semester fees for freshmen boasting outstanding secondary-school grades .
in hamburg , the best students of any given year are exempted from paying for the privilege of learning . while some commentators insist that financial incentives are an acceptable way to raise academic standards , others argue that the logical consequence of the plan in freiburg is that the wealthiest universities will be those with the least intelligent students . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de paying tuition fees ? - no , thank you !
the introduction of tuition fees for university study is very unpopular in germany .
80 percent of the arts students in hamburg are refusing to pay and may have to leave .
-lrb- 01.07.2007 -rrb- private universities take hold in germany while german officials discuss education reform proposals and elite schools , private international universities have started offering anglo-style degrees to german students and may help public schools along the way .
-lrb- 13.06.2005 -rrb- tuition fees face uphill battle in germany with conservatives gaining ground in german politics , the idea of free university education appears to be a thing of the past .
but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students .

a recent attack on a group of indian men in an eastern german town has caused alarm all over the country - and beyond .
could such attacks have an effect on the foreign investment climate in germany ? the incident , in which a mob of around 50 youths shouting racist slogans pursued a group of eight indian men through the small town of mügeln in the state of saxony last week , rekindled the debate about xenophobia and right-wing extremism in germany and , particularly , its eastern states . " people with dark skin have a much higher risk of being attacked in eastern germany than they do in western germany , " said sebastian edathy , a member of the german parliament 's internal affairs committee . questions have been raised about whether the german government is doing enough to fight racism and xenophobia , but also about the effects that the news of racist attacks in germany could have on foreign companies considering investing in the country 's eastern states .

a recent attack on a group of indian men in an eastern german town has caused alarm all over the country - and beyond .
could such attacks have an effect on the foreign investment climate in germany ? the incident , in which a mob of around 50 youths shouting racist slogans pursued a group of eight indian men through the small town of mügeln in the state of saxony last week , rekindled the debate about xenophobia and right-wing extremism in germany and , particularly , its eastern states . " people with dark skin have a much higher risk of being attacked in eastern germany than they do in western germany , " said sebastian edathy , a member of the german parliament 's internal affairs committee . questions have been raised about whether the german government is doing enough to fight racism and xenophobia , but also about the effects that the news of racist attacks in germany could have on foreign companies considering investing in the country 's eastern states .

a recent attack on a group of indian men in an eastern german town has caused alarm all over the country - and beyond .
could such attacks have an effect on the foreign investment climate in germany ? the incident , in which a mob of around 50 youths shouting racist slogans pursued a group of eight indian men through the small town of mügeln in the state of saxony last week , rekindled the debate about xenophobia and right-wing extremism in germany and , particularly , its eastern states . " people with dark skin have a much higher risk of being attacked in eastern germany than they do in western germany , " said sebastian edathy , a member of the german parliament 's internal affairs committee . questions have been raised about whether the german government is doing enough to fight racism and xenophobia , but also about the effects that the news of racist attacks in germany could have on foreign companies considering investing in the country 's eastern states . " episodes like that , when they occur , are always a burden - for the investment climate in germany , too , " achim dercks , deputy chief executive of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told dw-world.de. bad reputation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany needs foreign investors foreigners tend to be particularly sensitive when it comes to incidents like the one in mügeln because of germany 's troubled history .
that 's one of the reasons why , according to dercks , such incidents should not be played down . " we in germany are particularly dependent on foreign investment and , considering our shortage of skilled labor , also on foreign skilled workers , " dercks said . in the past , when similar incidents have taken place , the dihk noticed reluctance on the part of some foreign investors to enter the german market . xenophobic incidents are , according to dercks , not only " objectionable and reprehensible activities , but also unnecessary burdens for companies that are looking for researchers , skilled workers and executive personnel . " long-term image damage ? the mügeln attack has had a particularly strong resonance in india .
the indo-german chamber of commerce received a series of phone calls from concerned indian members , who were planning to attend trade fairs in germany . " as far as germany 's image abroad is concerned , events like this are very counterproductive , " said dirk matter , head of the indo-german chamber of commerce in düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chipmaker amd employs many foreign workers in its factory in dresden around 250 indian companies have their offices in germany , india 's largest foreign trade partner within the european union . it would be difficult , however , to figure out how many foreign firms are choosing not to invest in germany because of problems related to xenophobia and right-wing extremism , or how foreign companies might change their investment plans . " our ministry and our economic development agency do n't know of a single case in which an investor backed out of their plans for those reasons , " said katja mäder , spokeswoman for the saxony ministry for economy and labor -lrb- smwa -rrb- .
" the last inquiry we had related to this issue was 10 years ago , but the company came in the end anyway . " what is impossible to know , she added , was whether some firms were deciding against investing in germany and not even contacting her ministry for information in the first place . what do investors want ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign investments could suffer if there are more xenophobic attacks eva henkel , a spokeswoman for " invest in germany , " germany 's investment promotion agency , which advises international companies , also said that xenophobia has n't been brought up as an issue by foreign investors in the past . but she did n't rule out the possibility that things could change . " it 's possible that incidents like the one in mügeln could influence the climate in the future and that investors will say : ' no , we 'd rather not settle there , if we have to count on our workers being exposed to such abuse . " ' in order to prevent that from happening , saxony introduced the " cosmopolitan saxony " program in 2004 to promote democratic ideas .
with 1.7 million euros -lrb- $ 2.3 million -rrb- a year , the state supports projects and local initiatives that are dedicated to strengthening democracy and tolerance . julia elvers-guyot -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but in freiburg , anyone with an exceptionally high iq does n't have to pay up . ever since universities began charging for their services , the tuition fee debate has remained an inflammatory one .
the latest development looks set to fan the flames even more .
in germany , each federal state can decide how many students to exempt from tuition fees and the reasons why , such as whether a student has a disability , a serious illness or a young child .

" we want to give this a go , " freiburg university 's spokesman rudolf-werner dreier told the daily taz .

but in freiburg , anyone with an exceptionally high iq does n't have to pay up . ever since universities began charging for their services , the tuition fee debate has remained an inflammatory one .
the latest development looks set to fan the flames even more .
in germany , each federal state can decide how many students to exempt from tuition fees and the reasons why , such as whether a student has a disability , a serious illness or a young child .
but it is up to the university itself to decide which students will get an exemption from fees that can reach 500 euros -lrb- $ 674 -rrb- per semester .
in baden-württemberg , some universities recently decided that students with exceptional mental skills can also be excused .
in freiburg , 21 students have already been exempted from the fee requirement on the basis of their iq scores .
a class issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german universities are now in stiff competition to become " elite " at the root of this controversial move is the increased competition among the german universities to attract the nation 's most promising scholars , thereby boosting their chances of gaining " elite school " status , and more federal funding .
" we want to give this a go , " freiburg university 's spokesman rudolf-werner dreier told the daily taz .
" we want to attract the best minds without erecting social obstacles . "
but critics of the program doubt it will benefit the right students .
talking to taz , michael hartmann from the darmstadt technical university said he felt iq tests were not an efficient way of identifying students with the most potential .
" students from what are known as educated backgrounds are better equipped to learn , " he argued .
" they are also familiar with selection procedures and feel less intimidated by them . "
not such a clever idea ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher education is no longer free in germany other universities have similar policies .
tübingen university waives first-semester fees for freshmen boasting outstanding secondary-school grades .
in hamburg , the best students of any given year are exempted from paying for the privilege of learning . while some commentators insist that financial incentives are an acceptable way to raise academic standards , others argue that the logical consequence of the plan in freiburg is that the wealthiest universities will be those with the least intelligent students . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de paying tuition fees ? - no , thank you !
the introduction of tuition fees for university study is very unpopular in germany .
80 percent of the arts students in hamburg are refusing to pay and may have to leave .
-lrb- 01.07.2007 -rrb- private universities take hold in germany while german officials discuss education reform proposals and elite schools , private international universities have started offering anglo-style degrees to german students and may help public schools along the way .
-lrb- 13.06.2005 -rrb- tuition fees face uphill battle in germany with conservatives gaining ground in german politics , the idea of free university education appears to be a thing of the past .
but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students .

while the traditionally risk-averse germans are far from this , attitudes towards money and debt are changing . not everyone has the necessary amount in their savings account to pay for that dream vacation , a new kitchen or the latest flat-screen television .
while many americans may simply whip out a credit card to cover the costs , germans have traditionally been more reserved when it comes to incurring debt for consumer goods . fabian christandl from the institute for economic and social psychology at the university of cologne says germans are far from having the levels of debt that many americans carry around .
but studies showed that there has been a shift in the german mentality towards money and debt , he said . " in the past few years , we 've observed a development away from the puritanical ethos of the postwar generation to one marked by hedonistic values , " christandl said .

the rise in personal debt in germany , however , is also due to the fact that it has become easier for people to get loans - often at unfavorable conditions . according to springeneer , many households lack the necessary foresight when borrowing money .

while the traditionally risk-averse germans are far from this , attitudes towards money and debt are changing . not everyone has the necessary amount in their savings account to pay for that dream vacation , a new kitchen or the latest flat-screen television .
while many americans may simply whip out a credit card to cover the costs , germans have traditionally been more reserved when it comes to incurring debt for consumer goods . fabian christandl from the institute for economic and social psychology at the university of cologne says germans are far from having the levels of debt that many americans carry around .
but studies showed that there has been a shift in the german mentality towards money and debt , he said . " in the past few years , we 've observed a development away from the puritanical ethos of the postwar generation to one marked by hedonistic values , " christandl said .
the mentality of saving money is changing to one that accepts having debt , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people quickly become overwhelmed by debt debt in and of itself is not necessarily negative - if a person has the financial means to handle it .
but the opposite is increasingly becoming the case , official statistics show , said helga springeneer from the federation of german consumer organizations in berlin . " the number of heavily indebted consumers has risen significantly and steadily in the last 10 years , " springeneer said .
according to government figures , 3.1 million households in germany are too far into debt to manage it , she said . " and there is no sign of a significant easing of this situation , " springeneer added . getting out of debt in time various factors can lead a person into debt : losing a job , illness , a divorce or a failed attempt at self-employment .
the rise in personal debt in germany , however , is also due to the fact that it has become easier for people to get loans - often at unfavorable conditions . according to springeneer , many households lack the necessary foresight when borrowing money . " most people take out a loan when they 're doing well financially , " springeneer said .
" but they need to also consider their futures when making their risk assessments . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phones are a leading debt trap for young people when times turn bad , people tend to get in over their heads , often taking out new loans to cover existing debt , she said .

a recent attack on a group of indian men in an eastern german town has caused alarm all over the country - and beyond .
could such attacks have an effect on the foreign investment climate in germany ? the incident , in which a mob of around 50 youths shouting racist slogans pursued a group of eight indian men through the small town of mügeln in the state of saxony last week , rekindled the debate about xenophobia and right-wing extremism in germany and , particularly , its eastern states . " people with dark skin have a much higher risk of being attacked in eastern germany than they do in western germany , " said sebastian edathy , a member of the german parliament 's internal affairs committee . questions have been raised about whether the german government is doing enough to fight racism and xenophobia , but also about the effects that the news of racist attacks in germany could have on foreign companies considering investing in the country 's eastern states . " episodes like that , when they occur , are always a burden - for the investment climate in germany , too , " achim dercks , deputy chief executive of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told dw-world.de. bad reputation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany needs foreign investors foreigners tend to be particularly sensitive when it comes to incidents like the one in mügeln because of germany 's troubled history .
that 's one of the reasons why , according to dercks , such incidents should not be played down . " we in germany are particularly dependent on foreign investment and , considering our shortage of skilled labor , also on foreign skilled workers , " dercks said . in the past , when similar incidents have taken place , the dihk noticed reluctance on the part of some foreign investors to enter the german market . xenophobic incidents are , according to dercks , not only " objectionable and reprehensible activities , but also unnecessary burdens for companies that are looking for researchers , skilled workers and executive personnel . " long-term image damage ? the mügeln attack has had a particularly strong resonance in india .
the indo-german chamber of commerce received a series of phone calls from concerned indian members , who were planning to attend trade fairs in germany . " as far as germany 's image abroad is concerned , events like this are very counterproductive , " said dirk matter , head of the indo-german chamber of commerce in düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chipmaker amd employs many foreign workers in its factory in dresden around 250 indian companies have their offices in germany , india 's largest foreign trade partner within the european union . it would be difficult , however , to figure out how many foreign firms are choosing not to invest in germany because of problems related to xenophobia and right-wing extremism , or how foreign companies might change their investment plans . " our ministry and our economic development agency do n't know of a single case in which an investor backed out of their plans for those reasons , " said katja mäder , spokeswoman for the saxony ministry for economy and labor -lrb- smwa -rrb- .
" the last inquiry we had related to this issue was 10 years ago , but the company came in the end anyway . " what is impossible to know , she added , was whether some firms were deciding against investing in germany and not even contacting her ministry for information in the first place . what do investors want ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign investments could suffer if there are more xenophobic attacks eva henkel , a spokeswoman for " invest in germany , " germany 's investment promotion agency , which advises international companies , also said that xenophobia has n't been brought up as an issue by foreign investors in the past . but she did n't rule out the possibility that things could change . " it 's possible that incidents like the one in mügeln could influence the climate in the future and that investors will say : ' no , we 'd rather not settle there , if we have to count on our workers being exposed to such abuse . " ' in order to prevent that from happening , saxony introduced the " cosmopolitan saxony " program in 2004 to promote democratic ideas .

could such attacks have an effect on the foreign investment climate in germany ? the incident , in which a mob of around 50 youths shouting racist slogans pursued a group of eight indian men through the small town of mügeln in the state of saxony last week , rekindled the debate about xenophobia and right-wing extremism in germany and , particularly , its eastern states . " people with dark skin have a much higher risk of being attacked in eastern germany than they do in western germany , " said sebastian edathy , a member of the german parliament 's internal affairs committee . questions have been raised about whether the german government is doing enough to fight racism and xenophobia , but also about the effects that the news of racist attacks in germany could have on foreign companies considering investing in the country 's eastern states . " episodes like that , when they occur , are always a burden - for the investment climate in germany , too , " achim dercks , deputy chief executive of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told dw-world.de. bad reputation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany needs foreign investors foreigners tend to be particularly sensitive when it comes to incidents like the one in mügeln because of germany 's troubled history .
that 's one of the reasons why , according to dercks , such incidents should not be played down . " we in germany are particularly dependent on foreign investment and , considering our shortage of skilled labor , also on foreign skilled workers , " dercks said . in the past , when similar incidents have taken place , the dihk noticed reluctance on the part of some foreign investors to enter the german market . xenophobic incidents are , according to dercks , not only " objectionable and reprehensible activities , but also unnecessary burdens for companies that are looking for researchers , skilled workers and executive personnel . " long-term image damage ? the mügeln attack has had a particularly strong resonance in india .
the indo-german chamber of commerce received a series of phone calls from concerned indian members , who were planning to attend trade fairs in germany . " as far as germany 's image abroad is concerned , events like this are very counterproductive , " said dirk matter , head of the indo-german chamber of commerce in düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chipmaker amd employs many foreign workers in its factory in dresden around 250 indian companies have their offices in germany , india 's largest foreign trade partner within the european union . it would be difficult , however , to figure out how many foreign firms are choosing not to invest in germany because of problems related to xenophobia and right-wing extremism , or how foreign companies might change their investment plans . " our ministry and our economic development agency do n't know of a single case in which an investor backed out of their plans for those reasons , " said katja mäder , spokeswoman for the saxony ministry for economy and labor -lrb- smwa -rrb- .
" the last inquiry we had related to this issue was 10 years ago , but the company came in the end anyway . " what is impossible to know , she added , was whether some firms were deciding against investing in germany and not even contacting her ministry for information in the first place . what do investors want ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign investments could suffer if there are more xenophobic attacks eva henkel , a spokeswoman for " invest in germany , " germany 's investment promotion agency , which advises international companies , also said that xenophobia has n't been brought up as an issue by foreign investors in the past . but she did n't rule out the possibility that things could change . " it 's possible that incidents like the one in mügeln could influence the climate in the future and that investors will say : ' no , we 'd rather not settle there , if we have to count on our workers being exposed to such abuse . " ' in order to prevent that from happening , saxony introduced the " cosmopolitan saxony " program in 2004 to promote democratic ideas .
with 1.7 million euros -lrb- $ 2.3 million -rrb- a year , the state supports projects and local initiatives that are dedicated to strengthening democracy and tolerance . julia elvers-guyot -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but in freiburg , anyone with an exceptionally high iq does n't have to pay up . ever since universities began charging for their services , the tuition fee debate has remained an inflammatory one .
the latest development looks set to fan the flames even more .
in germany , each federal state can decide how many students to exempt from tuition fees and the reasons why , such as whether a student has a disability , a serious illness or a young child .
but it is up to the university itself to decide which students will get an exemption from fees that can reach 500 euros -lrb- $ 674 -rrb- per semester .
in baden-württemberg , some universities recently decided that students with exceptional mental skills can also be excused .
in freiburg , 21 students have already been exempted from the fee requirement on the basis of their iq scores .
a class issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german universities are now in stiff competition to become " elite " at the root of this controversial move is the increased competition among the german universities to attract the nation 's most promising scholars , thereby boosting their chances of gaining " elite school " status , and more federal funding .
" we want to give this a go , " freiburg university 's spokesman rudolf-werner dreier told the daily taz .
" we want to attract the best minds without erecting social obstacles . "
but critics of the program doubt it will benefit the right students .
talking to taz , michael hartmann from the darmstadt technical university said he felt iq tests were not an efficient way of identifying students with the most potential .
" students from what are known as educated backgrounds are better equipped to learn , " he argued .
" they are also familiar with selection procedures and feel less intimidated by them . "
not such a clever idea ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher education is no longer free in germany other universities have similar policies .
tübingen university waives first-semester fees for freshmen boasting outstanding secondary-school grades .
in hamburg , the best students of any given year are exempted from paying for the privilege of learning . while some commentators insist that financial incentives are an acceptable way to raise academic standards , others argue that the logical consequence of the plan in freiburg is that the wealthiest universities will be those with the least intelligent students . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the traditionally risk-averse germans are far from this , attitudes towards money and debt are changing . not everyone has the necessary amount in their savings account to pay for that dream vacation , a new kitchen or the latest flat-screen television .
while many americans may simply whip out a credit card to cover the costs , germans have traditionally been more reserved when it comes to incurring debt for consumer goods . fabian christandl from the institute for economic and social psychology at the university of cologne says germans are far from having the levels of debt that many americans carry around .
but studies showed that there has been a shift in the german mentality towards money and debt , he said . " in the past few years , we 've observed a development away from the puritanical ethos of the postwar generation to one marked by hedonistic values , " christandl said .
the mentality of saving money is changing to one that accepts having debt , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people quickly become overwhelmed by debt debt in and of itself is not necessarily negative - if a person has the financial means to handle it .
but the opposite is increasingly becoming the case , official statistics show , said helga springeneer from the federation of german consumer organizations in berlin . " the number of heavily indebted consumers has risen significantly and steadily in the last 10 years , " springeneer said .
according to government figures , 3.1 million households in germany are too far into debt to manage it , she said . " and there is no sign of a significant easing of this situation , " springeneer added . getting out of debt in time various factors can lead a person into debt : losing a job , illness , a divorce or a failed attempt at self-employment .
the rise in personal debt in germany , however , is also due to the fact that it has become easier for people to get loans - often at unfavorable conditions . according to springeneer , many households lack the necessary foresight when borrowing money . " most people take out a loan when they 're doing well financially , " springeneer said .
" but they need to also consider their futures when making their risk assessments . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phones are a leading debt trap for young people when times turn bad , people tend to get in over their heads , often taking out new loans to cover existing debt , she said .
the terms of those new loans are frequently poor , she said . " it does n't do any good to shut the stable door once the horse has bolted , " springeneer said , adding that it is important for people to seek external help beforehand from consumer protection agencies , local authorities or charity groups . education about finances young people were particularly affected by debt problems in germany , experts said . " the latest studies show that german youth are more in debt than young people in the united states , " christandl said .
this was due to the fact that young americans were taught entrepreneurial thinking already at a young age .
this socialization impacted their dealings with money , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german are increasingly paying with credit cards a lot still needs to be done in germany to educate youth about money , springeneer said . " young people need to be taught how to rationally deal with money , " she said .
" our children are being crammed with theoretical knowledge that is completely removed from reality .
they might learn how a social market economy functions , but ca n't even understand their own bank statement . " stefan horst , spokesman for germany 's official credit rating agency schufa , said that the number of loans people ca n't pay back has increased over the past few years .
this was especially the case with young people . " people in their 20s are the highest risk group when it comes to loans , " horst said . no danger for the german mortgage market according to christandl , the amount of installment purchases and credit card use was continuously rising in germany - though a credit card culture like the one in the united states has not yet developed .
however , in the long term , germany could develop american attitudes toward debt , he said . " it is becoming increasingly easy to take out loans , especially with the internet , " christandl said .
" borrowing money has simply become a matter of a few clicks . " the german federation of savings and loan banks -lrb- dsgv -rrb- said it had seen a strong rise in often dubious lenders . " we have noticed a significant increase in the past few years of aggressive competition in this market geared towards financing pure consumption through credit , " said dsgv spokeswoman michaela roth . however , roth said a sub-prime mortgage market crisis such as the us is currently experiencing would not occur in germany .

a recent attack on a group of indian men in an eastern german town has caused alarm all over the country - and beyond .
could such attacks have an effect on the foreign investment climate in germany ? the incident , in which a mob of around 50 youths shouting racist slogans pursued a group of eight indian men through the small town of mügeln in the state of saxony last week , rekindled the debate about xenophobia and right-wing extremism in germany and , particularly , its eastern states . " people with dark skin have a much higher risk of being attacked in eastern germany than they do in western germany , " said sebastian edathy , a member of the german parliament 's internal affairs committee . questions have been raised about whether the german government is doing enough to fight racism and xenophobia , but also about the effects that the news of racist attacks in germany could have on foreign companies considering investing in the country 's eastern states . " episodes like that , when they occur , are always a burden - for the investment climate in germany , too , " achim dercks , deputy chief executive of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told dw-world.de. bad reputation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany needs foreign investors foreigners tend to be particularly sensitive when it comes to incidents like the one in mügeln because of germany 's troubled history .

" we in germany are particularly dependent on foreign investment and , considering our shortage of skilled labor , also on foreign skilled workers , " dercks said . in the past , when similar incidents have taken place , the dihk noticed reluctance on the part of some foreign investors to enter the german market . xenophobic incidents are , according to dercks , not only " objectionable and reprehensible activities , but also unnecessary burdens for companies that are looking for researchers , skilled workers and executive personnel . " long-term image damage ? the mügeln attack has had a particularly strong resonance in india .
the indo-german chamber of commerce received a series of phone calls from concerned indian members , who were planning to attend trade fairs in germany .

" our ministry and our economic development agency do n't know of a single case in which an investor backed out of their plans for those reasons , " said katja mäder , spokeswoman for the saxony ministry for economy and labor -lrb- smwa -rrb- .

a recent attack on a group of indian men in an eastern german town has caused alarm all over the country - and beyond .
could such attacks have an effect on the foreign investment climate in germany ? the incident , in which a mob of around 50 youths shouting racist slogans pursued a group of eight indian men through the small town of mügeln in the state of saxony last week , rekindled the debate about xenophobia and right-wing extremism in germany and , particularly , its eastern states . " people with dark skin have a much higher risk of being attacked in eastern germany than they do in western germany , " said sebastian edathy , a member of the german parliament 's internal affairs committee . questions have been raised about whether the german government is doing enough to fight racism and xenophobia , but also about the effects that the news of racist attacks in germany could have on foreign companies considering investing in the country 's eastern states .

the indo-german chamber of commerce received a series of phone calls from concerned indian members , who were planning to attend trade fairs in germany .

but in freiburg , anyone with an exceptionally high iq does n't have to pay up . ever since universities began charging for their services , the tuition fee debate has remained an inflammatory one .
the latest development looks set to fan the flames even more .
in germany , each federal state can decide how many students to exempt from tuition fees and the reasons why , such as whether a student has a disability , a serious illness or a young child .
but it is up to the university itself to decide which students will get an exemption from fees that can reach 500 euros -lrb- $ 674 -rrb- per semester .
in baden-württemberg , some universities recently decided that students with exceptional mental skills can also be excused .
in freiburg , 21 students have already been exempted from the fee requirement on the basis of their iq scores .
a class issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german universities are now in stiff competition to become " elite " at the root of this controversial move is the increased competition among the german universities to attract the nation 's most promising scholars , thereby boosting their chances of gaining " elite school " status , and more federal funding .
" we want to give this a go , " freiburg university 's spokesman rudolf-werner dreier told the daily taz .
" we want to attract the best minds without erecting social obstacles . "
but critics of the program doubt it will benefit the right students .
talking to taz , michael hartmann from the darmstadt technical university said he felt iq tests were not an efficient way of identifying students with the most potential .
" students from what are known as educated backgrounds are better equipped to learn , " he argued .
" they are also familiar with selection procedures and feel less intimidated by them . "
not such a clever idea ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher education is no longer free in germany other universities have similar policies .
tübingen university waives first-semester fees for freshmen boasting outstanding secondary-school grades .
in hamburg , the best students of any given year are exempted from paying for the privilege of learning . while some commentators insist that financial incentives are an acceptable way to raise academic standards , others argue that the logical consequence of the plan in freiburg is that the wealthiest universities will be those with the least intelligent students . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de paying tuition fees ? - no , thank you !
the introduction of tuition fees for university study is very unpopular in germany .
80 percent of the arts students in hamburg are refusing to pay and may have to leave .
-lrb- 01.07.2007 -rrb- private universities take hold in germany while german officials discuss education reform proposals and elite schools , private international universities have started offering anglo-style degrees to german students and may help public schools along the way .
-lrb- 13.06.2005 -rrb- tuition fees face uphill battle in germany with conservatives gaining ground in german politics , the idea of free university education appears to be a thing of the past .
but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students .

but in freiburg , anyone with an exceptionally high iq does n't have to pay up . ever since universities began charging for their services , the tuition fee debate has remained an inflammatory one .
the latest development looks set to fan the flames even more .
in germany , each federal state can decide how many students to exempt from tuition fees and the reasons why , such as whether a student has a disability , a serious illness or a young child .
but it is up to the university itself to decide which students will get an exemption from fees that can reach 500 euros -lrb- $ 674 -rrb- per semester .
in baden-württemberg , some universities recently decided that students with exceptional mental skills can also be excused .
in freiburg , 21 students have already been exempted from the fee requirement on the basis of their iq scores .
a class issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german universities are now in stiff competition to become " elite " at the root of this controversial move is the increased competition among the german universities to attract the nation 's most promising scholars , thereby boosting their chances of gaining " elite school " status , and more federal funding .
" we want to give this a go , " freiburg university 's spokesman rudolf-werner dreier told the daily taz .
" we want to attract the best minds without erecting social obstacles . "
but critics of the program doubt it will benefit the right students .
talking to taz , michael hartmann from the darmstadt technical university said he felt iq tests were not an efficient way of identifying students with the most potential .
" students from what are known as educated backgrounds are better equipped to learn , " he argued .
" they are also familiar with selection procedures and feel less intimidated by them . "
not such a clever idea ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher education is no longer free in germany other universities have similar policies .
tübingen university waives first-semester fees for freshmen boasting outstanding secondary-school grades .
in hamburg , the best students of any given year are exempted from paying for the privilege of learning . while some commentators insist that financial incentives are an acceptable way to raise academic standards , others argue that the logical consequence of the plan in freiburg is that the wealthiest universities will be those with the least intelligent students . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de paying tuition fees ? - no , thank you !
the introduction of tuition fees for university study is very unpopular in germany .
80 percent of the arts students in hamburg are refusing to pay and may have to leave .
-lrb- 01.07.2007 -rrb- private universities take hold in germany while german officials discuss education reform proposals and elite schools , private international universities have started offering anglo-style degrees to german students and may help public schools along the way .
-lrb- 13.06.2005 -rrb- tuition fees face uphill battle in germany with conservatives gaining ground in german politics , the idea of free university education appears to be a thing of the past .
but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students .

while the traditionally risk-averse germans are far from this , attitudes towards money and debt are changing . not everyone has the necessary amount in their savings account to pay for that dream vacation , a new kitchen or the latest flat-screen television .
while many americans may simply whip out a credit card to cover the costs , germans have traditionally been more reserved when it comes to incurring debt for consumer goods . fabian christandl from the institute for economic and social psychology at the university of cologne says germans are far from having the levels of debt that many americans carry around .
but studies showed that there has been a shift in the german mentality towards money and debt , he said . " in the past few years , we 've observed a development away from the puritanical ethos of the postwar generation to one marked by hedonistic values , " christandl said .
the mentality of saving money is changing to one that accepts having debt , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people quickly become overwhelmed by debt debt in and of itself is not necessarily negative - if a person has the financial means to handle it .
but the opposite is increasingly becoming the case , official statistics show , said helga springeneer from the federation of german consumer organizations in berlin . " the number of heavily indebted consumers has risen significantly and steadily in the last 10 years , " springeneer said .
according to government figures , 3.1 million households in germany are too far into debt to manage it , she said . " and there is no sign of a significant easing of this situation , " springeneer added . getting out of debt in time various factors can lead a person into debt : losing a job , illness , a divorce or a failed attempt at self-employment .
the rise in personal debt in germany , however , is also due to the fact that it has become easier for people to get loans - often at unfavorable conditions . according to springeneer , many households lack the necessary foresight when borrowing money . " most people take out a loan when they 're doing well financially , " springeneer said .
" but they need to also consider their futures when making their risk assessments . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phones are a leading debt trap for young people when times turn bad , people tend to get in over their heads , often taking out new loans to cover existing debt , she said .
the terms of those new loans are frequently poor , she said . " it does n't do any good to shut the stable door once the horse has bolted , " springeneer said , adding that it is important for people to seek external help beforehand from consumer protection agencies , local authorities or charity groups . education about finances young people were particularly affected by debt problems in germany , experts said . " the latest studies show that german youth are more in debt than young people in the united states , " christandl said .
this was due to the fact that young americans were taught entrepreneurial thinking already at a young age .
this socialization impacted their dealings with money , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german are increasingly paying with credit cards a lot still needs to be done in germany to educate youth about money , springeneer said . " young people need to be taught how to rationally deal with money , " she said .
" our children are being crammed with theoretical knowledge that is completely removed from reality .
they might learn how a social market economy functions , but ca n't even understand their own bank statement . " stefan horst , spokesman for germany 's official credit rating agency schufa , said that the number of loans people ca n't pay back has increased over the past few years .
this was especially the case with young people . " people in their 20s are the highest risk group when it comes to loans , " horst said . no danger for the german mortgage market according to christandl , the amount of installment purchases and credit card use was continuously rising in germany - though a credit card culture like the one in the united states has not yet developed .
however , in the long term , germany could develop american attitudes toward debt , he said . " it is becoming increasingly easy to take out loans , especially with the internet , " christandl said .
" borrowing money has simply become a matter of a few clicks . " the german federation of savings and loan banks -lrb- dsgv -rrb- said it had seen a strong rise in often dubious lenders . " we have noticed a significant increase in the past few years of aggressive competition in this market geared towards financing pure consumption through credit , " said dsgv spokeswoman michaela roth . however , roth said a sub-prime mortgage market crisis such as the us is currently experiencing would not occur in germany . " these policies are simply not practiced here , with very few exceptions , " roth said .

while the traditionally risk-averse germans are far from this , attitudes towards money and debt are changing . not everyone has the necessary amount in their savings account to pay for that dream vacation , a new kitchen or the latest flat-screen television .
while many americans may simply whip out a credit card to cover the costs , germans have traditionally been more reserved when it comes to incurring debt for consumer goods . fabian christandl from the institute for economic and social psychology at the university of cologne says germans are far from having the levels of debt that many americans carry around .
but studies showed that there has been a shift in the german mentality towards money and debt , he said . " in the past few years , we 've observed a development away from the puritanical ethos of the postwar generation to one marked by hedonistic values , " christandl said .
the mentality of saving money is changing to one that accepts having debt , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people quickly become overwhelmed by debt debt in and of itself is not necessarily negative - if a person has the financial means to handle it .
but the opposite is increasingly becoming the case , official statistics show , said helga springeneer from the federation of german consumer organizations in berlin . " the number of heavily indebted consumers has risen significantly and steadily in the last 10 years , " springeneer said .
according to government figures , 3.1 million households in germany are too far into debt to manage it , she said . " and there is no sign of a significant easing of this situation , " springeneer added . getting out of debt in time various factors can lead a person into debt : losing a job , illness , a divorce or a failed attempt at self-employment .
the rise in personal debt in germany , however , is also due to the fact that it has become easier for people to get loans - often at unfavorable conditions . according to springeneer , many households lack the necessary foresight when borrowing money . " most people take out a loan when they 're doing well financially , " springeneer said .
" but they need to also consider their futures when making their risk assessments . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phones are a leading debt trap for young people when times turn bad , people tend to get in over their heads , often taking out new loans to cover existing debt , she said .

but in freiburg , anyone with an exceptionally high iq does n't have to pay up . ever since universities began charging for their services , the tuition fee debate has remained an inflammatory one .
the latest development looks set to fan the flames even more .
in germany , each federal state can decide how many students to exempt from tuition fees and the reasons why , such as whether a student has a disability , a serious illness or a young child .
but it is up to the university itself to decide which students will get an exemption from fees that can reach 500 euros -lrb- $ 674 -rrb- per semester .
in baden-württemberg , some universities recently decided that students with exceptional mental skills can also be excused .
in freiburg , 21 students have already been exempted from the fee requirement on the basis of their iq scores .
a class issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german universities are now in stiff competition to become " elite " at the root of this controversial move is the increased competition among the german universities to attract the nation 's most promising scholars , thereby boosting their chances of gaining " elite school " status , and more federal funding .
" we want to give this a go , " freiburg university 's spokesman rudolf-werner dreier told the daily taz .
" we want to attract the best minds without erecting social obstacles . "
but critics of the program doubt it will benefit the right students .
talking to taz , michael hartmann from the darmstadt technical university said he felt iq tests were not an efficient way of identifying students with the most potential .
" students from what are known as educated backgrounds are better equipped to learn , " he argued .
" they are also familiar with selection procedures and feel less intimidated by them . "
not such a clever idea ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher education is no longer free in germany other universities have similar policies .
tübingen university waives first-semester fees for freshmen boasting outstanding secondary-school grades .
in hamburg , the best students of any given year are exempted from paying for the privilege of learning . while some commentators insist that financial incentives are an acceptable way to raise academic standards , others argue that the logical consequence of the plan in freiburg is that the wealthiest universities will be those with the least intelligent students . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a recent attack on a group of indian men in an eastern german town has caused alarm all over the country - and beyond .
could such attacks have an effect on the foreign investment climate in germany ? the incident , in which a mob of around 50 youths shouting racist slogans pursued a group of eight indian men through the small town of mügeln in the state of saxony last week , rekindled the debate about xenophobia and right-wing extremism in germany and , particularly , its eastern states . " people with dark skin have a much higher risk of being attacked in eastern germany than they do in western germany , " said sebastian edathy , a member of the german parliament 's internal affairs committee . questions have been raised about whether the german government is doing enough to fight racism and xenophobia , but also about the effects that the news of racist attacks in germany could have on foreign companies considering investing in the country 's eastern states . " episodes like that , when they occur , are always a burden - for the investment climate in germany , too , " achim dercks , deputy chief executive of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told dw-world.de. bad reputation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany needs foreign investors foreigners tend to be particularly sensitive when it comes to incidents like the one in mügeln because of germany 's troubled history .
that 's one of the reasons why , according to dercks , such incidents should not be played down . " we in germany are particularly dependent on foreign investment and , considering our shortage of skilled labor , also on foreign skilled workers , " dercks said . in the past , when similar incidents have taken place , the dihk noticed reluctance on the part of some foreign investors to enter the german market . xenophobic incidents are , according to dercks , not only " objectionable and reprehensible activities , but also unnecessary burdens for companies that are looking for researchers , skilled workers and executive personnel . " long-term image damage ? the mügeln attack has had a particularly strong resonance in india .
the indo-german chamber of commerce received a series of phone calls from concerned indian members , who were planning to attend trade fairs in germany . " as far as germany 's image abroad is concerned , events like this are very counterproductive , " said dirk matter , head of the indo-german chamber of commerce in düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chipmaker amd employs many foreign workers in its factory in dresden around 250 indian companies have their offices in germany , india 's largest foreign trade partner within the european union . it would be difficult , however , to figure out how many foreign firms are choosing not to invest in germany because of problems related to xenophobia and right-wing extremism , or how foreign companies might change their investment plans . " our ministry and our economic development agency do n't know of a single case in which an investor backed out of their plans for those reasons , " said katja mäder , spokeswoman for the saxony ministry for economy and labor -lrb- smwa -rrb- .
" the last inquiry we had related to this issue was 10 years ago , but the company came in the end anyway . " what is impossible to know , she added , was whether some firms were deciding against investing in germany and not even contacting her ministry for information in the first place . what do investors want ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign investments could suffer if there are more xenophobic attacks eva henkel , a spokeswoman for " invest in germany , " germany 's investment promotion agency , which advises international companies , also said that xenophobia has n't been brought up as an issue by foreign investors in the past . but she did n't rule out the possibility that things could change . " it 's possible that incidents like the one in mügeln could influence the climate in the future and that investors will say : ' no , we 'd rather not settle there , if we have to count on our workers being exposed to such abuse . " ' in order to prevent that from happening , saxony introduced the " cosmopolitan saxony " program in 2004 to promote democratic ideas .

but in freiburg , anyone with an exceptionally high iq does n't have to pay up . ever since universities began charging for their services , the tuition fee debate has remained an inflammatory one .
the latest development looks set to fan the flames even more .
in germany , each federal state can decide how many students to exempt from tuition fees and the reasons why , such as whether a student has a disability , a serious illness or a young child .
but it is up to the university itself to decide which students will get an exemption from fees that can reach 500 euros -lrb- $ 674 -rrb- per semester .
in baden-württemberg , some universities recently decided that students with exceptional mental skills can also be excused .
in freiburg , 21 students have already been exempted from the fee requirement on the basis of their iq scores .
a class issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german universities are now in stiff competition to become " elite " at the root of this controversial move is the increased competition among the german universities to attract the nation 's most promising scholars , thereby boosting their chances of gaining " elite school " status , and more federal funding .
" we want to give this a go , " freiburg university 's spokesman rudolf-werner dreier told the daily taz .
" we want to attract the best minds without erecting social obstacles . "
but critics of the program doubt it will benefit the right students .
talking to taz , michael hartmann from the darmstadt technical university said he felt iq tests were not an efficient way of identifying students with the most potential .
" students from what are known as educated backgrounds are better equipped to learn , " he argued .
" they are also familiar with selection procedures and feel less intimidated by them . "
not such a clever idea ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher education is no longer free in germany other universities have similar policies .
tübingen university waives first-semester fees for freshmen boasting outstanding secondary-school grades .
in hamburg , the best students of any given year are exempted from paying for the privilege of learning . while some commentators insist that financial incentives are an acceptable way to raise academic standards , others argue that the logical consequence of the plan in freiburg is that the wealthiest universities will be those with the least intelligent students . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the introduction of tuition fees for university study is very unpopular in germany .
80 percent of the arts students in hamburg are refusing to pay and may have to leave .
-lrb- 01.07.2007 -rrb- private universities take hold in germany while german officials discuss education reform proposals and elite schools , private international universities have started offering anglo-style degrees to german students and may help public schools along the way .
-lrb- 13.06.2005 -rrb- tuition fees face uphill battle in germany with conservatives gaining ground in german politics , the idea of free university education appears to be a thing of the past .
but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students .

a recent attack on a group of indian men in an eastern german town has caused alarm all over the country - and beyond .
could such attacks have an effect on the foreign investment climate in germany ? the incident , in which a mob of around 50 youths shouting racist slogans pursued a group of eight indian men through the small town of mügeln in the state of saxony last week , rekindled the debate about xenophobia and right-wing extremism in germany and , particularly , its eastern states . " people with dark skin have a much higher risk of being attacked in eastern germany than they do in western germany , " said sebastian edathy , a member of the german parliament 's internal affairs committee . questions have been raised about whether the german government is doing enough to fight racism and xenophobia , but also about the effects that the news of racist attacks in germany could have on foreign companies considering investing in the country 's eastern states . " episodes like that , when they occur , are always a burden - for the investment climate in germany , too , " achim dercks , deputy chief executive of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told dw-world.de. bad reputation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany needs foreign investors foreigners tend to be particularly sensitive when it comes to incidents like the one in mügeln because of germany 's troubled history .
that 's one of the reasons why , according to dercks , such incidents should not be played down . " we in germany are particularly dependent on foreign investment and , considering our shortage of skilled labor , also on foreign skilled workers , " dercks said . in the past , when similar incidents have taken place , the dihk noticed reluctance on the part of some foreign investors to enter the german market . xenophobic incidents are , according to dercks , not only " objectionable and reprehensible activities , but also unnecessary burdens for companies that are looking for researchers , skilled workers and executive personnel . " long-term image damage ? the mügeln attack has had a particularly strong resonance in india .
the indo-german chamber of commerce received a series of phone calls from concerned indian members , who were planning to attend trade fairs in germany . " as far as germany 's image abroad is concerned , events like this are very counterproductive , " said dirk matter , head of the indo-german chamber of commerce in düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chipmaker amd employs many foreign workers in its factory in dresden around 250 indian companies have their offices in germany , india 's largest foreign trade partner within the european union . it would be difficult , however , to figure out how many foreign firms are choosing not to invest in germany because of problems related to xenophobia and right-wing extremism , or how foreign companies might change their investment plans . " our ministry and our economic development agency do n't know of a single case in which an investor backed out of their plans for those reasons , " said katja mäder , spokeswoman for the saxony ministry for economy and labor -lrb- smwa -rrb- .
" the last inquiry we had related to this issue was 10 years ago , but the company came in the end anyway . " what is impossible to know , she added , was whether some firms were deciding against investing in germany and not even contacting her ministry for information in the first place . what do investors want ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign investments could suffer if there are more xenophobic attacks eva henkel , a spokeswoman for " invest in germany , " germany 's investment promotion agency , which advises international companies , also said that xenophobia has n't been brought up as an issue by foreign investors in the past . but she did n't rule out the possibility that things could change . " it 's possible that incidents like the one in mügeln could influence the climate in the future and that investors will say : ' no , we 'd rather not settle there , if we have to count on our workers being exposed to such abuse . " ' in order to prevent that from happening , saxony introduced the " cosmopolitan saxony " program in 2004 to promote democratic ideas .
with 1.7 million euros -lrb- $ 2.3 million -rrb- a year , the state supports projects and local initiatives that are dedicated to strengthening democracy and tolerance . julia elvers-guyot -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a recent attack on a group of indian men in an eastern german town has caused alarm all over the country - and beyond .
could such attacks have an effect on the foreign investment climate in germany ? the incident , in which a mob of around 50 youths shouting racist slogans pursued a group of eight indian men through the small town of mügeln in the state of saxony last week , rekindled the debate about xenophobia and right-wing extremism in germany and , particularly , its eastern states . " people with dark skin have a much higher risk of being attacked in eastern germany than they do in western germany , " said sebastian edathy , a member of the german parliament 's internal affairs committee . questions have been raised about whether the german government is doing enough to fight racism and xenophobia , but also about the effects that the news of racist attacks in germany could have on foreign companies considering investing in the country 's eastern states . " episodes like that , when they occur , are always a burden - for the investment climate in germany , too , " achim dercks , deputy chief executive of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told dw-world.de. bad reputation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany needs foreign investors foreigners tend to be particularly sensitive when it comes to incidents like the one in mügeln because of germany 's troubled history .
that 's one of the reasons why , according to dercks , such incidents should not be played down . " we in germany are particularly dependent on foreign investment and , considering our shortage of skilled labor , also on foreign skilled workers , " dercks said . in the past , when similar incidents have taken place , the dihk noticed reluctance on the part of some foreign investors to enter the german market . xenophobic incidents are , according to dercks , not only " objectionable and reprehensible activities , but also unnecessary burdens for companies that are looking for researchers , skilled workers and executive personnel . " long-term image damage ? the mügeln attack has had a particularly strong resonance in india .
the indo-german chamber of commerce received a series of phone calls from concerned indian members , who were planning to attend trade fairs in germany .

" our ministry and our economic development agency do n't know of a single case in which an investor backed out of their plans for those reasons , " said katja mäder , spokeswoman for the saxony ministry for economy and labor -lrb- smwa -rrb- .
" the last inquiry we had related to this issue was 10 years ago , but the company came in the end anyway .

but in freiburg , anyone with an exceptionally high iq does n't have to pay up . ever since universities began charging for their services , the tuition fee debate has remained an inflammatory one .
the latest development looks set to fan the flames even more .
in germany , each federal state can decide how many students to exempt from tuition fees and the reasons why , such as whether a student has a disability , a serious illness or a young child .
but it is up to the university itself to decide which students will get an exemption from fees that can reach 500 euros -lrb- $ 674 -rrb- per semester .
in baden-württemberg , some universities recently decided that students with exceptional mental skills can also be excused .
in freiburg , 21 students have already been exempted from the fee requirement on the basis of their iq scores .
a class issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german universities are now in stiff competition to become " elite " at the root of this controversial move is the increased competition among the german universities to attract the nation 's most promising scholars , thereby boosting their chances of gaining " elite school " status , and more federal funding .
" we want to give this a go , " freiburg university 's spokesman rudolf-werner dreier told the daily taz .
" we want to attract the best minds without erecting social obstacles . "
but critics of the program doubt it will benefit the right students .
talking to taz , michael hartmann from the darmstadt technical university said he felt iq tests were not an efficient way of identifying students with the most potential .
" students from what are known as educated backgrounds are better equipped to learn , " he argued .
" they are also familiar with selection procedures and feel less intimidated by them . "
not such a clever idea ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher education is no longer free in germany other universities have similar policies .
tübingen university waives first-semester fees for freshmen boasting outstanding secondary-school grades .
in hamburg , the best students of any given year are exempted from paying for the privilege of learning . while some commentators insist that financial incentives are an acceptable way to raise academic standards , others argue that the logical consequence of the plan in freiburg is that the wealthiest universities will be those with the least intelligent students . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de paying tuition fees ? - no , thank you !
the introduction of tuition fees for university study is very unpopular in germany .
80 percent of the arts students in hamburg are refusing to pay and may have to leave .
-lrb- 01.07.2007 -rrb- private universities take hold in germany while german officials discuss education reform proposals and elite schools , private international universities have started offering anglo-style degrees to german students and may help public schools along the way .
-lrb- 13.06.2005 -rrb- tuition fees face uphill battle in germany with conservatives gaining ground in german politics , the idea of free university education appears to be a thing of the past .
but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students .

a recent attack on a group of indian men in an eastern german town has caused alarm all over the country - and beyond .
could such attacks have an effect on the foreign investment climate in germany ? the incident , in which a mob of around 50 youths shouting racist slogans pursued a group of eight indian men through the small town of mügeln in the state of saxony last week , rekindled the debate about xenophobia and right-wing extremism in germany and , particularly , its eastern states . " people with dark skin have a much higher risk of being attacked in eastern germany than they do in western germany , " said sebastian edathy , a member of the german parliament 's internal affairs committee . questions have been raised about whether the german government is doing enough to fight racism and xenophobia , but also about the effects that the news of racist attacks in germany could have on foreign companies considering investing in the country 's eastern states . " episodes like that , when they occur , are always a burden - for the investment climate in germany , too , " achim dercks , deputy chief executive of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told dw-world.de. bad reputation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany needs foreign investors foreigners tend to be particularly sensitive when it comes to incidents like the one in mügeln because of germany 's troubled history .
that 's one of the reasons why , according to dercks , such incidents should not be played down . " we in germany are particularly dependent on foreign investment and , considering our shortage of skilled labor , also on foreign skilled workers , " dercks said . in the past , when similar incidents have taken place , the dihk noticed reluctance on the part of some foreign investors to enter the german market . xenophobic incidents are , according to dercks , not only " objectionable and reprehensible activities , but also unnecessary burdens for companies that are looking for researchers , skilled workers and executive personnel . " long-term image damage ? the mügeln attack has had a particularly strong resonance in india .
the indo-german chamber of commerce received a series of phone calls from concerned indian members , who were planning to attend trade fairs in germany . " as far as germany 's image abroad is concerned , events like this are very counterproductive , " said dirk matter , head of the indo-german chamber of commerce in düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chipmaker amd employs many foreign workers in its factory in dresden around 250 indian companies have their offices in germany , india 's largest foreign trade partner within the european union . it would be difficult , however , to figure out how many foreign firms are choosing not to invest in germany because of problems related to xenophobia and right-wing extremism , or how foreign companies might change their investment plans . " our ministry and our economic development agency do n't know of a single case in which an investor backed out of their plans for those reasons , " said katja mäder , spokeswoman for the saxony ministry for economy and labor -lrb- smwa -rrb- .
" the last inquiry we had related to this issue was 10 years ago , but the company came in the end anyway . " what is impossible to know , she added , was whether some firms were deciding against investing in germany and not even contacting her ministry for information in the first place . what do investors want ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign investments could suffer if there are more xenophobic attacks eva henkel , a spokeswoman for " invest in germany , " germany 's investment promotion agency , which advises international companies , also said that xenophobia has n't been brought up as an issue by foreign investors in the past . but she did n't rule out the possibility that things could change . " it 's possible that incidents like the one in mügeln could influence the climate in the future and that investors will say : ' no , we 'd rather not settle there , if we have to count on our workers being exposed to such abuse . " ' in order to prevent that from happening , saxony introduced the " cosmopolitan saxony " program in 2004 to promote democratic ideas .

a recent attack on a group of indian men in an eastern german town has caused alarm all over the country - and beyond .
could such attacks have an effect on the foreign investment climate in germany ? the incident , in which a mob of around 50 youths shouting racist slogans pursued a group of eight indian men through the small town of mügeln in the state of saxony last week , rekindled the debate about xenophobia and right-wing extremism in germany and , particularly , its eastern states . " people with dark skin have a much higher risk of being attacked in eastern germany than they do in western germany , " said sebastian edathy , a member of the german parliament 's internal affairs committee . questions have been raised about whether the german government is doing enough to fight racism and xenophobia , but also about the effects that the news of racist attacks in germany could have on foreign companies considering investing in the country 's eastern states . " episodes like that , when they occur , are always a burden - for the investment climate in germany , too , " achim dercks , deputy chief executive of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told dw-world.de. bad reputation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany needs foreign investors foreigners tend to be particularly sensitive when it comes to incidents like the one in mügeln because of germany 's troubled history .
that 's one of the reasons why , according to dercks , such incidents should not be played down . " we in germany are particularly dependent on foreign investment and , considering our shortage of skilled labor , also on foreign skilled workers , " dercks said . in the past , when similar incidents have taken place , the dihk noticed reluctance on the part of some foreign investors to enter the german market . xenophobic incidents are , according to dercks , not only " objectionable and reprehensible activities , but also unnecessary burdens for companies that are looking for researchers , skilled workers and executive personnel . " long-term image damage ? the mügeln attack has had a particularly strong resonance in india .
the indo-german chamber of commerce received a series of phone calls from concerned indian members , who were planning to attend trade fairs in germany . " as far as germany 's image abroad is concerned , events like this are very counterproductive , " said dirk matter , head of the indo-german chamber of commerce in düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chipmaker amd employs many foreign workers in its factory in dresden around 250 indian companies have their offices in germany , india 's largest foreign trade partner within the european union . it would be difficult , however , to figure out how many foreign firms are choosing not to invest in germany because of problems related to xenophobia and right-wing extremism , or how foreign companies might change their investment plans . " our ministry and our economic development agency do n't know of a single case in which an investor backed out of their plans for those reasons , " said katja mäder , spokeswoman for the saxony ministry for economy and labor -lrb- smwa -rrb- .
" the last inquiry we had related to this issue was 10 years ago , but the company came in the end anyway . " what is impossible to know , she added , was whether some firms were deciding against investing in germany and not even contacting her ministry for information in the first place . what do investors want ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign investments could suffer if there are more xenophobic attacks eva henkel , a spokeswoman for " invest in germany , " germany 's investment promotion agency , which advises international companies , also said that xenophobia has n't been brought up as an issue by foreign investors in the past . but she did n't rule out the possibility that things could change . " it 's possible that incidents like the one in mügeln could influence the climate in the future and that investors will say : ' no , we 'd rather not settle there , if we have to count on our workers being exposed to such abuse . " ' in order to prevent that from happening , saxony introduced the " cosmopolitan saxony " program in 2004 to promote democratic ideas .

while the traditionally risk-averse germans are far from this , attitudes towards money and debt are changing . not everyone has the necessary amount in their savings account to pay for that dream vacation , a new kitchen or the latest flat-screen television .
while many americans may simply whip out a credit card to cover the costs , germans have traditionally been more reserved when it comes to incurring debt for consumer goods . fabian christandl from the institute for economic and social psychology at the university of cologne says germans are far from having the levels of debt that many americans carry around .
but studies showed that there has been a shift in the german mentality towards money and debt , he said . " in the past few years , we 've observed a development away from the puritanical ethos of the postwar generation to one marked by hedonistic values , " christandl said .
the mentality of saving money is changing to one that accepts having debt , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people quickly become overwhelmed by debt debt in and of itself is not necessarily negative - if a person has the financial means to handle it .
but the opposite is increasingly becoming the case , official statistics show , said helga springeneer from the federation of german consumer organizations in berlin . " the number of heavily indebted consumers has risen significantly and steadily in the last 10 years , " springeneer said .
according to government figures , 3.1 million households in germany are too far into debt to manage it , she said . " and there is no sign of a significant easing of this situation , " springeneer added . getting out of debt in time various factors can lead a person into debt : losing a job , illness , a divorce or a failed attempt at self-employment .
the rise in personal debt in germany , however , is also due to the fact that it has become easier for people to get loans - often at unfavorable conditions . according to springeneer , many households lack the necessary foresight when borrowing money . " most people take out a loan when they 're doing well financially , " springeneer said .
" but they need to also consider their futures when making their risk assessments . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phones are a leading debt trap for young people when times turn bad , people tend to get in over their heads , often taking out new loans to cover existing debt , she said .
the terms of those new loans are frequently poor , she said . " it does n't do any good to shut the stable door once the horse has bolted , " springeneer said , adding that it is important for people to seek external help beforehand from consumer protection agencies , local authorities or charity groups . education about finances young people were particularly affected by debt problems in germany , experts said . " the latest studies show that german youth are more in debt than young people in the united states , " christandl said .
this was due to the fact that young americans were taught entrepreneurial thinking already at a young age .
this socialization impacted their dealings with money , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german are increasingly paying with credit cards a lot still needs to be done in germany to educate youth about money , springeneer said . " young people need to be taught how to rationally deal with money , " she said .
" our children are being crammed with theoretical knowledge that is completely removed from reality .
they might learn how a social market economy functions , but ca n't even understand their own bank statement . " stefan horst , spokesman for germany 's official credit rating agency schufa , said that the number of loans people ca n't pay back has increased over the past few years .
this was especially the case with young people . " people in their 20s are the highest risk group when it comes to loans , " horst said . no danger for the german mortgage market according to christandl , the amount of installment purchases and credit card use was continuously rising in germany - though a credit card culture like the one in the united states has not yet developed .
however , in the long term , germany could develop american attitudes toward debt , he said . " it is becoming increasingly easy to take out loans , especially with the internet , " christandl said .

while the traditionally risk-averse germans are far from this , attitudes towards money and debt are changing . not everyone has the necessary amount in their savings account to pay for that dream vacation , a new kitchen or the latest flat-screen television .
while many americans may simply whip out a credit card to cover the costs , germans have traditionally been more reserved when it comes to incurring debt for consumer goods . fabian christandl from the institute for economic and social psychology at the university of cologne says germans are far from having the levels of debt that many americans carry around .
but studies showed that there has been a shift in the german mentality towards money and debt , he said . " in the past few years , we 've observed a development away from the puritanical ethos of the postwar generation to one marked by hedonistic values , " christandl said .
the mentality of saving money is changing to one that accepts having debt , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people quickly become overwhelmed by debt debt in and of itself is not necessarily negative - if a person has the financial means to handle it .
but the opposite is increasingly becoming the case , official statistics show , said helga springeneer from the federation of german consumer organizations in berlin . " the number of heavily indebted consumers has risen significantly and steadily in the last 10 years , " springeneer said .
according to government figures , 3.1 million households in germany are too far into debt to manage it , she said . " and there is no sign of a significant easing of this situation , " springeneer added . getting out of debt in time various factors can lead a person into debt : losing a job , illness , a divorce or a failed attempt at self-employment .
the rise in personal debt in germany , however , is also due to the fact that it has become easier for people to get loans - often at unfavorable conditions . according to springeneer , many households lack the necessary foresight when borrowing money . " most people take out a loan when they 're doing well financially , " springeneer said .
" but they need to also consider their futures when making their risk assessments . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phones are a leading debt trap for young people when times turn bad , people tend to get in over their heads , often taking out new loans to cover existing debt , she said .
the terms of those new loans are frequently poor , she said . " it does n't do any good to shut the stable door once the horse has bolted , " springeneer said , adding that it is important for people to seek external help beforehand from consumer protection agencies , local authorities or charity groups . education about finances young people were particularly affected by debt problems in germany , experts said . " the latest studies show that german youth are more in debt than young people in the united states , " christandl said .
this was due to the fact that young americans were taught entrepreneurial thinking already at a young age .
this socialization impacted their dealings with money , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german are increasingly paying with credit cards a lot still needs to be done in germany to educate youth about money , springeneer said . " young people need to be taught how to rationally deal with money , " she said .
" our children are being crammed with theoretical knowledge that is completely removed from reality .
they might learn how a social market economy functions , but ca n't even understand their own bank statement . " stefan horst , spokesman for germany 's official credit rating agency schufa , said that the number of loans people ca n't pay back has increased over the past few years .
this was especially the case with young people . " people in their 20s are the highest risk group when it comes to loans , " horst said . no danger for the german mortgage market according to christandl , the amount of installment purchases and credit card use was continuously rising in germany - though a credit card culture like the one in the united states has not yet developed .
however , in the long term , germany could develop american attitudes toward debt , he said . " it is becoming increasingly easy to take out loans , especially with the internet , " christandl said .

a recent attack on a group of indian men in an eastern german town has caused alarm all over the country - and beyond .
could such attacks have an effect on the foreign investment climate in germany ? the incident , in which a mob of around 50 youths shouting racist slogans pursued a group of eight indian men through the small town of mügeln in the state of saxony last week , rekindled the debate about xenophobia and right-wing extremism in germany and , particularly , its eastern states . " people with dark skin have a much higher risk of being attacked in eastern germany than they do in western germany , " said sebastian edathy , a member of the german parliament 's internal affairs committee . questions have been raised about whether the german government is doing enough to fight racism and xenophobia , but also about the effects that the news of racist attacks in germany could have on foreign companies considering investing in the country 's eastern states . " episodes like that , when they occur , are always a burden - for the investment climate in germany , too , " achim dercks , deputy chief executive of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told dw-world.de. bad reputation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany needs foreign investors foreigners tend to be particularly sensitive when it comes to incidents like the one in mügeln because of germany 's troubled history .
that 's one of the reasons why , according to dercks , such incidents should not be played down . " we in germany are particularly dependent on foreign investment and , considering our shortage of skilled labor , also on foreign skilled workers , " dercks said . in the past , when similar incidents have taken place , the dihk noticed reluctance on the part of some foreign investors to enter the german market . xenophobic incidents are , according to dercks , not only " objectionable and reprehensible activities , but also unnecessary burdens for companies that are looking for researchers , skilled workers and executive personnel . " long-term image damage ? the mügeln attack has had a particularly strong resonance in india .
the indo-german chamber of commerce received a series of phone calls from concerned indian members , who were planning to attend trade fairs in germany . " as far as germany 's image abroad is concerned , events like this are very counterproductive , " said dirk matter , head of the indo-german chamber of commerce in düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chipmaker amd employs many foreign workers in its factory in dresden around 250 indian companies have their offices in germany , india 's largest foreign trade partner within the european union . it would be difficult , however , to figure out how many foreign firms are choosing not to invest in germany because of problems related to xenophobia and right-wing extremism , or how foreign companies might change their investment plans .

a recent attack on a group of indian men in an eastern german town has caused alarm all over the country - and beyond .
could such attacks have an effect on the foreign investment climate in germany ? the incident , in which a mob of around 50 youths shouting racist slogans pursued a group of eight indian men through the small town of mügeln in the state of saxony last week , rekindled the debate about xenophobia and right-wing extremism in germany and , particularly , its eastern states . " people with dark skin have a much higher risk of being attacked in eastern germany than they do in western germany , " said sebastian edathy , a member of the german parliament 's internal affairs committee . questions have been raised about whether the german government is doing enough to fight racism and xenophobia , but also about the effects that the news of racist attacks in germany could have on foreign companies considering investing in the country 's eastern states . " episodes like that , when they occur , are always a burden - for the investment climate in germany , too , " achim dercks , deputy chief executive of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told dw-world.de. bad reputation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany needs foreign investors foreigners tend to be particularly sensitive when it comes to incidents like the one in mügeln because of germany 's troubled history .
that 's one of the reasons why , according to dercks , such incidents should not be played down . " we in germany are particularly dependent on foreign investment and , considering our shortage of skilled labor , also on foreign skilled workers , " dercks said . in the past , when similar incidents have taken place , the dihk noticed reluctance on the part of some foreign investors to enter the german market . xenophobic incidents are , according to dercks , not only " objectionable and reprehensible activities , but also unnecessary burdens for companies that are looking for researchers , skilled workers and executive personnel . " long-term image damage ? the mügeln attack has had a particularly strong resonance in india .
the indo-german chamber of commerce received a series of phone calls from concerned indian members , who were planning to attend trade fairs in germany . " as far as germany 's image abroad is concerned , events like this are very counterproductive , " said dirk matter , head of the indo-german chamber of commerce in düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chipmaker amd employs many foreign workers in its factory in dresden around 250 indian companies have their offices in germany , india 's largest foreign trade partner within the european union . it would be difficult , however , to figure out how many foreign firms are choosing not to invest in germany because of problems related to xenophobia and right-wing extremism , or how foreign companies might change their investment plans . " our ministry and our economic development agency do n't know of a single case in which an investor backed out of their plans for those reasons , " said katja mäder , spokeswoman for the saxony ministry for economy and labor -lrb- smwa -rrb- .

but in freiburg , anyone with an exceptionally high iq does n't have to pay up . ever since universities began charging for their services , the tuition fee debate has remained an inflammatory one .
the latest development looks set to fan the flames even more .
in germany , each federal state can decide how many students to exempt from tuition fees and the reasons why , such as whether a student has a disability , a serious illness or a young child .
but it is up to the university itself to decide which students will get an exemption from fees that can reach 500 euros -lrb- $ 674 -rrb- per semester .
in baden-württemberg , some universities recently decided that students with exceptional mental skills can also be excused .
in freiburg , 21 students have already been exempted from the fee requirement on the basis of their iq scores .
a class issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german universities are now in stiff competition to become " elite " at the root of this controversial move is the increased competition among the german universities to attract the nation 's most promising scholars , thereby boosting their chances of gaining " elite school " status , and more federal funding .
" we want to give this a go , " freiburg university 's spokesman rudolf-werner dreier told the daily taz .
" we want to attract the best minds without erecting social obstacles . "
but critics of the program doubt it will benefit the right students .
talking to taz , michael hartmann from the darmstadt technical university said he felt iq tests were not an efficient way of identifying students with the most potential .
" students from what are known as educated backgrounds are better equipped to learn , " he argued .
" they are also familiar with selection procedures and feel less intimidated by them . "
not such a clever idea ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher education is no longer free in germany other universities have similar policies .
tübingen university waives first-semester fees for freshmen boasting outstanding secondary-school grades .
in hamburg , the best students of any given year are exempted from paying for the privilege of learning . while some commentators insist that financial incentives are an acceptable way to raise academic standards , others argue that the logical consequence of the plan in freiburg is that the wealthiest universities will be those with the least intelligent students . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the introduction of tuition fees for university study is very unpopular in germany .
80 percent of the arts students in hamburg are refusing to pay and may have to leave .
-lrb- 01.07.2007 -rrb- private universities take hold in germany while german officials discuss education reform proposals and elite schools , private international universities have started offering anglo-style degrees to german students and may help public schools along the way .
-lrb- 13.06.2005 -rrb- tuition fees face uphill battle in germany with conservatives gaining ground in german politics , the idea of free university education appears to be a thing of the past .
but , the idea of tuition fees and even study loans remains anathema to many students .

could such attacks have an effect on the foreign investment climate in germany ? the incident , in which a mob of around 50 youths shouting racist slogans pursued a group of eight indian men through the small town of mügeln in the state of saxony last week , rekindled the debate about xenophobia and right-wing extremism in germany and , particularly , its eastern states . " people with dark skin have a much higher risk of being attacked in eastern germany than they do in western germany , " said sebastian edathy , a member of the german parliament 's internal affairs committee . questions have been raised about whether the german government is doing enough to fight racism and xenophobia , but also about the effects that the news of racist attacks in germany could have on foreign companies considering investing in the country 's eastern states .

his plea was broadcast on afghan television thursday . " i am a prisoner of the taliban , " the man identified as rudolf b. said in english in the video shown on afghan private channel tolo tv .
" we live in the mountains , very high in a very bad condition .
please help us . "
" i am in very bad shape , " the 62-year-old said in german .
he said his medication would only last for three more days and that time was running out .
his statements were interrupted by coughing attacks .

a recent attack on a group of indian men in an eastern german town has caused alarm all over the country - and beyond .
could such attacks have an effect on the foreign investment climate in germany ? the incident , in which a mob of around 50 youths shouting racist slogans pursued a group of eight indian men through the small town of mügeln in the state of saxony last week , rekindled the debate about xenophobia and right-wing extremism in germany and , particularly , its eastern states . " people with dark skin have a much higher risk of being attacked in eastern germany than they do in western germany , " said sebastian edathy , a member of the german parliament 's internal affairs committee . questions have been raised about whether the german government is doing enough to fight racism and xenophobia , but also about the effects that the news of racist attacks in germany could have on foreign companies considering investing in the country 's eastern states . " episodes like that , when they occur , are always a burden - for the investment climate in germany , too , " achim dercks , deputy chief executive of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told dw-world.de. bad reputation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany needs foreign investors foreigners tend to be particularly sensitive when it comes to incidents like the one in mügeln because of germany 's troubled history .
that 's one of the reasons why , according to dercks , such incidents should not be played down . " we in germany are particularly dependent on foreign investment and , considering our shortage of skilled labor , also on foreign skilled workers , " dercks said . in the past , when similar incidents have taken place , the dihk noticed reluctance on the part of some foreign investors to enter the german market . xenophobic incidents are , according to dercks , not only " objectionable and reprehensible activities , but also unnecessary burdens for companies that are looking for researchers , skilled workers and executive personnel . " long-term image damage ? the mügeln attack has had a particularly strong resonance in india .
the indo-german chamber of commerce received a series of phone calls from concerned indian members , who were planning to attend trade fairs in germany . " as far as germany 's image abroad is concerned , events like this are very counterproductive , " said dirk matter , head of the indo-german chamber of commerce in düsseldorf . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chipmaker amd employs many foreign workers in its factory in dresden around 250 indian companies have their offices in germany , india 's largest foreign trade partner within the european union . it would be difficult , however , to figure out how many foreign firms are choosing not to invest in germany because of problems related to xenophobia and right-wing extremism , or how foreign companies might change their investment plans . " our ministry and our economic development agency do n't know of a single case in which an investor backed out of their plans for those reasons , " said katja mäder , spokeswoman for the saxony ministry for economy and labor -lrb- smwa -rrb- .
" the last inquiry we had related to this issue was 10 years ago , but the company came in the end anyway . " what is impossible to know , she added , was whether some firms were deciding against investing in germany and not even contacting her ministry for information in the first place . what do investors want ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign investments could suffer if there are more xenophobic attacks eva henkel , a spokeswoman for " invest in germany , " germany 's investment promotion agency , which advises international companies , also said that xenophobia has n't been brought up as an issue by foreign investors in the past . but she did n't rule out the possibility that things could change . " it 's possible that incidents like the one in mügeln could influence the climate in the future and that investors will say : ' no , we 'd rather not settle there , if we have to count on our workers being exposed to such abuse . " ' in order to prevent that from happening , saxony introduced the " cosmopolitan saxony " program in 2004 to promote democratic ideas .

they are accused of " interfering " in the war-torn country 's affairs . sudan has expelled the european commission envoy and the canadian charge d 'affaires from the country , according to western officials .
the eu commission said its envoy , kent degerfelt , has been expelled while the canadian embassy in khartoum confirmed that daniel boon , its chief of mission , was also asked to leave .
earlier on thursday , the official suna news agency reported that the two were being told to leave for " interfering " in the country 's affairs .
" sudan has summoned the envoy of the european commission and the canadian charge d 'affaires and informed them they were considered persona non grata because they interfered in sudanese affairs , " foreign ministry spokesman ali al-sadek told suna .
the exact reasons for their expulsion were not immediately clear .
" we have received a letter informing the head of the delegation that he should leave , " eu commission spokeswoman antonia mochan said in a statement .
" we are trying to resolve the situation , " she added , without giving further details .
frequent tensions khartoum has often had strained diplomatic relations with the west since many western countries have been critical of the sudanese government 's role in the war-torn darfur region .

while the traditionally risk-averse germans are far from this , attitudes towards money and debt are changing . not everyone has the necessary amount in their savings account to pay for that dream vacation , a new kitchen or the latest flat-screen television .
while many americans may simply whip out a credit card to cover the costs , germans have traditionally been more reserved when it comes to incurring debt for consumer goods . fabian christandl from the institute for economic and social psychology at the university of cologne says germans are far from having the levels of debt that many americans carry around .

while the traditionally risk-averse germans are far from this , attitudes towards money and debt are changing . not everyone has the necessary amount in their savings account to pay for that dream vacation , a new kitchen or the latest flat-screen television .
while many americans may simply whip out a credit card to cover the costs , germans have traditionally been more reserved when it comes to incurring debt for consumer goods . fabian christandl from the institute for economic and social psychology at the university of cologne says germans are far from having the levels of debt that many americans carry around .
but studies showed that there has been a shift in the german mentality towards money and debt , he said . " in the past few years , we 've observed a development away from the puritanical ethos of the postwar generation to one marked by hedonistic values , " christandl said .
the mentality of saving money is changing to one that accepts having debt , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people quickly become overwhelmed by debt debt in and of itself is not necessarily negative - if a person has the financial means to handle it .

the rise in personal debt in germany , however , is also due to the fact that it has become easier for people to get loans - often at unfavorable conditions . according to springeneer , many households lack the necessary foresight when borrowing money . " most people take out a loan when they 're doing well financially , " springeneer said .
" but they need to also consider their futures when making their risk assessments . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phones are a leading debt trap for young people when times turn bad , people tend to get in over their heads , often taking out new loans to cover existing debt , she said .

" it is very satisfactory , " a spokesman for the ministry told news agency afp .

" we still have our new net debt and we still have to pay 40 billion euros -lrb- $ 53.9 billion -rrb- in interest every year . " kauder said that the government would make a strong effort to eliminate new borrowing by 2011-2012 , which would be in the next legislative period .

while the traditionally risk-averse germans are far from this , attitudes towards money and debt are changing . not everyone has the necessary amount in their savings account to pay for that dream vacation , a new kitchen or the latest flat-screen television .
while many americans may simply whip out a credit card to cover the costs , germans have traditionally been more reserved when it comes to incurring debt for consumer goods . fabian christandl from the institute for economic and social psychology at the university of cologne says germans are far from having the levels of debt that many americans carry around .
but studies showed that there has been a shift in the german mentality towards money and debt , he said . " in the past few years , we 've observed a development away from the puritanical ethos of the postwar generation to one marked by hedonistic values , " christandl said .
the mentality of saving money is changing to one that accepts having debt , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people quickly become overwhelmed by debt debt in and of itself is not necessarily negative - if a person has the financial means to handle it .
but the opposite is increasingly becoming the case , official statistics show , said helga springeneer from the federation of german consumer organizations in berlin . " the number of heavily indebted consumers has risen significantly and steadily in the last 10 years , " springeneer said .
according to government figures , 3.1 million households in germany are too far into debt to manage it , she said . " and there is no sign of a significant easing of this situation , " springeneer added . getting out of debt in time various factors can lead a person into debt : losing a job , illness , a divorce or a failed attempt at self-employment .
the rise in personal debt in germany , however , is also due to the fact that it has become easier for people to get loans - often at unfavorable conditions . according to springeneer , many households lack the necessary foresight when borrowing money . " most people take out a loan when they 're doing well financially , " springeneer said .
" but they need to also consider their futures when making their risk assessments . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phones are a leading debt trap for young people when times turn bad , people tend to get in over their heads , often taking out new loans to cover existing debt , she said .
the terms of those new loans are frequently poor , she said . " it does n't do any good to shut the stable door once the horse has bolted , " springeneer said , adding that it is important for people to seek external help beforehand from consumer protection agencies , local authorities or charity groups . education about finances young people were particularly affected by debt problems in germany , experts said . " the latest studies show that german youth are more in debt than young people in the united states , " christandl said .
this was due to the fact that young americans were taught entrepreneurial thinking already at a young age .
this socialization impacted their dealings with money , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german are increasingly paying with credit cards a lot still needs to be done in germany to educate youth about money , springeneer said . " young people need to be taught how to rationally deal with money , " she said .
" our children are being crammed with theoretical knowledge that is completely removed from reality .
they might learn how a social market economy functions , but ca n't even understand their own bank statement . " stefan horst , spokesman for germany 's official credit rating agency schufa , said that the number of loans people ca n't pay back has increased over the past few years .
this was especially the case with young people . " people in their 20s are the highest risk group when it comes to loans , " horst said . no danger for the german mortgage market according to christandl , the amount of installment purchases and credit card use was continuously rising in germany - though a credit card culture like the one in the united states has not yet developed .
however , in the long term , germany could develop american attitudes toward debt , he said . " it is becoming increasingly easy to take out loans , especially with the internet , " christandl said .
" borrowing money has simply become a matter of a few clicks . " the german federation of savings and loan banks -lrb- dsgv -rrb- said it had seen a strong rise in often dubious lenders . " we have noticed a significant increase in the past few years of aggressive competition in this market geared towards financing pure consumption through credit , " said dsgv spokeswoman michaela roth . however , roth said a sub-prime mortgage market crisis such as the us is currently experiencing would not occur in germany . " these policies are simply not practiced here , with very few exceptions , " roth said .

but in freiburg , anyone with an exceptionally high iq does n't have to pay up . ever since universities began charging for their services , the tuition fee debate has remained an inflammatory one .
the latest development looks set to fan the flames even more .
in germany , each federal state can decide how many students to exempt from tuition fees and the reasons why , such as whether a student has a disability , a serious illness or a young child .
but it is up to the university itself to decide which students will get an exemption from fees that can reach 500 euros -lrb- $ 674 -rrb- per semester .
in baden-württemberg , some universities recently decided that students with exceptional mental skills can also be excused .
in freiburg , 21 students have already been exempted from the fee requirement on the basis of their iq scores .
a class issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german universities are now in stiff competition to become " elite " at the root of this controversial move is the increased competition among the german universities to attract the nation 's most promising scholars , thereby boosting their chances of gaining " elite school " status , and more federal funding .
" we want to give this a go , " freiburg university 's spokesman rudolf-werner dreier told the daily taz .
" we want to attract the best minds without erecting social obstacles . "
but critics of the program doubt it will benefit the right students .
talking to taz , michael hartmann from the darmstadt technical university said he felt iq tests were not an efficient way of identifying students with the most potential .
" students from what are known as educated backgrounds are better equipped to learn , " he argued .
" they are also familiar with selection procedures and feel less intimidated by them . "
not such a clever idea ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher education is no longer free in germany other universities have similar policies .
tübingen university waives first-semester fees for freshmen boasting outstanding secondary-school grades .
in hamburg , the best students of any given year are exempted from paying for the privilege of learning . while some commentators insist that financial incentives are an acceptable way to raise academic standards , others argue that the logical consequence of the plan in freiburg is that the wealthiest universities will be those with the least intelligent students . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de finance -pipe- 23.08.2007 germans are losing their traditional aversion to debt großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : debts can quickly add up the ongoing us financial crisis has highlighted the fact that many americans live with high levels of debt .
while the traditionally risk-averse germans are far from this , attitudes towards money and debt are changing . not everyone has the necessary amount in their savings account to pay for that dream vacation , a new kitchen or the latest flat-screen television .
while many americans may simply whip out a credit card to cover the costs , germans have traditionally been more reserved when it comes to incurring debt for consumer goods . fabian christandl from the institute for economic and social psychology at the university of cologne says germans are far from having the levels of debt that many americans carry around .
but studies showed that there has been a shift in the german mentality towards money and debt , he said . " in the past few years , we 've observed a development away from the puritanical ethos of the postwar generation to one marked by hedonistic values , " christandl said .
the mentality of saving money is changing to one that accepts having debt , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people quickly become overwhelmed by debt debt in and of itself is not necessarily negative - if a person has the financial means to handle it .
but the opposite is increasingly becoming the case , official statistics show , said helga springeneer from the federation of german consumer organizations in berlin . " the number of heavily indebted consumers has risen significantly and steadily in the last 10 years , " springeneer said .
according to government figures , 3.1 million households in germany are too far into debt to manage it , she said . " and there is no sign of a significant easing of this situation , " springeneer added . getting out of debt in time various factors can lead a person into debt : losing a job , illness , a divorce or a failed attempt at self-employment .
the rise in personal debt in germany , however , is also due to the fact that it has become easier for people to get loans - often at unfavorable conditions . according to springeneer , many households lack the necessary foresight when borrowing money . " most people take out a loan when they 're doing well financially , " springeneer said .
" but they need to also consider their futures when making their risk assessments . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phones are a leading debt trap for young people when times turn bad , people tend to get in over their heads , often taking out new loans to cover existing debt , she said .
the terms of those new loans are frequently poor , she said . " it does n't do any good to shut the stable door once the horse has bolted , " springeneer said , adding that it is important for people to seek external help beforehand from consumer protection agencies , local authorities or charity groups . education about finances young people were particularly affected by debt problems in germany , experts said . " the latest studies show that german youth are more in debt than young people in the united states , " christandl said .
this was due to the fact that young americans were taught entrepreneurial thinking already at a young age .
this socialization impacted their dealings with money , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german are increasingly paying with credit cards a lot still needs to be done in germany to educate youth about money , springeneer said . " young people need to be taught how to rationally deal with money , " she said .
" our children are being crammed with theoretical knowledge that is completely removed from reality .
they might learn how a social market economy functions , but ca n't even understand their own bank statement . " stefan horst , spokesman for germany 's official credit rating agency schufa , said that the number of loans people ca n't pay back has increased over the past few years .
this was especially the case with young people . " people in their 20s are the highest risk group when it comes to loans , " horst said . no danger for the german mortgage market according to christandl , the amount of installment purchases and credit card use was continuously rising in germany - though a credit card culture like the one in the united states has not yet developed .
however , in the long term , germany could develop american attitudes toward debt , he said . " it is becoming increasingly easy to take out loans , especially with the internet , " christandl said .
" borrowing money has simply become a matter of a few clicks . " the german federation of savings and loan banks -lrb- dsgv -rrb- said it had seen a strong rise in often dubious lenders . " we have noticed a significant increase in the past few years of aggressive competition in this market geared towards financing pure consumption through credit , " said dsgv spokeswoman michaela roth . however , roth said a sub-prime mortgage market crisis such as the us is currently experiencing would not occur in germany . " these policies are simply not practiced here , with very few exceptions , " roth said .

the mentality of saving money is changing to one that accepts having debt , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people quickly become overwhelmed by debt debt in and of itself is not necessarily negative - if a person has the financial means to handle it .
but the opposite is increasingly becoming the case , official statistics show , said helga springeneer from the federation of german consumer organizations in berlin . " the number of heavily indebted consumers has risen significantly and steadily in the last 10 years , " springeneer said .
according to government figures , 3.1 million households in germany are too far into debt to manage it , she said . " and there is no sign of a significant easing of this situation , " springeneer added . getting out of debt in time various factors can lead a person into debt : losing a job , illness , a divorce or a failed attempt at self-employment .
the rise in personal debt in germany , however , is also due to the fact that it has become easier for people to get loans - often at unfavorable conditions . according to springeneer , many households lack the necessary foresight when borrowing money .

the rise in personal debt in germany , however , is also due to the fact that it has become easier for people to get loans - often at unfavorable conditions . according to springeneer , many households lack the necessary foresight when borrowing money . " most people take out a loan when they 're doing well financially , " springeneer said .
" but they need to also consider their futures when making their risk assessments . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phones are a leading debt trap for young people when times turn bad , people tend to get in over their heads , often taking out new loans to cover existing debt , she said .
the terms of those new loans are frequently poor , she said . " it does n't do any good to shut the stable door once the horse has bolted , " springeneer said , adding that it is important for people to seek external help beforehand from consumer protection agencies , local authorities or charity groups . education about finances young people were particularly affected by debt problems in germany , experts said . " the latest studies show that german youth are more in debt than young people in the united states , " christandl said .
this was due to the fact that young americans were taught entrepreneurial thinking already at a young age .
this socialization impacted their dealings with money , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german are increasingly paying with credit cards a lot still needs to be done in germany to educate youth about money , springeneer said . " young people need to be taught how to rationally deal with money , " she said .
" our children are being crammed with theoretical knowledge that is completely removed from reality .
they might learn how a social market economy functions , but ca n't even understand their own bank statement . " stefan horst , spokesman for germany 's official credit rating agency schufa , said that the number of loans people ca n't pay back has increased over the past few years .
this was especially the case with young people . " people in their 20s are the highest risk group when it comes to loans , " horst said . no danger for the german mortgage market according to christandl , the amount of installment purchases and credit card use was continuously rising in germany - though a credit card culture like the one in the united states has not yet developed .
however , in the long term , germany could develop american attitudes toward debt , he said . " it is becoming increasingly easy to take out loans , especially with the internet , " christandl said .
" borrowing money has simply become a matter of a few clicks . " the german federation of savings and loan banks -lrb- dsgv -rrb- said it had seen a strong rise in often dubious lenders . " we have noticed a significant increase in the past few years of aggressive competition in this market geared towards financing pure consumption through credit , " said dsgv spokeswoman michaela roth . however , roth said a sub-prime mortgage market crisis such as the us is currently experiencing would not occur in germany . " these policies are simply not practiced here , with very few exceptions , " roth said .

but in freiburg , anyone with an exceptionally high iq does n't have to pay up . ever since universities began charging for their services , the tuition fee debate has remained an inflammatory one .
the latest development looks set to fan the flames even more .
in germany , each federal state can decide how many students to exempt from tuition fees and the reasons why , such as whether a student has a disability , a serious illness or a young child .
but it is up to the university itself to decide which students will get an exemption from fees that can reach 500 euros -lrb- $ 674 -rrb- per semester .

a class issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german universities are now in stiff competition to become " elite " at the root of this controversial move is the increased competition among the german universities to attract the nation 's most promising scholars , thereby boosting their chances of gaining " elite school " status , and more federal funding .
" we want to give this a go , " freiburg university 's spokesman rudolf-werner dreier told the daily taz .
" we want to attract the best minds without erecting social obstacles . "
but critics of the program doubt it will benefit the right students .
talking to taz , michael hartmann from the darmstadt technical university said he felt iq tests were not an efficient way of identifying students with the most potential .
" students from what are known as educated backgrounds are better equipped to learn , " he argued .
" they are also familiar with selection procedures and feel less intimidated by them . "
not such a clever idea ?

a recent attack on a group of indian men in an eastern german town has caused alarm all over the country - and beyond .
could such attacks have an effect on the foreign investment climate in germany ? the incident , in which a mob of around 50 youths shouting racist slogans pursued a group of eight indian men through the small town of mügeln in the state of saxony last week , rekindled the debate about xenophobia and right-wing extremism in germany and , particularly , its eastern states . " people with dark skin have a much higher risk of being attacked in eastern germany than they do in western germany , " said sebastian edathy , a member of the german parliament 's internal affairs committee . questions have been raised about whether the german government is doing enough to fight racism and xenophobia , but also about the effects that the news of racist attacks in germany could have on foreign companies considering investing in the country 's eastern states . " episodes like that , when they occur , are always a burden - for the investment climate in germany , too , " achim dercks , deputy chief executive of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told dw-world.de. bad reputation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany needs foreign investors foreigners tend to be particularly sensitive when it comes to incidents like the one in mügeln because of germany 's troubled history .
that 's one of the reasons why , according to dercks , such incidents should not be played down . " we in germany are particularly dependent on foreign investment and , considering our shortage of skilled labor , also on foreign skilled workers , " dercks said . in the past , when similar incidents have taken place , the dihk noticed reluctance on the part of some foreign investors to enter the german market . xenophobic incidents are , according to dercks , not only " objectionable and reprehensible activities , but also unnecessary burdens for companies that are looking for researchers , skilled workers and executive personnel . " long-term image damage ? the mügeln attack has had a particularly strong resonance in india .
the indo-german chamber of commerce received a series of phone calls from concerned indian members , who were planning to attend trade fairs in germany .

a recent attack on a group of indian men in an eastern german town has caused alarm all over the country - and beyond .
could such attacks have an effect on the foreign investment climate in germany ? the incident , in which a mob of around 50 youths shouting racist slogans pursued a group of eight indian men through the small town of mügeln in the state of saxony last week , rekindled the debate about xenophobia and right-wing extremism in germany and , particularly , its eastern states . " people with dark skin have a much higher risk of being attacked in eastern germany than they do in western germany , " said sebastian edathy , a member of the german parliament 's internal affairs committee . questions have been raised about whether the german government is doing enough to fight racism and xenophobia , but also about the effects that the news of racist attacks in germany could have on foreign companies considering investing in the country 's eastern states .

but in freiburg , anyone with an exceptionally high iq does n't have to pay up . ever since universities began charging for their services , the tuition fee debate has remained an inflammatory one .
the latest development looks set to fan the flames even more .
in germany , each federal state can decide how many students to exempt from tuition fees and the reasons why , such as whether a student has a disability , a serious illness or a young child .
but it is up to the university itself to decide which students will get an exemption from fees that can reach 500 euros -lrb- $ 674 -rrb- per semester .
in baden-württemberg , some universities recently decided that students with exceptional mental skills can also be excused .
in freiburg , 21 students have already been exempted from the fee requirement on the basis of their iq scores .
a class issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german universities are now in stiff competition to become " elite " at the root of this controversial move is the increased competition among the german universities to attract the nation 's most promising scholars , thereby boosting their chances of gaining " elite school " status , and more federal funding .
" we want to give this a go , " freiburg university 's spokesman rudolf-werner dreier told the daily taz .
" we want to attract the best minds without erecting social obstacles . "
but critics of the program doubt it will benefit the right students .
talking to taz , michael hartmann from the darmstadt technical university said he felt iq tests were not an efficient way of identifying students with the most potential .
" students from what are known as educated backgrounds are better equipped to learn , " he argued .
" they are also familiar with selection procedures and feel less intimidated by them . "
not such a clever idea ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher education is no longer free in germany other universities have similar policies .
tübingen university waives first-semester fees for freshmen boasting outstanding secondary-school grades .
in hamburg , the best students of any given year are exempted from paying for the privilege of learning . while some commentators insist that financial incentives are an acceptable way to raise academic standards , others argue that the logical consequence of the plan in freiburg is that the wealthiest universities will be those with the least intelligent students . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

they are accused of " interfering " in the war-torn country 's affairs . sudan has expelled the european commission envoy and the canadian charge d 'affaires from the country , according to western officials .
the eu commission said its envoy , kent degerfelt , has been expelled while the canadian embassy in khartoum confirmed that daniel boon , its chief of mission , was also asked to leave .
earlier on thursday , the official suna news agency reported that the two were being told to leave for " interfering " in the country 's affairs .
" sudan has summoned the envoy of the european commission and the canadian charge d 'affaires and informed them they were considered persona non grata because they interfered in sudanese affairs , " foreign ministry spokesman ali al-sadek told suna .
the exact reasons for their expulsion were not immediately clear .
" we have received a letter informing the head of the delegation that he should leave , " eu commission spokeswoman antonia mochan said in a statement .
" we are trying to resolve the situation , " she added , without giving further details .
frequent tensions khartoum has often had strained diplomatic relations with the west since many western countries have been critical of the sudanese government 's role in the war-torn darfur region .
this week , government forces attacked the region 's most volatile camp to flush out rebels who they say are responsible for recent attacks on police .

the war in the western sudanese region erupted in february 2003 when rebels from minority tribes took up arms to demand an equal share of the country 's national resources , prompting a heavy-handed crackdown from government forces and proxy militia .
the african union force in darfur has failed to calm the violence despite a peace deal in 2006 .
according to un estimates , at least 200,000 people have been killed and 2.5 million displaced by the combined effect of war and famine since the conflict erupted . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while the traditionally risk-averse germans are far from this , attitudes towards money and debt are changing . not everyone has the necessary amount in their savings account to pay for that dream vacation , a new kitchen or the latest flat-screen television .
while many americans may simply whip out a credit card to cover the costs , germans have traditionally been more reserved when it comes to incurring debt for consumer goods . fabian christandl from the institute for economic and social psychology at the university of cologne says germans are far from having the levels of debt that many americans carry around .
but studies showed that there has been a shift in the german mentality towards money and debt , he said . " in the past few years , we 've observed a development away from the puritanical ethos of the postwar generation to one marked by hedonistic values , " christandl said .
the mentality of saving money is changing to one that accepts having debt , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people quickly become overwhelmed by debt debt in and of itself is not necessarily negative - if a person has the financial means to handle it .
but the opposite is increasingly becoming the case , official statistics show , said helga springeneer from the federation of german consumer organizations in berlin . " the number of heavily indebted consumers has risen significantly and steadily in the last 10 years , " springeneer said .
according to government figures , 3.1 million households in germany are too far into debt to manage it , she said . " and there is no sign of a significant easing of this situation , " springeneer added . getting out of debt in time various factors can lead a person into debt : losing a job , illness , a divorce or a failed attempt at self-employment .
the rise in personal debt in germany , however , is also due to the fact that it has become easier for people to get loans - often at unfavorable conditions . according to springeneer , many households lack the necessary foresight when borrowing money . " most people take out a loan when they 're doing well financially , " springeneer said .
" but they need to also consider their futures when making their risk assessments . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phones are a leading debt trap for young people when times turn bad , people tend to get in over their heads , often taking out new loans to cover existing debt , she said .

while the traditionally risk-averse germans are far from this , attitudes towards money and debt are changing . not everyone has the necessary amount in their savings account to pay for that dream vacation , a new kitchen or the latest flat-screen television .
while many americans may simply whip out a credit card to cover the costs , germans have traditionally been more reserved when it comes to incurring debt for consumer goods . fabian christandl from the institute for economic and social psychology at the university of cologne says germans are far from having the levels of debt that many americans carry around .
but studies showed that there has been a shift in the german mentality towards money and debt , he said . " in the past few years , we 've observed a development away from the puritanical ethos of the postwar generation to one marked by hedonistic values , " christandl said .

while the traditionally risk-averse germans are far from this , attitudes towards money and debt are changing . not everyone has the necessary amount in their savings account to pay for that dream vacation , a new kitchen or the latest flat-screen television .
while many americans may simply whip out a credit card to cover the costs , germans have traditionally been more reserved when it comes to incurring debt for consumer goods . fabian christandl from the institute for economic and social psychology at the university of cologne says germans are far from having the levels of debt that many americans carry around .
but studies showed that there has been a shift in the german mentality towards money and debt , he said . " in the past few years , we 've observed a development away from the puritanical ethos of the postwar generation to one marked by hedonistic values , " christandl said .
the mentality of saving money is changing to one that accepts having debt , he added . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many people quickly become overwhelmed by debt debt in and of itself is not necessarily negative - if a person has the financial means to handle it .
but the opposite is increasingly becoming the case , official statistics show , said helga springeneer from the federation of german consumer organizations in berlin . " the number of heavily indebted consumers has risen significantly and steadily in the last 10 years , " springeneer said .
according to government figures , 3.1 million households in germany are too far into debt to manage it , she said . " and there is no sign of a significant easing of this situation , " springeneer added . getting out of debt in time various factors can lead a person into debt : losing a job , illness , a divorce or a failed attempt at self-employment .
the rise in personal debt in germany , however , is also due to the fact that it has become easier for people to get loans - often at unfavorable conditions . according to springeneer , many households lack the necessary foresight when borrowing money . " most people take out a loan when they 're doing well financially , " springeneer said .
" but they need to also consider their futures when making their risk assessments . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mobile phones are a leading debt trap for young people when times turn bad , people tend to get in over their heads , often taking out new loans to cover existing debt , she said .
the terms of those new loans are frequently poor , she said . " it does n't do any good to shut the stable door once the horse has bolted , " springeneer said , adding that it is important for people to seek external help beforehand from consumer protection agencies , local authorities or charity groups . education about finances young people were particularly affected by debt problems in germany , experts said . " the latest studies show that german youth are more in debt than young people in the united states , " christandl said .
this was due to the fact that young americans were taught entrepreneurial thinking already at a young age .
this socialization impacted their dealings with money , he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german are increasingly paying with credit cards a lot still needs to be done in germany to educate youth about money , springeneer said . " young people need to be taught how to rationally deal with money , " she said .
" our children are being crammed with theoretical knowledge that is completely removed from reality .
they might learn how a social market economy functions , but ca n't even understand their own bank statement . " stefan horst , spokesman for germany 's official credit rating agency schufa , said that the number of loans people ca n't pay back has increased over the past few years .
this was especially the case with young people . " people in their 20s are the highest risk group when it comes to loans , " horst said . no danger for the german mortgage market according to christandl , the amount of installment purchases and credit card use was continuously rising in germany - though a credit card culture like the one in the united states has not yet developed .

a recent attack on a group of indian men in an eastern german town has caused alarm all over the country - and beyond .
could such attacks have an effect on the foreign investment climate in germany ? the incident , in which a mob of around 50 youths shouting racist slogans pursued a group of eight indian men through the small town of mügeln in the state of saxony last week , rekindled the debate about xenophobia and right-wing extremism in germany and , particularly , its eastern states . " people with dark skin have a much higher risk of being attacked in eastern germany than they do in western germany , " said sebastian edathy , a member of the german parliament 's internal affairs committee . questions have been raised about whether the german government is doing enough to fight racism and xenophobia , but also about the effects that the news of racist attacks in germany could have on foreign companies considering investing in the country 's eastern states . " episodes like that , when they occur , are always a burden - for the investment climate in germany , too , " achim dercks , deputy chief executive of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told dw-world.de. bad reputation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany needs foreign investors foreigners tend to be particularly sensitive when it comes to incidents like the one in mügeln because of germany 's troubled history .
that 's one of the reasons why , according to dercks , such incidents should not be played down . " we in germany are particularly dependent on foreign investment and , considering our shortage of skilled labor , also on foreign skilled workers , " dercks said . in the past , when similar incidents have taken place , the dihk noticed reluctance on the part of some foreign investors to enter the german market . xenophobic incidents are , according to dercks , not only " objectionable and reprehensible activities , but also unnecessary burdens for companies that are looking for researchers , skilled workers and executive personnel . " long-term image damage ? the mügeln attack has had a particularly strong resonance in india .
the indo-german chamber of commerce received a series of phone calls from concerned indian members , who were planning to attend trade fairs in germany .

a recent attack on a group of indian men in an eastern german town has caused alarm all over the country - and beyond .
could such attacks have an effect on the foreign investment climate in germany ? the incident , in which a mob of around 50 youths shouting racist slogans pursued a group of eight indian men through the small town of mügeln in the state of saxony last week , rekindled the debate about xenophobia and right-wing extremism in germany and , particularly , its eastern states . " people with dark skin have a much higher risk of being attacked in eastern germany than they do in western germany , " said sebastian edathy , a member of the german parliament 's internal affairs committee . questions have been raised about whether the german government is doing enough to fight racism and xenophobia , but also about the effects that the news of racist attacks in germany could have on foreign companies considering investing in the country 's eastern states . " episodes like that , when they occur , are always a burden - for the investment climate in germany , too , " achim dercks , deputy chief executive of the german chambers of industry and commerce -lrb- dihk -rrb- , told dw-world.de. bad reputation ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern germany needs foreign investors foreigners tend to be particularly sensitive when it comes to incidents like the one in mügeln because of germany 's troubled history .
that 's one of the reasons why , according to dercks , such incidents should not be played down . " we in germany are particularly dependent on foreign investment and , considering our shortage of skilled labor , also on foreign skilled workers , " dercks said . in the past , when similar incidents have taken place , the dihk noticed reluctance on the part of some foreign investors to enter the german market . xenophobic incidents are , according to dercks , not only " objectionable and reprehensible activities , but also unnecessary burdens for companies that are looking for researchers , skilled workers and executive personnel . " long-term image damage ? the mügeln attack has had a particularly strong resonance in india .
the indo-german chamber of commerce received a series of phone calls from concerned indian members , who were planning to attend trade fairs in germany .

" our ministry and our economic development agency do n't know of a single case in which an investor backed out of their plans for those reasons , " said katja mäder , spokeswoman for the saxony ministry for economy and labor -lrb- smwa -rrb- .
" the last inquiry we had related to this issue was 10 years ago , but the company came in the end anyway . " what is impossible to know , she added , was whether some firms were deciding against investing in germany and not even contacting her ministry for information in the first place . what do investors want ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : foreign investments could suffer if there are more xenophobic attacks eva henkel , a spokeswoman for " invest in germany , " germany 's investment promotion agency , which advises international companies , also said that xenophobia has n't been brought up as an issue by foreign investors in the past . but she did n't rule out the possibility that things could change .

they are accused of " interfering " in the war-torn country 's affairs . sudan has expelled the european commission envoy and the canadian charge d 'affaires from the country , according to western officials .
the eu commission said its envoy , kent degerfelt , has been expelled while the canadian embassy in khartoum confirmed that daniel boon , its chief of mission , was also asked to leave .
earlier on thursday , the official suna news agency reported that the two were being told to leave for " interfering " in the country 's affairs .
" sudan has summoned the envoy of the european commission and the canadian charge d 'affaires and informed them they were considered persona non grata because they interfered in sudanese affairs , " foreign ministry spokesman ali al-sadek told suna .
the exact reasons for their expulsion were not immediately clear .
" we have received a letter informing the head of the delegation that he should leave , " eu commission spokeswoman antonia mochan said in a statement .
" we are trying to resolve the situation , " she added , without giving further details .
frequent tensions khartoum has often had strained diplomatic relations with the west since many western countries have been critical of the sudanese government 's role in the war-torn darfur region .
this week , government forces attacked the region 's most volatile camp to flush out rebels who they say are responsible for recent attacks on police .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chief un envoy to sudan , jan pronk , was expelled in 2006 in october 2006 , the sudanese government expelled top un envoy jan pronk for criticizing its actions in darfur .
the war in the western sudanese region erupted in february 2003 when rebels from minority tribes took up arms to demand an equal share of the country 's national resources , prompting a heavy-handed crackdown from government forces and proxy militia .
the african union force in darfur has failed to calm the violence despite a peace deal in 2006 .
according to un estimates , at least 200,000 people have been killed and 2.5 million displaced by the combined effect of war and famine since the conflict erupted . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but in freiburg , anyone with an exceptionally high iq does n't have to pay up . ever since universities began charging for their services , the tuition fee debate has remained an inflammatory one .
the latest development looks set to fan the flames even more .
in germany , each federal state can decide how many students to exempt from tuition fees and the reasons why , such as whether a student has a disability , a serious illness or a young child .
but it is up to the university itself to decide which students will get an exemption from fees that can reach 500 euros -lrb- $ 674 -rrb- per semester .
in baden-württemberg , some universities recently decided that students with exceptional mental skills can also be excused .
in freiburg , 21 students have already been exempted from the fee requirement on the basis of their iq scores .
a class issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german universities are now in stiff competition to become " elite " at the root of this controversial move is the increased competition among the german universities to attract the nation 's most promising scholars , thereby boosting their chances of gaining " elite school " status , and more federal funding .
" we want to give this a go , " freiburg university 's spokesman rudolf-werner dreier told the daily taz .
" we want to attract the best minds without erecting social obstacles . "
but critics of the program doubt it will benefit the right students .
talking to taz , michael hartmann from the darmstadt technical university said he felt iq tests were not an efficient way of identifying students with the most potential .
" students from what are known as educated backgrounds are better equipped to learn , " he argued .
" they are also familiar with selection procedures and feel less intimidated by them . "
not such a clever idea ?

a recent attack on a group of indian men in an eastern german town has caused alarm all over the country - and beyond .
could such attacks have an effect on the foreign investment climate in germany ? the incident , in which a mob of around 50 youths shouting racist slogans pursued a group of eight indian men through the small town of mügeln in the state of saxony last week , rekindled the debate about xenophobia and right-wing extremism in germany and , particularly , its eastern states . " people with dark skin have a much higher risk of being attacked in eastern germany than they do in western germany , " said sebastian edathy , a member of the german parliament 's internal affairs committee . questions have been raised about whether the german government is doing enough to fight racism and xenophobia , but also about the effects that the news of racist attacks in germany could have on foreign companies considering investing in the country 's eastern states .

but in freiburg , anyone with an exceptionally high iq does n't have to pay up . ever since universities began charging for their services , the tuition fee debate has remained an inflammatory one .
the latest development looks set to fan the flames even more .
in germany , each federal state can decide how many students to exempt from tuition fees and the reasons why , such as whether a student has a disability , a serious illness or a young child .
but it is up to the university itself to decide which students will get an exemption from fees that can reach 500 euros -lrb- $ 674 -rrb- per semester .
in baden-württemberg , some universities recently decided that students with exceptional mental skills can also be excused .
in freiburg , 21 students have already been exempted from the fee requirement on the basis of their iq scores .
a class issue bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german universities are now in stiff competition to become " elite " at the root of this controversial move is the increased competition among the german universities to attract the nation 's most promising scholars , thereby boosting their chances of gaining " elite school " status , and more federal funding .
" we want to give this a go , " freiburg university 's spokesman rudolf-werner dreier told the daily taz .
" we want to attract the best minds without erecting social obstacles . "
but critics of the program doubt it will benefit the right students .
talking to taz , michael hartmann from the darmstadt technical university said he felt iq tests were not an efficient way of identifying students with the most potential .
" students from what are known as educated backgrounds are better equipped to learn , " he argued .
" they are also familiar with selection procedures and feel less intimidated by them . "
not such a clever idea ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : higher education is no longer free in germany other universities have similar policies .
tübingen university waives first-semester fees for freshmen boasting outstanding secondary-school grades .
in hamburg , the best students of any given year are exempted from paying for the privilege of learning . while some commentators insist that financial incentives are an acceptable way to raise academic standards , others argue that the logical consequence of the plan in freiburg is that the wealthiest universities will be those with the least intelligent students . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

enlarge image imagine a history of world war 2 that failed to cover the events in 1930s germany .
conventional histories of the internet are that incomplete , according to a researcher .
it is difficult to conceive of a world without the internet - today more than a billion users worldwide are connected - but just 25 years ago global network connections were vanishingly rare .
during the 1980s , small research networks linking a few hundred universities were gradually replaced by a commercial network with 300,000 users .
but history has failed to document this transitional period in any detail .
dr doug gale , president of information technology associates , in montana , is devoting his spare time to filling in the gaps .
timeline take a tour through the history of the net in the early 1980s , dr gale worked as a network administrator at the national science foundation -lrb- nsf -rrb- , a us government agency that promotes research and education .
he says that at the time , there was just one research network , called arpanet .
it was run by the defense advance research projects agency within the us department of defense .
computer networking but access to arpanet was limited to universities with connections to the department of defense .
as the advantages of computer networking became apparent , other universities began developing their own networks .
ultimately , the nsf launched nsfnet , the immediate forerunner of the modern internet , to link all the networks together .
but there are so few historical records from that time that dr gale describes the period as the internet 's dark age .
" the arpanet period is somewhat well documented because the corporation in charge - bbn - left a physical record , " says dr gale .
" moving into the nsfnet era , it became an extraordinarily decentralised process .
the record exists in people 's basements , in closets . "
dr gale has a simple explanation for the decentralised nature of the nsfnet era .
it was such an exciting project that lots of people just wanted to drop what they were doing and get involved doug gale on the development of nfsnet " it was such an exciting project that lots of people just wanted to drop what they were doing and get involved , " he says .
there were collaborations between universities , governments , corporations and individuals in the private sector , dr gale explains .
although that led to rapid progress in the development of the internet , it has left a poor historical record .
" so much of what happened was done verbally and on the basis of individual trust , " says dr gale .
" if something needed to be done , there was never a formal contract ; it was just done on the basis of a telephone call . "
he says the more he explores the missing history , the more complicated the picture becomes .
" i thought i had some sense of what was going on .
but it 's a much richer history than i ever dreamed , " he says .
" a number of individuals were making important contributions in multiple areas . "
standard language one of the most important of those individuals was dr dennis jennings , now director of computing services at university college dublin .
in the early 1980s , dr jennings made the key decisions at the nsf that would shape the modern internet .
one of those decisions was to insist on a standard language , or set of protocols , to allow easy communication between networks .
dr jennings settled on the tcp / ip protocols , which had been developed by robert kahn and vinton cerf at arpanet in the 1970s .
vint cerf and bob kahn were given the presidential medal of freedom in 2005 " i became known as ' mr tcp / ip ' because i was going around saying it has to be based around these protocols , " dr jennings says .
" the decision to go with tcp was radical , " he continues .
" it was a great decision technically , but implementation of the software was poor and the initial performance was dreadful .
but at the time we envisioned a few hundred users , not ten thousand . "
gradually , the software improved and more networks switched to tcp / ip .
but having a number of isolated networks speaking the same language was n't enough .
there needed to be a central backbone to connect the networks together .
moves began to form a network of networks , the first internet .
" that was the last piece of the jigsaw , " says dr jennings .
the impetus for an internet came from the academic research community and a feeling that resources needed to be more evenly distributed , according to dr jennings .
' concern ' " there was concern that some us researchers were not getting enough access to supercomputers , " he says .
the nsf thought about a network to connect a handful of supercomputers , but dr jennings pressed for a more radical solution .
in september 1985 , he suggested creating a general purpose ' backbone ' to connect any network user with any other user .
the internet today encompasses the globe and one billion people " the supercomputer centres thought it was an appalling idea , " he says .
" but then they caught on to the idea that if there was a backbone , everyone would be able to access their network . "
the thought of all that extra traffic and revenue was enough to persuade the supercomputer centres to support dr jennings ' calls for a general purpose network .
the nsf launched nsfnet in july 1986 .
that was a crucial turning point , says dr gale .
" there was an understanding that , although nfsnet was billed as a supercomputer network , that would soon become a less important component , " he says .
central backbone " and within months , if not weeks , supercomputers did become just a small part of nsfnet .
the rest was - well , you know the internet - everything else . "
in europe too , there were calls for a central backbone to connect existing networks .
but the picture was more complex , says dr kees neggers , managing director of dutch research network surfnet .
public networks in europe were running a set of protocols called x.25 rather than tcp / ip , he says .
soon the networks could no longer handle the demand and consensus emerged among users to start a tcp / ip backbone in europe .
in 1991 , dr neggers chaired a meeting in amsterdam which helped establish a tcp / ip network called ebone , which would become the european equivalent of nsfnet .
in both europe and the us , tcp / ip was viewed as an interim communication solution , to be replaced with superior protocols in time , says dr neggers .
but by the mid 1990s , tcp / ip had become so ubiquitous that it was never replaced .
the internet had become commercial by this time , according to dr gale .
the turning point came in 1987 when the nsfnet backbone was upgraded to 1.544 megabits per second -lrb- mbps -rrb- .
although slow by today 's standards - broadband connections of 24mbps are now available to uk users - it was fast enough to encourage commercial organisations to take a more active role in running the emerging internet .
by 1990 , the internet boasted 300,000 users and numbers have been growing ever since .
" it did n't hit home at a gut level the changes it would have for culture and society .
i saw it as a scientist ; i did n't see it as a human , " says dr gale .
dr gale has barely scratched the surface of internet history , but in the future he intends to extend the focus of his studies .
once he has a good record of internet history in the usa , he will look at the history in europe and elsewhere in the world .
he will also extend the record further into the past .
" when i started the history project the initial focus was that dark age in the 1980s and early ' 90s , " he says .
" but the archive is not going to focus on a particular era .
there 's more to human history than the dark ages . "

enlarge image imagine a history of world war 2 that failed to cover the events in 1930s germany .
conventional histories of the internet are that incomplete , according to a researcher .
it is difficult to conceive of a world without the internet - today more than a billion users worldwide are connected - but just 25 years ago global network connections were vanishingly rare .
during the 1980s , small research networks linking a few hundred universities were gradually replaced by a commercial network with 300,000 users .
but history has failed to document this transitional period in any detail .
dr doug gale , president of information technology associates , in montana , is devoting his spare time to filling in the gaps .
timeline take a tour through the history of the net in the early 1980s , dr gale worked as a network administrator at the national science foundation -lrb- nsf -rrb- , a us government agency that promotes research and education .
he says that at the time , there was just one research network , called arpanet .
it was run by the defense advance research projects agency within the us department of defense .
computer networking but access to arpanet was limited to universities with connections to the department of defense .
as the advantages of computer networking became apparent , other universities began developing their own networks .
ultimately , the nsf launched nsfnet , the immediate forerunner of the modern internet , to link all the networks together .
but there are so few historical records from that time that dr gale describes the period as the internet 's dark age .
" the arpanet period is somewhat well documented because the corporation in charge - bbn - left a physical record , " says dr gale .
" moving into the nsfnet era , it became an extraordinarily decentralised process .
the record exists in people 's basements , in closets . "
dr gale has a simple explanation for the decentralised nature of the nsfnet era .
it was such an exciting project that lots of people just wanted to drop what they were doing and get involved doug gale on the development of nfsnet " it was such an exciting project that lots of people just wanted to drop what they were doing and get involved , " he says .
there were collaborations between universities , governments , corporations and individuals in the private sector , dr gale explains .
although that led to rapid progress in the development of the internet , it has left a poor historical record .
" so much of what happened was done verbally and on the basis of individual trust , " says dr gale .
" if something needed to be done , there was never a formal contract ; it was just done on the basis of a telephone call . "
he says the more he explores the missing history , the more complicated the picture becomes .
" i thought i had some sense of what was going on .
but it 's a much richer history than i ever dreamed , " he says .
" a number of individuals were making important contributions in multiple areas . "
standard language one of the most important of those individuals was dr dennis jennings , now director of computing services at university college dublin .
in the early 1980s , dr jennings made the key decisions at the nsf that would shape the modern internet .
one of those decisions was to insist on a standard language , or set of protocols , to allow easy communication between networks .
dr jennings settled on the tcp / ip protocols , which had been developed by robert kahn and vinton cerf at arpanet in the 1970s .
vint cerf and bob kahn were given the presidential medal of freedom in 2005 " i became known as ' mr tcp / ip ' because i was going around saying it has to be based around these protocols , " dr jennings says .
" the decision to go with tcp was radical , " he continues .
" it was a great decision technically , but implementation of the software was poor and the initial performance was dreadful .
but at the time we envisioned a few hundred users , not ten thousand . "
gradually , the software improved and more networks switched to tcp / ip .
but having a number of isolated networks speaking the same language was n't enough .
there needed to be a central backbone to connect the networks together .
moves began to form a network of networks , the first internet .
" that was the last piece of the jigsaw , " says dr jennings .
the impetus for an internet came from the academic research community and a feeling that resources needed to be more evenly distributed , according to dr jennings .
' concern ' " there was concern that some us researchers were not getting enough access to supercomputers , " he says .
the nsf thought about a network to connect a handful of supercomputers , but dr jennings pressed for a more radical solution .
in september 1985 , he suggested creating a general purpose ' backbone ' to connect any network user with any other user .
the internet today encompasses the globe and one billion people " the supercomputer centres thought it was an appalling idea , " he says .
" but then they caught on to the idea that if there was a backbone , everyone would be able to access their network . "
the thought of all that extra traffic and revenue was enough to persuade the supercomputer centres to support dr jennings ' calls for a general purpose network .
the nsf launched nsfnet in july 1986 .
that was a crucial turning point , says dr gale .
" there was an understanding that , although nfsnet was billed as a supercomputer network , that would soon become a less important component , " he says .
central backbone " and within months , if not weeks , supercomputers did become just a small part of nsfnet .
the rest was - well , you know the internet - everything else . "
in europe too , there were calls for a central backbone to connect existing networks .
but the picture was more complex , says dr kees neggers , managing director of dutch research network surfnet .
public networks in europe were running a set of protocols called x.25 rather than tcp / ip , he says .
soon the networks could no longer handle the demand and consensus emerged among users to start a tcp / ip backbone in europe .
in 1991 , dr neggers chaired a meeting in amsterdam which helped establish a tcp / ip network called ebone , which would become the european equivalent of nsfnet .
in both europe and the us , tcp / ip was viewed as an interim communication solution , to be replaced with superior protocols in time , says dr neggers .
but by the mid 1990s , tcp / ip had become so ubiquitous that it was never replaced .
the internet had become commercial by this time , according to dr gale .
the turning point came in 1987 when the nsfnet backbone was upgraded to 1.544 megabits per second -lrb- mbps -rrb- .
although slow by today 's standards - broadband connections of 24mbps are now available to uk users - it was fast enough to encourage commercial organisations to take a more active role in running the emerging internet .
by 1990 , the internet boasted 300,000 users and numbers have been growing ever since .
" it did n't hit home at a gut level the changes it would have for culture and society .
i saw it as a scientist ; i did n't see it as a human , " says dr gale .
dr gale has barely scratched the surface of internet history , but in the future he intends to extend the focus of his studies .
once he has a good record of internet history in the usa , he will look at the history in europe and elsewhere in the world .
he will also extend the record further into the past .
" when i started the history project the initial focus was that dark age in the 1980s and early ' 90s , " he says .
" but the archive is not going to focus on a particular era .
there 's more to human history than the dark ages . "

vint cerf and bob kahn were given the presidential medal of freedom in 2005 " i became known as ' mr tcp / ip ' because i was going around saying it has to be based around these protocols , " dr jennings says .
" the decision to go with tcp was radical , " he continues .
" it was a great decision technically , but implementation of the software was poor and the initial performance was dreadful .
but at the time we envisioned a few hundred users , not ten thousand . "
gradually , the software improved and more networks switched to tcp / ip .
but having a number of isolated networks speaking the same language was n't enough .
there needed to be a central backbone to connect the networks together .
moves began to form a network of networks , the first internet .
" that was the last piece of the jigsaw , " says dr jennings .
the impetus for an internet came from the academic research community and a feeling that resources needed to be more evenly distributed , according to dr jennings .
' concern ' " there was concern that some us researchers were not getting enough access to supercomputers , " he says .
the nsf thought about a network to connect a handful of supercomputers , but dr jennings pressed for a more radical solution .
in september 1985 , he suggested creating a general purpose ' backbone ' to connect any network user with any other user .
the internet today encompasses the globe and one billion people " the supercomputer centres thought it was an appalling idea , " he says .
" but then they caught on to the idea that if there was a backbone , everyone would be able to access their network . "
the thought of all that extra traffic and revenue was enough to persuade the supercomputer centres to support dr jennings ' calls for a general purpose network .
the nsf launched nsfnet in july 1986 .
that was a crucial turning point , says dr gale .
" there was an understanding that , although nfsnet was billed as a supercomputer network , that would soon become a less important component , " he says .
central backbone " and within months , if not weeks , supercomputers did become just a small part of nsfnet .
the rest was - well , you know the internet - everything else . "
in europe too , there were calls for a central backbone to connect existing networks .
but the picture was more complex , says dr kees neggers , managing director of dutch research network surfnet .
public networks in europe were running a set of protocols called x.25 rather than tcp / ip , he says .
soon the networks could no longer handle the demand and consensus emerged among users to start a tcp / ip backbone in europe .
in 1991 , dr neggers chaired a meeting in amsterdam which helped establish a tcp / ip network called ebone , which would become the european equivalent of nsfnet .
in both europe and the us , tcp / ip was viewed as an interim communication solution , to be replaced with superior protocols in time , says dr neggers .
but by the mid 1990s , tcp / ip had become so ubiquitous that it was never replaced .
the internet had become commercial by this time , according to dr gale .
the turning point came in 1987 when the nsfnet backbone was upgraded to 1.544 megabits per second -lrb- mbps -rrb- .
although slow by today 's standards - broadband connections of 24mbps are now available to uk users - it was fast enough to encourage commercial organisations to take a more active role in running the emerging internet .
by 1990 , the internet boasted 300,000 users and numbers have been growing ever since .
" it did n't hit home at a gut level the changes it would have for culture and society .
i saw it as a scientist ; i did n't see it as a human , " says dr gale .
dr gale has barely scratched the surface of internet history , but in the future he intends to extend the focus of his studies .
once he has a good record of internet history in the usa , he will look at the history in europe and elsewhere in the world .
he will also extend the record further into the past .
" when i started the history project the initial focus was that dark age in the 1980s and early ' 90s , " he says .
" but the archive is not going to focus on a particular era .
there 's more to human history than the dark ages . "

enlarge image imagine a history of world war 2 that failed to cover the events in 1930s germany .
conventional histories of the internet are that incomplete , according to a researcher .
it is difficult to conceive of a world without the internet - today more than a billion users worldwide are connected - but just 25 years ago global network connections were vanishingly rare .
during the 1980s , small research networks linking a few hundred universities were gradually replaced by a commercial network with 300,000 users .
but history has failed to document this transitional period in any detail .
dr doug gale , president of information technology associates , in montana , is devoting his spare time to filling in the gaps .
timeline take a tour through the history of the net in the early 1980s , dr gale worked as a network administrator at the national science foundation -lrb- nsf -rrb- , a us government agency that promotes research and education .
he says that at the time , there was just one research network , called arpanet .
it was run by the defense advance research projects agency within the us department of defense .
computer networking but access to arpanet was limited to universities with connections to the department of defense .
as the advantages of computer networking became apparent , other universities began developing their own networks .
ultimately , the nsf launched nsfnet , the immediate forerunner of the modern internet , to link all the networks together .
but there are so few historical records from that time that dr gale describes the period as the internet 's dark age .
" the arpanet period is somewhat well documented because the corporation in charge - bbn - left a physical record , " says dr gale .
" moving into the nsfnet era , it became an extraordinarily decentralised process .
the record exists in people 's basements , in closets . "
dr gale has a simple explanation for the decentralised nature of the nsfnet era .
it was such an exciting project that lots of people just wanted to drop what they were doing and get involved doug gale on the development of nfsnet " it was such an exciting project that lots of people just wanted to drop what they were doing and get involved , " he says .
there were collaborations between universities , governments , corporations and individuals in the private sector , dr gale explains .
although that led to rapid progress in the development of the internet , it has left a poor historical record .
" so much of what happened was done verbally and on the basis of individual trust , " says dr gale .
" if something needed to be done , there was never a formal contract ; it was just done on the basis of a telephone call . "
he says the more he explores the missing history , the more complicated the picture becomes .
" i thought i had some sense of what was going on .
but it 's a much richer history than i ever dreamed , " he says .
" a number of individuals were making important contributions in multiple areas . "

once he has a good record of internet history in the usa , he will look at the history in europe and elsewhere in the world .
he will also extend the record further into the past .
" when i started the history project the initial focus was that dark age in the 1980s and early ' 90s , " he says .
" but the archive is not going to focus on a particular era .
there 's more to human history than the dark ages . "

enlarge image imagine a history of world war 2 that failed to cover the events in 1930s germany .
conventional histories of the internet are that incomplete , according to a researcher .
it is difficult to conceive of a world without the internet - today more than a billion users worldwide are connected - but just 25 years ago global network connections were vanishingly rare .
during the 1980s , small research networks linking a few hundred universities were gradually replaced by a commercial network with 300,000 users .
but history has failed to document this transitional period in any detail .
dr doug gale , president of information technology associates , in montana , is devoting his spare time to filling in the gaps .
timeline take a tour through the history of the net in the early 1980s , dr gale worked as a network administrator at the national science foundation -lrb- nsf -rrb- , a us government agency that promotes research and education .
he says that at the time , there was just one research network , called arpanet .
it was run by the defense advance research projects agency within the us department of defense .
computer networking but access to arpanet was limited to universities with connections to the department of defense .
as the advantages of computer networking became apparent , other universities began developing their own networks .
ultimately , the nsf launched nsfnet , the immediate forerunner of the modern internet , to link all the networks together .
but there are so few historical records from that time that dr gale describes the period as the internet 's dark age .
" the arpanet period is somewhat well documented because the corporation in charge - bbn - left a physical record , " says dr gale .
" moving into the nsfnet era , it became an extraordinarily decentralised process .
the record exists in people 's basements , in closets . "
dr gale has a simple explanation for the decentralised nature of the nsfnet era .
it was such an exciting project that lots of people just wanted to drop what they were doing and get involved doug gale on the development of nfsnet " it was such an exciting project that lots of people just wanted to drop what they were doing and get involved , " he says .
there were collaborations between universities , governments , corporations and individuals in the private sector , dr gale explains .
although that led to rapid progress in the development of the internet , it has left a poor historical record .
" so much of what happened was done verbally and on the basis of individual trust , " says dr gale .
" if something needed to be done , there was never a formal contract ; it was just done on the basis of a telephone call . "
he says the more he explores the missing history , the more complicated the picture becomes .
" i thought i had some sense of what was going on .
but it 's a much richer history than i ever dreamed , " he says .
" a number of individuals were making important contributions in multiple areas . "
standard language one of the most important of those individuals was dr dennis jennings , now director of computing services at university college dublin .
in the early 1980s , dr jennings made the key decisions at the nsf that would shape the modern internet .
one of those decisions was to insist on a standard language , or set of protocols , to allow easy communication between networks .
dr jennings settled on the tcp / ip protocols , which had been developed by robert kahn and vinton cerf at arpanet in the 1970s .
vint cerf and bob kahn were given the presidential medal of freedom in 2005 " i became known as ' mr tcp / ip ' because i was going around saying it has to be based around these protocols , " dr jennings says .
" the decision to go with tcp was radical , " he continues .
" it was a great decision technically , but implementation of the software was poor and the initial performance was dreadful .
but at the time we envisioned a few hundred users , not ten thousand . "
gradually , the software improved and more networks switched to tcp / ip .
but having a number of isolated networks speaking the same language was n't enough .
there needed to be a central backbone to connect the networks together .
moves began to form a network of networks , the first internet .
" that was the last piece of the jigsaw , " says dr jennings .
the impetus for an internet came from the academic research community and a feeling that resources needed to be more evenly distributed , according to dr jennings .
' concern ' " there was concern that some us researchers were not getting enough access to supercomputers , " he says .
the nsf thought about a network to connect a handful of supercomputers , but dr jennings pressed for a more radical solution .
in september 1985 , he suggested creating a general purpose ' backbone ' to connect any network user with any other user .
the internet today encompasses the globe and one billion people " the supercomputer centres thought it was an appalling idea , " he says .
" but then they caught on to the idea that if there was a backbone , everyone would be able to access their network . "
the thought of all that extra traffic and revenue was enough to persuade the supercomputer centres to support dr jennings ' calls for a general purpose network .
the nsf launched nsfnet in july 1986 .
that was a crucial turning point , says dr gale .
" there was an understanding that , although nfsnet was billed as a supercomputer network , that would soon become a less important component , " he says .
central backbone " and within months , if not weeks , supercomputers did become just a small part of nsfnet .
the rest was - well , you know the internet - everything else . "
in europe too , there were calls for a central backbone to connect existing networks .
but the picture was more complex , says dr kees neggers , managing director of dutch research network surfnet .
public networks in europe were running a set of protocols called x.25 rather than tcp / ip , he says .
soon the networks could no longer handle the demand and consensus emerged among users to start a tcp / ip backbone in europe .
in 1991 , dr neggers chaired a meeting in amsterdam which helped establish a tcp / ip network called ebone , which would become the european equivalent of nsfnet .
in both europe and the us , tcp / ip was viewed as an interim communication solution , to be replaced with superior protocols in time , says dr neggers .
but by the mid 1990s , tcp / ip had become so ubiquitous that it was never replaced .
the internet had become commercial by this time , according to dr gale .
the turning point came in 1987 when the nsfnet backbone was upgraded to 1.544 megabits per second -lrb- mbps -rrb- .
although slow by today 's standards - broadband connections of 24mbps are now available to uk users - it was fast enough to encourage commercial organisations to take a more active role in running the emerging internet .
by 1990 , the internet boasted 300,000 users and numbers have been growing ever since .
" it did n't hit home at a gut level the changes it would have for culture and society .
i saw it as a scientist ; i did n't see it as a human , " says dr gale .
dr gale has barely scratched the surface of internet history , but in the future he intends to extend the focus of his studies .

but the british medical association -lrb- bma -rrb- said it was very unhappy with the " inaccurate and misleading " report .
the audit office said the new general medical services contract , which formally came into effect in april 2004 , had brought some benefits to patients in wales .
it concluded that , although the contract was helping to improve primary care services , a number of changes needed to be made to the way the contract is run .
auditor general for wales jeremy colman said the contract has delivered clear improvements for gps - with better working conditions , a 10 % reduction in working hours , and an average 25 % increase in gp incomes .
gp incomes have risen by 10 % and work hours have dropped 25 % he told bbc radio wales : " what we 're saying is , the contract has succeeded in making doctors richer - that was intended and we do n't criticise that .
" it 's promoting benefits in public health , we do n't criticise that .
but what we 're saying is that the contract needs to be tightened up so that those benefits come through .
" they -lsb- the government -rsb- wanted to pay them more while getting them to do things that would be of long-term benefit to patients - not treating patients just when they are ill - registering patients for particular problems to keep them out of hospital . "
he added that the standard needed for gps to earn points for extra resources needed to continually get tighter " so that bar needs to be raised continually , so that gps are encouraged to perform better , continually " .
' dreadful slur ' the report entitled review of the new general medical services contract in wales , identified a need to monitor more closely the money given out to gp practices .
it also raised concerns about the way improvements were being measured and evaluated by local health boards -lrb- lhbs -rrb- .
dr david bailey , chairman of the bma 's gps committee , said the suggestion of the report was a " dreadful slur " on family doctors .
he said : " what they are saying is that because the lhbs are n't doing their job then maybe we 're committing fraud .
now that 's not acceptable .
" we 're completely happy with the whole idea of much more rigorous and much more focused checking , that 's fine .
we have nothing to hide . "
vacancy rates the report found general practice was now a more attractive option for young doctors , and that , across wales , it had led to the oversubscription in trainee schemes and a reduction in vacancy levels .
however , vacancy rates remain higher in wales -lrb- 1.8 % -rrb- than in england -lrb- 0.7 % -rrb- , and there has actually been an increase in vacancies in north wales -lrb- 3.6 % -rrb- .
gp practices now also have more funding for services to offer their patients - leading to an improvement in the baseline activity of practices , and the quality of care for patients in many areas , claims the report .
the report added the level of care had also improved , with the vast majority of patients able to expect to see their gp promptly , and most practices in wales now demonstrating they were meeting acceptable standards .
in a statement , the welsh assembly government said " health minister edwina hart had " noted the report and will consider the recommendations " .

it used ibm rscs protocols an alternative to tcpip to connect the city university new york and yale university in may 1981 .
at its peak bitnet linked over a thousand organisations in 49 countries .
july , 1981 the national science foundation launches its own network for us universities most universities had no connection with the us department of defense and so could not access arpanet .

more regional networks were added later .
november , 1987 early internet upgraded from 56kbps to 1.544mbps the nsfnet upgraded to 1.544 mbps t1 standard in november 1987 .

while syria has given all iraqis access to its education and health services , the sheer number of refugees seeking help mean most do n't get what they need .
the syrian government estimates there are 1.7 million iraqis within its borders .
the un refugee agency , unhcr , puts the total at 1.4 million .
un children 's fund , unicef believes around half of all iraqi refugees in syria are of school age .
most are unable to attend classes because their families fled without the documents they need to enter the syrian education system - and because of poverty .
my children have no future .
they should be continuing their studies , but we can not afford it adnan abdulhamid hassan when saed shaker , 14 , fled iraq with his family , he had no idea what lay ahead .
saed has ended up selling iraqi sweets in a suburb of damascus with a big iraqi refugee population .
he earns 150 syrian pounds a day -lrb- uk £ 1.50 -rrb- .
" i came with my family a year ago .
i have no documents on me to be able to register at school .
but i also need to work to support my family and help my father " .
saed is one of many iraqi children who are trapped in poverty with little chance of escape through education .
back to school only 33,000 iraqi refugee children attended school in syria in 2007 .
unicef 's deputy representative in syria , mark luce says the aim is to get 100,000 iraqi students into the school system in 2007-2008 - an ambitious target .
un agencies have offered support and they are asking donor countries to do more .
unfortunately the usa - which is the main reason behind this crisis - has n't offered financial support to host countries dr maher al-husami syrian minister " unicef will provide training for teachers and help improve the school environment .
unhcr will focus on the actual school buildings and their infrastructure . "
the unhcr has already rehabilitated 11 schools in and around damascus .
it is preparing 70-100 schools for the new academic year , as well as building from scratch eight new schools .
unhcr and unicef have launched a global appeal to help cover the costs for such programmes in syria and jordan .
syria 's public higher education system is also technically open to all iraqis .
however , as the syrian curriculum is different from the iraqi one , many students are unable to join .
going private private universities offer iraqis the chance to study within an international system - if they can afford it .
the syrian international university is dedicated largely to the iraqi community .
the dean is iraqi , as are most of the students and other professors .
poverty and despair lead people to criminality .
the social , security and economic impact of the huge number of iraqi refugees is very clear in syria radwan nouicer unhcr abdul nasser khaled hamzeh , 20 , is studying computer engineering .
" i had to leave baghdad ; men are targeted there .
this university is a great opportunity for me .
we follow the same system we used to follow in baghdad . "
abdul nasser is one of the privileged few who can afford the us $ 4,000 -lrb- uk £ 2,100 -rrb- university joining fee .
adnan abdulhamid hassan is a father of five .
his younger children are going to school but they also have to earn money once classes are over .
his eldest son omar , 21 , is working in a restaurant to support the family .
adnan bitterly regrets that his son can not continue his education .
" we arrived in damascus two years ago ; we were targeted by militias so we had to escape .
my children have no future .
they should be continuing their studies , but it is so hard on us , we can not afford it " .
true costs in april , syria asked the international donors ' conference for us $ 256 million over two years to help cover the cost of delivering basic services to iraqis .
unhcr has delivered us $ 45 million of this so far .
syrian officials say the iraqi refugee crisis is costing the country around us $ 1 billion a year .
a syrian government minister , dr maher al-husami , told the bbc at a recent health conference in damascus , that syria needs more outside help .
" un agencies have offered support and they are asking donor countries to do more .
unfortunately the usa - which is the main reason behind this crisis - has n't offered financial support to host countries . "
people working with the refugees suggest that the cost should not be measured in financial terms alone .

while syria has given all iraqis access to its education and health services , the sheer number of refugees seeking help mean most do n't get what they need .
the syrian government estimates there are 1.7 million iraqis within its borders .
the un refugee agency , unhcr , puts the total at 1.4 million .
un children 's fund , unicef believes around half of all iraqi refugees in syria are of school age .
most are unable to attend classes because their families fled without the documents they need to enter the syrian education system - and because of poverty .
my children have no future .
they should be continuing their studies , but we can not afford it adnan abdulhamid hassan when saed shaker , 14 , fled iraq with his family , he had no idea what lay ahead .
saed has ended up selling iraqi sweets in a suburb of damascus with a big iraqi refugee population .
he earns 150 syrian pounds a day -lrb- uk £ 1.50 -rrb- .
" i came with my family a year ago .
i have no documents on me to be able to register at school .
but i also need to work to support my family and help my father " .
saed is one of many iraqi children who are trapped in poverty with little chance of escape through education .
back to school only 33,000 iraqi refugee children attended school in syria in 2007 .
unicef 's deputy representative in syria , mark luce says the aim is to get 100,000 iraqi students into the school system in 2007-2008 - an ambitious target .
un agencies have offered support and they are asking donor countries to do more .
unfortunately the usa - which is the main reason behind this crisis - has n't offered financial support to host countries dr maher al-husami syrian minister " unicef will provide training for teachers and help improve the school environment .
unhcr will focus on the actual school buildings and their infrastructure . "
the unhcr has already rehabilitated 11 schools in and around damascus .
it is preparing 70-100 schools for the new academic year , as well as building from scratch eight new schools .
unhcr and unicef have launched a global appeal to help cover the costs for such programmes in syria and jordan .
syria 's public higher education system is also technically open to all iraqis .
however , as the syrian curriculum is different from the iraqi one , many students are unable to join .
going private private universities offer iraqis the chance to study within an international system - if they can afford it .
the syrian international university is dedicated largely to the iraqi community .
the dean is iraqi , as are most of the students and other professors .
poverty and despair lead people to criminality .
