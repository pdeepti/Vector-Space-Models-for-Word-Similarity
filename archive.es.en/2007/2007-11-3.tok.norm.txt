the move raised germany 's eastern neighbors ' fears of brain drain . the german labor ministry confirmed that the " priority test " that job applicants from these countries previously had to undergo had been dropped , as announced in september . as of nov .
1 , german companies have been permitted to hire skilled workers from electrical and mechanical engineering sectors without giving priority to german applicants .
changes to labor laws now also permit foreign graduates of german universities to work in the country for three years . when the plan was announced earlier this year , german chancellor angela merkel said the government 's priority would be to " give a chance to those people in germany who are unemployed . " economic boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german economic data is improving , though not all germans are benefiting germany 's unemployment in october fell below 3.5 million for the first time since 1995 and german firms are scrambling to find engineers and other highly skilled employees . but the partial opening has raised concerns in eastern europe that more highly skilled workers could leave , worsening the skills shortages that have already developed in this boom conditions . poland has been particularly affected .
since joining the eu in may 2004 , some two million mainly younger poles have sought work abroad , many in britain , which opened its borders when poland joined the eu . the situation in the czech republic is similar to poland 's .
according to official statistics , czech firms already lack at least 50,000 workers qualified in various technical professions . " the czech republic is preparing a green-card program , which could cover the shortages in some professions , " a spokeswoman for the czech confederation of industry , blanka ruzickova , told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .
" but if those who already work here leave , the problem could intensify .
it puts us in jeopardy to a certain level . " ruzickova added that the extent of the damage would depend on german firms ' qualification demands . " if they require a good knowledge of german , the drain may not be so large , " she said . not all companies concerned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skoda is n't worried about losing its employees to german competition volkswagen-owned skoda auto , the czech republic 's largest automaker , was unconcerned that its engineers would head west . " skoda 's social benefits are above standard , and keeping a job in the future also plays a considerable role , " skoda auto spokesman jaroslav cerny told dpa . there was also concern in bulgaria , which joined the eu with romania in january this year . " the opening of german borders for engineers could give its new eu partner bulgaria a heavy blow , " a professor in sofia said , pointing to salaries in germany that would far exceed the average at bulgarian companies . the country has already lost highly skilled people to the united states and canada , and foreign investors have begun to complain about a lack of highly skilled young engineers . the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia joined the eu in may 2004 , while bulgaria and romania became members at the beginning of 2007 . germany was one of many eu countries that closed its labor market to the eight eastern european countries that joined the eu in 2004 along with cyprus and malta . the restrictions were imposed for three years and then extended for a further two years to 2009 .
a final possible extension to 2011 is a hotly debated topic in germany , with business in favor of opening up and politicians largely against . britain , ireland and sweden opened their labor markets immediately , and most other " old " eu members have since followed . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the move raised germany 's eastern neighbors ' fears of brain drain . the german labor ministry confirmed that the " priority test " that job applicants from these countries previously had to undergo had been dropped , as announced in september . as of nov .
1 , german companies have been permitted to hire skilled workers from electrical and mechanical engineering sectors without giving priority to german applicants .
changes to labor laws now also permit foreign graduates of german universities to work in the country for three years . when the plan was announced earlier this year , german chancellor angela merkel said the government 's priority would be to " give a chance to those people in germany who are unemployed . " economic boom bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german economic data is improving , though not all germans are benefiting germany 's unemployment in october fell below 3.5 million for the first time since 1995 and german firms are scrambling to find engineers and other highly skilled employees . but the partial opening has raised concerns in eastern europe that more highly skilled workers could leave , worsening the skills shortages that have already developed in this boom conditions . poland has been particularly affected .
since joining the eu in may 2004 , some two million mainly younger poles have sought work abroad , many in britain , which opened its borders when poland joined the eu . the situation in the czech republic is similar to poland 's .
according to official statistics , czech firms already lack at least 50,000 workers qualified in various technical professions . " the czech republic is preparing a green-card program , which could cover the shortages in some professions , " a spokeswoman for the czech confederation of industry , blanka ruzickova , told deutsche presse-agentur dpa .
" but if those who already work here leave , the problem could intensify .
it puts us in jeopardy to a certain level . " ruzickova added that the extent of the damage would depend on german firms ' qualification demands . " if they require a good knowledge of german , the drain may not be so large , " she said . not all companies concerned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : skoda is n't worried about losing its employees to german competition volkswagen-owned skoda auto , the czech republic 's largest automaker , was unconcerned that its engineers would head west . " skoda 's social benefits are above standard , and keeping a job in the future also plays a considerable role , " skoda auto spokesman jaroslav cerny told dpa . there was also concern in bulgaria , which joined the eu with romania in january this year . " the opening of german borders for engineers could give its new eu partner bulgaria a heavy blow , " a professor in sofia said , pointing to salaries in germany that would far exceed the average at bulgarian companies . the country has already lost highly skilled people to the united states and canada , and foreign investors have begun to complain about a lack of highly skilled young engineers . the czech republic , estonia , hungary , latvia , lithuania , poland , slovakia and slovenia joined the eu in may 2004 , while bulgaria and romania became members at the beginning of 2007 . germany was one of many eu countries that closed its labor market to the eight eastern european countries that joined the eu in 2004 along with cyprus and malta . the restrictions were imposed for three years and then extended for a further two years to 2009 .
a final possible extension to 2011 is a hotly debated topic in germany , with business in favor of opening up and politicians largely against . britain , ireland and sweden opened their labor markets immediately , and most other " old " eu members have since followed . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the men are being sent home after being accused of sexual misconduct and abuse .
officials say the law will take its course once the soldiers arrive back in sri lanka , but warn that little tangible evidence has been produced .

michelle montas un spokesman sri lanka 's foreign secretary , dr palitha kohona , said the allegations against the soldiers were a blight on what he described as the country 's stunningly good record in united nations peacekeeping .
he added though that little tangible evidence had been provided by the united nations , which might make it difficult to bring them before a court .
the un mission in haiti has requested an immediate investigation by the organisation 's internal watchdog .
the un has a " zero tolerance " policy on peacekeepers visiting prostitutes , regardless of local laws .

member states are supplying about 100,000 troops to peacekeeping operations worldwide .
the 950-strong peacekeeping operation in haiti is the first to which sri lanka has sent a full contingent of troops , although some officers have joined earlier missions .

bbc news -pipe- programmes -pipe- from our own correspondent -pipe- the silencing of uzbekistan 's voice home news sport radio tv weather languages low graphics -pipe- accessibility help bbc news channel news services your news when you want it from our own correspondent archive about the programme faqs related bbc sites sport weather on this day editors ' blog last updated : saturday , 3 november 2007 , 12:06 gmt e-mail this to a friend printable version the silencing of uzbekistan 's voice by natalia antelava bbc news behind every international story that you read , every radio report that you hear or television piece that you watch , there is likely to be a person that we - the reporters - rarely mention .
uncovering the truth of story was paramount to alisher often it is the first person we meet when we fly into a foreign country .
someone who explains to us the nuts and bolts of the story we have come to cover , who fills us in on what is happening on the ground and puts us in touch with vital contacts .
this person is a local journalist .
and after we - the global media - exhaust our short attention span and leave , our local colleagues stay behind .
they have the story that we tell in passing .
their main sources are people in the streets and they are , more often than not , the first ones to get the word out .
in many ways , they are the real journalists .
and the best i have ever known was alisher saipov .
reporting reality twenty-six years old , slim , boyish and restless , alisher had dedicated his entire life to telling the story of a place that many people know little about : uzbekistan .
methodical , passionate and thorough , he dug deeper than anyone else into the reality of president islam karimov 's uzbekistan it is central asia 's most populous country and home to what some have described as one of the world 's most oppressive regimes .
an ethnic uzbek himself , alisher grew up just across the border from uzbekistan , in the kyrgyz town of osh .
he used to say that gave him a degree of freedom , and the responsibility to speak up for those who did not have a voice .
" freedom is a precious commodity , and it should not be wasted , " he once told me .
he did not waste a second of it .
for alisher , journalism was not just a job , it was a tool , an instrument to push for what he saw as desperately needed change .
methodical , passionate and thorough , he dug deeper than anyone else into the reality of president islam karimov 's uzbekistan .
he wrote endlessly about torture in uzbek prisons , about the total clampdown on dissent , about the economic collapse of what was once the region 's richest nation , and about the rise of islamic radicalism , driven - he always said - by the government 's persecution of muslims in uzbekistan .
with his sound recorder , a camera strapped around his shoulder , and a cheeky smile stretched across his face , he was constantly on the move - investigating , writing , planning and dreaming .
his contacts ranged from islamic radicals to politicians , from refugees to secret service officers .
whether it was a man on the run , or the man who was after him , alisher always seemed to have the phone number .
he went where others would not go , and asked questions no one dared to raise .
he was - we used to joke - the king of scoops , the master of making headlines .
kidnap reports i first met alisher in the aftermath of a bloody crackdown in the uzbek city of andijan in 2005 , where government troops opened fire on demonstrators , killing hundreds of civilians .
hundreds more fled across the border , into southern kyrgyzstan .
alisher 's investigations revealed that the uzbek security services were kidnapping some of these refugees and taking them back to uzbek jails .
he was the first person to warn that mr karimov 's hand had stretched far beyond his country 's borders .
just over two weeks ago , thrilled and overflowing with pride , he showed me his new project : an uzbek-language newspaper .
he was beginning to feature heavily on uzbek state-controlled television , portrayed as a terrorist , a dangerous man with a hidden agenda published in kyrgyzstan and smuggled across the border by traders and merchants , it was the only uzbek-language publication that challenged the authorities .
the paper was becoming increasingly popular ahead of the december presidential election , in which mr karimov is seeking re-election .
and , with its popularity , alisher 's name too was gaining prominence .
he was beginning to feature heavily on uzbek state-controlled television , portrayed as a terrorist , a dangerous man with a hidden agenda of overthrowing the uzbek state .
the last time i saw him he told me that there were even rumours that the uzbek government had put a price on his head .
chilling message we talked for hours that evening - about his paper , about the upcoming election and about reports of a fresh wave of repression .
but more than anything else , we talked about his new family - his young wife and newborn baby daughter .
witnesses in andijan said hundreds were killed by uzbek troops " being a dad , " he said to me , " is like discovering a whole new world . "
he only had three months to enjoy being a father .
on october 24 , at 1900 local time , as he walked out from his office in the centre of osh , a gunmen fired three bullets into his head and chest .
his murder was an execution .
and it sent a chilling message not just to his friends , but to all of his colleagues around the world who live and work in dangerous places .
a message to all of those who give their communities a voice , who are trying to promote freedom in countries which does not exist .
to all of those whose names you may not know , but without whom we could never tell you the full story .

uncovering the truth of story was paramount to alisher often it is the first person we meet when we fly into a foreign country .
someone who explains to us the nuts and bolts of the story we have come to cover , who fills us in on what is happening on the ground and puts us in touch with vital contacts .
this person is a local journalist .
and after we - the global media - exhaust our short attention span and leave , our local colleagues stay behind .
they have the story that we tell in passing .
their main sources are people in the streets and they are , more often than not , the first ones to get the word out .
in many ways , they are the real journalists .
and the best i have ever known was alisher saipov .
reporting reality twenty-six years old , slim , boyish and restless , alisher had dedicated his entire life to telling the story of a place that many people know little about : uzbekistan .
methodical , passionate and thorough , he dug deeper than anyone else into the reality of president islam karimov 's uzbekistan it is central asia 's most populous country and home to what some have described as one of the world 's most oppressive regimes .
an ethnic uzbek himself , alisher grew up just across the border from uzbekistan , in the kyrgyz town of osh .
he used to say that gave him a degree of freedom , and the responsibility to speak up for those who did not have a voice .
" freedom is a precious commodity , and it should not be wasted , " he once told me .
he did not waste a second of it .
for alisher , journalism was not just a job , it was a tool , an instrument to push for what he saw as desperately needed change .
methodical , passionate and thorough , he dug deeper than anyone else into the reality of president islam karimov 's uzbekistan .
he wrote endlessly about torture in uzbek prisons , about the total clampdown on dissent , about the economic collapse of what was once the region 's richest nation , and about the rise of islamic radicalism , driven - he always said - by the government 's persecution of muslims in uzbekistan .
with his sound recorder , a camera strapped around his shoulder , and a cheeky smile stretched across his face , he was constantly on the move - investigating , writing , planning and dreaming .
his contacts ranged from islamic radicals to politicians , from refugees to secret service officers .
whether it was a man on the run , or the man who was after him , alisher always seemed to have the phone number .
he went where others would not go , and asked questions no one dared to raise .
he was - we used to joke - the king of scoops , the master of making headlines .
kidnap reports i first met alisher in the aftermath of a bloody crackdown in the uzbek city of andijan in 2005 , where government troops opened fire on demonstrators , killing hundreds of civilians .
hundreds more fled across the border , into southern kyrgyzstan .
alisher 's investigations revealed that the uzbek security services were kidnapping some of these refugees and taking them back to uzbek jails .
he was the first person to warn that mr karimov 's hand had stretched far beyond his country 's borders .
just over two weeks ago , thrilled and overflowing with pride , he showed me his new project : an uzbek-language newspaper .
he was beginning to feature heavily on uzbek state-controlled television , portrayed as a terrorist , a dangerous man with a hidden agenda published in kyrgyzstan and smuggled across the border by traders and merchants , it was the only uzbek-language publication that challenged the authorities .
the paper was becoming increasingly popular ahead of the december presidential election , in which mr karimov is seeking re-election .
and , with its popularity , alisher 's name too was gaining prominence .
he was beginning to feature heavily on uzbek state-controlled television , portrayed as a terrorist , a dangerous man with a hidden agenda of overthrowing the uzbek state .
the last time i saw him he told me that there were even rumours that the uzbek government had put a price on his head .
chilling message we talked for hours that evening - about his paper , about the upcoming election and about reports of a fresh wave of repression .
but more than anything else , we talked about his new family - his young wife and newborn baby daughter .
witnesses in andijan said hundreds were killed by uzbek troops " being a dad , " he said to me , " is like discovering a whole new world . "
he only had three months to enjoy being a father .
on october 24 , at 1900 local time , as he walked out from his office in the centre of osh , a gunmen fired three bullets into his head and chest .
his murder was an execution .
and it sent a chilling message not just to his friends , but to all of his colleagues around the world who live and work in dangerous places .
a message to all of those who give their communities a voice , who are trying to promote freedom in countries which does not exist .
to all of those whose names you may not know , but without whom we could never tell you the full story .
