the book has moved many to take a closer look at a politician known as much for his partying as his policies . to some observers , the fact that klaus wowereit published his memoirs in september at the age of 53 was a case of a heightened sense of self-importance , perhaps even arrogance , or at least jumping the gun . his book , although entitled " … and that 's ok - my life in politics , " does not present a new political philosophy or ideas on how germany can succeed in a globalized economy .
rather , these are stories from his own life , of his hardscrabble childhood , his school days , his entry into public office , his finding love and happiness .
politics is present , but plays a secondary role . but those who think the book is nothing more than a vanity project by someone who believes his own life is inspirational are likely underestimating wowereit 's political and media savvy .
indeed , many observers think the book is an announcement by the social democratic , openly gay mayor to the public and his own spd party that berlin 's city hall is not the last stop on his political journey . " wowereit wants to play a larger role in national politics , " said gero neugebauer , professor emeritus of political science at berlin 's free university .
" this book allowed him to get into the media and get people talking about him again . " but all the talk has not necessarily been positive , and while wowereit is used to criticism as mayor of germany 's capital and largest city , his hinting at a desire to reach greater political heights has turned up the intensity of the spotlight on him . bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit partying in berlin with entertainer desirée nick public outing , skyrocketing popularity his book 's title references the event that turned wowereit from a local politician into an a-list celebrity who just happened to also sit in the mayor 's office .
in 2001 , during the campaign , he outed himself publicly in a speech with the words : " i 'm gay , and that 's ok . " suddenly , berlin had a mayor who seemed perfectly in synch with the city itself - open , risk-taking and just a step outside of the mainstream .
there was n't much industry to be found in the capital and unemployment was higher than almost anywhere else in germany , but it certainly knew how to party .
manufacturing sites were rare , but one could n't throw a rock without hitting a club or bar . wowereit could be found in more than a few of those locales , or at society functions , pressing the flesh and having a good time .
his office even came up with an unofficial slogan for berlin , " poor , but sexy . "
people lapped it up ; and with an opposition in disarray , wowereit 's popularity grew . the right stuff ? but as it looks like berlin might be too small a pond for " wowi , " as he 's affectionately known , critics are looking at his record and wondering if he has what it takes to jump to the federal level – and maybe one day even run for the top job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit and his partner jörn kubicki his sexuality does n't seem to figure large .
newspaper headlines have been fond of the expression " gay chancellor " of late and germans themselves are n't put off by it .
in a recent survey , 79 percent of germans said they did n't think homosexuality was a stumbling block on the way to the chancellery . " i think the population is further along than politicians when it comes to that , " said klaus jetz , director of the gay and lesbian federation of germany , who said he was n't surprised at the poll results .
" the sexuality of a chancellor does n't influence his or her policies . " that may be true , say others , but add that wowereit 's record in berlin , particularly when it comes to attracting industry , is not particularly good .
the berlin office of the free democrats , germany 's free-market liberal party , recently sent the mayor a book entitled " klaus wowereit 's ideas for more economic growth and jobs in berlin . "
the book was blank . while the mayor shows enthusiasm for attracting media and other creative - read " sexy " - companies to the capital , critics say he is blasé about getting big players here which could employ big numbers . " in general , he has an attitude that is hostile to the economy , " said markus löning , chair of the berlin fdp . " business people who are interested in investing in berlin ca n't even get an appointment with him . " others question his intellectual heft , and even wowereit himself admits in his book he was never a big reader .
in a questionnaire the mayor filled out at the end of 2004 , he could n't name the date the second world war began , the answer to 3 + 8 x 2 , or spell " rhythm . " in a blistering critique in the süddeutsche zeitung daily , long-time foreign correspondent roger boyes wrote : " often wowi simply acts like a bored teenager . " slow and steady - he 's got time but political scientist neugebauer is less critical of the mayor 's performance in office , saying he has made the best out of the very bad situation he found when he got there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wowereit is never been one to shy away from celebrities - here with sylvester stallone wowereit was able to bring the berlin spd out of a long-term crisis , has given berlin a new international profile that has brought in streams of tourists and has gotten the city 's budget under control by enacting strict spending controls .
his office has stepped up its efforts to bring high-tech and service sector jobs to the city . " he 's working with what he 's got , and going step by step , " said neugebauer , similar to the strategy of another german politician , angela merkel . and he can wait , he added , he 's young enough .

germany 's watertight defence did n't concede a single goal in the tournament , the first time ever that a soccer side has managed the feat .
31,000 fans in shanghai 's hongkou football stadium watched the fast-paced fifa women 's world cup final .
brazilian star striker marta , the top scorer in the tournament , failed to get in a penalty kick past goalkeeper nadine angerer , a goal which would have tied the game in the second half .
bildunterschrift : brazil 's marta grimaces after she failed to score a penalty kick " after the penalty save , i felt it was meant to be , " germany coach silvia neid said .
" we worked hard for each other , it was a great team performance .
it was important to work against marta , and we did a good job in pushing her to the sidelines . "
missed chances the nimble-footed brazilians were the better side in the first half , playing a fast aggressive game and piling up the pressure on the german defense .
marta , who won the best player of the tournament award , had the first chance of the game in the fourth minute with a long range drive stopped easily by angerer . seconds later , the physically stronger germans went on the attack when kerstin garefrekes was set free on the right only to slice her shot into the side netting .
in the eight minute , germany 's powerful defense seemed to falter for an instant when goalkeeper angerer failed to gather a free kick by brazil 's daniela .
the ball bounced out to formiga but she was unable to put the ball in the net .
daniela had another chance in the 23rd minute but was unlucky when she shot a left foot volley onto the post .
heroic saves by german goalie the germans finally picked up pace in the second half , determinedly pushing forward .
but it was only in the 52nd minute that they managed the breakthrough when captain birgit prinz was fed a pass by sandra smisek .
the veteran forward coolly slotted in the crossed ball on the turn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's defender aline , german forward sandra smisek and german midfielder melanie behringer fight for the ball but it was angerer who was the hero of the day when she stopped the spot kick by martha with her knees and then again when she held a flying strike by substitute rosana .
despite dominating ball possession , brazil 's spirited attack failed to break through the solid german defense and they failed to find an equalizer .
a stunning header by simone laudehr in the dying minutes of the game clinched the game for the ruthlessly efficient german side .
" germany deserved to win " " this was a very tough match , we missed a lot of chances especially when we were 1-0 down and marta missed a critical penalty , " said brazil coach jorge barcellos .
" but germany took their chances and scored .
i 'm very sad about this result but my players tried their best . "

eu justice commissioner franco frattini is pushing for greater powers to monitor the web .
frattini is in favor of developing technology to block and monitor internet sites offering bomb-making recipes as well as making online recruiting of terrorists a punishable offense .

online surveillance being stepped up in response to a recent series of arrests and the unfolding of terror plots and planned strikes in sweden , germany and austria , individual countries in europe are already moving ahead to step up surveillance of the internet .
in germany , interior minister wolfgang schäuble is seeking powers allowing investigators to send software that secretly installs itself on specific computers , relaying data to police computers as users operate online .

the commissioner also wants to create an eu-wide data bank in which police across the bloc can enter information on the theft of explosives .
the measure will help authorities follow the trail of terrorists faster and thus thwart attacks , according to frattini .
the eu commissioner is to present the exact details of his counterterrorism proposals in early november .

the former world chess champion faces a daunting challenge , as pro-kremlin candidates are expected to win . kasparov is a leading force behind other russia , a coalition which unites liberals , leftists and nationalists who oppose russian president vladimir putin .
the russian constitution requires putin to step down after serving two four-year terms .
his has yet to endorse a potential successor , but his approval is seen as pivotal to the upcoming elections , which will be held in march 2 , 2008 .
kasparov 's coalition has little public support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign season is just around the corner kasparov , 44 , won 379 of 498 votes at other russia coalition 's national congress .
yet kasparov 's place on the march ballot remains uncertain .
his candidacy needs to be registered and will likely be blocked .
even if he is allowed to run , kasparov is not expected to pose a major threat to putin 's candidate .
while kasparov is well known in europe for his chess exploits , the latest poll by the independent levada news agency shows 3 percent of russians will vote for the other russia candidate .
" the goal of the other russia is not winning elections , but to have an election , " kasparov said , speaking in english on the sidelines of the congress .
" we 're trying to force the regime to accept our right to participate in free and fair elections , to agitate the russian population and the russian public to support our ideas . "
kasparov calls for unity in opposing kremlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin won easily last time around kasparov says that putin 's broad public support comes from the kremlin 's control over the media and the electoral process .
" i will do everything possible for the ideas of other russia to win .
this will work only if we stay united , " kasparov said , adding the coalition stood for a " democratic and just russia . "
the other russia coalition is hampered by internal divisions and has been marginalized by the authorities .
kasparov founded the coalition in 2005 after a successful chess career .
kasparov faces challenge of his career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's like a game of chess kasparov is fond on comparing current political battles to his famous duels with anatoly karpov in the 1980s .

and this evaluation does n't have anything to do with the fact that the german team succeeded in winning its second title in a row - something the men 's team has still never done . the 16 national teams have spectacularly shown that women 's soccer has absolutely nothing to do with the seemingly ineradicable views of armchair players .
the world cup was , without a doubt , a tournament played at a high technical and tactical level .
women 's soccer today is fairer than men 's , offensive and well-played at a pace that has clearly sped up .
of course , the men are still faster , but that 's the case in track and field , too .
are those races any more boring because of it ? the journey women 's soccer has taken from its beginnings when it was often chuckled at - or even openly ridiculed - can be shown in many ways .
while the women on the german team who won the 1989 european championships were rewarded with a coffee set , each member of the 2007 team will receive 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 71,165 -rrb- for winning the title .

while the 1999 cup was broadcast in 67 countries , this time around it was 220 - and german television ratings were very high . the world cup in china has doubtlessly given women 's soccer a new worldwide impulse for further development .
the announcement from brazil to introduce a real professional league as soon as possible is only a small , first step .
if the sport still does n't make a giant leap in terms of public perception then it 's because of limited funding and the lack of a league structure . in comparison with men , there are also simply fewer women playing soccer , which lowers the number of truly gifted players .
the result is that the level of club soccer varies from club to club and is clearly lower than the soccer played by national teams .
that 's a reason why organizers should carefully consider whether the plan to increase the number of teams at the next world cup from 16 to 24 is the right decision . the world cup was also another test for the beijing summer olympics in 2008 , and it was a test spectators passed with flying colors while small and usually insignificant mistakes tarnished the organizers ' results . it leaves a bitter taste in many mouths when teams complain of sports espionage , journalists and players are constantly monitored and even have the feeling of being watched in their hotel rooms .

europeans are divided on whether to refer to it as burma or myanmar . pro-democracy demonstrations led by buddhist monks clad in orange robes have grabbed headlines in recent weeks .
in the media coverage , the country is variously referred to as burma or myanmar .
in europe , no concensus exists on how to refer to the former british colony of burma , which won independence in 1948 .
both versions have linguistic legitimacy .
in the burmese language , myanmar is the formal term and burma is the informal , everyday word .
official name change dates to 1989 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to china , it 's myanmar as far as the military junta is concerned , their country should be referred to as myanmar .
the junta officially changed the english name in 1989 .
yet the change was not universally adopted .
in europe , great britain and ireland do not recognize the legitimacy of the military junta and have also continued to use burma exclusively .
exiles also refer to it as burma .
the united nations , recognizing a country 's right to call itself as it wishes , uses myanmar , as do france and germany .
yet while germany 's foreign ministry uses myanmar , the german media use burma .
the european union sits squarely on the fence , referring to the country burma / myanmar in documents on its web site .
the united states government , like britain , does n't recognize the legitimacy of the military rulers in myanmar , and calls the country burma .
but major media outlets such as the new york times , cnn and the associated press refer to it as myanmar .

china , which has been supportive of the military regime , refers to the country as myanmar .
" myanmar is a kind of indicator of countries that are soft on the regime , " mark farmener of burma campaign in the uk told the bbc .
" but really it 's not important .
who cares what people call the country ?
it 's the human rights abuses that matter . "
the tipping point for the current unrest was the government 's decision in mid-august to double fuel prices .
myanmar was relatively prosperous when it gained independence from britain in 1945 , but after 45 years of military rule and economic hardship , it is one of the world 's poorest countries .
in 1988 , a series of peaceful protests led to the current military government seizing power .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 01.10.2007 as berlin mayor looks to own political future , scrutiny grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit poses with a copy of his autobiography berlin mayor klaus wowereit 's recent memoir has ignited discussion about his future political ambitions .
the book has moved many to take a closer look at a politician known as much for his partying as his policies . to some observers , the fact that klaus wowereit published his memoirs in september at the age of 53 was a case of a heightened sense of self-importance , perhaps even arrogance , or at least jumping the gun . his book , although entitled " … and that 's ok - my life in politics , " does not present a new political philosophy or ideas on how germany can succeed in a globalized economy .
rather , these are stories from his own life , of his hardscrabble childhood , his school days , his entry into public office , his finding love and happiness .
politics is present , but plays a secondary role . but those who think the book is nothing more than a vanity project by someone who believes his own life is inspirational are likely underestimating wowereit 's political and media savvy .
indeed , many observers think the book is an announcement by the social democratic , openly gay mayor to the public and his own spd party that berlin 's city hall is not the last stop on his political journey . " wowereit wants to play a larger role in national politics , " said gero neugebauer , professor emeritus of political science at berlin 's free university .
" this book allowed him to get into the media and get people talking about him again . " but all the talk has not necessarily been positive , and while wowereit is used to criticism as mayor of germany 's capital and largest city , his hinting at a desire to reach greater political heights has turned up the intensity of the spotlight on him . bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit partying in berlin with entertainer desirée nick public outing , skyrocketing popularity his book 's title references the event that turned wowereit from a local politician into an a-list celebrity who just happened to also sit in the mayor 's office .
in 2001 , during the campaign , he outed himself publicly in a speech with the words : " i 'm gay , and that 's ok . " suddenly , berlin had a mayor who seemed perfectly in synch with the city itself - open , risk-taking and just a step outside of the mainstream .
there was n't much industry to be found in the capital and unemployment was higher than almost anywhere else in germany , but it certainly knew how to party .
manufacturing sites were rare , but one could n't throw a rock without hitting a club or bar . wowereit could be found in more than a few of those locales , or at society functions , pressing the flesh and having a good time .
his office even came up with an unofficial slogan for berlin , " poor , but sexy . "
people lapped it up ; and with an opposition in disarray , wowereit 's popularity grew . the right stuff ? but as it looks like berlin might be too small a pond for " wowi , " as he 's affectionately known , critics are looking at his record and wondering if he has what it takes to jump to the federal level – and maybe one day even run for the top job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit and his partner jörn kubicki his sexuality does n't seem to figure large .
newspaper headlines have been fond of the expression " gay chancellor " of late and germans themselves are n't put off by it .
in a recent survey , 79 percent of germans said they did n't think homosexuality was a stumbling block on the way to the chancellery . " i think the population is further along than politicians when it comes to that , " said klaus jetz , director of the gay and lesbian federation of germany , who said he was n't surprised at the poll results .
" the sexuality of a chancellor does n't influence his or her policies . " that may be true , say others , but add that wowereit 's record in berlin , particularly when it comes to attracting industry , is not particularly good .
the berlin office of the free democrats , germany 's free-market liberal party , recently sent the mayor a book entitled " klaus wowereit 's ideas for more economic growth and jobs in berlin . "
the book was blank . while the mayor shows enthusiasm for attracting media and other creative - read " sexy " - companies to the capital , critics say he is blasé about getting big players here which could employ big numbers . " in general , he has an attitude that is hostile to the economy , " said markus löning , chair of the berlin fdp .

the book has moved many to take a closer look at a politician known as much for his partying as his policies . to some observers , the fact that klaus wowereit published his memoirs in september at the age of 53 was a case of a heightened sense of self-importance , perhaps even arrogance , or at least jumping the gun . his book , although entitled " … and that 's ok - my life in politics , " does not present a new political philosophy or ideas on how germany can succeed in a globalized economy .
rather , these are stories from his own life , of his hardscrabble childhood , his school days , his entry into public office , his finding love and happiness .
politics is present , but plays a secondary role . but those who think the book is nothing more than a vanity project by someone who believes his own life is inspirational are likely underestimating wowereit 's political and media savvy .
indeed , many observers think the book is an announcement by the social democratic , openly gay mayor to the public and his own spd party that berlin 's city hall is not the last stop on his political journey . " wowereit wants to play a larger role in national politics , " said gero neugebauer , professor emeritus of political science at berlin 's free university .
" this book allowed him to get into the media and get people talking about him again . " but all the talk has not necessarily been positive , and while wowereit is used to criticism as mayor of germany 's capital and largest city , his hinting at a desire to reach greater political heights has turned up the intensity of the spotlight on him . bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit partying in berlin with entertainer desirée nick public outing , skyrocketing popularity his book 's title references the event that turned wowereit from a local politician into an a-list celebrity who just happened to also sit in the mayor 's office .
in 2001 , during the campaign , he outed himself publicly in a speech with the words : " i 'm gay , and that 's ok . " suddenly , berlin had a mayor who seemed perfectly in synch with the city itself - open , risk-taking and just a step outside of the mainstream .
there was n't much industry to be found in the capital and unemployment was higher than almost anywhere else in germany , but it certainly knew how to party .
manufacturing sites were rare , but one could n't throw a rock without hitting a club or bar . wowereit could be found in more than a few of those locales , or at society functions , pressing the flesh and having a good time .
his office even came up with an unofficial slogan for berlin , " poor , but sexy . "
people lapped it up ; and with an opposition in disarray , wowereit 's popularity grew . the right stuff ? but as it looks like berlin might be too small a pond for " wowi , " as he 's affectionately known , critics are looking at his record and wondering if he has what it takes to jump to the federal level – and maybe one day even run for the top job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit and his partner jörn kubicki his sexuality does n't seem to figure large .
newspaper headlines have been fond of the expression " gay chancellor " of late and germans themselves are n't put off by it .
in a recent survey , 79 percent of germans said they did n't think homosexuality was a stumbling block on the way to the chancellery . " i think the population is further along than politicians when it comes to that , " said klaus jetz , director of the gay and lesbian federation of germany , who said he was n't surprised at the poll results .
" the sexuality of a chancellor does n't influence his or her policies . " that may be true , say others , but add that wowereit 's record in berlin , particularly when it comes to attracting industry , is not particularly good .
the berlin office of the free democrats , germany 's free-market liberal party , recently sent the mayor a book entitled " klaus wowereit 's ideas for more economic growth and jobs in berlin . "
the book was blank . while the mayor shows enthusiasm for attracting media and other creative - read " sexy " - companies to the capital , critics say he is blasé about getting big players here which could employ big numbers . " in general , he has an attitude that is hostile to the economy , " said markus löning , chair of the berlin fdp . " business people who are interested in investing in berlin ca n't even get an appointment with him . " others question his intellectual heft , and even wowereit himself admits in his book he was never a big reader .
in a questionnaire the mayor filled out at the end of 2004 , he could n't name the date the second world war began , the answer to 3 + 8 x 2 , or spell " rhythm .

europeans are divided on whether to refer to it as burma or myanmar . pro-democracy demonstrations led by buddhist monks clad in orange robes have grabbed headlines in recent weeks .
in the media coverage , the country is variously referred to as burma or myanmar .
in europe , no concensus exists on how to refer to the former british colony of burma , which won independence in 1948 .
both versions have linguistic legitimacy .
in the burmese language , myanmar is the formal term and burma is the informal , everyday word .
official name change dates to 1989 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to china , it 's myanmar as far as the military junta is concerned , their country should be referred to as myanmar .
the junta officially changed the english name in 1989 .
yet the change was not universally adopted .
in europe , great britain and ireland do not recognize the legitimacy of the military junta and have also continued to use burma exclusively .
exiles also refer to it as burma .
the united nations , recognizing a country 's right to call itself as it wishes , uses myanmar , as do france and germany .
yet while germany 's foreign ministry uses myanmar , the german media use burma .
the european union sits squarely on the fence , referring to the country burma / myanmar in documents on its web site .
the united states government , like britain , does n't recognize the legitimacy of the military rulers in myanmar , and calls the country burma .
but major media outlets such as the new york times , cnn and the associated press refer to it as myanmar .
difference of opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesting monks the name is useful in gauging how countries feel about the regime , pro-democracy activists say .
china , which has been supportive of the military regime , refers to the country as myanmar .
" myanmar is a kind of indicator of countries that are soft on the regime , " mark farmener of burma campaign in the uk told the bbc .
" but really it 's not important .
who cares what people call the country ?
it 's the human rights abuses that matter . "
the tipping point for the current unrest was the government 's decision in mid-august to double fuel prices .
myanmar was relatively prosperous when it gained independence from britain in 1945 , but after 45 years of military rule and economic hardship , it is one of the world 's poorest countries .
in 1988 , a series of peaceful protests led to the current military government seizing power .
elections took place in 1990 , in which the democracy party under the leadership of aung san suu kyi won 82 percent of the vote .
but the elections were not honored by the military regime .
rangoon vs. yangon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police have dealt violently with protestors the regime also changed the english name of myanmar 's largest city from rangoon to yangon .
in 2005 , the government decamped from yangon entirely , building a new capital from scratch , which was named naypyidaw -lrb- royal residence -rrb- .
as for how to pronounce myanmar , the bbc said that the stress can be on any of the word 's three syllables .
the first syllable can be pronounced " mee " as in " meet " or alternatively " my " as in " cry . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's watertight defence did n't concede a single goal in the tournament , the first time ever that a soccer side has managed the feat .
31,000 fans in shanghai 's hongkou football stadium watched the fast-paced fifa women 's world cup final .
brazilian star striker marta , the top scorer in the tournament , failed to get in a penalty kick past goalkeeper nadine angerer , a goal which would have tied the game in the second half .
bildunterschrift : brazil 's marta grimaces after she failed to score a penalty kick " after the penalty save , i felt it was meant to be , " germany coach silvia neid said .
" we worked hard for each other , it was a great team performance .
it was important to work against marta , and we did a good job in pushing her to the sidelines . "
missed chances the nimble-footed brazilians were the better side in the first half , playing a fast aggressive game and piling up the pressure on the german defense .
marta , who won the best player of the tournament award , had the first chance of the game in the fourth minute with a long range drive stopped easily by angerer . seconds later , the physically stronger germans went on the attack when kerstin garefrekes was set free on the right only to slice her shot into the side netting .
in the eight minute , germany 's powerful defense seemed to falter for an instant when goalkeeper angerer failed to gather a free kick by brazil 's daniela .
the ball bounced out to formiga but she was unable to put the ball in the net .
daniela had another chance in the 23rd minute but was unlucky when she shot a left foot volley onto the post .
heroic saves by german goalie the germans finally picked up pace in the second half , determinedly pushing forward .
but it was only in the 52nd minute that they managed the breakthrough when captain birgit prinz was fed a pass by sandra smisek .
the veteran forward coolly slotted in the crossed ball on the turn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's defender aline , german forward sandra smisek and german midfielder melanie behringer fight for the ball but it was angerer who was the hero of the day when she stopped the spot kick by martha with her knees and then again when she held a flying strike by substitute rosana .
despite dominating ball possession , brazil 's spirited attack failed to break through the solid german defense and they failed to find an equalizer .
a stunning header by simone laudehr in the dying minutes of the game clinched the game for the ruthlessly efficient german side .
" germany deserved to win " " this was a very tough match , we missed a lot of chances especially when we were 1-0 down and marta missed a critical penalty , " said brazil coach jorge barcellos .
" but germany took their chances and scored .
i 'm very sad about this result but my players tried their best . "
the 21-year-old marta said she was crushed after the defeat but that the team had to look ahead . " it 's difficult to express my feelings .

despite dominating ball possession , brazil 's spirited attack failed to break through the solid german defense and they failed to find an equalizer .
a stunning header by simone laudehr in the dying minutes of the game clinched the game for the ruthlessly efficient german side .
" germany deserved to win " " this was a very tough match , we missed a lot of chances especially when we were 1-0 down and marta missed a critical penalty , " said brazil coach jorge barcellos .

the book has moved many to take a closer look at a politician known as much for his partying as his policies . to some observers , the fact that klaus wowereit published his memoirs in september at the age of 53 was a case of a heightened sense of self-importance , perhaps even arrogance , or at least jumping the gun . his book , although entitled " … and that 's ok - my life in politics , " does not present a new political philosophy or ideas on how germany can succeed in a globalized economy .
rather , these are stories from his own life , of his hardscrabble childhood , his school days , his entry into public office , his finding love and happiness .
politics is present , but plays a secondary role . but those who think the book is nothing more than a vanity project by someone who believes his own life is inspirational are likely underestimating wowereit 's political and media savvy .
indeed , many observers think the book is an announcement by the social democratic , openly gay mayor to the public and his own spd party that berlin 's city hall is not the last stop on his political journey . " wowereit wants to play a larger role in national politics , " said gero neugebauer , professor emeritus of political science at berlin 's free university .
" this book allowed him to get into the media and get people talking about him again . " but all the talk has not necessarily been positive , and while wowereit is used to criticism as mayor of germany 's capital and largest city , his hinting at a desire to reach greater political heights has turned up the intensity of the spotlight on him . bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit partying in berlin with entertainer desirée nick public outing , skyrocketing popularity his book 's title references the event that turned wowereit from a local politician into an a-list celebrity who just happened to also sit in the mayor 's office .
in 2001 , during the campaign , he outed himself publicly in a speech with the words : " i 'm gay , and that 's ok . " suddenly , berlin had a mayor who seemed perfectly in synch with the city itself - open , risk-taking and just a step outside of the mainstream .
there was n't much industry to be found in the capital and unemployment was higher than almost anywhere else in germany , but it certainly knew how to party .
manufacturing sites were rare , but one could n't throw a rock without hitting a club or bar . wowereit could be found in more than a few of those locales , or at society functions , pressing the flesh and having a good time .
his office even came up with an unofficial slogan for berlin , " poor , but sexy . "
people lapped it up ; and with an opposition in disarray , wowereit 's popularity grew . the right stuff ? but as it looks like berlin might be too small a pond for " wowi , " as he 's affectionately known , critics are looking at his record and wondering if he has what it takes to jump to the federal level – and maybe one day even run for the top job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit and his partner jörn kubicki his sexuality does n't seem to figure large .
newspaper headlines have been fond of the expression " gay chancellor " of late and germans themselves are n't put off by it .
in a recent survey , 79 percent of germans said they did n't think homosexuality was a stumbling block on the way to the chancellery . " i think the population is further along than politicians when it comes to that , " said klaus jetz , director of the gay and lesbian federation of germany , who said he was n't surprised at the poll results .
" the sexuality of a chancellor does n't influence his or her policies . " that may be true , say others , but add that wowereit 's record in berlin , particularly when it comes to attracting industry , is not particularly good .
the berlin office of the free democrats , germany 's free-market liberal party , recently sent the mayor a book entitled " klaus wowereit 's ideas for more economic growth and jobs in berlin . "
the book was blank . while the mayor shows enthusiasm for attracting media and other creative - read " sexy " - companies to the capital , critics say he is blasé about getting big players here which could employ big numbers . " in general , he has an attitude that is hostile to the economy , " said markus löning , chair of the berlin fdp . " business people who are interested in investing in berlin ca n't even get an appointment with him . " others question his intellectual heft , and even wowereit himself admits in his book he was never a big reader .
in a questionnaire the mayor filled out at the end of 2004 , he could n't name the date the second world war began , the answer to 3 + 8 x 2 , or spell " rhythm . " in a blistering critique in the süddeutsche zeitung daily , long-time foreign correspondent roger boyes wrote : " often wowi simply acts like a bored teenager . " slow and steady - he 's got time but political scientist neugebauer is less critical of the mayor 's performance in office , saying he has made the best out of the very bad situation he found when he got there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wowereit is never been one to shy away from celebrities - here with sylvester stallone wowereit was able to bring the berlin spd out of a long-term crisis , has given berlin a new international profile that has brought in streams of tourists and has gotten the city 's budget under control by enacting strict spending controls .
his office has stepped up its efforts to bring high-tech and service sector jobs to the city . " he 's working with what he 's got , and going step by step , " said neugebauer , similar to the strategy of another german politician , angela merkel . and he can wait , he added , he 's young enough .
wowereit will not likely challenge current spd head kurt beck , but will likely see how the 2009 federal elections go before making his next move .
right now spd leaders are keeping a close eye on them .
he 's seen as one who does n't follow the party line lock-step , but who can win elections .
that gives him some clout , according to neugebauer . " he just has to wait for the right opportunities , " he said .

germany 's watertight defence did n't concede a single goal in the tournament , the first time ever that a soccer side has managed the feat .
31,000 fans in shanghai 's hongkou football stadium watched the fast-paced fifa women 's world cup final .
brazilian star striker marta , the top scorer in the tournament , failed to get in a penalty kick past goalkeeper nadine angerer , a goal which would have tied the game in the second half .
bildunterschrift : brazil 's marta grimaces after she failed to score a penalty kick " after the penalty save , i felt it was meant to be , " germany coach silvia neid said .
" we worked hard for each other , it was a great team performance .
it was important to work against marta , and we did a good job in pushing her to the sidelines . "
missed chances the nimble-footed brazilians were the better side in the first half , playing a fast aggressive game and piling up the pressure on the german defense .
marta , who won the best player of the tournament award , had the first chance of the game in the fourth minute with a long range drive stopped easily by angerer . seconds later , the physically stronger germans went on the attack when kerstin garefrekes was set free on the right only to slice her shot into the side netting .
in the eight minute , germany 's powerful defense seemed to falter for an instant when goalkeeper angerer failed to gather a free kick by brazil 's daniela .
the ball bounced out to formiga but she was unable to put the ball in the net .
daniela had another chance in the 23rd minute but was unlucky when she shot a left foot volley onto the post .
heroic saves by german goalie the germans finally picked up pace in the second half , determinedly pushing forward .
but it was only in the 52nd minute that they managed the breakthrough when captain birgit prinz was fed a pass by sandra smisek .
the veteran forward coolly slotted in the crossed ball on the turn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's defender aline , german forward sandra smisek and german midfielder melanie behringer fight for the ball but it was angerer who was the hero of the day when she stopped the spot kick by martha with her knees and then again when she held a flying strike by substitute rosana .
despite dominating ball possession , brazil 's spirited attack failed to break through the solid german defense and they failed to find an equalizer .
a stunning header by simone laudehr in the dying minutes of the game clinched the game for the ruthlessly efficient german side .
" germany deserved to win " " this was a very tough match , we missed a lot of chances especially when we were 1-0 down and marta missed a critical penalty , " said brazil coach jorge barcellos .
" but germany took their chances and scored .
i 'm very sad about this result but my players tried their best . "

31,000 fans in shanghai 's hongkou football stadium watched the fast-paced fifa women 's world cup final .
brazilian star striker marta , the top scorer in the tournament , failed to get in a penalty kick past goalkeeper nadine angerer , a goal which would have tied the game in the second half .
bildunterschrift : brazil 's marta grimaces after she failed to score a penalty kick " after the penalty save , i felt it was meant to be , " germany coach silvia neid said .
" we worked hard for each other , it was a great team performance .
it was important to work against marta , and we did a good job in pushing her to the sidelines . "
missed chances the nimble-footed brazilians were the better side in the first half , playing a fast aggressive game and piling up the pressure on the german defense .
marta , who won the best player of the tournament award , had the first chance of the game in the fourth minute with a long range drive stopped easily by angerer . seconds later , the physically stronger germans went on the attack when kerstin garefrekes was set free on the right only to slice her shot into the side netting .
in the eight minute , germany 's powerful defense seemed to falter for an instant when goalkeeper angerer failed to gather a free kick by brazil 's daniela .
the ball bounced out to formiga but she was unable to put the ball in the net .
daniela had another chance in the 23rd minute but was unlucky when she shot a left foot volley onto the post .
heroic saves by german goalie the germans finally picked up pace in the second half , determinedly pushing forward .
but it was only in the 52nd minute that they managed the breakthrough when captain birgit prinz was fed a pass by sandra smisek .
the veteran forward coolly slotted in the crossed ball on the turn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's defender aline , german forward sandra smisek and german midfielder melanie behringer fight for the ball but it was angerer who was the hero of the day when she stopped the spot kick by martha with her knees and then again when she held a flying strike by substitute rosana .
despite dominating ball possession , brazil 's spirited attack failed to break through the solid german defense and they failed to find an equalizer .
a stunning header by simone laudehr in the dying minutes of the game clinched the game for the ruthlessly efficient german side .
" germany deserved to win " " this was a very tough match , we missed a lot of chances especially when we were 1-0 down and marta missed a critical penalty , " said brazil coach jorge barcellos .
" but germany took their chances and scored .
i 'm very sad about this result but my players tried their best . "
the 21-year-old marta said she was crushed after the defeat but that the team had to look ahead . " it 's difficult to express my feelings .
the germans deserved to win , " she said .
" but we have to keep our chin up and prepare for the olympics in beijing .

30 , to forge a joint declaration against nuclear energy .
participating politicians called for more investments in energy-efficiency measures and renewable energies rather than nuclear power . " we are no anti-nuclear coalition , but we want to show alternatives , " said austrian environment minister josef pröll .
the declaration , focusing on the safety and security risks surrounding nuclear energy , said this form of energy was not the best way to fight climate change . matthias machnig , german deputy minister for environment , criticized the alleged positive role of nuclear energy in reducing global greenhouse gases as a " myth , " adding that the world 's combined power plants would only contribute with 8 percent to carbon dioxide reduction . the discussion on nuclear energy only slowed down investment into energy efficiency and alternative energy forms , he said . nuclear renaissance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chernobyl disaster led some countries to rethink their nuclear power strategy support for nuclear energy dropped after the 1986 chernobyl disaster but the energy source has come back into fashion as governments and officials look at strategies toward lowering greenhouse gas emissions .
recent increases in gas and oil prices as well as questions about the reliability of russian energy supplies have also raised european energy concerns . european union energy commissioner andris piebalgs said in an interview published in spanish daily el pais on monday that the eu should aim to generate 30 percent of its electricity from nuclear sources in order to ensure member states ' energy security . industry officials are promoting third-generation pressurized water reactors which provide greater energy , improved security and reduced waste compared to earlier versions of nuclear reactors .
these new reactors are still rejected by environmentalists . long-term ecological effects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power opponents question what will become of radioactive waste but italy 's environment minister alfonso pecoraro scanio warned of the long-term ecological effects - his country is still dealing with nuclear waste , 20 years after quitting nuclear energy . latvia was the only country in the group that is actively moving ahead with expanding its nuclear energy capabilities , while all other seven members either have no nuclear energy or are planning a phase-out , like germany . the cooperation was no contradiction , latvia 's deputy environment secretary martins jirgens said , as he hoped the planned latvian involvement in the construction of the lithuanian nuclear reactor ignalina would not go ahead . an issue for national governments european commission chief jose manuel barroso urged eu nations on monday to hold a " total and frank debate " about the use of nuclear energy . " member states can not avoid the question of nuclear energy , " he said monday during an energy conference in madrid .

germany 's watertight defence did n't concede a single goal in the tournament , the first time ever that a soccer side has managed the feat .
31,000 fans in shanghai 's hongkou football stadium watched the fast-paced fifa women 's world cup final .
brazilian star striker marta , the top scorer in the tournament , failed to get in a penalty kick past goalkeeper nadine angerer , a goal which would have tied the game in the second half .
bildunterschrift : brazil 's marta grimaces after she failed to score a penalty kick " after the penalty save , i felt it was meant to be , " germany coach silvia neid said .
" we worked hard for each other , it was a great team performance .
it was important to work against marta , and we did a good job in pushing her to the sidelines . "
missed chances the nimble-footed brazilians were the better side in the first half , playing a fast aggressive game and piling up the pressure on the german defense .
marta , who won the best player of the tournament award , had the first chance of the game in the fourth minute with a long range drive stopped easily by angerer . seconds later , the physically stronger germans went on the attack when kerstin garefrekes was set free on the right only to slice her shot into the side netting .
in the eight minute , germany 's powerful defense seemed to falter for an instant when goalkeeper angerer failed to gather a free kick by brazil 's daniela .
the ball bounced out to formiga but she was unable to put the ball in the net .
daniela had another chance in the 23rd minute but was unlucky when she shot a left foot volley onto the post .
heroic saves by german goalie the germans finally picked up pace in the second half , determinedly pushing forward .
but it was only in the 52nd minute that they managed the breakthrough when captain birgit prinz was fed a pass by sandra smisek .
the veteran forward coolly slotted in the crossed ball on the turn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's defender aline , german forward sandra smisek and german midfielder melanie behringer fight for the ball but it was angerer who was the hero of the day when she stopped the spot kick by martha with her knees and then again when she held a flying strike by substitute rosana .
despite dominating ball possession , brazil 's spirited attack failed to break through the solid german defense and they failed to find an equalizer .
a stunning header by simone laudehr in the dying minutes of the game clinched the game for the ruthlessly efficient german side .

germany 's watertight defence did n't concede a single goal in the tournament , the first time ever that a soccer side has managed the feat .
31,000 fans in shanghai 's hongkou football stadium watched the fast-paced fifa women 's world cup final .
brazilian star striker marta , the top scorer in the tournament , failed to get in a penalty kick past goalkeeper nadine angerer , a goal which would have tied the game in the second half .
bildunterschrift : brazil 's marta grimaces after she failed to score a penalty kick " after the penalty save , i felt it was meant to be , " germany coach silvia neid said .
" we worked hard for each other , it was a great team performance .
it was important to work against marta , and we did a good job in pushing her to the sidelines . "
missed chances the nimble-footed brazilians were the better side in the first half , playing a fast aggressive game and piling up the pressure on the german defense .
marta , who won the best player of the tournament award , had the first chance of the game in the fourth minute with a long range drive stopped easily by angerer . seconds later , the physically stronger germans went on the attack when kerstin garefrekes was set free on the right only to slice her shot into the side netting .
in the eight minute , germany 's powerful defense seemed to falter for an instant when goalkeeper angerer failed to gather a free kick by brazil 's daniela .
the ball bounced out to formiga but she was unable to put the ball in the net .
daniela had another chance in the 23rd minute but was unlucky when she shot a left foot volley onto the post .
heroic saves by german goalie the germans finally picked up pace in the second half , determinedly pushing forward .
but it was only in the 52nd minute that they managed the breakthrough when captain birgit prinz was fed a pass by sandra smisek .
the veteran forward coolly slotted in the crossed ball on the turn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's defender aline , german forward sandra smisek and german midfielder melanie behringer fight for the ball but it was angerer who was the hero of the day when she stopped the spot kick by martha with her knees and then again when she held a flying strike by substitute rosana .
despite dominating ball possession , brazil 's spirited attack failed to break through the solid german defense and they failed to find an equalizer .
a stunning header by simone laudehr in the dying minutes of the game clinched the game for the ruthlessly efficient german side .
" germany deserved to win " " this was a very tough match , we missed a lot of chances especially when we were 1-0 down and marta missed a critical penalty , " said brazil coach jorge barcellos .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 01.10.2007 as berlin mayor looks to own political future , scrutiny grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit poses with a copy of his autobiography berlin mayor klaus wowereit 's recent memoir has ignited discussion about his future political ambitions .
the book has moved many to take a closer look at a politician known as much for his partying as his policies . to some observers , the fact that klaus wowereit published his memoirs in september at the age of 53 was a case of a heightened sense of self-importance , perhaps even arrogance , or at least jumping the gun . his book , although entitled " … and that 's ok - my life in politics , " does not present a new political philosophy or ideas on how germany can succeed in a globalized economy .
rather , these are stories from his own life , of his hardscrabble childhood , his school days , his entry into public office , his finding love and happiness .
politics is present , but plays a secondary role . but those who think the book is nothing more than a vanity project by someone who believes his own life is inspirational are likely underestimating wowereit 's political and media savvy .
indeed , many observers think the book is an announcement by the social democratic , openly gay mayor to the public and his own spd party that berlin 's city hall is not the last stop on his political journey . " wowereit wants to play a larger role in national politics , " said gero neugebauer , professor emeritus of political science at berlin 's free university .
" this book allowed him to get into the media and get people talking about him again . " but all the talk has not necessarily been positive , and while wowereit is used to criticism as mayor of germany 's capital and largest city , his hinting at a desire to reach greater political heights has turned up the intensity of the spotlight on him . bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit partying in berlin with entertainer desirée nick public outing , skyrocketing popularity his book 's title references the event that turned wowereit from a local politician into an a-list celebrity who just happened to also sit in the mayor 's office .
in 2001 , during the campaign , he outed himself publicly in a speech with the words : " i 'm gay , and that 's ok . " suddenly , berlin had a mayor who seemed perfectly in synch with the city itself - open , risk-taking and just a step outside of the mainstream .
there was n't much industry to be found in the capital and unemployment was higher than almost anywhere else in germany , but it certainly knew how to party .
manufacturing sites were rare , but one could n't throw a rock without hitting a club or bar . wowereit could be found in more than a few of those locales , or at society functions , pressing the flesh and having a good time .
his office even came up with an unofficial slogan for berlin , " poor , but sexy . "
people lapped it up ; and with an opposition in disarray , wowereit 's popularity grew . the right stuff ? but as it looks like berlin might be too small a pond for " wowi , " as he 's affectionately known , critics are looking at his record and wondering if he has what it takes to jump to the federal level – and maybe one day even run for the top job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit and his partner jörn kubicki his sexuality does n't seem to figure large .
newspaper headlines have been fond of the expression " gay chancellor " of late and germans themselves are n't put off by it .
in a recent survey , 79 percent of germans said they did n't think homosexuality was a stumbling block on the way to the chancellery . " i think the population is further along than politicians when it comes to that , " said klaus jetz , director of the gay and lesbian federation of germany , who said he was n't surprised at the poll results .
" the sexuality of a chancellor does n't influence his or her policies . " that may be true , say others , but add that wowereit 's record in berlin , particularly when it comes to attracting industry , is not particularly good .
the berlin office of the free democrats , germany 's free-market liberal party , recently sent the mayor a book entitled " klaus wowereit 's ideas for more economic growth and jobs in berlin . "
the book was blank . while the mayor shows enthusiasm for attracting media and other creative - read " sexy " - companies to the capital , critics say he is blasé about getting big players here which could employ big numbers . " in general , he has an attitude that is hostile to the economy , " said markus löning , chair of the berlin fdp . " business people who are interested in investing in berlin ca n't even get an appointment with him . " others question his intellectual heft , and even wowereit himself admits in his book he was never a big reader .
in a questionnaire the mayor filled out at the end of 2004 , he could n't name the date the second world war began , the answer to 3 + 8 x 2 , or spell " rhythm . " in a blistering critique in the süddeutsche zeitung daily , long-time foreign correspondent roger boyes wrote : " often wowi simply acts like a bored teenager . " slow and steady - he 's got time but political scientist neugebauer is less critical of the mayor 's performance in office , saying he has made the best out of the very bad situation he found when he got there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wowereit is never been one to shy away from celebrities - here with sylvester stallone wowereit was able to bring the berlin spd out of a long-term crisis , has given berlin a new international profile that has brought in streams of tourists and has gotten the city 's budget under control by enacting strict spending controls .
his office has stepped up its efforts to bring high-tech and service sector jobs to the city . " he 's working with what he 's got , and going step by step , " said neugebauer , similar to the strategy of another german politician , angela merkel . and he can wait , he added , he 's young enough .
wowereit will not likely challenge current spd head kurt beck , but will likely see how the 2009 federal elections go before making his next move .
right now spd leaders are keeping a close eye on them .
he 's seen as one who does n't follow the party line lock-step , but who can win elections .
that gives him some clout , according to neugebauer . " he just has to wait for the right opportunities , " he said .

" wowereit wants to play a larger role in national politics , " said gero neugebauer , professor emeritus of political science at berlin 's free university .
" this book allowed him to get into the media and get people talking about him again . " but all the talk has not necessarily been positive , and while wowereit is used to criticism as mayor of germany 's capital and largest city , his hinting at a desire to reach greater political heights has turned up the intensity of the spotlight on him . bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit partying in berlin with entertainer desirée nick public outing , skyrocketing popularity his book 's title references the event that turned wowereit from a local politician into an a-list celebrity who just happened to also sit in the mayor 's office .
in 2001 , during the campaign , he outed himself publicly in a speech with the words : " i 'm gay , and that 's ok . " suddenly , berlin had a mayor who seemed perfectly in synch with the city itself - open , risk-taking and just a step outside of the mainstream .
there was n't much industry to be found in the capital and unemployment was higher than almost anywhere else in germany , but it certainly knew how to party .
manufacturing sites were rare , but one could n't throw a rock without hitting a club or bar . wowereit could be found in more than a few of those locales , or at society functions , pressing the flesh and having a good time .
his office even came up with an unofficial slogan for berlin , " poor , but sexy . "
people lapped it up ; and with an opposition in disarray , wowereit 's popularity grew . the right stuff ? but as it looks like berlin might be too small a pond for " wowi , " as he 's affectionately known , critics are looking at his record and wondering if he has what it takes to jump to the federal level – and maybe one day even run for the top job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit and his partner jörn kubicki his sexuality does n't seem to figure large .
newspaper headlines have been fond of the expression " gay chancellor " of late and germans themselves are n't put off by it .
in a recent survey , 79 percent of germans said they did n't think homosexuality was a stumbling block on the way to the chancellery . " i think the population is further along than politicians when it comes to that , " said klaus jetz , director of the gay and lesbian federation of germany , who said he was n't surprised at the poll results .
" the sexuality of a chancellor does n't influence his or her policies . " that may be true , say others , but add that wowereit 's record in berlin , particularly when it comes to attracting industry , is not particularly good .
the berlin office of the free democrats , germany 's free-market liberal party , recently sent the mayor a book entitled " klaus wowereit 's ideas for more economic growth and jobs in berlin . "
the book was blank . while the mayor shows enthusiasm for attracting media and other creative - read " sexy " - companies to the capital , critics say he is blasé about getting big players here which could employ big numbers . " in general , he has an attitude that is hostile to the economy , " said markus löning , chair of the berlin fdp . " business people who are interested in investing in berlin ca n't even get an appointment with him . " others question his intellectual heft , and even wowereit himself admits in his book he was never a big reader .
in a questionnaire the mayor filled out at the end of 2004 , he could n't name the date the second world war began , the answer to 3 + 8 x 2 , or spell " rhythm . " in a blistering critique in the süddeutsche zeitung daily , long-time foreign correspondent roger boyes wrote : " often wowi simply acts like a bored teenager . " slow and steady - he 's got time but political scientist neugebauer is less critical of the mayor 's performance in office , saying he has made the best out of the very bad situation he found when he got there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wowereit is never been one to shy away from celebrities - here with sylvester stallone wowereit was able to bring the berlin spd out of a long-term crisis , has given berlin a new international profile that has brought in streams of tourists and has gotten the city 's budget under control by enacting strict spending controls .
his office has stepped up its efforts to bring high-tech and service sector jobs to the city . " he 's working with what he 's got , and going step by step , " said neugebauer , similar to the strategy of another german politician , angela merkel . and he can wait , he added , he 's young enough .
wowereit will not likely challenge current spd head kurt beck , but will likely see how the 2009 federal elections go before making his next move .
right now spd leaders are keeping a close eye on them .
he 's seen as one who does n't follow the party line lock-step , but who can win elections .

the former world chess champion faces a daunting challenge , as pro-kremlin candidates are expected to win . kasparov is a leading force behind other russia , a coalition which unites liberals , leftists and nationalists who oppose russian president vladimir putin .
the russian constitution requires putin to step down after serving two four-year terms .
his has yet to endorse a potential successor , but his approval is seen as pivotal to the upcoming elections , which will be held in march 2 , 2008 .
kasparov 's coalition has little public support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign season is just around the corner kasparov , 44 , won 379 of 498 votes at other russia coalition 's national congress .
yet kasparov 's place on the march ballot remains uncertain .
his candidacy needs to be registered and will likely be blocked .
even if he is allowed to run , kasparov is not expected to pose a major threat to putin 's candidate .
while kasparov is well known in europe for his chess exploits , the latest poll by the independent levada news agency shows 3 percent of russians will vote for the other russia candidate .
" the goal of the other russia is not winning elections , but to have an election , " kasparov said , speaking in english on the sidelines of the congress .
" we 're trying to force the regime to accept our right to participate in free and fair elections , to agitate the russian population and the russian public to support our ideas . "
kasparov calls for unity in opposing kremlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin won easily last time around kasparov says that putin 's broad public support comes from the kremlin 's control over the media and the electoral process .
" i will do everything possible for the ideas of other russia to win .
this will work only if we stay united , " kasparov said , adding the coalition stood for a " democratic and just russia . "
the other russia coalition is hampered by internal divisions and has been marginalized by the authorities .
kasparov founded the coalition in 2005 after a successful chess career .
kasparov faces challenge of his career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's like a game of chess kasparov is fond on comparing current political battles to his famous duels with anatoly karpov in the 1980s .
" back then , the chess system wanted to maintain a cosy status quo , avoiding any candidate worthy of the name to fight karpov , " he has said .
" the political situation in russia today reminds me of that time . "
kasparov was born in the former soviet republic of azerbaijan to armenian-jewish parents .
he took up chess in 1963 at the age of 6 and was a junior champion by the age of 13 .
he became the world 's youngest chess champion when he beat karpov in 1985 at the age of 22 .
political maneuvering underway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's endorsement seen as essential in presidential campaign there could be surprise contenders in the race , first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev said on sunday .
medvedev , who also chairs gas monopoly gazprom , has ruled out running for parliament as a pro-kremlin party candidate , but did not answer direct questions about whether he would run for president .
medvedev , 42 , is one of a small group of kremlin insiders who has been tipped as a possible successor to putin .
putin has not ruled out returning to power in 2012 .
he has kept everyone guessing about which candidate will get his crucial endorsement .
he surprised observers by appointing viktor zubkov , a relatively unknown 66-year-old former head of an anti-money laundering unit , as prime minister on sept .

the former world chess champion faces a daunting challenge , as pro-kremlin candidates are expected to win . kasparov is a leading force behind other russia , a coalition which unites liberals , leftists and nationalists who oppose russian president vladimir putin .
the russian constitution requires putin to step down after serving two four-year terms .
his has yet to endorse a potential successor , but his approval is seen as pivotal to the upcoming elections , which will be held in march 2 , 2008 .
kasparov 's coalition has little public support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign season is just around the corner kasparov , 44 , won 379 of 498 votes at other russia coalition 's national congress .
yet kasparov 's place on the march ballot remains uncertain .
his candidacy needs to be registered and will likely be blocked .
even if he is allowed to run , kasparov is not expected to pose a major threat to putin 's candidate .
while kasparov is well known in europe for his chess exploits , the latest poll by the independent levada news agency shows 3 percent of russians will vote for the other russia candidate .
" the goal of the other russia is not winning elections , but to have an election , " kasparov said , speaking in english on the sidelines of the congress .
" we 're trying to force the regime to accept our right to participate in free and fair elections , to agitate the russian population and the russian public to support our ideas . "
kasparov calls for unity in opposing kremlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin won easily last time around kasparov says that putin 's broad public support comes from the kremlin 's control over the media and the electoral process .
" i will do everything possible for the ideas of other russia to win .
this will work only if we stay united , " kasparov said , adding the coalition stood for a " democratic and just russia . "
the other russia coalition is hampered by internal divisions and has been marginalized by the authorities .

" back then , the chess system wanted to maintain a cosy status quo , avoiding any candidate worthy of the name to fight karpov , " he has said .
" the political situation in russia today reminds me of that time . "
kasparov was born in the former soviet republic of azerbaijan to armenian-jewish parents .
he took up chess in 1963 at the age of 6 and was a junior champion by the age of 13 .
he became the world 's youngest chess champion when he beat karpov in 1985 at the age of 22 .

medvedev , 42 , is one of a small group of kremlin insiders who has been tipped as a possible successor to putin .
putin has not ruled out returning to power in 2012 .
he has kept everyone guessing about which candidate will get his crucial endorsement .
he surprised observers by appointing viktor zubkov , a relatively unknown 66-year-old former head of an anti-money laundering unit , as prime minister on sept .

the former world chess champion faces a daunting challenge , as pro-kremlin candidates are expected to win . kasparov is a leading force behind other russia , a coalition which unites liberals , leftists and nationalists who oppose russian president vladimir putin .
the russian constitution requires putin to step down after serving two four-year terms .
his has yet to endorse a potential successor , but his approval is seen as pivotal to the upcoming elections , which will be held in march 2 , 2008 .
kasparov 's coalition has little public support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign season is just around the corner kasparov , 44 , won 379 of 498 votes at other russia coalition 's national congress .
yet kasparov 's place on the march ballot remains uncertain .
his candidacy needs to be registered and will likely be blocked .
even if he is allowed to run , kasparov is not expected to pose a major threat to putin 's candidate .
while kasparov is well known in europe for his chess exploits , the latest poll by the independent levada news agency shows 3 percent of russians will vote for the other russia candidate .
" the goal of the other russia is not winning elections , but to have an election , " kasparov said , speaking in english on the sidelines of the congress .
" we 're trying to force the regime to accept our right to participate in free and fair elections , to agitate the russian population and the russian public to support our ideas . "
kasparov calls for unity in opposing kremlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin won easily last time around kasparov says that putin 's broad public support comes from the kremlin 's control over the media and the electoral process .
" i will do everything possible for the ideas of other russia to win .
this will work only if we stay united , " kasparov said , adding the coalition stood for a " democratic and just russia . "
the other russia coalition is hampered by internal divisions and has been marginalized by the authorities .
kasparov founded the coalition in 2005 after a successful chess career .
kasparov faces challenge of his career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's like a game of chess kasparov is fond on comparing current political battles to his famous duels with anatoly karpov in the 1980s .
" back then , the chess system wanted to maintain a cosy status quo , avoiding any candidate worthy of the name to fight karpov , " he has said .
" the political situation in russia today reminds me of that time . "
kasparov was born in the former soviet republic of azerbaijan to armenian-jewish parents .
he took up chess in 1963 at the age of 6 and was a junior champion by the age of 13 .
he became the world 's youngest chess champion when he beat karpov in 1985 at the age of 22 .
political maneuvering underway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's endorsement seen as essential in presidential campaign there could be surprise contenders in the race , first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev said on sunday .
medvedev , who also chairs gas monopoly gazprom , has ruled out running for parliament as a pro-kremlin party candidate , but did not answer direct questions about whether he would run for president .
medvedev , 42 , is one of a small group of kremlin insiders who has been tipped as a possible successor to putin .
putin has not ruled out returning to power in 2012 .
he has kept everyone guessing about which candidate will get his crucial endorsement .
he surprised observers by appointing viktor zubkov , a relatively unknown 66-year-old former head of an anti-money laundering unit , as prime minister on sept .
14 .
putin , 54 , has said zubkov is one of five people who could succeed him , but so far has kept mum on the names of the others . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 , to forge a joint declaration against nuclear energy .
participating politicians called for more investments in energy-efficiency measures and renewable energies rather than nuclear power . " we are no anti-nuclear coalition , but we want to show alternatives , " said austrian environment minister josef pröll .
the declaration , focusing on the safety and security risks surrounding nuclear energy , said this form of energy was not the best way to fight climate change . matthias machnig , german deputy minister for environment , criticized the alleged positive role of nuclear energy in reducing global greenhouse gases as a " myth , " adding that the world 's combined power plants would only contribute with 8 percent to carbon dioxide reduction . the discussion on nuclear energy only slowed down investment into energy efficiency and alternative energy forms , he said . nuclear renaissance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chernobyl disaster led some countries to rethink their nuclear power strategy support for nuclear energy dropped after the 1986 chernobyl disaster but the energy source has come back into fashion as governments and officials look at strategies toward lowering greenhouse gas emissions .
recent increases in gas and oil prices as well as questions about the reliability of russian energy supplies have also raised european energy concerns . european union energy commissioner andris piebalgs said in an interview published in spanish daily el pais on monday that the eu should aim to generate 30 percent of its electricity from nuclear sources in order to ensure member states ' energy security . industry officials are promoting third-generation pressurized water reactors which provide greater energy , improved security and reduced waste compared to earlier versions of nuclear reactors .
these new reactors are still rejected by environmentalists . long-term ecological effects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power opponents question what will become of radioactive waste but italy 's environment minister alfonso pecoraro scanio warned of the long-term ecological effects - his country is still dealing with nuclear waste , 20 years after quitting nuclear energy . latvia was the only country in the group that is actively moving ahead with expanding its nuclear energy capabilities , while all other seven members either have no nuclear energy or are planning a phase-out , like germany . the cooperation was no contradiction , latvia 's deputy environment secretary martins jirgens said , as he hoped the planned latvian involvement in the construction of the lithuanian nuclear reactor ignalina would not go ahead . an issue for national governments european commission chief jose manuel barroso urged eu nations on monday to hold a " total and frank debate " about the use of nuclear energy . " member states can not avoid the question of nuclear energy , " he said monday during an energy conference in madrid .
" it is not the eu 's role to decide if they should or should not use nuclear power . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , are zooming in on the role of the internet in the planning of terrorist attacks .
eu justice commissioner franco frattini is pushing for greater powers to monitor the web .
frattini is in favor of developing technology to block and monitor internet sites offering bomb-making recipes as well as making online recruiting of terrorists a punishable offense .
" they -lrb- terrorists -rrb- can find precise information and instructions for all kinds of terror attacks on the internet , for instance how to make bombs , " frattini said ahead of the meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini wants to develop a whole range of new tools to fight terrorism however , the aim is not to " follow every person that ' googles ' the word ' bomb ' on the internet , " frattini added , referring to the wariness the proposed measures have triggered among critics and proponents of civil liberties .
online surveillance being stepped up in response to a recent series of arrests and the unfolding of terror plots and planned strikes in sweden , germany and austria , individual countries in europe are already moving ahead to step up surveillance of the internet .
in germany , interior minister wolfgang schäuble is seeking powers allowing investigators to send software that secretly installs itself on specific computers , relaying data to police computers as users operate online .
a court in germany is also trying a man for posting al qaeda hate messages and audio and video recordings , by osama bin laden among others , in an internet chartroom for islamists .
the defendant 's computer was being monitored for a year and a half by security officials before the man was arrested .
in sweden , too , the defense minister has cited the threat of terrorism to seek broad powers to monitor e-mail traffic without court orders .
controversial recording of data at monday 's meeting , frattini is expected to bring up another controversial security proposal .
following the example of the us , the commissioner wants to collect data on all airline passengers flying into the eu and keep a register of foreigners entering or leaving the bloc that would ultimately include details such as their photograph , fingerprint and even a retina scan .
under the proposals , law enforcement officials in all member states would be allowed to share the data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini wants to gather data on all passengers flying into the eu " europe is a target of terrorism , just like the united states .
and i simply can not ignore that there is a real threat that one day terrorists will try once again to attack a country in the eu , " frattini said .
the commissioner also wants to create an eu-wide data bank in which police across the bloc can enter information on the theft of explosives .
the measure will help authorities follow the trail of terrorists faster and thus thwart attacks , according to frattini .
the eu commissioner is to present the exact details of his counterterrorism proposals in early november .
he is expected to lobby support for the plans among the eu 's 27 interior ministers at the informal talks in lisbon whose approval is crucial for the go-ahead . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , are zooming in on the role of the internet in the planning of terrorist attacks .
eu justice commissioner franco frattini is pushing for greater powers to monitor the web .
frattini is in favor of developing technology to block and monitor internet sites offering bomb-making recipes as well as making online recruiting of terrorists a punishable offense .
" they -lrb- terrorists -rrb- can find precise information and instructions for all kinds of terror attacks on the internet , for instance how to make bombs , " frattini said ahead of the meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini wants to develop a whole range of new tools to fight terrorism however , the aim is not to " follow every person that ' googles ' the word ' bomb ' on the internet , " frattini added , referring to the wariness the proposed measures have triggered among critics and proponents of civil liberties .
online surveillance being stepped up in response to a recent series of arrests and the unfolding of terror plots and planned strikes in sweden , germany and austria , individual countries in europe are already moving ahead to step up surveillance of the internet .
in germany , interior minister wolfgang schäuble is seeking powers allowing investigators to send software that secretly installs itself on specific computers , relaying data to police computers as users operate online .
a court in germany is also trying a man for posting al qaeda hate messages and audio and video recordings , by osama bin laden among others , in an internet chartroom for islamists .
the defendant 's computer was being monitored for a year and a half by security officials before the man was arrested .
in sweden , too , the defense minister has cited the threat of terrorism to seek broad powers to monitor e-mail traffic without court orders .
controversial recording of data at monday 's meeting , frattini is expected to bring up another controversial security proposal .
following the example of the us , the commissioner wants to collect data on all airline passengers flying into the eu and keep a register of foreigners entering or leaving the bloc that would ultimately include details such as their photograph , fingerprint and even a retina scan .
under the proposals , law enforcement officials in all member states would be allowed to share the data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini wants to gather data on all passengers flying into the eu " europe is a target of terrorism , just like the united states .
and i simply can not ignore that there is a real threat that one day terrorists will try once again to attack a country in the eu , " frattini said .
the commissioner also wants to create an eu-wide data bank in which police across the bloc can enter information on the theft of explosives .
the measure will help authorities follow the trail of terrorists faster and thus thwart attacks , according to frattini .
the eu commissioner is to present the exact details of his counterterrorism proposals in early november .

europeans are divided on whether to refer to it as burma or myanmar . pro-democracy demonstrations led by buddhist monks clad in orange robes have grabbed headlines in recent weeks .
in the media coverage , the country is variously referred to as burma or myanmar .
in europe , no concensus exists on how to refer to the former british colony of burma , which won independence in 1948 .
both versions have linguistic legitimacy .
in the burmese language , myanmar is the formal term and burma is the informal , everyday word .
official name change dates to 1989 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to china , it 's myanmar as far as the military junta is concerned , their country should be referred to as myanmar .
the junta officially changed the english name in 1989 .
yet the change was not universally adopted .
in europe , great britain and ireland do not recognize the legitimacy of the military junta and have also continued to use burma exclusively .
exiles also refer to it as burma .
the united nations , recognizing a country 's right to call itself as it wishes , uses myanmar , as do france and germany .
yet while germany 's foreign ministry uses myanmar , the german media use burma .
the european union sits squarely on the fence , referring to the country burma / myanmar in documents on its web site .
the united states government , like britain , does n't recognize the legitimacy of the military rulers in myanmar , and calls the country burma .
but major media outlets such as the new york times , cnn and the associated press refer to it as myanmar .
difference of opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesting monks the name is useful in gauging how countries feel about the regime , pro-democracy activists say .
china , which has been supportive of the military regime , refers to the country as myanmar .
" myanmar is a kind of indicator of countries that are soft on the regime , " mark farmener of burma campaign in the uk told the bbc .
" but really it 's not important .
who cares what people call the country ?
it 's the human rights abuses that matter . "
the tipping point for the current unrest was the government 's decision in mid-august to double fuel prices .
myanmar was relatively prosperous when it gained independence from britain in 1945 , but after 45 years of military rule and economic hardship , it is one of the world 's poorest countries .
in 1988 , a series of peaceful protests led to the current military government seizing power .
elections took place in 1990 , in which the democracy party under the leadership of aung san suu kyi won 82 percent of the vote .
but the elections were not honored by the military regime .
rangoon vs. yangon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police have dealt violently with protestors the regime also changed the english name of myanmar 's largest city from rangoon to yangon .
in 2005 , the government decamped from yangon entirely , building a new capital from scratch , which was named naypyidaw -lrb- royal residence -rrb- .

and this evaluation does n't have anything to do with the fact that the german team succeeded in winning its second title in a row - something the men 's team has still never done . the 16 national teams have spectacularly shown that women 's soccer has absolutely nothing to do with the seemingly ineradicable views of armchair players .
the world cup was , without a doubt , a tournament played at a high technical and tactical level .
women 's soccer today is fairer than men 's , offensive and well-played at a pace that has clearly sped up .
of course , the men are still faster , but that 's the case in track and field , too .
are those races any more boring because of it ? the journey women 's soccer has taken from its beginnings when it was often chuckled at - or even openly ridiculed - can be shown in many ways .
while the women on the german team who won the 1989 european championships were rewarded with a coffee set , each member of the 2007 team will receive 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 71,165 -rrb- for winning the title .
and the nearly 40,000 spectators per game in china speak for themselves .
while the 1999 cup was broadcast in 67 countries , this time around it was 220 - and german television ratings were very high . the world cup in china has doubtlessly given women 's soccer a new worldwide impulse for further development .
the announcement from brazil to introduce a real professional league as soon as possible is only a small , first step .
if the sport still does n't make a giant leap in terms of public perception then it 's because of limited funding and the lack of a league structure . in comparison with men , there are also simply fewer women playing soccer , which lowers the number of truly gifted players .
the result is that the level of club soccer varies from club to club and is clearly lower than the soccer played by national teams .
that 's a reason why organizers should carefully consider whether the plan to increase the number of teams at the next world cup from 16 to 24 is the right decision . the world cup was also another test for the beijing summer olympics in 2008 , and it was a test spectators passed with flying colors while small and usually insignificant mistakes tarnished the organizers ' results . it leaves a bitter taste in many mouths when teams complain of sports espionage , journalists and players are constantly monitored and even have the feeling of being watched in their hotel rooms .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 01.10.2007 as berlin mayor looks to own political future , scrutiny grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit poses with a copy of his autobiography berlin mayor klaus wowereit 's recent memoir has ignited discussion about his future political ambitions .
the book has moved many to take a closer look at a politician known as much for his partying as his policies . to some observers , the fact that klaus wowereit published his memoirs in september at the age of 53 was a case of a heightened sense of self-importance , perhaps even arrogance , or at least jumping the gun . his book , although entitled " … and that 's ok - my life in politics , " does not present a new political philosophy or ideas on how germany can succeed in a globalized economy .
rather , these are stories from his own life , of his hardscrabble childhood , his school days , his entry into public office , his finding love and happiness .
politics is present , but plays a secondary role . but those who think the book is nothing more than a vanity project by someone who believes his own life is inspirational are likely underestimating wowereit 's political and media savvy .
indeed , many observers think the book is an announcement by the social democratic , openly gay mayor to the public and his own spd party that berlin 's city hall is not the last stop on his political journey . " wowereit wants to play a larger role in national politics , " said gero neugebauer , professor emeritus of political science at berlin 's free university .
" this book allowed him to get into the media and get people talking about him again . " but all the talk has not necessarily been positive , and while wowereit is used to criticism as mayor of germany 's capital and largest city , his hinting at a desire to reach greater political heights has turned up the intensity of the spotlight on him . bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit partying in berlin with entertainer desirée nick public outing , skyrocketing popularity his book 's title references the event that turned wowereit from a local politician into an a-list celebrity who just happened to also sit in the mayor 's office .
in 2001 , during the campaign , he outed himself publicly in a speech with the words : " i 'm gay , and that 's ok . " suddenly , berlin had a mayor who seemed perfectly in synch with the city itself - open , risk-taking and just a step outside of the mainstream .
there was n't much industry to be found in the capital and unemployment was higher than almost anywhere else in germany , but it certainly knew how to party .
manufacturing sites were rare , but one could n't throw a rock without hitting a club or bar . wowereit could be found in more than a few of those locales , or at society functions , pressing the flesh and having a good time .
his office even came up with an unofficial slogan for berlin , " poor , but sexy . "
people lapped it up ; and with an opposition in disarray , wowereit 's popularity grew . the right stuff ? but as it looks like berlin might be too small a pond for " wowi , " as he 's affectionately known , critics are looking at his record and wondering if he has what it takes to jump to the federal level – and maybe one day even run for the top job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit and his partner jörn kubicki his sexuality does n't seem to figure large .
newspaper headlines have been fond of the expression " gay chancellor " of late and germans themselves are n't put off by it .
in a recent survey , 79 percent of germans said they did n't think homosexuality was a stumbling block on the way to the chancellery . " i think the population is further along than politicians when it comes to that , " said klaus jetz , director of the gay and lesbian federation of germany , who said he was n't surprised at the poll results .
" the sexuality of a chancellor does n't influence his or her policies . " that may be true , say others , but add that wowereit 's record in berlin , particularly when it comes to attracting industry , is not particularly good .
the berlin office of the free democrats , germany 's free-market liberal party , recently sent the mayor a book entitled " klaus wowereit 's ideas for more economic growth and jobs in berlin . "
the book was blank . while the mayor shows enthusiasm for attracting media and other creative - read " sexy " - companies to the capital , critics say he is blasé about getting big players here which could employ big numbers . " in general , he has an attitude that is hostile to the economy , " said markus löning , chair of the berlin fdp . " business people who are interested in investing in berlin ca n't even get an appointment with him . " others question his intellectual heft , and even wowereit himself admits in his book he was never a big reader .
in a questionnaire the mayor filled out at the end of 2004 , he could n't name the date the second world war began , the answer to 3 + 8 x 2 , or spell " rhythm . " in a blistering critique in the süddeutsche zeitung daily , long-time foreign correspondent roger boyes wrote : " often wowi simply acts like a bored teenager . " slow and steady - he 's got time but political scientist neugebauer is less critical of the mayor 's performance in office , saying he has made the best out of the very bad situation he found when he got there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wowereit is never been one to shy away from celebrities - here with sylvester stallone wowereit was able to bring the berlin spd out of a long-term crisis , has given berlin a new international profile that has brought in streams of tourists and has gotten the city 's budget under control by enacting strict spending controls .
his office has stepped up its efforts to bring high-tech and service sector jobs to the city . " he 's working with what he 's got , and going step by step , " said neugebauer , similar to the strategy of another german politician , angela merkel . and he can wait , he added , he 's young enough .
wowereit will not likely challenge current spd head kurt beck , but will likely see how the 2009 federal elections go before making his next move .
right now spd leaders are keeping a close eye on them .
he 's seen as one who does n't follow the party line lock-step , but who can win elections .
that gives him some clout , according to neugebauer . " he just has to wait for the right opportunities , " he said .

" i think the population is further along than politicians when it comes to that , " said klaus jetz , director of the gay and lesbian federation of germany , who said he was n't surprised at the poll results .
" the sexuality of a chancellor does n't influence his or her policies . " that may be true , say others , but add that wowereit 's record in berlin , particularly when it comes to attracting industry , is not particularly good .
the berlin office of the free democrats , germany 's free-market liberal party , recently sent the mayor a book entitled " klaus wowereit 's ideas for more economic growth and jobs in berlin . "
the book was blank . while the mayor shows enthusiasm for attracting media and other creative - read " sexy " - companies to the capital , critics say he is blasé about getting big players here which could employ big numbers . " in general , he has an attitude that is hostile to the economy , " said markus löning , chair of the berlin fdp . " business people who are interested in investing in berlin ca n't even get an appointment with him . " others question his intellectual heft , and even wowereit himself admits in his book he was never a big reader .
in a questionnaire the mayor filled out at the end of 2004 , he could n't name the date the second world war began , the answer to 3 + 8 x 2 , or spell " rhythm . " in a blistering critique in the süddeutsche zeitung daily , long-time foreign correspondent roger boyes wrote : " often wowi simply acts like a bored teenager . " slow and steady - he 's got time but political scientist neugebauer is less critical of the mayor 's performance in office , saying he has made the best out of the very bad situation he found when he got there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wowereit is never been one to shy away from celebrities - here with sylvester stallone wowereit was able to bring the berlin spd out of a long-term crisis , has given berlin a new international profile that has brought in streams of tourists and has gotten the city 's budget under control by enacting strict spending controls .
his office has stepped up its efforts to bring high-tech and service sector jobs to the city . " he 's working with what he 's got , and going step by step , " said neugebauer , similar to the strategy of another german politician , angela merkel . and he can wait , he added , he 's young enough .
wowereit will not likely challenge current spd head kurt beck , but will likely see how the 2009 federal elections go before making his next move .
right now spd leaders are keeping a close eye on them .

the book has moved many to take a closer look at a politician known as much for his partying as his policies . to some observers , the fact that klaus wowereit published his memoirs in september at the age of 53 was a case of a heightened sense of self-importance , perhaps even arrogance , or at least jumping the gun . his book , although entitled " … and that 's ok - my life in politics , " does not present a new political philosophy or ideas on how germany can succeed in a globalized economy .
rather , these are stories from his own life , of his hardscrabble childhood , his school days , his entry into public office , his finding love and happiness .
politics is present , but plays a secondary role . but those who think the book is nothing more than a vanity project by someone who believes his own life is inspirational are likely underestimating wowereit 's political and media savvy .
indeed , many observers think the book is an announcement by the social democratic , openly gay mayor to the public and his own spd party that berlin 's city hall is not the last stop on his political journey . " wowereit wants to play a larger role in national politics , " said gero neugebauer , professor emeritus of political science at berlin 's free university .
" this book allowed him to get into the media and get people talking about him again . " but all the talk has not necessarily been positive , and while wowereit is used to criticism as mayor of germany 's capital and largest city , his hinting at a desire to reach greater political heights has turned up the intensity of the spotlight on him . bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit partying in berlin with entertainer desirée nick public outing , skyrocketing popularity his book 's title references the event that turned wowereit from a local politician into an a-list celebrity who just happened to also sit in the mayor 's office .
in 2001 , during the campaign , he outed himself publicly in a speech with the words : " i 'm gay , and that 's ok . " suddenly , berlin had a mayor who seemed perfectly in synch with the city itself - open , risk-taking and just a step outside of the mainstream .
there was n't much industry to be found in the capital and unemployment was higher than almost anywhere else in germany , but it certainly knew how to party .
manufacturing sites were rare , but one could n't throw a rock without hitting a club or bar . wowereit could be found in more than a few of those locales , or at society functions , pressing the flesh and having a good time .
his office even came up with an unofficial slogan for berlin , " poor , but sexy . "
people lapped it up ; and with an opposition in disarray , wowereit 's popularity grew . the right stuff ? but as it looks like berlin might be too small a pond for " wowi , " as he 's affectionately known , critics are looking at his record and wondering if he has what it takes to jump to the federal level – and maybe one day even run for the top job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit and his partner jörn kubicki his sexuality does n't seem to figure large .

germany 's watertight defence did n't concede a single goal in the tournament , the first time ever that a soccer side has managed the feat .
31,000 fans in shanghai 's hongkou football stadium watched the fast-paced fifa women 's world cup final .
brazilian star striker marta , the top scorer in the tournament , failed to get in a penalty kick past goalkeeper nadine angerer , a goal which would have tied the game in the second half .
bildunterschrift : brazil 's marta grimaces after she failed to score a penalty kick " after the penalty save , i felt it was meant to be , " germany coach silvia neid said .
" we worked hard for each other , it was a great team performance .
it was important to work against marta , and we did a good job in pushing her to the sidelines . "
missed chances the nimble-footed brazilians were the better side in the first half , playing a fast aggressive game and piling up the pressure on the german defense .
marta , who won the best player of the tournament award , had the first chance of the game in the fourth minute with a long range drive stopped easily by angerer . seconds later , the physically stronger germans went on the attack when kerstin garefrekes was set free on the right only to slice her shot into the side netting .
in the eight minute , germany 's powerful defense seemed to falter for an instant when goalkeeper angerer failed to gather a free kick by brazil 's daniela .
the ball bounced out to formiga but she was unable to put the ball in the net .
daniela had another chance in the 23rd minute but was unlucky when she shot a left foot volley onto the post .
heroic saves by german goalie the germans finally picked up pace in the second half , determinedly pushing forward .
but it was only in the 52nd minute that they managed the breakthrough when captain birgit prinz was fed a pass by sandra smisek .
the veteran forward coolly slotted in the crossed ball on the turn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's defender aline , german forward sandra smisek and german midfielder melanie behringer fight for the ball but it was angerer who was the hero of the day when she stopped the spot kick by martha with her knees and then again when she held a flying strike by substitute rosana .
despite dominating ball possession , brazil 's spirited attack failed to break through the solid german defense and they failed to find an equalizer .
a stunning header by simone laudehr in the dying minutes of the game clinched the game for the ruthlessly efficient german side .
" germany deserved to win " " this was a very tough match , we missed a lot of chances especially when we were 1-0 down and marta missed a critical penalty , " said brazil coach jorge barcellos .
" but germany took their chances and scored .
i 'm very sad about this result but my players tried their best . "
the 21-year-old marta said she was crushed after the defeat but that the team had to look ahead . " it 's difficult to express my feelings .

germany 's watertight defence did n't concede a single goal in the tournament , the first time ever that a soccer side has managed the feat .
31,000 fans in shanghai 's hongkou football stadium watched the fast-paced fifa women 's world cup final .
brazilian star striker marta , the top scorer in the tournament , failed to get in a penalty kick past goalkeeper nadine angerer , a goal which would have tied the game in the second half .
bildunterschrift : brazil 's marta grimaces after she failed to score a penalty kick " after the penalty save , i felt it was meant to be , " germany coach silvia neid said .
" we worked hard for each other , it was a great team performance .
it was important to work against marta , and we did a good job in pushing her to the sidelines . "
missed chances the nimble-footed brazilians were the better side in the first half , playing a fast aggressive game and piling up the pressure on the german defense .
marta , who won the best player of the tournament award , had the first chance of the game in the fourth minute with a long range drive stopped easily by angerer . seconds later , the physically stronger germans went on the attack when kerstin garefrekes was set free on the right only to slice her shot into the side netting .
in the eight minute , germany 's powerful defense seemed to falter for an instant when goalkeeper angerer failed to gather a free kick by brazil 's daniela .
the ball bounced out to formiga but she was unable to put the ball in the net .
daniela had another chance in the 23rd minute but was unlucky when she shot a left foot volley onto the post .
heroic saves by german goalie the germans finally picked up pace in the second half , determinedly pushing forward .
but it was only in the 52nd minute that they managed the breakthrough when captain birgit prinz was fed a pass by sandra smisek .
the veteran forward coolly slotted in the crossed ball on the turn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's defender aline , german forward sandra smisek and german midfielder melanie behringer fight for the ball but it was angerer who was the hero of the day when she stopped the spot kick by martha with her knees and then again when she held a flying strike by substitute rosana .
despite dominating ball possession , brazil 's spirited attack failed to break through the solid german defense and they failed to find an equalizer .
a stunning header by simone laudehr in the dying minutes of the game clinched the game for the ruthlessly efficient german side .
" germany deserved to win " " this was a very tough match , we missed a lot of chances especially when we were 1-0 down and marta missed a critical penalty , " said brazil coach jorge barcellos .
" but germany took their chances and scored .
i 'm very sad about this result but my players tried their best . "
the 21-year-old marta said she was crushed after the defeat but that the team had to look ahead . " it 's difficult to express my feelings .
the germans deserved to win , " she said .
" but we have to keep our chin up and prepare for the olympics in beijing . " in the third-place play-off , two-time champions the united states beat norway 4-1 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 , to forge a joint declaration against nuclear energy .
participating politicians called for more investments in energy-efficiency measures and renewable energies rather than nuclear power . " we are no anti-nuclear coalition , but we want to show alternatives , " said austrian environment minister josef pröll .
the declaration , focusing on the safety and security risks surrounding nuclear energy , said this form of energy was not the best way to fight climate change . matthias machnig , german deputy minister for environment , criticized the alleged positive role of nuclear energy in reducing global greenhouse gases as a " myth , " adding that the world 's combined power plants would only contribute with 8 percent to carbon dioxide reduction . the discussion on nuclear energy only slowed down investment into energy efficiency and alternative energy forms , he said . nuclear renaissance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chernobyl disaster led some countries to rethink their nuclear power strategy support for nuclear energy dropped after the 1986 chernobyl disaster but the energy source has come back into fashion as governments and officials look at strategies toward lowering greenhouse gas emissions .
recent increases in gas and oil prices as well as questions about the reliability of russian energy supplies have also raised european energy concerns . european union energy commissioner andris piebalgs said in an interview published in spanish daily el pais on monday that the eu should aim to generate 30 percent of its electricity from nuclear sources in order to ensure member states ' energy security . industry officials are promoting third-generation pressurized water reactors which provide greater energy , improved security and reduced waste compared to earlier versions of nuclear reactors .
these new reactors are still rejected by environmentalists . long-term ecological effects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power opponents question what will become of radioactive waste but italy 's environment minister alfonso pecoraro scanio warned of the long-term ecological effects - his country is still dealing with nuclear waste , 20 years after quitting nuclear energy . latvia was the only country in the group that is actively moving ahead with expanding its nuclear energy capabilities , while all other seven members either have no nuclear energy or are planning a phase-out , like germany . the cooperation was no contradiction , latvia 's deputy environment secretary martins jirgens said , as he hoped the planned latvian involvement in the construction of the lithuanian nuclear reactor ignalina would not go ahead . an issue for national governments european commission chief jose manuel barroso urged eu nations on monday to hold a " total and frank debate " about the use of nuclear energy . " member states can not avoid the question of nuclear energy , " he said monday during an energy conference in madrid .
" it is not the eu 's role to decide if they should or should not use nuclear power . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

yet kasparov 's place on the march ballot remains uncertain .
his candidacy needs to be registered and will likely be blocked .
even if he is allowed to run , kasparov is not expected to pose a major threat to putin 's candidate .
while kasparov is well known in europe for his chess exploits , the latest poll by the independent levada news agency shows 3 percent of russians will vote for the other russia candidate .
" the goal of the other russia is not winning elections , but to have an election , " kasparov said , speaking in english on the sidelines of the congress .

" the political situation in russia today reminds me of that time . "
kasparov was born in the former soviet republic of azerbaijan to armenian-jewish parents .
he took up chess in 1963 at the age of 6 and was a junior champion by the age of 13 .

the former world chess champion faces a daunting challenge , as pro-kremlin candidates are expected to win . kasparov is a leading force behind other russia , a coalition which unites liberals , leftists and nationalists who oppose russian president vladimir putin .
the russian constitution requires putin to step down after serving two four-year terms .

yet kasparov 's place on the march ballot remains uncertain .
his candidacy needs to be registered and will likely be blocked .
even if he is allowed to run , kasparov is not expected to pose a major threat to putin 's candidate .
while kasparov is well known in europe for his chess exploits , the latest poll by the independent levada news agency shows 3 percent of russians will vote for the other russia candidate .
" the goal of the other russia is not winning elections , but to have an election , " kasparov said , speaking in english on the sidelines of the congress .
" we 're trying to force the regime to accept our right to participate in free and fair elections , to agitate the russian population and the russian public to support our ideas . "
kasparov calls for unity in opposing kremlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin won easily last time around kasparov says that putin 's broad public support comes from the kremlin 's control over the media and the electoral process .
" i will do everything possible for the ideas of other russia to win .
this will work only if we stay united , " kasparov said , adding the coalition stood for a " democratic and just russia . "
the other russia coalition is hampered by internal divisions and has been marginalized by the authorities .
kasparov founded the coalition in 2005 after a successful chess career .
kasparov faces challenge of his career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's like a game of chess kasparov is fond on comparing current political battles to his famous duels with anatoly karpov in the 1980s .
" back then , the chess system wanted to maintain a cosy status quo , avoiding any candidate worthy of the name to fight karpov , " he has said .
" the political situation in russia today reminds me of that time . "
kasparov was born in the former soviet republic of azerbaijan to armenian-jewish parents .
he took up chess in 1963 at the age of 6 and was a junior champion by the age of 13 .
he became the world 's youngest chess champion when he beat karpov in 1985 at the age of 22 .
political maneuvering underway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's endorsement seen as essential in presidential campaign there could be surprise contenders in the race , first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev said on sunday .
medvedev , who also chairs gas monopoly gazprom , has ruled out running for parliament as a pro-kremlin party candidate , but did not answer direct questions about whether he would run for president .
medvedev , 42 , is one of a small group of kremlin insiders who has been tipped as a possible successor to putin .
putin has not ruled out returning to power in 2012 .
he has kept everyone guessing about which candidate will get his crucial endorsement .
he surprised observers by appointing viktor zubkov , a relatively unknown 66-year-old former head of an anti-money laundering unit , as prime minister on sept .
14 .
putin , 54 , has said zubkov is one of five people who could succeed him , but so far has kept mum on the names of the others . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's watertight defence did n't concede a single goal in the tournament , the first time ever that a soccer side has managed the feat .
31,000 fans in shanghai 's hongkou football stadium watched the fast-paced fifa women 's world cup final .
brazilian star striker marta , the top scorer in the tournament , failed to get in a penalty kick past goalkeeper nadine angerer , a goal which would have tied the game in the second half .
bildunterschrift : brazil 's marta grimaces after she failed to score a penalty kick " after the penalty save , i felt it was meant to be , " germany coach silvia neid said .
" we worked hard for each other , it was a great team performance .
it was important to work against marta , and we did a good job in pushing her to the sidelines . "
missed chances the nimble-footed brazilians were the better side in the first half , playing a fast aggressive game and piling up the pressure on the german defense .
marta , who won the best player of the tournament award , had the first chance of the game in the fourth minute with a long range drive stopped easily by angerer . seconds later , the physically stronger germans went on the attack when kerstin garefrekes was set free on the right only to slice her shot into the side netting .
in the eight minute , germany 's powerful defense seemed to falter for an instant when goalkeeper angerer failed to gather a free kick by brazil 's daniela .
the ball bounced out to formiga but she was unable to put the ball in the net .
daniela had another chance in the 23rd minute but was unlucky when she shot a left foot volley onto the post .
heroic saves by german goalie the germans finally picked up pace in the second half , determinedly pushing forward .
but it was only in the 52nd minute that they managed the breakthrough when captain birgit prinz was fed a pass by sandra smisek .
the veteran forward coolly slotted in the crossed ball on the turn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's defender aline , german forward sandra smisek and german midfielder melanie behringer fight for the ball but it was angerer who was the hero of the day when she stopped the spot kick by martha with her knees and then again when she held a flying strike by substitute rosana .
despite dominating ball possession , brazil 's spirited attack failed to break through the solid german defense and they failed to find an equalizer .
a stunning header by simone laudehr in the dying minutes of the game clinched the game for the ruthlessly efficient german side .
" germany deserved to win " " this was a very tough match , we missed a lot of chances especially when we were 1-0 down and marta missed a critical penalty , " said brazil coach jorge barcellos .
" but germany took their chances and scored .
i 'm very sad about this result but my players tried their best . "
the 21-year-old marta said she was crushed after the defeat but that the team had to look ahead . " it 's difficult to express my feelings .

germany 's watertight defence did n't concede a single goal in the tournament , the first time ever that a soccer side has managed the feat .

brazilian star striker marta , the top scorer in the tournament , failed to get in a penalty kick past goalkeeper nadine angerer , a goal which would have tied the game in the second half .

the former world chess champion faces a daunting challenge , as pro-kremlin candidates are expected to win . kasparov is a leading force behind other russia , a coalition which unites liberals , leftists and nationalists who oppose russian president vladimir putin .
the russian constitution requires putin to step down after serving two four-year terms .
his has yet to endorse a potential successor , but his approval is seen as pivotal to the upcoming elections , which will be held in march 2 , 2008 .
kasparov 's coalition has little public support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign season is just around the corner kasparov , 44 , won 379 of 498 votes at other russia coalition 's national congress .
yet kasparov 's place on the march ballot remains uncertain .
his candidacy needs to be registered and will likely be blocked .
even if he is allowed to run , kasparov is not expected to pose a major threat to putin 's candidate .
while kasparov is well known in europe for his chess exploits , the latest poll by the independent levada news agency shows 3 percent of russians will vote for the other russia candidate .
" the goal of the other russia is not winning elections , but to have an election , " kasparov said , speaking in english on the sidelines of the congress .
" we 're trying to force the regime to accept our right to participate in free and fair elections , to agitate the russian population and the russian public to support our ideas . "
kasparov calls for unity in opposing kremlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin won easily last time around kasparov says that putin 's broad public support comes from the kremlin 's control over the media and the electoral process .
" i will do everything possible for the ideas of other russia to win .
this will work only if we stay united , " kasparov said , adding the coalition stood for a " democratic and just russia . "
the other russia coalition is hampered by internal divisions and has been marginalized by the authorities .
kasparov founded the coalition in 2005 after a successful chess career .
kasparov faces challenge of his career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's like a game of chess kasparov is fond on comparing current political battles to his famous duels with anatoly karpov in the 1980s .
" back then , the chess system wanted to maintain a cosy status quo , avoiding any candidate worthy of the name to fight karpov , " he has said .
" the political situation in russia today reminds me of that time . "
kasparov was born in the former soviet republic of azerbaijan to armenian-jewish parents .
he took up chess in 1963 at the age of 6 and was a junior champion by the age of 13 .
he became the world 's youngest chess champion when he beat karpov in 1985 at the age of 22 .
political maneuvering underway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's endorsement seen as essential in presidential campaign there could be surprise contenders in the race , first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev said on sunday .
medvedev , who also chairs gas monopoly gazprom , has ruled out running for parliament as a pro-kremlin party candidate , but did not answer direct questions about whether he would run for president .
medvedev , 42 , is one of a small group of kremlin insiders who has been tipped as a possible successor to putin .
putin has not ruled out returning to power in 2012 .
he has kept everyone guessing about which candidate will get his crucial endorsement .
he surprised observers by appointing viktor zubkov , a relatively unknown 66-year-old former head of an anti-money laundering unit , as prime minister on sept .

the former world chess champion faces a daunting challenge , as pro-kremlin candidates are expected to win . kasparov is a leading force behind other russia , a coalition which unites liberals , leftists and nationalists who oppose russian president vladimir putin .
the russian constitution requires putin to step down after serving two four-year terms .

yet kasparov 's place on the march ballot remains uncertain .
his candidacy needs to be registered and will likely be blocked .
even if he is allowed to run , kasparov is not expected to pose a major threat to putin 's candidate .
while kasparov is well known in europe for his chess exploits , the latest poll by the independent levada news agency shows 3 percent of russians will vote for the other russia candidate .
" the goal of the other russia is not winning elections , but to have an election , " kasparov said , speaking in english on the sidelines of the congress .
" we 're trying to force the regime to accept our right to participate in free and fair elections , to agitate the russian population and the russian public to support our ideas . "

" back then , the chess system wanted to maintain a cosy status quo , avoiding any candidate worthy of the name to fight karpov , " he has said .
" the political situation in russia today reminds me of that time . "
kasparov was born in the former soviet republic of azerbaijan to armenian-jewish parents .
he took up chess in 1963 at the age of 6 and was a junior champion by the age of 13 .
he became the world 's youngest chess champion when he beat karpov in 1985 at the age of 22 .

the former world chess champion faces a daunting challenge , as pro-kremlin candidates are expected to win . kasparov is a leading force behind other russia , a coalition which unites liberals , leftists and nationalists who oppose russian president vladimir putin .
the russian constitution requires putin to step down after serving two four-year terms .

kasparov 's coalition has little public support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign season is just around the corner kasparov , 44 , won 379 of 498 votes at other russia coalition 's national congress .
yet kasparov 's place on the march ballot remains uncertain .
his candidacy needs to be registered and will likely be blocked .
even if he is allowed to run , kasparov is not expected to pose a major threat to putin 's candidate .
while kasparov is well known in europe for his chess exploits , the latest poll by the independent levada news agency shows 3 percent of russians will vote for the other russia candidate .
" the goal of the other russia is not winning elections , but to have an election , " kasparov said , speaking in english on the sidelines of the congress .
" we 're trying to force the regime to accept our right to participate in free and fair elections , to agitate the russian population and the russian public to support our ideas . "
kasparov calls for unity in opposing kremlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin won easily last time around kasparov says that putin 's broad public support comes from the kremlin 's control over the media and the electoral process .
" i will do everything possible for the ideas of other russia to win .
this will work only if we stay united , " kasparov said , adding the coalition stood for a " democratic and just russia . "
the other russia coalition is hampered by internal divisions and has been marginalized by the authorities .
kasparov founded the coalition in 2005 after a successful chess career .
kasparov faces challenge of his career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's like a game of chess kasparov is fond on comparing current political battles to his famous duels with anatoly karpov in the 1980s .
" back then , the chess system wanted to maintain a cosy status quo , avoiding any candidate worthy of the name to fight karpov , " he has said .
" the political situation in russia today reminds me of that time . "
kasparov was born in the former soviet republic of azerbaijan to armenian-jewish parents .
he took up chess in 1963 at the age of 6 and was a junior champion by the age of 13 .
he became the world 's youngest chess champion when he beat karpov in 1985 at the age of 22 .
political maneuvering underway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's endorsement seen as essential in presidential campaign there could be surprise contenders in the race , first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev said on sunday .
medvedev , who also chairs gas monopoly gazprom , has ruled out running for parliament as a pro-kremlin party candidate , but did not answer direct questions about whether he would run for president .
medvedev , 42 , is one of a small group of kremlin insiders who has been tipped as a possible successor to putin .
putin has not ruled out returning to power in 2012 .
he has kept everyone guessing about which candidate will get his crucial endorsement .
he surprised observers by appointing viktor zubkov , a relatively unknown 66-year-old former head of an anti-money laundering unit , as prime minister on sept .

putin , 54 , has said zubkov is one of five people who could succeed him , but so far has kept mum on the names of the others . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , are zooming in on the role of the internet in the planning of terrorist attacks .
eu justice commissioner franco frattini is pushing for greater powers to monitor the web .
frattini is in favor of developing technology to block and monitor internet sites offering bomb-making recipes as well as making online recruiting of terrorists a punishable offense .
" they -lrb- terrorists -rrb- can find precise information and instructions for all kinds of terror attacks on the internet , for instance how to make bombs , " frattini said ahead of the meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini wants to develop a whole range of new tools to fight terrorism however , the aim is not to " follow every person that ' googles ' the word ' bomb ' on the internet , " frattini added , referring to the wariness the proposed measures have triggered among critics and proponents of civil liberties .
online surveillance being stepped up in response to a recent series of arrests and the unfolding of terror plots and planned strikes in sweden , germany and austria , individual countries in europe are already moving ahead to step up surveillance of the internet .
in germany , interior minister wolfgang schäuble is seeking powers allowing investigators to send software that secretly installs itself on specific computers , relaying data to police computers as users operate online .
a court in germany is also trying a man for posting al qaeda hate messages and audio and video recordings , by osama bin laden among others , in an internet chartroom for islamists .
the defendant 's computer was being monitored for a year and a half by security officials before the man was arrested .
in sweden , too , the defense minister has cited the threat of terrorism to seek broad powers to monitor e-mail traffic without court orders .
controversial recording of data at monday 's meeting , frattini is expected to bring up another controversial security proposal .
following the example of the us , the commissioner wants to collect data on all airline passengers flying into the eu and keep a register of foreigners entering or leaving the bloc that would ultimately include details such as their photograph , fingerprint and even a retina scan .
under the proposals , law enforcement officials in all member states would be allowed to share the data .

and i simply can not ignore that there is a real threat that one day terrorists will try once again to attack a country in the eu , " frattini said .
the commissioner also wants to create an eu-wide data bank in which police across the bloc can enter information on the theft of explosives .
the measure will help authorities follow the trail of terrorists faster and thus thwart attacks , according to frattini .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de lifestyle -pipe- 01.10.2007 rebranding the german capital großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some bright spark should be able to come up with a new slogan for berlin in recent years , berlin 's best-known slogan has been " poor but sexy . "
pithy , but not necessarily the image a dignified capital wants to project to the world .
the mayor asked the public if it had any better ideas . the capital 's famously flamboyant mayor klaus wowereit recently appointed a " berlin board , " entrusted to " position the berlin brand " internationally . its illustrious line-up includes architects hans kollhoff and peter hall , catherine mühlemann , mtv 's head of central and emerging markets , and the city 's education minister jürgen zöllner .
the mayor hopes the team , which began work in august , will help steer the capital to lasting global stardom , consolidate its reputation as a cutting edge cultural hotspot and provide it with useful professional contacts .
but wowi , as the mayor 's affectionately known , is also keen for the public to do its bit and has called on the city 's denizens to help come up with a new slogan for the city . " a corporate identity for berlin needs to come from its public , " he said .
" it ca n't be imposed from above . "
commercial clout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a city of many faces wowi himself was the man who first labeled berlin as " poor but sexy " - not , perhaps , the most persuasive branding strategy even if broadly accurate .
ideally , city slogans should be timeless , original and memorable .
a good one , like a good title , can be a valuable tool of identification .
and , as cities like las vegas -lrb- " what happens here , stays here " -rrb- can attest to , an effective slogan can also have considerable commercial value .
the competition designed to reinvent how people see berlin ends on oct .
1 , and the suggestions have been pouring in .
" the contest got a good reception , " the berlin senate 's spokesman günter kolodziej told spiegel online , adding that a second wind of enthusiasm was expected as the deadline approaches .
city of change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : city of encounters , indeed but not all the proposals have been serious .
berlin 's bi-weekly listings magazine zitty suggested the phrase " we do it all .
but we do it all wrong , " which has a certain ring of truth to it in the light of spectacular semi-disasters such as the expensive new central train station , which started falling apart as soon as the wind picked up .
another suggestion was " berlin : city of encounters " - a reference to the mayor 's party-loving reputation . but now it 's up to the public .
and according to the mayor , they 're more than equal to the task . " berlin secret weapon is its people , " wowereit stressed on the berlin city web site . " they are the real heroes of the berlin brand .
it is their personalities that make this city exciting and unique . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de opinion -pipe- 01.10.2007 opinion : women 's soccer does n't trail men 's in excitement großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : after the 2007 world cup in china , the world has seen that women 's soccer is not longer worthy of ridicule and , in fact , is played at high technical and tactical levels , says dw 's wolfgang van kann . we saw a very good world cup in china - and i 'm intentionally leaving the " women 's " modifier out of the sentence .
and this evaluation does n't have anything to do with the fact that the german team succeeded in winning its second title in a row - something the men 's team has still never done . the 16 national teams have spectacularly shown that women 's soccer has absolutely nothing to do with the seemingly ineradicable views of armchair players .
the world cup was , without a doubt , a tournament played at a high technical and tactical level .
women 's soccer today is fairer than men 's , offensive and well-played at a pace that has clearly sped up .
of course , the men are still faster , but that 's the case in track and field , too .
are those races any more boring because of it ? the journey women 's soccer has taken from its beginnings when it was often chuckled at - or even openly ridiculed - can be shown in many ways .
while the women on the german team who won the 1989 european championships were rewarded with a coffee set , each member of the 2007 team will receive 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 71,165 -rrb- for winning the title .
and the nearly 40,000 spectators per game in china speak for themselves .
while the 1999 cup was broadcast in 67 countries , this time around it was 220 - and german television ratings were very high . the world cup in china has doubtlessly given women 's soccer a new worldwide impulse for further development .
the announcement from brazil to introduce a real professional league as soon as possible is only a small , first step .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 01.10.2007 as berlin mayor looks to own political future , scrutiny grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit poses with a copy of his autobiography berlin mayor klaus wowereit 's recent memoir has ignited discussion about his future political ambitions .
the book has moved many to take a closer look at a politician known as much for his partying as his policies . to some observers , the fact that klaus wowereit published his memoirs in september at the age of 53 was a case of a heightened sense of self-importance , perhaps even arrogance , or at least jumping the gun . his book , although entitled " … and that 's ok - my life in politics , " does not present a new political philosophy or ideas on how germany can succeed in a globalized economy .
rather , these are stories from his own life , of his hardscrabble childhood , his school days , his entry into public office , his finding love and happiness .
politics is present , but plays a secondary role . but those who think the book is nothing more than a vanity project by someone who believes his own life is inspirational are likely underestimating wowereit 's political and media savvy .
indeed , many observers think the book is an announcement by the social democratic , openly gay mayor to the public and his own spd party that berlin 's city hall is not the last stop on his political journey . " wowereit wants to play a larger role in national politics , " said gero neugebauer , professor emeritus of political science at berlin 's free university .
" this book allowed him to get into the media and get people talking about him again . " but all the talk has not necessarily been positive , and while wowereit is used to criticism as mayor of germany 's capital and largest city , his hinting at a desire to reach greater political heights has turned up the intensity of the spotlight on him . bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit partying in berlin with entertainer desirée nick public outing , skyrocketing popularity his book 's title references the event that turned wowereit from a local politician into an a-list celebrity who just happened to also sit in the mayor 's office .
in 2001 , during the campaign , he outed himself publicly in a speech with the words : " i 'm gay , and that 's ok . " suddenly , berlin had a mayor who seemed perfectly in synch with the city itself - open , risk-taking and just a step outside of the mainstream .
there was n't much industry to be found in the capital and unemployment was higher than almost anywhere else in germany , but it certainly knew how to party .
manufacturing sites were rare , but one could n't throw a rock without hitting a club or bar . wowereit could be found in more than a few of those locales , or at society functions , pressing the flesh and having a good time .
his office even came up with an unofficial slogan for berlin , " poor , but sexy . "
people lapped it up ; and with an opposition in disarray , wowereit 's popularity grew . the right stuff ? but as it looks like berlin might be too small a pond for " wowi , " as he 's affectionately known , critics are looking at his record and wondering if he has what it takes to jump to the federal level – and maybe one day even run for the top job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit and his partner jörn kubicki his sexuality does n't seem to figure large .
newspaper headlines have been fond of the expression " gay chancellor " of late and germans themselves are n't put off by it .
in a recent survey , 79 percent of germans said they did n't think homosexuality was a stumbling block on the way to the chancellery . " i think the population is further along than politicians when it comes to that , " said klaus jetz , director of the gay and lesbian federation of germany , who said he was n't surprised at the poll results .
" the sexuality of a chancellor does n't influence his or her policies . " that may be true , say others , but add that wowereit 's record in berlin , particularly when it comes to attracting industry , is not particularly good .
the berlin office of the free democrats , germany 's free-market liberal party , recently sent the mayor a book entitled " klaus wowereit 's ideas for more economic growth and jobs in berlin . "
the book was blank . while the mayor shows enthusiasm for attracting media and other creative - read " sexy " - companies to the capital , critics say he is blasé about getting big players here which could employ big numbers . " in general , he has an attitude that is hostile to the economy , " said markus löning , chair of the berlin fdp . " business people who are interested in investing in berlin ca n't even get an appointment with him . " others question his intellectual heft , and even wowereit himself admits in his book he was never a big reader .
in a questionnaire the mayor filled out at the end of 2004 , he could n't name the date the second world war began , the answer to 3 + 8 x 2 , or spell " rhythm . " in a blistering critique in the süddeutsche zeitung daily , long-time foreign correspondent roger boyes wrote : " often wowi simply acts like a bored teenager . " slow and steady - he 's got time but political scientist neugebauer is less critical of the mayor 's performance in office , saying he has made the best out of the very bad situation he found when he got there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wowereit is never been one to shy away from celebrities - here with sylvester stallone wowereit was able to bring the berlin spd out of a long-term crisis , has given berlin a new international profile that has brought in streams of tourists and has gotten the city 's budget under control by enacting strict spending controls .
his office has stepped up its efforts to bring high-tech and service sector jobs to the city . " he 's working with what he 's got , and going step by step , " said neugebauer , similar to the strategy of another german politician , angela merkel . and he can wait , he added , he 's young enough .
wowereit will not likely challenge current spd head kurt beck , but will likely see how the 2009 federal elections go before making his next move .
right now spd leaders are keeping a close eye on them .
he 's seen as one who does n't follow the party line lock-step , but who can win elections .
that gives him some clout , according to neugebauer . " he just has to wait for the right opportunities , " he said .
" and maybe still prove that he 's got some real substance to him . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 , to forge a joint declaration against nuclear energy .
participating politicians called for more investments in energy-efficiency measures and renewable energies rather than nuclear power . " we are no anti-nuclear coalition , but we want to show alternatives , " said austrian environment minister josef pröll .
the declaration , focusing on the safety and security risks surrounding nuclear energy , said this form of energy was not the best way to fight climate change . matthias machnig , german deputy minister for environment , criticized the alleged positive role of nuclear energy in reducing global greenhouse gases as a " myth , " adding that the world 's combined power plants would only contribute with 8 percent to carbon dioxide reduction . the discussion on nuclear energy only slowed down investment into energy efficiency and alternative energy forms , he said . nuclear renaissance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chernobyl disaster led some countries to rethink their nuclear power strategy support for nuclear energy dropped after the 1986 chernobyl disaster but the energy source has come back into fashion as governments and officials look at strategies toward lowering greenhouse gas emissions .
recent increases in gas and oil prices as well as questions about the reliability of russian energy supplies have also raised european energy concerns . european union energy commissioner andris piebalgs said in an interview published in spanish daily el pais on monday that the eu should aim to generate 30 percent of its electricity from nuclear sources in order to ensure member states ' energy security . industry officials are promoting third-generation pressurized water reactors which provide greater energy , improved security and reduced waste compared to earlier versions of nuclear reactors .
these new reactors are still rejected by environmentalists . long-term ecological effects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power opponents question what will become of radioactive waste but italy 's environment minister alfonso pecoraro scanio warned of the long-term ecological effects - his country is still dealing with nuclear waste , 20 years after quitting nuclear energy . latvia was the only country in the group that is actively moving ahead with expanding its nuclear energy capabilities , while all other seven members either have no nuclear energy or are planning a phase-out , like germany . the cooperation was no contradiction , latvia 's deputy environment secretary martins jirgens said , as he hoped the planned latvian involvement in the construction of the lithuanian nuclear reactor ignalina would not go ahead . an issue for national governments european commission chief jose manuel barroso urged eu nations on monday to hold a " total and frank debate " about the use of nuclear energy . " member states can not avoid the question of nuclear energy , " he said monday during an energy conference in madrid .

30 , to forge a joint declaration against nuclear energy .
participating politicians called for more investments in energy-efficiency measures and renewable energies rather than nuclear power . " we are no anti-nuclear coalition , but we want to show alternatives , " said austrian environment minister josef pröll .
the declaration , focusing on the safety and security risks surrounding nuclear energy , said this form of energy was not the best way to fight climate change . matthias machnig , german deputy minister for environment , criticized the alleged positive role of nuclear energy in reducing global greenhouse gases as a " myth , " adding that the world 's combined power plants would only contribute with 8 percent to carbon dioxide reduction . the discussion on nuclear energy only slowed down investment into energy efficiency and alternative energy forms , he said . nuclear renaissance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chernobyl disaster led some countries to rethink their nuclear power strategy support for nuclear energy dropped after the 1986 chernobyl disaster but the energy source has come back into fashion as governments and officials look at strategies toward lowering greenhouse gas emissions .
recent increases in gas and oil prices as well as questions about the reliability of russian energy supplies have also raised european energy concerns . european union energy commissioner andris piebalgs said in an interview published in spanish daily el pais on monday that the eu should aim to generate 30 percent of its electricity from nuclear sources in order to ensure member states ' energy security . industry officials are promoting third-generation pressurized water reactors which provide greater energy , improved security and reduced waste compared to earlier versions of nuclear reactors .
these new reactors are still rejected by environmentalists . long-term ecological effects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power opponents question what will become of radioactive waste but italy 's environment minister alfonso pecoraro scanio warned of the long-term ecological effects - his country is still dealing with nuclear waste , 20 years after quitting nuclear energy . latvia was the only country in the group that is actively moving ahead with expanding its nuclear energy capabilities , while all other seven members either have no nuclear energy or are planning a phase-out , like germany . the cooperation was no contradiction , latvia 's deputy environment secretary martins jirgens said , as he hoped the planned latvian involvement in the construction of the lithuanian nuclear reactor ignalina would not go ahead . an issue for national governments european commission chief jose manuel barroso urged eu nations on monday to hold a " total and frank debate " about the use of nuclear energy . " member states can not avoid the question of nuclear energy , " he said monday during an energy conference in madrid .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 01.10.2007 as berlin mayor looks to own political future , scrutiny grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit poses with a copy of his autobiography berlin mayor klaus wowereit 's recent memoir has ignited discussion about his future political ambitions .
the book has moved many to take a closer look at a politician known as much for his partying as his policies . to some observers , the fact that klaus wowereit published his memoirs in september at the age of 53 was a case of a heightened sense of self-importance , perhaps even arrogance , or at least jumping the gun . his book , although entitled " … and that 's ok - my life in politics , " does not present a new political philosophy or ideas on how germany can succeed in a globalized economy .
rather , these are stories from his own life , of his hardscrabble childhood , his school days , his entry into public office , his finding love and happiness .
politics is present , but plays a secondary role . but those who think the book is nothing more than a vanity project by someone who believes his own life is inspirational are likely underestimating wowereit 's political and media savvy .
indeed , many observers think the book is an announcement by the social democratic , openly gay mayor to the public and his own spd party that berlin 's city hall is not the last stop on his political journey . " wowereit wants to play a larger role in national politics , " said gero neugebauer , professor emeritus of political science at berlin 's free university .
" this book allowed him to get into the media and get people talking about him again . " but all the talk has not necessarily been positive , and while wowereit is used to criticism as mayor of germany 's capital and largest city , his hinting at a desire to reach greater political heights has turned up the intensity of the spotlight on him . bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit partying in berlin with entertainer desirée nick public outing , skyrocketing popularity his book 's title references the event that turned wowereit from a local politician into an a-list celebrity who just happened to also sit in the mayor 's office .
in 2001 , during the campaign , he outed himself publicly in a speech with the words : " i 'm gay , and that 's ok . " suddenly , berlin had a mayor who seemed perfectly in synch with the city itself - open , risk-taking and just a step outside of the mainstream .
there was n't much industry to be found in the capital and unemployment was higher than almost anywhere else in germany , but it certainly knew how to party .
manufacturing sites were rare , but one could n't throw a rock without hitting a club or bar . wowereit could be found in more than a few of those locales , or at society functions , pressing the flesh and having a good time .
his office even came up with an unofficial slogan for berlin , " poor , but sexy . "
people lapped it up ; and with an opposition in disarray , wowereit 's popularity grew . the right stuff ? but as it looks like berlin might be too small a pond for " wowi , " as he 's affectionately known , critics are looking at his record and wondering if he has what it takes to jump to the federal level – and maybe one day even run for the top job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit and his partner jörn kubicki his sexuality does n't seem to figure large .
newspaper headlines have been fond of the expression " gay chancellor " of late and germans themselves are n't put off by it .
in a recent survey , 79 percent of germans said they did n't think homosexuality was a stumbling block on the way to the chancellery . " i think the population is further along than politicians when it comes to that , " said klaus jetz , director of the gay and lesbian federation of germany , who said he was n't surprised at the poll results .
" the sexuality of a chancellor does n't influence his or her policies . " that may be true , say others , but add that wowereit 's record in berlin , particularly when it comes to attracting industry , is not particularly good .
the berlin office of the free democrats , germany 's free-market liberal party , recently sent the mayor a book entitled " klaus wowereit 's ideas for more economic growth and jobs in berlin . "
the book was blank . while the mayor shows enthusiasm for attracting media and other creative - read " sexy " - companies to the capital , critics say he is blasé about getting big players here which could employ big numbers . " in general , he has an attitude that is hostile to the economy , " said markus löning , chair of the berlin fdp . " business people who are interested in investing in berlin ca n't even get an appointment with him . " others question his intellectual heft , and even wowereit himself admits in his book he was never a big reader .
in a questionnaire the mayor filled out at the end of 2004 , he could n't name the date the second world war began , the answer to 3 + 8 x 2 , or spell " rhythm . " in a blistering critique in the süddeutsche zeitung daily , long-time foreign correspondent roger boyes wrote : " often wowi simply acts like a bored teenager . " slow and steady - he 's got time but political scientist neugebauer is less critical of the mayor 's performance in office , saying he has made the best out of the very bad situation he found when he got there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wowereit is never been one to shy away from celebrities - here with sylvester stallone wowereit was able to bring the berlin spd out of a long-term crisis , has given berlin a new international profile that has brought in streams of tourists and has gotten the city 's budget under control by enacting strict spending controls .
his office has stepped up its efforts to bring high-tech and service sector jobs to the city . " he 's working with what he 's got , and going step by step , " said neugebauer , similar to the strategy of another german politician , angela merkel . and he can wait , he added , he 's young enough .
wowereit will not likely challenge current spd head kurt beck , but will likely see how the 2009 federal elections go before making his next move .
right now spd leaders are keeping a close eye on them .
he 's seen as one who does n't follow the party line lock-step , but who can win elections .
that gives him some clout , according to neugebauer . " he just has to wait for the right opportunities , " he said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 01.10.2007 as berlin mayor looks to own political future , scrutiny grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit poses with a copy of his autobiography berlin mayor klaus wowereit 's recent memoir has ignited discussion about his future political ambitions .
the book has moved many to take a closer look at a politician known as much for his partying as his policies . to some observers , the fact that klaus wowereit published his memoirs in september at the age of 53 was a case of a heightened sense of self-importance , perhaps even arrogance , or at least jumping the gun . his book , although entitled " … and that 's ok - my life in politics , " does not present a new political philosophy or ideas on how germany can succeed in a globalized economy .
rather , these are stories from his own life , of his hardscrabble childhood , his school days , his entry into public office , his finding love and happiness .
politics is present , but plays a secondary role . but those who think the book is nothing more than a vanity project by someone who believes his own life is inspirational are likely underestimating wowereit 's political and media savvy .
indeed , many observers think the book is an announcement by the social democratic , openly gay mayor to the public and his own spd party that berlin 's city hall is not the last stop on his political journey . " wowereit wants to play a larger role in national politics , " said gero neugebauer , professor emeritus of political science at berlin 's free university .
" this book allowed him to get into the media and get people talking about him again . " but all the talk has not necessarily been positive , and while wowereit is used to criticism as mayor of germany 's capital and largest city , his hinting at a desire to reach greater political heights has turned up the intensity of the spotlight on him . bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit partying in berlin with entertainer desirée nick public outing , skyrocketing popularity his book 's title references the event that turned wowereit from a local politician into an a-list celebrity who just happened to also sit in the mayor 's office .
in 2001 , during the campaign , he outed himself publicly in a speech with the words : " i 'm gay , and that 's ok . " suddenly , berlin had a mayor who seemed perfectly in synch with the city itself - open , risk-taking and just a step outside of the mainstream .
there was n't much industry to be found in the capital and unemployment was higher than almost anywhere else in germany , but it certainly knew how to party .
manufacturing sites were rare , but one could n't throw a rock without hitting a club or bar . wowereit could be found in more than a few of those locales , or at society functions , pressing the flesh and having a good time .
his office even came up with an unofficial slogan for berlin , " poor , but sexy . "
people lapped it up ; and with an opposition in disarray , wowereit 's popularity grew . the right stuff ? but as it looks like berlin might be too small a pond for " wowi , " as he 's affectionately known , critics are looking at his record and wondering if he has what it takes to jump to the federal level – and maybe one day even run for the top job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit and his partner jörn kubicki his sexuality does n't seem to figure large .
newspaper headlines have been fond of the expression " gay chancellor " of late and germans themselves are n't put off by it .
in a recent survey , 79 percent of germans said they did n't think homosexuality was a stumbling block on the way to the chancellery . " i think the population is further along than politicians when it comes to that , " said klaus jetz , director of the gay and lesbian federation of germany , who said he was n't surprised at the poll results .
" the sexuality of a chancellor does n't influence his or her policies . " that may be true , say others , but add that wowereit 's record in berlin , particularly when it comes to attracting industry , is not particularly good .
the berlin office of the free democrats , germany 's free-market liberal party , recently sent the mayor a book entitled " klaus wowereit 's ideas for more economic growth and jobs in berlin . "
the book was blank . while the mayor shows enthusiasm for attracting media and other creative - read " sexy " - companies to the capital , critics say he is blasé about getting big players here which could employ big numbers . " in general , he has an attitude that is hostile to the economy , " said markus löning , chair of the berlin fdp . " business people who are interested in investing in berlin ca n't even get an appointment with him . " others question his intellectual heft , and even wowereit himself admits in his book he was never a big reader .

but the latest survey among 9-14 year olds in germany sponsored by the lbs building society reveals that childhood in germany is fraught with the same fear of failure and psychosomatic illness that probably keeps the likes of donald trump awake at night .
comprehensive survey the report questioned over 6000 children in seven states on how they felt about family , school , politics and current affairs , asking them about their self-image , hopes and fears , pocket money , internet use , tv consumption and eating habits .
preying most on kids ' minds is school .
one third of those questioned said they were scared not just of bad grades , but also of being laughed at by their peers and their teachers .
over 50 percent admitted they felt stressed at school , saying they had been insulted , harassed or publicly humiliated in the week the survey was carried out , with one in five revealing the aggressor was a teacher .
academically , children felt particularly under pressure in bavaria and saxony , two states which regularly top the polls in national student assessment ratings .
tired and emotional bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much tv does n't make for happy kids as a result , many children internalize their worries .
one third of those polled said they suffered from frequent headaches and stomach aches .
" these are classic symptoms of stress and pressure , " said german family minister ursula von der leyen , who presented the report in berlin wednesday .
adding to physical ill-health is bad diet .
one in three children admitted they did n't always eat breakfast , with the same number admitting to eating candy on a regular basis .
one in five confessed they never or rarely eat vegetables , while one third would n't touch wholemeal bread .
one on five children feels overweight , one in ten too thin .
one in five children also said they seldom ate with their parents , while further results showed that these kids were more likely to feel ill often .
the children of unemployed parents are more likely to eat fast food , and these kids are correspondingly more inclined to suffer from illness and stress .
and although two thirds of 9-14s belong to sports ' clubs , the majority exercises just once a week .
" when we 've reached a point where tv and fast food have replaced shared mealtimes and exercise , then we need to act , " said von der leyen .
" exercise once a week is not enough " she added .
respecting boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family meals help kids stay healthy but it might prove difficult getting kids to sit down and eat dinner with their parents when most of those questioned said they want more privacy .
von der leyen said mothers should avoid snooping in their kids ' diaries , and fathers should make a point of knocking on the bedroom door before entering .
she also pointed out that children said they wanted more freedom of opinion and more leisure time , with 20 percent of those asked saying they hankered for more relaxation and play .
" we adults frequently make the mistake of underestimating our children , " she said .
" they can do more than we think , they 're more aware than we realize and they 're interested in more issues than we can imagine . "

but the latest survey among 9-14 year olds in germany sponsored by the lbs building society reveals that childhood in germany is fraught with the same fear of failure and psychosomatic illness that probably keeps the likes of donald trump awake at night .
comprehensive survey the report questioned over 6000 children in seven states on how they felt about family , school , politics and current affairs , asking them about their self-image , hopes and fears , pocket money , internet use , tv consumption and eating habits .
preying most on kids ' minds is school .
one third of those questioned said they were scared not just of bad grades , but also of being laughed at by their peers and their teachers .
over 50 percent admitted they felt stressed at school , saying they had been insulted , harassed or publicly humiliated in the week the survey was carried out , with one in five revealing the aggressor was a teacher .
academically , children felt particularly under pressure in bavaria and saxony , two states which regularly top the polls in national student assessment ratings .
tired and emotional bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much tv does n't make for happy kids as a result , many children internalize their worries .
one third of those polled said they suffered from frequent headaches and stomach aches .
" these are classic symptoms of stress and pressure , " said german family minister ursula von der leyen , who presented the report in berlin wednesday .
adding to physical ill-health is bad diet .
one in three children admitted they did n't always eat breakfast , with the same number admitting to eating candy on a regular basis .
one in five confessed they never or rarely eat vegetables , while one third would n't touch wholemeal bread .
one on five children feels overweight , one in ten too thin .
one in five children also said they seldom ate with their parents , while further results showed that these kids were more likely to feel ill often .
the children of unemployed parents are more likely to eat fast food , and these kids are correspondingly more inclined to suffer from illness and stress .
and although two thirds of 9-14s belong to sports ' clubs , the majority exercises just once a week .
" when we 've reached a point where tv and fast food have replaced shared mealtimes and exercise , then we need to act , " said von der leyen .
" exercise once a week is not enough " she added .
respecting boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family meals help kids stay healthy but it might prove difficult getting kids to sit down and eat dinner with their parents when most of those questioned said they want more privacy .
von der leyen said mothers should avoid snooping in their kids ' diaries , and fathers should make a point of knocking on the bedroom door before entering .
she also pointed out that children said they wanted more freedom of opinion and more leisure time , with 20 percent of those asked saying they hankered for more relaxation and play .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de lifestyle -pipe- 01.10.2007 rebranding the german capital großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some bright spark should be able to come up with a new slogan for berlin in recent years , berlin 's best-known slogan has been " poor but sexy . "
pithy , but not necessarily the image a dignified capital wants to project to the world .
the mayor asked the public if it had any better ideas . the capital 's famously flamboyant mayor klaus wowereit recently appointed a " berlin board , " entrusted to " position the berlin brand " internationally . its illustrious line-up includes architects hans kollhoff and peter hall , catherine mühlemann , mtv 's head of central and emerging markets , and the city 's education minister jürgen zöllner .
the mayor hopes the team , which began work in august , will help steer the capital to lasting global stardom , consolidate its reputation as a cutting edge cultural hotspot and provide it with useful professional contacts .
but wowi , as the mayor 's affectionately known , is also keen for the public to do its bit and has called on the city 's denizens to help come up with a new slogan for the city . " a corporate identity for berlin needs to come from its public , " he said .
" it ca n't be imposed from above . "
commercial clout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a city of many faces wowi himself was the man who first labeled berlin as " poor but sexy " - not , perhaps , the most persuasive branding strategy even if broadly accurate .
ideally , city slogans should be timeless , original and memorable .
a good one , like a good title , can be a valuable tool of identification .
and , as cities like las vegas -lrb- " what happens here , stays here " -rrb- can attest to , an effective slogan can also have considerable commercial value .
the competition designed to reinvent how people see berlin ends on oct .
1 , and the suggestions have been pouring in .
" the contest got a good reception , " the berlin senate 's spokesman günter kolodziej told spiegel online , adding that a second wind of enthusiasm was expected as the deadline approaches .
city of change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : city of encounters , indeed but not all the proposals have been serious .
berlin 's bi-weekly listings magazine zitty suggested the phrase " we do it all .
but we do it all wrong , " which has a certain ring of truth to it in the light of spectacular semi-disasters such as the expensive new central train station , which started falling apart as soon as the wind picked up .
another suggestion was " berlin : city of encounters " - a reference to the mayor 's party-loving reputation . but now it 's up to the public .
and according to the mayor , they 're more than equal to the task . " berlin secret weapon is its people , " wowereit stressed on the berlin city web site . " they are the real heroes of the berlin brand .
it is their personalities that make this city exciting and unique . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , are zooming in on the role of the internet in the planning of terrorist attacks .
eu justice commissioner franco frattini is pushing for greater powers to monitor the web .
frattini is in favor of developing technology to block and monitor internet sites offering bomb-making recipes as well as making online recruiting of terrorists a punishable offense .
" they -lrb- terrorists -rrb- can find precise information and instructions for all kinds of terror attacks on the internet , for instance how to make bombs , " frattini said ahead of the meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini wants to develop a whole range of new tools to fight terrorism however , the aim is not to " follow every person that ' googles ' the word ' bomb ' on the internet , " frattini added , referring to the wariness the proposed measures have triggered among critics and proponents of civil liberties .
online surveillance being stepped up in response to a recent series of arrests and the unfolding of terror plots and planned strikes in sweden , germany and austria , individual countries in europe are already moving ahead to step up surveillance of the internet .
in germany , interior minister wolfgang schäuble is seeking powers allowing investigators to send software that secretly installs itself on specific computers , relaying data to police computers as users operate online .
a court in germany is also trying a man for posting al qaeda hate messages and audio and video recordings , by osama bin laden among others , in an internet chartroom for islamists .
the defendant 's computer was being monitored for a year and a half by security officials before the man was arrested .
in sweden , too , the defense minister has cited the threat of terrorism to seek broad powers to monitor e-mail traffic without court orders .
controversial recording of data at monday 's meeting , frattini is expected to bring up another controversial security proposal .
following the example of the us , the commissioner wants to collect data on all airline passengers flying into the eu and keep a register of foreigners entering or leaving the bloc that would ultimately include details such as their photograph , fingerprint and even a retina scan .
under the proposals , law enforcement officials in all member states would be allowed to share the data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini wants to gather data on all passengers flying into the eu " europe is a target of terrorism , just like the united states .
and i simply can not ignore that there is a real threat that one day terrorists will try once again to attack a country in the eu , " frattini said .
the commissioner also wants to create an eu-wide data bank in which police across the bloc can enter information on the theft of explosives .
the measure will help authorities follow the trail of terrorists faster and thus thwart attacks , according to frattini .
the eu commissioner is to present the exact details of his counterterrorism proposals in early november .
he is expected to lobby support for the plans among the eu 's 27 interior ministers at the informal talks in lisbon whose approval is crucial for the go-ahead . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and this evaluation does n't have anything to do with the fact that the german team succeeded in winning its second title in a row - something the men 's team has still never done . the 16 national teams have spectacularly shown that women 's soccer has absolutely nothing to do with the seemingly ineradicable views of armchair players .
the world cup was , without a doubt , a tournament played at a high technical and tactical level .
women 's soccer today is fairer than men 's , offensive and well-played at a pace that has clearly sped up .
of course , the men are still faster , but that 's the case in track and field , too .
are those races any more boring because of it ? the journey women 's soccer has taken from its beginnings when it was often chuckled at - or even openly ridiculed - can be shown in many ways .
while the women on the german team who won the 1989 european championships were rewarded with a coffee set , each member of the 2007 team will receive 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 71,165 -rrb- for winning the title .
and the nearly 40,000 spectators per game in china speak for themselves .
while the 1999 cup was broadcast in 67 countries , this time around it was 220 - and german television ratings were very high . the world cup in china has doubtlessly given women 's soccer a new worldwide impulse for further development .
the announcement from brazil to introduce a real professional league as soon as possible is only a small , first step .
if the sport still does n't make a giant leap in terms of public perception then it 's because of limited funding and the lack of a league structure . in comparison with men , there are also simply fewer women playing soccer , which lowers the number of truly gifted players .
the result is that the level of club soccer varies from club to club and is clearly lower than the soccer played by national teams .
that 's a reason why organizers should carefully consider whether the plan to increase the number of teams at the next world cup from 16 to 24 is the right decision . the world cup was also another test for the beijing summer olympics in 2008 , and it was a test spectators passed with flying colors while small and usually insignificant mistakes tarnished the organizers ' results . it leaves a bitter taste in many mouths when teams complain of sports espionage , journalists and players are constantly monitored and even have the feeling of being watched in their hotel rooms .

germany 's watertight defence did n't concede a single goal in the tournament , the first time ever that a soccer side has managed the feat .
31,000 fans in shanghai 's hongkou football stadium watched the fast-paced fifa women 's world cup final .
brazilian star striker marta , the top scorer in the tournament , failed to get in a penalty kick past goalkeeper nadine angerer , a goal which would have tied the game in the second half .
bildunterschrift : brazil 's marta grimaces after she failed to score a penalty kick " after the penalty save , i felt it was meant to be , " germany coach silvia neid said .
" we worked hard for each other , it was a great team performance .
it was important to work against marta , and we did a good job in pushing her to the sidelines . "
missed chances the nimble-footed brazilians were the better side in the first half , playing a fast aggressive game and piling up the pressure on the german defense .
marta , who won the best player of the tournament award , had the first chance of the game in the fourth minute with a long range drive stopped easily by angerer . seconds later , the physically stronger germans went on the attack when kerstin garefrekes was set free on the right only to slice her shot into the side netting .
in the eight minute , germany 's powerful defense seemed to falter for an instant when goalkeeper angerer failed to gather a free kick by brazil 's daniela .
the ball bounced out to formiga but she was unable to put the ball in the net .
daniela had another chance in the 23rd minute but was unlucky when she shot a left foot volley onto the post .
heroic saves by german goalie the germans finally picked up pace in the second half , determinedly pushing forward .
but it was only in the 52nd minute that they managed the breakthrough when captain birgit prinz was fed a pass by sandra smisek .
the veteran forward coolly slotted in the crossed ball on the turn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's defender aline , german forward sandra smisek and german midfielder melanie behringer fight for the ball but it was angerer who was the hero of the day when she stopped the spot kick by martha with her knees and then again when she held a flying strike by substitute rosana .
despite dominating ball possession , brazil 's spirited attack failed to break through the solid german defense and they failed to find an equalizer .
a stunning header by simone laudehr in the dying minutes of the game clinched the game for the ruthlessly efficient german side .
" germany deserved to win " " this was a very tough match , we missed a lot of chances especially when we were 1-0 down and marta missed a critical penalty , " said brazil coach jorge barcellos .
" but germany took their chances and scored .
i 'm very sad about this result but my players tried their best . "
the 21-year-old marta said she was crushed after the defeat but that the team had to look ahead . " it 's difficult to express my feelings .
the germans deserved to win , " she said .
" but we have to keep our chin up and prepare for the olympics in beijing . " in the third-place play-off , two-time champions the united states beat norway 4-1 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

participating politicians called for more investments in energy-efficiency measures and renewable energies rather than nuclear power . " we are no anti-nuclear coalition , but we want to show alternatives , " said austrian environment minister josef pröll .
the declaration , focusing on the safety and security risks surrounding nuclear energy , said this form of energy was not the best way to fight climate change . matthias machnig , german deputy minister for environment , criticized the alleged positive role of nuclear energy in reducing global greenhouse gases as a " myth , " adding that the world 's combined power plants would only contribute with 8 percent to carbon dioxide reduction . the discussion on nuclear energy only slowed down investment into energy efficiency and alternative energy forms , he said . nuclear renaissance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chernobyl disaster led some countries to rethink their nuclear power strategy support for nuclear energy dropped after the 1986 chernobyl disaster but the energy source has come back into fashion as governments and officials look at strategies toward lowering greenhouse gas emissions .

the former world chess champion faces a daunting challenge , as pro-kremlin candidates are expected to win . kasparov is a leading force behind other russia , a coalition which unites liberals , leftists and nationalists who oppose russian president vladimir putin .
the russian constitution requires putin to step down after serving two four-year terms .
his has yet to endorse a potential successor , but his approval is seen as pivotal to the upcoming elections , which will be held in march 2 , 2008 .
kasparov 's coalition has little public support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign season is just around the corner kasparov , 44 , won 379 of 498 votes at other russia coalition 's national congress .
yet kasparov 's place on the march ballot remains uncertain .
his candidacy needs to be registered and will likely be blocked .
even if he is allowed to run , kasparov is not expected to pose a major threat to putin 's candidate .
while kasparov is well known in europe for his chess exploits , the latest poll by the independent levada news agency shows 3 percent of russians will vote for the other russia candidate .
" the goal of the other russia is not winning elections , but to have an election , " kasparov said , speaking in english on the sidelines of the congress .
" we 're trying to force the regime to accept our right to participate in free and fair elections , to agitate the russian population and the russian public to support our ideas . "
kasparov calls for unity in opposing kremlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin won easily last time around kasparov says that putin 's broad public support comes from the kremlin 's control over the media and the electoral process .
" i will do everything possible for the ideas of other russia to win .
this will work only if we stay united , " kasparov said , adding the coalition stood for a " democratic and just russia . "
the other russia coalition is hampered by internal divisions and has been marginalized by the authorities .
kasparov founded the coalition in 2005 after a successful chess career .
kasparov faces challenge of his career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's like a game of chess kasparov is fond on comparing current political battles to his famous duels with anatoly karpov in the 1980s .
" back then , the chess system wanted to maintain a cosy status quo , avoiding any candidate worthy of the name to fight karpov , " he has said .
" the political situation in russia today reminds me of that time . "
kasparov was born in the former soviet republic of azerbaijan to armenian-jewish parents .
he took up chess in 1963 at the age of 6 and was a junior champion by the age of 13 .
he became the world 's youngest chess champion when he beat karpov in 1985 at the age of 22 .
political maneuvering underway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's endorsement seen as essential in presidential campaign there could be surprise contenders in the race , first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev said on sunday .
medvedev , who also chairs gas monopoly gazprom , has ruled out running for parliament as a pro-kremlin party candidate , but did not answer direct questions about whether he would run for president .
medvedev , 42 , is one of a small group of kremlin insiders who has been tipped as a possible successor to putin .
putin has not ruled out returning to power in 2012 .
he has kept everyone guessing about which candidate will get his crucial endorsement .
he surprised observers by appointing viktor zubkov , a relatively unknown 66-year-old former head of an anti-money laundering unit , as prime minister on sept .

putin , 54 , has said zubkov is one of five people who could succeed him , but so far has kept mum on the names of the others . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 , to forge a joint declaration against nuclear energy .
participating politicians called for more investments in energy-efficiency measures and renewable energies rather than nuclear power . " we are no anti-nuclear coalition , but we want to show alternatives , " said austrian environment minister josef pröll .
the declaration , focusing on the safety and security risks surrounding nuclear energy , said this form of energy was not the best way to fight climate change . matthias machnig , german deputy minister for environment , criticized the alleged positive role of nuclear energy in reducing global greenhouse gases as a " myth , " adding that the world 's combined power plants would only contribute with 8 percent to carbon dioxide reduction . the discussion on nuclear energy only slowed down investment into energy efficiency and alternative energy forms , he said . nuclear renaissance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chernobyl disaster led some countries to rethink their nuclear power strategy support for nuclear energy dropped after the 1986 chernobyl disaster but the energy source has come back into fashion as governments and officials look at strategies toward lowering greenhouse gas emissions .
recent increases in gas and oil prices as well as questions about the reliability of russian energy supplies have also raised european energy concerns . european union energy commissioner andris piebalgs said in an interview published in spanish daily el pais on monday that the eu should aim to generate 30 percent of its electricity from nuclear sources in order to ensure member states ' energy security . industry officials are promoting third-generation pressurized water reactors which provide greater energy , improved security and reduced waste compared to earlier versions of nuclear reactors .
these new reactors are still rejected by environmentalists . long-term ecological effects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power opponents question what will become of radioactive waste but italy 's environment minister alfonso pecoraro scanio warned of the long-term ecological effects - his country is still dealing with nuclear waste , 20 years after quitting nuclear energy . latvia was the only country in the group that is actively moving ahead with expanding its nuclear energy capabilities , while all other seven members either have no nuclear energy or are planning a phase-out , like germany . the cooperation was no contradiction , latvia 's deputy environment secretary martins jirgens said , as he hoped the planned latvian involvement in the construction of the lithuanian nuclear reactor ignalina would not go ahead . an issue for national governments european commission chief jose manuel barroso urged eu nations on monday to hold a " total and frank debate " about the use of nuclear energy .

germany 's watertight defence did n't concede a single goal in the tournament , the first time ever that a soccer side has managed the feat .
31,000 fans in shanghai 's hongkou football stadium watched the fast-paced fifa women 's world cup final .
brazilian star striker marta , the top scorer in the tournament , failed to get in a penalty kick past goalkeeper nadine angerer , a goal which would have tied the game in the second half .
bildunterschrift : brazil 's marta grimaces after she failed to score a penalty kick " after the penalty save , i felt it was meant to be , " germany coach silvia neid said .
" we worked hard for each other , it was a great team performance .
it was important to work against marta , and we did a good job in pushing her to the sidelines . "
missed chances the nimble-footed brazilians were the better side in the first half , playing a fast aggressive game and piling up the pressure on the german defense .
marta , who won the best player of the tournament award , had the first chance of the game in the fourth minute with a long range drive stopped easily by angerer . seconds later , the physically stronger germans went on the attack when kerstin garefrekes was set free on the right only to slice her shot into the side netting .
in the eight minute , germany 's powerful defense seemed to falter for an instant when goalkeeper angerer failed to gather a free kick by brazil 's daniela .
the ball bounced out to formiga but she was unable to put the ball in the net .
daniela had another chance in the 23rd minute but was unlucky when she shot a left foot volley onto the post .
heroic saves by german goalie the germans finally picked up pace in the second half , determinedly pushing forward .
but it was only in the 52nd minute that they managed the breakthrough when captain birgit prinz was fed a pass by sandra smisek .
the veteran forward coolly slotted in the crossed ball on the turn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's defender aline , german forward sandra smisek and german midfielder melanie behringer fight for the ball but it was angerer who was the hero of the day when she stopped the spot kick by martha with her knees and then again when she held a flying strike by substitute rosana .
despite dominating ball possession , brazil 's spirited attack failed to break through the solid german defense and they failed to find an equalizer .
a stunning header by simone laudehr in the dying minutes of the game clinched the game for the ruthlessly efficient german side .
" germany deserved to win " " this was a very tough match , we missed a lot of chances especially when we were 1-0 down and marta missed a critical penalty , " said brazil coach jorge barcellos .
" but germany took their chances and scored .
i 'm very sad about this result but my players tried their best . "
the 21-year-old marta said she was crushed after the defeat but that the team had to look ahead . " it 's difficult to express my feelings .

germany 's watertight defence did n't concede a single goal in the tournament , the first time ever that a soccer side has managed the feat .
31,000 fans in shanghai 's hongkou football stadium watched the fast-paced fifa women 's world cup final .
brazilian star striker marta , the top scorer in the tournament , failed to get in a penalty kick past goalkeeper nadine angerer , a goal which would have tied the game in the second half .
bildunterschrift : brazil 's marta grimaces after she failed to score a penalty kick " after the penalty save , i felt it was meant to be , " germany coach silvia neid said .
" we worked hard for each other , it was a great team performance .
it was important to work against marta , and we did a good job in pushing her to the sidelines . "
missed chances the nimble-footed brazilians were the better side in the first half , playing a fast aggressive game and piling up the pressure on the german defense .
marta , who won the best player of the tournament award , had the first chance of the game in the fourth minute with a long range drive stopped easily by angerer . seconds later , the physically stronger germans went on the attack when kerstin garefrekes was set free on the right only to slice her shot into the side netting .
in the eight minute , germany 's powerful defense seemed to falter for an instant when goalkeeper angerer failed to gather a free kick by brazil 's daniela .
the ball bounced out to formiga but she was unable to put the ball in the net .
daniela had another chance in the 23rd minute but was unlucky when she shot a left foot volley onto the post .
heroic saves by german goalie the germans finally picked up pace in the second half , determinedly pushing forward .
but it was only in the 52nd minute that they managed the breakthrough when captain birgit prinz was fed a pass by sandra smisek .
the veteran forward coolly slotted in the crossed ball on the turn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's defender aline , german forward sandra smisek and german midfielder melanie behringer fight for the ball but it was angerer who was the hero of the day when she stopped the spot kick by martha with her knees and then again when she held a flying strike by substitute rosana .
despite dominating ball possession , brazil 's spirited attack failed to break through the solid german defense and they failed to find an equalizer .
a stunning header by simone laudehr in the dying minutes of the game clinched the game for the ruthlessly efficient german side .
" germany deserved to win " " this was a very tough match , we missed a lot of chances especially when we were 1-0 down and marta missed a critical penalty , " said brazil coach jorge barcellos .
" but germany took their chances and scored .
i 'm very sad about this result but my players tried their best . "
the 21-year-old marta said she was crushed after the defeat but that the team had to look ahead . " it 's difficult to express my feelings .
the germans deserved to win , " she said .

the former world chess champion faces a daunting challenge , as pro-kremlin candidates are expected to win . kasparov is a leading force behind other russia , a coalition which unites liberals , leftists and nationalists who oppose russian president vladimir putin .
the russian constitution requires putin to step down after serving two four-year terms .
his has yet to endorse a potential successor , but his approval is seen as pivotal to the upcoming elections , which will be held in march 2 , 2008 .
kasparov 's coalition has little public support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign season is just around the corner kasparov , 44 , won 379 of 498 votes at other russia coalition 's national congress .
yet kasparov 's place on the march ballot remains uncertain .
his candidacy needs to be registered and will likely be blocked .
even if he is allowed to run , kasparov is not expected to pose a major threat to putin 's candidate .
while kasparov is well known in europe for his chess exploits , the latest poll by the independent levada news agency shows 3 percent of russians will vote for the other russia candidate .
" the goal of the other russia is not winning elections , but to have an election , " kasparov said , speaking in english on the sidelines of the congress .
" we 're trying to force the regime to accept our right to participate in free and fair elections , to agitate the russian population and the russian public to support our ideas . "
kasparov calls for unity in opposing kremlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin won easily last time around kasparov says that putin 's broad public support comes from the kremlin 's control over the media and the electoral process .

this will work only if we stay united , " kasparov said , adding the coalition stood for a " democratic and just russia . "

" back then , the chess system wanted to maintain a cosy status quo , avoiding any candidate worthy of the name to fight karpov , " he has said .
" the political situation in russia today reminds me of that time . "
kasparov was born in the former soviet republic of azerbaijan to armenian-jewish parents .
he took up chess in 1963 at the age of 6 and was a junior champion by the age of 13 .
he became the world 's youngest chess champion when he beat karpov in 1985 at the age of 22 .
political maneuvering underway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's endorsement seen as essential in presidential campaign there could be surprise contenders in the race , first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev said on sunday .

medvedev , 42 , is one of a small group of kremlin insiders who has been tipped as a possible successor to putin .
putin has not ruled out returning to power in 2012 .

europeans are divided on whether to refer to it as burma or myanmar . pro-democracy demonstrations led by buddhist monks clad in orange robes have grabbed headlines in recent weeks .
in the media coverage , the country is variously referred to as burma or myanmar .
in europe , no concensus exists on how to refer to the former british colony of burma , which won independence in 1948 .
both versions have linguistic legitimacy .
in the burmese language , myanmar is the formal term and burma is the informal , everyday word .
official name change dates to 1989 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to china , it 's myanmar as far as the military junta is concerned , their country should be referred to as myanmar .
the junta officially changed the english name in 1989 .
yet the change was not universally adopted .
in europe , great britain and ireland do not recognize the legitimacy of the military junta and have also continued to use burma exclusively .
exiles also refer to it as burma .
the united nations , recognizing a country 's right to call itself as it wishes , uses myanmar , as do france and germany .
yet while germany 's foreign ministry uses myanmar , the german media use burma .
the european union sits squarely on the fence , referring to the country burma / myanmar in documents on its web site .
the united states government , like britain , does n't recognize the legitimacy of the military rulers in myanmar , and calls the country burma .
but major media outlets such as the new york times , cnn and the associated press refer to it as myanmar .
difference of opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesting monks the name is useful in gauging how countries feel about the regime , pro-democracy activists say .
china , which has been supportive of the military regime , refers to the country as myanmar .
" myanmar is a kind of indicator of countries that are soft on the regime , " mark farmener of burma campaign in the uk told the bbc .
" but really it 's not important .
who cares what people call the country ?
it 's the human rights abuses that matter . "
the tipping point for the current unrest was the government 's decision in mid-august to double fuel prices .
myanmar was relatively prosperous when it gained independence from britain in 1945 , but after 45 years of military rule and economic hardship , it is one of the world 's poorest countries .
in 1988 , a series of peaceful protests led to the current military government seizing power .
elections took place in 1990 , in which the democracy party under the leadership of aung san suu kyi won 82 percent of the vote .
but the elections were not honored by the military regime .
rangoon vs. yangon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police have dealt violently with protestors the regime also changed the english name of myanmar 's largest city from rangoon to yangon .
in 2005 , the government decamped from yangon entirely , building a new capital from scratch , which was named naypyidaw -lrb- royal residence -rrb- .
as for how to pronounce myanmar , the bbc said that the stress can be on any of the word 's three syllables .
the first syllable can be pronounced " mee " as in " meet " or alternatively " my " as in " cry . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

europeans are divided on whether to refer to it as burma or myanmar . pro-democracy demonstrations led by buddhist monks clad in orange robes have grabbed headlines in recent weeks .
in the media coverage , the country is variously referred to as burma or myanmar .
in europe , no concensus exists on how to refer to the former british colony of burma , which won independence in 1948 .
both versions have linguistic legitimacy .
in the burmese language , myanmar is the formal term and burma is the informal , everyday word .
official name change dates to 1989 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to china , it 's myanmar as far as the military junta is concerned , their country should be referred to as myanmar .
the junta officially changed the english name in 1989 .
yet the change was not universally adopted .
in europe , great britain and ireland do not recognize the legitimacy of the military junta and have also continued to use burma exclusively .
exiles also refer to it as burma .
the united nations , recognizing a country 's right to call itself as it wishes , uses myanmar , as do france and germany .
yet while germany 's foreign ministry uses myanmar , the german media use burma .
the european union sits squarely on the fence , referring to the country burma / myanmar in documents on its web site .
the united states government , like britain , does n't recognize the legitimacy of the military rulers in myanmar , and calls the country burma .
but major media outlets such as the new york times , cnn and the associated press refer to it as myanmar .

1 , are zooming in on the role of the internet in the planning of terrorist attacks .
eu justice commissioner franco frattini is pushing for greater powers to monitor the web .
frattini is in favor of developing technology to block and monitor internet sites offering bomb-making recipes as well as making online recruiting of terrorists a punishable offense .
" they -lrb- terrorists -rrb- can find precise information and instructions for all kinds of terror attacks on the internet , for instance how to make bombs , " frattini said ahead of the meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini wants to develop a whole range of new tools to fight terrorism however , the aim is not to " follow every person that ' googles ' the word ' bomb ' on the internet , " frattini added , referring to the wariness the proposed measures have triggered among critics and proponents of civil liberties .
online surveillance being stepped up in response to a recent series of arrests and the unfolding of terror plots and planned strikes in sweden , germany and austria , individual countries in europe are already moving ahead to step up surveillance of the internet .
in germany , interior minister wolfgang schäuble is seeking powers allowing investigators to send software that secretly installs itself on specific computers , relaying data to police computers as users operate online .
a court in germany is also trying a man for posting al qaeda hate messages and audio and video recordings , by osama bin laden among others , in an internet chartroom for islamists .
the defendant 's computer was being monitored for a year and a half by security officials before the man was arrested .
in sweden , too , the defense minister has cited the threat of terrorism to seek broad powers to monitor e-mail traffic without court orders .
controversial recording of data at monday 's meeting , frattini is expected to bring up another controversial security proposal .
following the example of the us , the commissioner wants to collect data on all airline passengers flying into the eu and keep a register of foreigners entering or leaving the bloc that would ultimately include details such as their photograph , fingerprint and even a retina scan .
under the proposals , law enforcement officials in all member states would be allowed to share the data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini wants to gather data on all passengers flying into the eu " europe is a target of terrorism , just like the united states .
and i simply can not ignore that there is a real threat that one day terrorists will try once again to attack a country in the eu , " frattini said .
the commissioner also wants to create an eu-wide data bank in which police across the bloc can enter information on the theft of explosives .
the measure will help authorities follow the trail of terrorists faster and thus thwart attacks , according to frattini .
the eu commissioner is to present the exact details of his counterterrorism proposals in early november .
he is expected to lobby support for the plans among the eu 's 27 interior ministers at the informal talks in lisbon whose approval is crucial for the go-ahead . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's watertight defence did n't concede a single goal in the tournament , the first time ever that a soccer side has managed the feat .
31,000 fans in shanghai 's hongkou football stadium watched the fast-paced fifa women 's world cup final .
brazilian star striker marta , the top scorer in the tournament , failed to get in a penalty kick past goalkeeper nadine angerer , a goal which would have tied the game in the second half .
bildunterschrift : brazil 's marta grimaces after she failed to score a penalty kick " after the penalty save , i felt it was meant to be , " germany coach silvia neid said .
" we worked hard for each other , it was a great team performance .
it was important to work against marta , and we did a good job in pushing her to the sidelines . "
missed chances the nimble-footed brazilians were the better side in the first half , playing a fast aggressive game and piling up the pressure on the german defense .
marta , who won the best player of the tournament award , had the first chance of the game in the fourth minute with a long range drive stopped easily by angerer . seconds later , the physically stronger germans went on the attack when kerstin garefrekes was set free on the right only to slice her shot into the side netting .
in the eight minute , germany 's powerful defense seemed to falter for an instant when goalkeeper angerer failed to gather a free kick by brazil 's daniela .
the ball bounced out to formiga but she was unable to put the ball in the net .
daniela had another chance in the 23rd minute but was unlucky when she shot a left foot volley onto the post .
heroic saves by german goalie the germans finally picked up pace in the second half , determinedly pushing forward .
but it was only in the 52nd minute that they managed the breakthrough when captain birgit prinz was fed a pass by sandra smisek .
the veteran forward coolly slotted in the crossed ball on the turn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's defender aline , german forward sandra smisek and german midfielder melanie behringer fight for the ball but it was angerer who was the hero of the day when she stopped the spot kick by martha with her knees and then again when she held a flying strike by substitute rosana .
despite dominating ball possession , brazil 's spirited attack failed to break through the solid german defense and they failed to find an equalizer .
a stunning header by simone laudehr in the dying minutes of the game clinched the game for the ruthlessly efficient german side .
" germany deserved to win " " this was a very tough match , we missed a lot of chances especially when we were 1-0 down and marta missed a critical penalty , " said brazil coach jorge barcellos .
" but germany took their chances and scored .
i 'm very sad about this result but my players tried their best . "
the 21-year-old marta said she was crushed after the defeat but that the team had to look ahead . " it 's difficult to express my feelings .
the germans deserved to win , " she said .

but the latest survey among 9-14 year olds in germany sponsored by the lbs building society reveals that childhood in germany is fraught with the same fear of failure and psychosomatic illness that probably keeps the likes of donald trump awake at night .
comprehensive survey the report questioned over 6000 children in seven states on how they felt about family , school , politics and current affairs , asking them about their self-image , hopes and fears , pocket money , internet use , tv consumption and eating habits .
preying most on kids ' minds is school .
one third of those questioned said they were scared not just of bad grades , but also of being laughed at by their peers and their teachers .
over 50 percent admitted they felt stressed at school , saying they had been insulted , harassed or publicly humiliated in the week the survey was carried out , with one in five revealing the aggressor was a teacher .
academically , children felt particularly under pressure in bavaria and saxony , two states which regularly top the polls in national student assessment ratings .
tired and emotional bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much tv does n't make for happy kids as a result , many children internalize their worries .
one third of those polled said they suffered from frequent headaches and stomach aches .
" these are classic symptoms of stress and pressure , " said german family minister ursula von der leyen , who presented the report in berlin wednesday .
adding to physical ill-health is bad diet .
one in three children admitted they did n't always eat breakfast , with the same number admitting to eating candy on a regular basis .
one in five confessed they never or rarely eat vegetables , while one third would n't touch wholemeal bread .
one on five children feels overweight , one in ten too thin .
one in five children also said they seldom ate with their parents , while further results showed that these kids were more likely to feel ill often .
the children of unemployed parents are more likely to eat fast food , and these kids are correspondingly more inclined to suffer from illness and stress .
and although two thirds of 9-14s belong to sports ' clubs , the majority exercises just once a week .
" when we 've reached a point where tv and fast food have replaced shared mealtimes and exercise , then we need to act , " said von der leyen .
" exercise once a week is not enough " she added .
respecting boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family meals help kids stay healthy but it might prove difficult getting kids to sit down and eat dinner with their parents when most of those questioned said they want more privacy .
von der leyen said mothers should avoid snooping in their kids ' diaries , and fathers should make a point of knocking on the bedroom door before entering .
she also pointed out that children said they wanted more freedom of opinion and more leisure time , with 20 percent of those asked saying they hankered for more relaxation and play .
" we adults frequently make the mistake of underestimating our children , " she said .
" they can do more than we think , they 're more aware than we realize and they 're interested in more issues than we can imagine . "
" children need to be allowed to slow down and be given space to develop , " said von der leyen . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de school in the afternoon is new to germany , but catching on while parents in many countries of the world are used to dropping kids off at school in the morning and not seeing them until dinnertime , all-day schooling is just beginning to make in-roads in germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de lifestyle -pipe- 01.10.2007 rebranding the german capital großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some bright spark should be able to come up with a new slogan for berlin in recent years , berlin 's best-known slogan has been " poor but sexy . "
pithy , but not necessarily the image a dignified capital wants to project to the world .
the mayor asked the public if it had any better ideas . the capital 's famously flamboyant mayor klaus wowereit recently appointed a " berlin board , " entrusted to " position the berlin brand " internationally . its illustrious line-up includes architects hans kollhoff and peter hall , catherine mühlemann , mtv 's head of central and emerging markets , and the city 's education minister jürgen zöllner .
the mayor hopes the team , which began work in august , will help steer the capital to lasting global stardom , consolidate its reputation as a cutting edge cultural hotspot and provide it with useful professional contacts .
but wowi , as the mayor 's affectionately known , is also keen for the public to do its bit and has called on the city 's denizens to help come up with a new slogan for the city . " a corporate identity for berlin needs to come from its public , " he said .
" it ca n't be imposed from above . "
commercial clout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a city of many faces wowi himself was the man who first labeled berlin as " poor but sexy " - not , perhaps , the most persuasive branding strategy even if broadly accurate .
ideally , city slogans should be timeless , original and memorable .
a good one , like a good title , can be a valuable tool of identification .
and , as cities like las vegas -lrb- " what happens here , stays here " -rrb- can attest to , an effective slogan can also have considerable commercial value .
the competition designed to reinvent how people see berlin ends on oct .
1 , and the suggestions have been pouring in .
" the contest got a good reception , " the berlin senate 's spokesman günter kolodziej told spiegel online , adding that a second wind of enthusiasm was expected as the deadline approaches .
city of change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : city of encounters , indeed but not all the proposals have been serious .
berlin 's bi-weekly listings magazine zitty suggested the phrase " we do it all .
but we do it all wrong , " which has a certain ring of truth to it in the light of spectacular semi-disasters such as the expensive new central train station , which started falling apart as soon as the wind picked up .
another suggestion was " berlin : city of encounters " - a reference to the mayor 's party-loving reputation . but now it 's up to the public .
and according to the mayor , they 're more than equal to the task . " berlin secret weapon is its people , " wowereit stressed on the berlin city web site . " they are the real heroes of the berlin brand .
it is their personalities that make this city exciting and unique . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the latest survey among 9-14 year olds in germany sponsored by the lbs building society reveals that childhood in germany is fraught with the same fear of failure and psychosomatic illness that probably keeps the likes of donald trump awake at night .
comprehensive survey the report questioned over 6000 children in seven states on how they felt about family , school , politics and current affairs , asking them about their self-image , hopes and fears , pocket money , internet use , tv consumption and eating habits .
preying most on kids ' minds is school .
one third of those questioned said they were scared not just of bad grades , but also of being laughed at by their peers and their teachers .
over 50 percent admitted they felt stressed at school , saying they had been insulted , harassed or publicly humiliated in the week the survey was carried out , with one in five revealing the aggressor was a teacher .
academically , children felt particularly under pressure in bavaria and saxony , two states which regularly top the polls in national student assessment ratings .
tired and emotional bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much tv does n't make for happy kids as a result , many children internalize their worries .
one third of those polled said they suffered from frequent headaches and stomach aches .
" these are classic symptoms of stress and pressure , " said german family minister ursula von der leyen , who presented the report in berlin wednesday .
adding to physical ill-health is bad diet .
one in three children admitted they did n't always eat breakfast , with the same number admitting to eating candy on a regular basis .
one in five confessed they never or rarely eat vegetables , while one third would n't touch wholemeal bread .
one on five children feels overweight , one in ten too thin .
one in five children also said they seldom ate with their parents , while further results showed that these kids were more likely to feel ill often .
the children of unemployed parents are more likely to eat fast food , and these kids are correspondingly more inclined to suffer from illness and stress .
and although two thirds of 9-14s belong to sports ' clubs , the majority exercises just once a week .
" when we 've reached a point where tv and fast food have replaced shared mealtimes and exercise , then we need to act , " said von der leyen .
" exercise once a week is not enough " she added .
respecting boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family meals help kids stay healthy but it might prove difficult getting kids to sit down and eat dinner with their parents when most of those questioned said they want more privacy .
von der leyen said mothers should avoid snooping in their kids ' diaries , and fathers should make a point of knocking on the bedroom door before entering .
she also pointed out that children said they wanted more freedom of opinion and more leisure time , with 20 percent of those asked saying they hankered for more relaxation and play .
" we adults frequently make the mistake of underestimating our children , " she said .
" they can do more than we think , they 're more aware than we realize and they 're interested in more issues than we can imagine . "

but the latest survey among 9-14 year olds in germany sponsored by the lbs building society reveals that childhood in germany is fraught with the same fear of failure and psychosomatic illness that probably keeps the likes of donald trump awake at night .
comprehensive survey the report questioned over 6000 children in seven states on how they felt about family , school , politics and current affairs , asking them about their self-image , hopes and fears , pocket money , internet use , tv consumption and eating habits .
preying most on kids ' minds is school .
one third of those questioned said they were scared not just of bad grades , but also of being laughed at by their peers and their teachers .
over 50 percent admitted they felt stressed at school , saying they had been insulted , harassed or publicly humiliated in the week the survey was carried out , with one in five revealing the aggressor was a teacher .
academically , children felt particularly under pressure in bavaria and saxony , two states which regularly top the polls in national student assessment ratings .
tired and emotional bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much tv does n't make for happy kids as a result , many children internalize their worries .
one third of those polled said they suffered from frequent headaches and stomach aches .
" these are classic symptoms of stress and pressure , " said german family minister ursula von der leyen , who presented the report in berlin wednesday .
adding to physical ill-health is bad diet .
one in three children admitted they did n't always eat breakfast , with the same number admitting to eating candy on a regular basis .
one in five confessed they never or rarely eat vegetables , while one third would n't touch wholemeal bread .
one on five children feels overweight , one in ten too thin .
one in five children also said they seldom ate with their parents , while further results showed that these kids were more likely to feel ill often .
the children of unemployed parents are more likely to eat fast food , and these kids are correspondingly more inclined to suffer from illness and stress .
and although two thirds of 9-14s belong to sports ' clubs , the majority exercises just once a week .
" when we 've reached a point where tv and fast food have replaced shared mealtimes and exercise , then we need to act , " said von der leyen .
" exercise once a week is not enough " she added .
respecting boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family meals help kids stay healthy but it might prove difficult getting kids to sit down and eat dinner with their parents when most of those questioned said they want more privacy .
von der leyen said mothers should avoid snooping in their kids ' diaries , and fathers should make a point of knocking on the bedroom door before entering .
she also pointed out that children said they wanted more freedom of opinion and more leisure time , with 20 percent of those asked saying they hankered for more relaxation and play .
" we adults frequently make the mistake of underestimating our children , " she said .

but the latest survey among 9-14 year olds in germany sponsored by the lbs building society reveals that childhood in germany is fraught with the same fear of failure and psychosomatic illness that probably keeps the likes of donald trump awake at night .
comprehensive survey the report questioned over 6000 children in seven states on how they felt about family , school , politics and current affairs , asking them about their self-image , hopes and fears , pocket money , internet use , tv consumption and eating habits .
preying most on kids ' minds is school .
one third of those questioned said they were scared not just of bad grades , but also of being laughed at by their peers and their teachers .
over 50 percent admitted they felt stressed at school , saying they had been insulted , harassed or publicly humiliated in the week the survey was carried out , with one in five revealing the aggressor was a teacher .
academically , children felt particularly under pressure in bavaria and saxony , two states which regularly top the polls in national student assessment ratings .
tired and emotional bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much tv does n't make for happy kids as a result , many children internalize their worries .
one third of those polled said they suffered from frequent headaches and stomach aches .
" these are classic symptoms of stress and pressure , " said german family minister ursula von der leyen , who presented the report in berlin wednesday .
adding to physical ill-health is bad diet .
one in three children admitted they did n't always eat breakfast , with the same number admitting to eating candy on a regular basis .
one in five confessed they never or rarely eat vegetables , while one third would n't touch wholemeal bread .
one on five children feels overweight , one in ten too thin .
one in five children also said they seldom ate with their parents , while further results showed that these kids were more likely to feel ill often .
the children of unemployed parents are more likely to eat fast food , and these kids are correspondingly more inclined to suffer from illness and stress .
and although two thirds of 9-14s belong to sports ' clubs , the majority exercises just once a week .
" when we 've reached a point where tv and fast food have replaced shared mealtimes and exercise , then we need to act , " said von der leyen .
" exercise once a week is not enough " she added .
respecting boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family meals help kids stay healthy but it might prove difficult getting kids to sit down and eat dinner with their parents when most of those questioned said they want more privacy .
von der leyen said mothers should avoid snooping in their kids ' diaries , and fathers should make a point of knocking on the bedroom door before entering .
she also pointed out that children said they wanted more freedom of opinion and more leisure time , with 20 percent of those asked saying they hankered for more relaxation and play .
" we adults frequently make the mistake of underestimating our children , " she said .
" they can do more than we think , they 're more aware than we realize and they 're interested in more issues than we can imagine . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de children and families -pipe- 01.10.2007 germany 's kids heading for burnout großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : school children visit potsdam university children in germany say life is all work and no play , according to the " children 's barometer " - one of the country 's most comprehensive studies into childhood . stress , performance anxiety and frequent headaches - problems all too familiar to high-achieving executives but not generally associated with the under-14s .
but the latest survey among 9-14 year olds in germany sponsored by the lbs building society reveals that childhood in germany is fraught with the same fear of failure and psychosomatic illness that probably keeps the likes of donald trump awake at night .
comprehensive survey the report questioned over 6000 children in seven states on how they felt about family , school , politics and current affairs , asking them about their self-image , hopes and fears , pocket money , internet use , tv consumption and eating habits .
preying most on kids ' minds is school .
one third of those questioned said they were scared not just of bad grades , but also of being laughed at by their peers and their teachers .
over 50 percent admitted they felt stressed at school , saying they had been insulted , harassed or publicly humiliated in the week the survey was carried out , with one in five revealing the aggressor was a teacher .
academically , children felt particularly under pressure in bavaria and saxony , two states which regularly top the polls in national student assessment ratings .
tired and emotional bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much tv does n't make for happy kids as a result , many children internalize their worries .
one third of those polled said they suffered from frequent headaches and stomach aches .
" these are classic symptoms of stress and pressure , " said german family minister ursula von der leyen , who presented the report in berlin wednesday .
adding to physical ill-health is bad diet .
one in three children admitted they did n't always eat breakfast , with the same number admitting to eating candy on a regular basis .
one in five confessed they never or rarely eat vegetables , while one third would n't touch wholemeal bread .
one on five children feels overweight , one in ten too thin .
one in five children also said they seldom ate with their parents , while further results showed that these kids were more likely to feel ill often .
the children of unemployed parents are more likely to eat fast food , and these kids are correspondingly more inclined to suffer from illness and stress .
and although two thirds of 9-14s belong to sports ' clubs , the majority exercises just once a week .
" when we 've reached a point where tv and fast food have replaced shared mealtimes and exercise , then we need to act , " said von der leyen .
" exercise once a week is not enough " she added .
respecting boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family meals help kids stay healthy but it might prove difficult getting kids to sit down and eat dinner with their parents when most of those questioned said they want more privacy .
von der leyen said mothers should avoid snooping in their kids ' diaries , and fathers should make a point of knocking on the bedroom door before entering .
she also pointed out that children said they wanted more freedom of opinion and more leisure time , with 20 percent of those asked saying they hankered for more relaxation and play .
" we adults frequently make the mistake of underestimating our children , " she said .
" they can do more than we think , they 're more aware than we realize and they 're interested in more issues than we can imagine . "
" children need to be allowed to slow down and be given space to develop , " said von der leyen . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 01.10.2007 eu takes battle against terrorism online großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu ministers are zooming in on internet sites eu interior ministers are debating tools in the fight against terrorism with special emphasis on shoring up online security borders by monitoring and blocking web sites to foil the planning of attacks on the internet . eu interior ministers meeting for informal counter-terrorism talks in lisbon on monday , oct .
1 , are zooming in on the role of the internet in the planning of terrorist attacks .
eu justice commissioner franco frattini is pushing for greater powers to monitor the web .
frattini is in favor of developing technology to block and monitor internet sites offering bomb-making recipes as well as making online recruiting of terrorists a punishable offense .
" they -lrb- terrorists -rrb- can find precise information and instructions for all kinds of terror attacks on the internet , for instance how to make bombs , " frattini said ahead of the meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini wants to develop a whole range of new tools to fight terrorism however , the aim is not to " follow every person that ' googles ' the word ' bomb ' on the internet , " frattini added , referring to the wariness the proposed measures have triggered among critics and proponents of civil liberties .
online surveillance being stepped up in response to a recent series of arrests and the unfolding of terror plots and planned strikes in sweden , germany and austria , individual countries in europe are already moving ahead to step up surveillance of the internet .
in germany , interior minister wolfgang schäuble is seeking powers allowing investigators to send software that secretly installs itself on specific computers , relaying data to police computers as users operate online .
a court in germany is also trying a man for posting al qaeda hate messages and audio and video recordings , by osama bin laden among others , in an internet chartroom for islamists .
the defendant 's computer was being monitored for a year and a half by security officials before the man was arrested .
in sweden , too , the defense minister has cited the threat of terrorism to seek broad powers to monitor e-mail traffic without court orders .
controversial recording of data at monday 's meeting , frattini is expected to bring up another controversial security proposal .
following the example of the us , the commissioner wants to collect data on all airline passengers flying into the eu and keep a register of foreigners entering or leaving the bloc that would ultimately include details such as their photograph , fingerprint and even a retina scan .
under the proposals , law enforcement officials in all member states would be allowed to share the data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini wants to gather data on all passengers flying into the eu " europe is a target of terrorism , just like the united states .
and i simply can not ignore that there is a real threat that one day terrorists will try once again to attack a country in the eu , " frattini said .
the commissioner also wants to create an eu-wide data bank in which police across the bloc can enter information on the theft of explosives .
the measure will help authorities follow the trail of terrorists faster and thus thwart attacks , according to frattini .
the eu commissioner is to present the exact details of his counterterrorism proposals in early november .
he is expected to lobby support for the plans among the eu 's 27 interior ministers at the informal talks in lisbon whose approval is crucial for the go-ahead . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the former world chess champion faces a daunting challenge , as pro-kremlin candidates are expected to win . kasparov is a leading force behind other russia , a coalition which unites liberals , leftists and nationalists who oppose russian president vladimir putin .
the russian constitution requires putin to step down after serving two four-year terms .

yet kasparov 's place on the march ballot remains uncertain .
his candidacy needs to be registered and will likely be blocked .
even if he is allowed to run , kasparov is not expected to pose a major threat to putin 's candidate .
while kasparov is well known in europe for his chess exploits , the latest poll by the independent levada news agency shows 3 percent of russians will vote for the other russia candidate .
" the goal of the other russia is not winning elections , but to have an election , " kasparov said , speaking in english on the sidelines of the congress .
" we 're trying to force the regime to accept our right to participate in free and fair elections , to agitate the russian population and the russian public to support our ideas . "

" the political situation in russia today reminds me of that time . "
kasparov was born in the former soviet republic of azerbaijan to armenian-jewish parents .

medvedev , 42 , is one of a small group of kremlin insiders who has been tipped as a possible successor to putin .
putin has not ruled out returning to power in 2012 .

putin has not ruled out returning to power in 2012 .
he has kept everyone guessing about which candidate will get his crucial endorsement .
he surprised observers by appointing viktor zubkov , a relatively unknown 66-year-old former head of an anti-money laundering unit , as prime minister on sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de lifestyle -pipe- 01.10.2007 rebranding the german capital großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some bright spark should be able to come up with a new slogan for berlin in recent years , berlin 's best-known slogan has been " poor but sexy . "
pithy , but not necessarily the image a dignified capital wants to project to the world .
the mayor asked the public if it had any better ideas . the capital 's famously flamboyant mayor klaus wowereit recently appointed a " berlin board , " entrusted to " position the berlin brand " internationally . its illustrious line-up includes architects hans kollhoff and peter hall , catherine mühlemann , mtv 's head of central and emerging markets , and the city 's education minister jürgen zöllner .
the mayor hopes the team , which began work in august , will help steer the capital to lasting global stardom , consolidate its reputation as a cutting edge cultural hotspot and provide it with useful professional contacts .
but wowi , as the mayor 's affectionately known , is also keen for the public to do its bit and has called on the city 's denizens to help come up with a new slogan for the city . " a corporate identity for berlin needs to come from its public , " he said .
" it ca n't be imposed from above . "
commercial clout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a city of many faces wowi himself was the man who first labeled berlin as " poor but sexy " - not , perhaps , the most persuasive branding strategy even if broadly accurate .
ideally , city slogans should be timeless , original and memorable .
a good one , like a good title , can be a valuable tool of identification .
and , as cities like las vegas -lrb- " what happens here , stays here " -rrb- can attest to , an effective slogan can also have considerable commercial value .
the competition designed to reinvent how people see berlin ends on oct .
1 , and the suggestions have been pouring in .
" the contest got a good reception , " the berlin senate 's spokesman günter kolodziej told spiegel online , adding that a second wind of enthusiasm was expected as the deadline approaches .
city of change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : city of encounters , indeed but not all the proposals have been serious .
berlin 's bi-weekly listings magazine zitty suggested the phrase " we do it all .
but we do it all wrong , " which has a certain ring of truth to it in the light of spectacular semi-disasters such as the expensive new central train station , which started falling apart as soon as the wind picked up .
another suggestion was " berlin : city of encounters " - a reference to the mayor 's party-loving reputation . but now it 's up to the public .
and according to the mayor , they 're more than equal to the task . " berlin secret weapon is its people , " wowereit stressed on the berlin city web site . " they are the real heroes of the berlin brand .
it is their personalities that make this city exciting and unique . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's watertight defence did n't concede a single goal in the tournament , the first time ever that a soccer side has managed the feat .
31,000 fans in shanghai 's hongkou football stadium watched the fast-paced fifa women 's world cup final .
brazilian star striker marta , the top scorer in the tournament , failed to get in a penalty kick past goalkeeper nadine angerer , a goal which would have tied the game in the second half .
bildunterschrift : brazil 's marta grimaces after she failed to score a penalty kick " after the penalty save , i felt it was meant to be , " germany coach silvia neid said .
" we worked hard for each other , it was a great team performance .
it was important to work against marta , and we did a good job in pushing her to the sidelines . "
missed chances the nimble-footed brazilians were the better side in the first half , playing a fast aggressive game and piling up the pressure on the german defense .
marta , who won the best player of the tournament award , had the first chance of the game in the fourth minute with a long range drive stopped easily by angerer . seconds later , the physically stronger germans went on the attack when kerstin garefrekes was set free on the right only to slice her shot into the side netting .
in the eight minute , germany 's powerful defense seemed to falter for an instant when goalkeeper angerer failed to gather a free kick by brazil 's daniela .
the ball bounced out to formiga but she was unable to put the ball in the net .
daniela had another chance in the 23rd minute but was unlucky when she shot a left foot volley onto the post .
heroic saves by german goalie the germans finally picked up pace in the second half , determinedly pushing forward .
but it was only in the 52nd minute that they managed the breakthrough when captain birgit prinz was fed a pass by sandra smisek .
the veteran forward coolly slotted in the crossed ball on the turn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's defender aline , german forward sandra smisek and german midfielder melanie behringer fight for the ball but it was angerer who was the hero of the day when she stopped the spot kick by martha with her knees and then again when she held a flying strike by substitute rosana .
despite dominating ball possession , brazil 's spirited attack failed to break through the solid german defense and they failed to find an equalizer .
a stunning header by simone laudehr in the dying minutes of the game clinched the game for the ruthlessly efficient german side .
" germany deserved to win " " this was a very tough match , we missed a lot of chances especially when we were 1-0 down and marta missed a critical penalty , " said brazil coach jorge barcellos .
" but germany took their chances and scored .
i 'm very sad about this result but my players tried their best . "
the 21-year-old marta said she was crushed after the defeat but that the team had to look ahead . " it 's difficult to express my feelings .

30 , to forge a joint declaration against nuclear energy .
participating politicians called for more investments in energy-efficiency measures and renewable energies rather than nuclear power . " we are no anti-nuclear coalition , but we want to show alternatives , " said austrian environment minister josef pröll .
the declaration , focusing on the safety and security risks surrounding nuclear energy , said this form of energy was not the best way to fight climate change . matthias machnig , german deputy minister for environment , criticized the alleged positive role of nuclear energy in reducing global greenhouse gases as a " myth , " adding that the world 's combined power plants would only contribute with 8 percent to carbon dioxide reduction . the discussion on nuclear energy only slowed down investment into energy efficiency and alternative energy forms , he said . nuclear renaissance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chernobyl disaster led some countries to rethink their nuclear power strategy support for nuclear energy dropped after the 1986 chernobyl disaster but the energy source has come back into fashion as governments and officials look at strategies toward lowering greenhouse gas emissions .
recent increases in gas and oil prices as well as questions about the reliability of russian energy supplies have also raised european energy concerns . european union energy commissioner andris piebalgs said in an interview published in spanish daily el pais on monday that the eu should aim to generate 30 percent of its electricity from nuclear sources in order to ensure member states ' energy security . industry officials are promoting third-generation pressurized water reactors which provide greater energy , improved security and reduced waste compared to earlier versions of nuclear reactors .
these new reactors are still rejected by environmentalists . long-term ecological effects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power opponents question what will become of radioactive waste but italy 's environment minister alfonso pecoraro scanio warned of the long-term ecological effects - his country is still dealing with nuclear waste , 20 years after quitting nuclear energy . latvia was the only country in the group that is actively moving ahead with expanding its nuclear energy capabilities , while all other seven members either have no nuclear energy or are planning a phase-out , like germany . the cooperation was no contradiction , latvia 's deputy environment secretary martins jirgens said , as he hoped the planned latvian involvement in the construction of the lithuanian nuclear reactor ignalina would not go ahead . an issue for national governments european commission chief jose manuel barroso urged eu nations on monday to hold a " total and frank debate " about the use of nuclear energy . " member states can not avoid the question of nuclear energy , " he said monday during an energy conference in madrid .

brazilian star striker marta , the top scorer in the tournament , failed to get in a penalty kick past goalkeeper nadine angerer , a goal which would have tied the game in the second half .
bildunterschrift : brazil 's marta grimaces after she failed to score a penalty kick " after the penalty save , i felt it was meant to be , " germany coach silvia neid said .
" we worked hard for each other , it was a great team performance .
it was important to work against marta , and we did a good job in pushing her to the sidelines . "
missed chances the nimble-footed brazilians were the better side in the first half , playing a fast aggressive game and piling up the pressure on the german defense .
marta , who won the best player of the tournament award , had the first chance of the game in the fourth minute with a long range drive stopped easily by angerer . seconds later , the physically stronger germans went on the attack when kerstin garefrekes was set free on the right only to slice her shot into the side netting .
in the eight minute , germany 's powerful defense seemed to falter for an instant when goalkeeper angerer failed to gather a free kick by brazil 's daniela .
the ball bounced out to formiga but she was unable to put the ball in the net .
daniela had another chance in the 23rd minute but was unlucky when she shot a left foot volley onto the post .
heroic saves by german goalie the germans finally picked up pace in the second half , determinedly pushing forward .
but it was only in the 52nd minute that they managed the breakthrough when captain birgit prinz was fed a pass by sandra smisek .
the veteran forward coolly slotted in the crossed ball on the turn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's defender aline , german forward sandra smisek and german midfielder melanie behringer fight for the ball but it was angerer who was the hero of the day when she stopped the spot kick by martha with her knees and then again when she held a flying strike by substitute rosana .
despite dominating ball possession , brazil 's spirited attack failed to break through the solid german defense and they failed to find an equalizer .
a stunning header by simone laudehr in the dying minutes of the game clinched the game for the ruthlessly efficient german side .
" germany deserved to win " " this was a very tough match , we missed a lot of chances especially when we were 1-0 down and marta missed a critical penalty , " said brazil coach jorge barcellos .
" but germany took their chances and scored .
i 'm very sad about this result but my players tried their best . "
the 21-year-old marta said she was crushed after the defeat but that the team had to look ahead . " it 's difficult to express my feelings .
the germans deserved to win , " she said .
" but we have to keep our chin up and prepare for the olympics in beijing . " in the third-place play-off , two-time champions the united states beat norway 4-1 . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

europeans are divided on whether to refer to it as burma or myanmar . pro-democracy demonstrations led by buddhist monks clad in orange robes have grabbed headlines in recent weeks .
in the media coverage , the country is variously referred to as burma or myanmar .
in europe , no concensus exists on how to refer to the former british colony of burma , which won independence in 1948 .
both versions have linguistic legitimacy .
in the burmese language , myanmar is the formal term and burma is the informal , everyday word .
official name change dates to 1989 bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : to china , it 's myanmar as far as the military junta is concerned , their country should be referred to as myanmar .
the junta officially changed the english name in 1989 .
yet the change was not universally adopted .
in europe , great britain and ireland do not recognize the legitimacy of the military junta and have also continued to use burma exclusively .
exiles also refer to it as burma .
the united nations , recognizing a country 's right to call itself as it wishes , uses myanmar , as do france and germany .
yet while germany 's foreign ministry uses myanmar , the german media use burma .
the european union sits squarely on the fence , referring to the country burma / myanmar in documents on its web site .
the united states government , like britain , does n't recognize the legitimacy of the military rulers in myanmar , and calls the country burma .
but major media outlets such as the new york times , cnn and the associated press refer to it as myanmar .
difference of opinion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protesting monks the name is useful in gauging how countries feel about the regime , pro-democracy activists say .
china , which has been supportive of the military regime , refers to the country as myanmar .
" myanmar is a kind of indicator of countries that are soft on the regime , " mark farmener of burma campaign in the uk told the bbc .
" but really it 's not important .
who cares what people call the country ?
it 's the human rights abuses that matter . "
the tipping point for the current unrest was the government 's decision in mid-august to double fuel prices .
myanmar was relatively prosperous when it gained independence from britain in 1945 , but after 45 years of military rule and economic hardship , it is one of the world 's poorest countries .
in 1988 , a series of peaceful protests led to the current military government seizing power .
elections took place in 1990 , in which the democracy party under the leadership of aung san suu kyi won 82 percent of the vote .
but the elections were not honored by the military regime .
rangoon vs. yangon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : riot police have dealt violently with protestors the regime also changed the english name of myanmar 's largest city from rangoon to yangon .
in 2005 , the government decamped from yangon entirely , building a new capital from scratch , which was named naypyidaw -lrb- royal residence -rrb- .
as for how to pronounce myanmar , the bbc said that the stress can be on any of the word 's three syllables .
the first syllable can be pronounced " mee " as in " meet " or alternatively " my " as in " cry . " dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the former world chess champion faces a daunting challenge , as pro-kremlin candidates are expected to win . kasparov is a leading force behind other russia , a coalition which unites liberals , leftists and nationalists who oppose russian president vladimir putin .
the russian constitution requires putin to step down after serving two four-year terms .
his has yet to endorse a potential successor , but his approval is seen as pivotal to the upcoming elections , which will be held in march 2 , 2008 .
kasparov 's coalition has little public support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign season is just around the corner kasparov , 44 , won 379 of 498 votes at other russia coalition 's national congress .
yet kasparov 's place on the march ballot remains uncertain .
his candidacy needs to be registered and will likely be blocked .
even if he is allowed to run , kasparov is not expected to pose a major threat to putin 's candidate .
while kasparov is well known in europe for his chess exploits , the latest poll by the independent levada news agency shows 3 percent of russians will vote for the other russia candidate .
" the goal of the other russia is not winning elections , but to have an election , " kasparov said , speaking in english on the sidelines of the congress .
" we 're trying to force the regime to accept our right to participate in free and fair elections , to agitate the russian population and the russian public to support our ideas . "
kasparov calls for unity in opposing kremlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin won easily last time around kasparov says that putin 's broad public support comes from the kremlin 's control over the media and the electoral process .
" i will do everything possible for the ideas of other russia to win .
this will work only if we stay united , " kasparov said , adding the coalition stood for a " democratic and just russia . "
the other russia coalition is hampered by internal divisions and has been marginalized by the authorities .
kasparov founded the coalition in 2005 after a successful chess career .
kasparov faces challenge of his career bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's like a game of chess kasparov is fond on comparing current political battles to his famous duels with anatoly karpov in the 1980s .
" back then , the chess system wanted to maintain a cosy status quo , avoiding any candidate worthy of the name to fight karpov , " he has said .
" the political situation in russia today reminds me of that time . "
kasparov was born in the former soviet republic of azerbaijan to armenian-jewish parents .
he took up chess in 1963 at the age of 6 and was a junior champion by the age of 13 .
he became the world 's youngest chess champion when he beat karpov in 1985 at the age of 22 .
political maneuvering underway bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin 's endorsement seen as essential in presidential campaign there could be surprise contenders in the race , first deputy prime minister dmitry medvedev said on sunday .
medvedev , who also chairs gas monopoly gazprom , has ruled out running for parliament as a pro-kremlin party candidate , but did not answer direct questions about whether he would run for president .
medvedev , 42 , is one of a small group of kremlin insiders who has been tipped as a possible successor to putin .
putin has not ruled out returning to power in 2012 .
he has kept everyone guessing about which candidate will get his crucial endorsement .
he surprised observers by appointing viktor zubkov , a relatively unknown 66-year-old former head of an anti-money laundering unit , as prime minister on sept .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 01.10.2007 as berlin mayor looks to own political future , scrutiny grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit poses with a copy of his autobiography berlin mayor klaus wowereit 's recent memoir has ignited discussion about his future political ambitions .
the book has moved many to take a closer look at a politician known as much for his partying as his policies . to some observers , the fact that klaus wowereit published his memoirs in september at the age of 53 was a case of a heightened sense of self-importance , perhaps even arrogance , or at least jumping the gun . his book , although entitled " … and that 's ok - my life in politics , " does not present a new political philosophy or ideas on how germany can succeed in a globalized economy .
rather , these are stories from his own life , of his hardscrabble childhood , his school days , his entry into public office , his finding love and happiness .
politics is present , but plays a secondary role . but those who think the book is nothing more than a vanity project by someone who believes his own life is inspirational are likely underestimating wowereit 's political and media savvy .
indeed , many observers think the book is an announcement by the social democratic , openly gay mayor to the public and his own spd party that berlin 's city hall is not the last stop on his political journey . " wowereit wants to play a larger role in national politics , " said gero neugebauer , professor emeritus of political science at berlin 's free university .
" this book allowed him to get into the media and get people talking about him again . " but all the talk has not necessarily been positive , and while wowereit is used to criticism as mayor of germany 's capital and largest city , his hinting at a desire to reach greater political heights has turned up the intensity of the spotlight on him . bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit partying in berlin with entertainer desirée nick public outing , skyrocketing popularity his book 's title references the event that turned wowereit from a local politician into an a-list celebrity who just happened to also sit in the mayor 's office .
in 2001 , during the campaign , he outed himself publicly in a speech with the words : " i 'm gay , and that 's ok . " suddenly , berlin had a mayor who seemed perfectly in synch with the city itself - open , risk-taking and just a step outside of the mainstream .
there was n't much industry to be found in the capital and unemployment was higher than almost anywhere else in germany , but it certainly knew how to party .
manufacturing sites were rare , but one could n't throw a rock without hitting a club or bar . wowereit could be found in more than a few of those locales , or at society functions , pressing the flesh and having a good time .
his office even came up with an unofficial slogan for berlin , " poor , but sexy . "
people lapped it up ; and with an opposition in disarray , wowereit 's popularity grew . the right stuff ? but as it looks like berlin might be too small a pond for " wowi , " as he 's affectionately known , critics are looking at his record and wondering if he has what it takes to jump to the federal level – and maybe one day even run for the top job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit and his partner jörn kubicki his sexuality does n't seem to figure large .
newspaper headlines have been fond of the expression " gay chancellor " of late and germans themselves are n't put off by it .
in a recent survey , 79 percent of germans said they did n't think homosexuality was a stumbling block on the way to the chancellery . " i think the population is further along than politicians when it comes to that , " said klaus jetz , director of the gay and lesbian federation of germany , who said he was n't surprised at the poll results .
" the sexuality of a chancellor does n't influence his or her policies . " that may be true , say others , but add that wowereit 's record in berlin , particularly when it comes to attracting industry , is not particularly good .
the berlin office of the free democrats , germany 's free-market liberal party , recently sent the mayor a book entitled " klaus wowereit 's ideas for more economic growth and jobs in berlin . "
the book was blank . while the mayor shows enthusiasm for attracting media and other creative - read " sexy " - companies to the capital , critics say he is blasé about getting big players here which could employ big numbers . " in general , he has an attitude that is hostile to the economy , " said markus löning , chair of the berlin fdp . " business people who are interested in investing in berlin ca n't even get an appointment with him . " others question his intellectual heft , and even wowereit himself admits in his book he was never a big reader .
in a questionnaire the mayor filled out at the end of 2004 , he could n't name the date the second world war began , the answer to 3 + 8 x 2 , or spell " rhythm . " in a blistering critique in the süddeutsche zeitung daily , long-time foreign correspondent roger boyes wrote : " often wowi simply acts like a bored teenager . " slow and steady - he 's got time but political scientist neugebauer is less critical of the mayor 's performance in office , saying he has made the best out of the very bad situation he found when he got there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wowereit is never been one to shy away from celebrities - here with sylvester stallone wowereit was able to bring the berlin spd out of a long-term crisis , has given berlin a new international profile that has brought in streams of tourists and has gotten the city 's budget under control by enacting strict spending controls .
his office has stepped up its efforts to bring high-tech and service sector jobs to the city . " he 's working with what he 's got , and going step by step , " said neugebauer , similar to the strategy of another german politician , angela merkel . and he can wait , he added , he 's young enough .
wowereit will not likely challenge current spd head kurt beck , but will likely see how the 2009 federal elections go before making his next move .
right now spd leaders are keeping a close eye on them .
he 's seen as one who does n't follow the party line lock-step , but who can win elections .
that gives him some clout , according to neugebauer . " he just has to wait for the right opportunities , " he said .

but the latest survey among 9-14 year olds in germany sponsored by the lbs building society reveals that childhood in germany is fraught with the same fear of failure and psychosomatic illness that probably keeps the likes of donald trump awake at night .
comprehensive survey the report questioned over 6000 children in seven states on how they felt about family , school , politics and current affairs , asking them about their self-image , hopes and fears , pocket money , internet use , tv consumption and eating habits .
preying most on kids ' minds is school .
one third of those questioned said they were scared not just of bad grades , but also of being laughed at by their peers and their teachers .
over 50 percent admitted they felt stressed at school , saying they had been insulted , harassed or publicly humiliated in the week the survey was carried out , with one in five revealing the aggressor was a teacher .
academically , children felt particularly under pressure in bavaria and saxony , two states which regularly top the polls in national student assessment ratings .

1 , are zooming in on the role of the internet in the planning of terrorist attacks .
eu justice commissioner franco frattini is pushing for greater powers to monitor the web .
frattini is in favor of developing technology to block and monitor internet sites offering bomb-making recipes as well as making online recruiting of terrorists a punishable offense .
" they -lrb- terrorists -rrb- can find precise information and instructions for all kinds of terror attacks on the internet , for instance how to make bombs , " frattini said ahead of the meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini wants to develop a whole range of new tools to fight terrorism however , the aim is not to " follow every person that ' googles ' the word ' bomb ' on the internet , " frattini added , referring to the wariness the proposed measures have triggered among critics and proponents of civil liberties .
online surveillance being stepped up in response to a recent series of arrests and the unfolding of terror plots and planned strikes in sweden , germany and austria , individual countries in europe are already moving ahead to step up surveillance of the internet .
in germany , interior minister wolfgang schäuble is seeking powers allowing investigators to send software that secretly installs itself on specific computers , relaying data to police computers as users operate online .
a court in germany is also trying a man for posting al qaeda hate messages and audio and video recordings , by osama bin laden among others , in an internet chartroom for islamists .
the defendant 's computer was being monitored for a year and a half by security officials before the man was arrested .
in sweden , too , the defense minister has cited the threat of terrorism to seek broad powers to monitor e-mail traffic without court orders .
controversial recording of data at monday 's meeting , frattini is expected to bring up another controversial security proposal .
following the example of the us , the commissioner wants to collect data on all airline passengers flying into the eu and keep a register of foreigners entering or leaving the bloc that would ultimately include details such as their photograph , fingerprint and even a retina scan .
under the proposals , law enforcement officials in all member states would be allowed to share the data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini wants to gather data on all passengers flying into the eu " europe is a target of terrorism , just like the united states .
and i simply can not ignore that there is a real threat that one day terrorists will try once again to attack a country in the eu , " frattini said .
the commissioner also wants to create an eu-wide data bank in which police across the bloc can enter information on the theft of explosives .
the measure will help authorities follow the trail of terrorists faster and thus thwart attacks , according to frattini .
the eu commissioner is to present the exact details of his counterterrorism proposals in early november .
he is expected to lobby support for the plans among the eu 's 27 interior ministers at the informal talks in lisbon whose approval is crucial for the go-ahead . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the latest survey among 9-14 year olds in germany sponsored by the lbs building society reveals that childhood in germany is fraught with the same fear of failure and psychosomatic illness that probably keeps the likes of donald trump awake at night .
comprehensive survey the report questioned over 6000 children in seven states on how they felt about family , school , politics and current affairs , asking them about their self-image , hopes and fears , pocket money , internet use , tv consumption and eating habits .
preying most on kids ' minds is school .
one third of those questioned said they were scared not just of bad grades , but also of being laughed at by their peers and their teachers .
over 50 percent admitted they felt stressed at school , saying they had been insulted , harassed or publicly humiliated in the week the survey was carried out , with one in five revealing the aggressor was a teacher .
academically , children felt particularly under pressure in bavaria and saxony , two states which regularly top the polls in national student assessment ratings .

following the example of the us , the commissioner wants to collect data on all airline passengers flying into the eu and keep a register of foreigners entering or leaving the bloc that would ultimately include details such as their photograph , fingerprint and even a retina scan .
under the proposals , law enforcement officials in all member states would be allowed to share the data .

and i simply can not ignore that there is a real threat that one day terrorists will try once again to attack a country in the eu , " frattini said .
the commissioner also wants to create an eu-wide data bank in which police across the bloc can enter information on the theft of explosives .
the measure will help authorities follow the trail of terrorists faster and thus thwart attacks , according to frattini .
the eu commissioner is to present the exact details of his counterterrorism proposals in early november .

"
pithy , but not necessarily the image a dignified capital wants to project to the world .
the mayor asked the public if it had any better ideas . the capital 's famously flamboyant mayor klaus wowereit recently appointed a " berlin board , " entrusted to " position the berlin brand " internationally . its illustrious line-up includes architects hans kollhoff and peter hall , catherine mühlemann , mtv 's head of central and emerging markets , and the city 's education minister jürgen zöllner .
the mayor hopes the team , which began work in august , will help steer the capital to lasting global stardom , consolidate its reputation as a cutting edge cultural hotspot and provide it with useful professional contacts .
but wowi , as the mayor 's affectionately known , is also keen for the public to do its bit and has called on the city 's denizens to help come up with a new slogan for the city . " a corporate identity for berlin needs to come from its public , " he said .
" it ca n't be imposed from above . "
commercial clout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a city of many faces wowi himself was the man who first labeled berlin as " poor but sexy " - not , perhaps , the most persuasive branding strategy even if broadly accurate .
ideally , city slogans should be timeless , original and memorable .
a good one , like a good title , can be a valuable tool of identification .
and , as cities like las vegas -lrb- " what happens here , stays here " -rrb- can attest to , an effective slogan can also have considerable commercial value .
the competition designed to reinvent how people see berlin ends on oct .
1 , and the suggestions have been pouring in .
" the contest got a good reception , " the berlin senate 's spokesman günter kolodziej told spiegel online , adding that a second wind of enthusiasm was expected as the deadline approaches .
city of change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : city of encounters , indeed but not all the proposals have been serious .
berlin 's bi-weekly listings magazine zitty suggested the phrase " we do it all .
but we do it all wrong , " which has a certain ring of truth to it in the light of spectacular semi-disasters such as the expensive new central train station , which started falling apart as soon as the wind picked up .
another suggestion was " berlin : city of encounters " - a reference to the mayor 's party-loving reputation . but now it 's up to the public .
and according to the mayor , they 're more than equal to the task . " berlin secret weapon is its people , " wowereit stressed on the berlin city web site . " they are the real heroes of the berlin brand .
it is their personalities that make this city exciting and unique . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the latest survey among 9-14 year olds in germany sponsored by the lbs building society reveals that childhood in germany is fraught with the same fear of failure and psychosomatic illness that probably keeps the likes of donald trump awake at night .
comprehensive survey the report questioned over 6000 children in seven states on how they felt about family , school , politics and current affairs , asking them about their self-image , hopes and fears , pocket money , internet use , tv consumption and eating habits .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 01.10.2007 as berlin mayor looks to own political future , scrutiny grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit poses with a copy of his autobiography berlin mayor klaus wowereit 's recent memoir has ignited discussion about his future political ambitions .
the book has moved many to take a closer look at a politician known as much for his partying as his policies . to some observers , the fact that klaus wowereit published his memoirs in september at the age of 53 was a case of a heightened sense of self-importance , perhaps even arrogance , or at least jumping the gun . his book , although entitled " … and that 's ok - my life in politics , " does not present a new political philosophy or ideas on how germany can succeed in a globalized economy .
rather , these are stories from his own life , of his hardscrabble childhood , his school days , his entry into public office , his finding love and happiness .
politics is present , but plays a secondary role . but those who think the book is nothing more than a vanity project by someone who believes his own life is inspirational are likely underestimating wowereit 's political and media savvy .
indeed , many observers think the book is an announcement by the social democratic , openly gay mayor to the public and his own spd party that berlin 's city hall is not the last stop on his political journey . " wowereit wants to play a larger role in national politics , " said gero neugebauer , professor emeritus of political science at berlin 's free university .
" this book allowed him to get into the media and get people talking about him again . " but all the talk has not necessarily been positive , and while wowereit is used to criticism as mayor of germany 's capital and largest city , his hinting at a desire to reach greater political heights has turned up the intensity of the spotlight on him . bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit partying in berlin with entertainer desirée nick public outing , skyrocketing popularity his book 's title references the event that turned wowereit from a local politician into an a-list celebrity who just happened to also sit in the mayor 's office .
in 2001 , during the campaign , he outed himself publicly in a speech with the words : " i 'm gay , and that 's ok . " suddenly , berlin had a mayor who seemed perfectly in synch with the city itself - open , risk-taking and just a step outside of the mainstream .
there was n't much industry to be found in the capital and unemployment was higher than almost anywhere else in germany , but it certainly knew how to party .
manufacturing sites were rare , but one could n't throw a rock without hitting a club or bar . wowereit could be found in more than a few of those locales , or at society functions , pressing the flesh and having a good time .
his office even came up with an unofficial slogan for berlin , " poor , but sexy . "
people lapped it up ; and with an opposition in disarray , wowereit 's popularity grew . the right stuff ? but as it looks like berlin might be too small a pond for " wowi , " as he 's affectionately known , critics are looking at his record and wondering if he has what it takes to jump to the federal level – and maybe one day even run for the top job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit and his partner jörn kubicki his sexuality does n't seem to figure large .
newspaper headlines have been fond of the expression " gay chancellor " of late and germans themselves are n't put off by it .
in a recent survey , 79 percent of germans said they did n't think homosexuality was a stumbling block on the way to the chancellery . " i think the population is further along than politicians when it comes to that , " said klaus jetz , director of the gay and lesbian federation of germany , who said he was n't surprised at the poll results .
" the sexuality of a chancellor does n't influence his or her policies . " that may be true , say others , but add that wowereit 's record in berlin , particularly when it comes to attracting industry , is not particularly good .
the berlin office of the free democrats , germany 's free-market liberal party , recently sent the mayor a book entitled " klaus wowereit 's ideas for more economic growth and jobs in berlin . "
the book was blank . while the mayor shows enthusiasm for attracting media and other creative - read " sexy " - companies to the capital , critics say he is blasé about getting big players here which could employ big numbers . " in general , he has an attitude that is hostile to the economy , " said markus löning , chair of the berlin fdp . " business people who are interested in investing in berlin ca n't even get an appointment with him . " others question his intellectual heft , and even wowereit himself admits in his book he was never a big reader .
in a questionnaire the mayor filled out at the end of 2004 , he could n't name the date the second world war began , the answer to 3 + 8 x 2 , or spell " rhythm . " in a blistering critique in the süddeutsche zeitung daily , long-time foreign correspondent roger boyes wrote : " often wowi simply acts like a bored teenager . " slow and steady - he 's got time but political scientist neugebauer is less critical of the mayor 's performance in office , saying he has made the best out of the very bad situation he found when he got there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wowereit is never been one to shy away from celebrities - here with sylvester stallone wowereit was able to bring the berlin spd out of a long-term crisis , has given berlin a new international profile that has brought in streams of tourists and has gotten the city 's budget under control by enacting strict spending controls .
his office has stepped up its efforts to bring high-tech and service sector jobs to the city . " he 's working with what he 's got , and going step by step , " said neugebauer , similar to the strategy of another german politician , angela merkel . and he can wait , he added , he 's young enough .
wowereit will not likely challenge current spd head kurt beck , but will likely see how the 2009 federal elections go before making his next move .
right now spd leaders are keeping a close eye on them .
he 's seen as one who does n't follow the party line lock-step , but who can win elections .
that gives him some clout , according to neugebauer . " he just has to wait for the right opportunities , " he said .

but the latest survey among 9-14 year olds in germany sponsored by the lbs building society reveals that childhood in germany is fraught with the same fear of failure and psychosomatic illness that probably keeps the likes of donald trump awake at night .
comprehensive survey the report questioned over 6000 children in seven states on how they felt about family , school , politics and current affairs , asking them about their self-image , hopes and fears , pocket money , internet use , tv consumption and eating habits .
preying most on kids ' minds is school .
one third of those questioned said they were scared not just of bad grades , but also of being laughed at by their peers and their teachers .
over 50 percent admitted they felt stressed at school , saying they had been insulted , harassed or publicly humiliated in the week the survey was carried out , with one in five revealing the aggressor was a teacher .
academically , children felt particularly under pressure in bavaria and saxony , two states which regularly top the polls in national student assessment ratings .
tired and emotional bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much tv does n't make for happy kids as a result , many children internalize their worries .
one third of those polled said they suffered from frequent headaches and stomach aches .
" these are classic symptoms of stress and pressure , " said german family minister ursula von der leyen , who presented the report in berlin wednesday .
adding to physical ill-health is bad diet .
one in three children admitted they did n't always eat breakfast , with the same number admitting to eating candy on a regular basis .
one in five confessed they never or rarely eat vegetables , while one third would n't touch wholemeal bread .
one on five children feels overweight , one in ten too thin .
one in five children also said they seldom ate with their parents , while further results showed that these kids were more likely to feel ill often .
the children of unemployed parents are more likely to eat fast food , and these kids are correspondingly more inclined to suffer from illness and stress .
and although two thirds of 9-14s belong to sports ' clubs , the majority exercises just once a week .
" when we 've reached a point where tv and fast food have replaced shared mealtimes and exercise , then we need to act , " said von der leyen .
" exercise once a week is not enough " she added .
respecting boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family meals help kids stay healthy but it might prove difficult getting kids to sit down and eat dinner with their parents when most of those questioned said they want more privacy .
von der leyen said mothers should avoid snooping in their kids ' diaries , and fathers should make a point of knocking on the bedroom door before entering .
she also pointed out that children said they wanted more freedom of opinion and more leisure time , with 20 percent of those asked saying they hankered for more relaxation and play .
" we adults frequently make the mistake of underestimating our children , " she said .
" they can do more than we think , they 're more aware than we realize and they 're interested in more issues than we can imagine . "
" children need to be allowed to slow down and be given space to develop , " said von der leyen . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 01.10.2007 as berlin mayor looks to own political future , scrutiny grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit poses with a copy of his autobiography berlin mayor klaus wowereit 's recent memoir has ignited discussion about his future political ambitions .
the book has moved many to take a closer look at a politician known as much for his partying as his policies . to some observers , the fact that klaus wowereit published his memoirs in september at the age of 53 was a case of a heightened sense of self-importance , perhaps even arrogance , or at least jumping the gun . his book , although entitled " … and that 's ok - my life in politics , " does not present a new political philosophy or ideas on how germany can succeed in a globalized economy .
rather , these are stories from his own life , of his hardscrabble childhood , his school days , his entry into public office , his finding love and happiness .
politics is present , but plays a secondary role . but those who think the book is nothing more than a vanity project by someone who believes his own life is inspirational are likely underestimating wowereit 's political and media savvy .
indeed , many observers think the book is an announcement by the social democratic , openly gay mayor to the public and his own spd party that berlin 's city hall is not the last stop on his political journey . " wowereit wants to play a larger role in national politics , " said gero neugebauer , professor emeritus of political science at berlin 's free university .
" this book allowed him to get into the media and get people talking about him again . " but all the talk has not necessarily been positive , and while wowereit is used to criticism as mayor of germany 's capital and largest city , his hinting at a desire to reach greater political heights has turned up the intensity of the spotlight on him . bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit partying in berlin with entertainer desirée nick public outing , skyrocketing popularity his book 's title references the event that turned wowereit from a local politician into an a-list celebrity who just happened to also sit in the mayor 's office .
in 2001 , during the campaign , he outed himself publicly in a speech with the words : " i 'm gay , and that 's ok . " suddenly , berlin had a mayor who seemed perfectly in synch with the city itself - open , risk-taking and just a step outside of the mainstream .
there was n't much industry to be found in the capital and unemployment was higher than almost anywhere else in germany , but it certainly knew how to party .
manufacturing sites were rare , but one could n't throw a rock without hitting a club or bar . wowereit could be found in more than a few of those locales , or at society functions , pressing the flesh and having a good time .
his office even came up with an unofficial slogan for berlin , " poor , but sexy . "
people lapped it up ; and with an opposition in disarray , wowereit 's popularity grew . the right stuff ? but as it looks like berlin might be too small a pond for " wowi , " as he 's affectionately known , critics are looking at his record and wondering if he has what it takes to jump to the federal level – and maybe one day even run for the top job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit and his partner jörn kubicki his sexuality does n't seem to figure large .
newspaper headlines have been fond of the expression " gay chancellor " of late and germans themselves are n't put off by it .
in a recent survey , 79 percent of germans said they did n't think homosexuality was a stumbling block on the way to the chancellery . " i think the population is further along than politicians when it comes to that , " said klaus jetz , director of the gay and lesbian federation of germany , who said he was n't surprised at the poll results .
" the sexuality of a chancellor does n't influence his or her policies . " that may be true , say others , but add that wowereit 's record in berlin , particularly when it comes to attracting industry , is not particularly good .
the berlin office of the free democrats , germany 's free-market liberal party , recently sent the mayor a book entitled " klaus wowereit 's ideas for more economic growth and jobs in berlin . "
the book was blank . while the mayor shows enthusiasm for attracting media and other creative - read " sexy " - companies to the capital , critics say he is blasé about getting big players here which could employ big numbers . " in general , he has an attitude that is hostile to the economy , " said markus löning , chair of the berlin fdp . " business people who are interested in investing in berlin ca n't even get an appointment with him . " others question his intellectual heft , and even wowereit himself admits in his book he was never a big reader .
in a questionnaire the mayor filled out at the end of 2004 , he could n't name the date the second world war began , the answer to 3 + 8 x 2 , or spell " rhythm . " in a blistering critique in the süddeutsche zeitung daily , long-time foreign correspondent roger boyes wrote : " often wowi simply acts like a bored teenager . " slow and steady - he 's got time but political scientist neugebauer is less critical of the mayor 's performance in office , saying he has made the best out of the very bad situation he found when he got there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wowereit is never been one to shy away from celebrities - here with sylvester stallone wowereit was able to bring the berlin spd out of a long-term crisis , has given berlin a new international profile that has brought in streams of tourists and has gotten the city 's budget under control by enacting strict spending controls .
his office has stepped up its efforts to bring high-tech and service sector jobs to the city . " he 's working with what he 's got , and going step by step , " said neugebauer , similar to the strategy of another german politician , angela merkel . and he can wait , he added , he 's young enough .
wowereit will not likely challenge current spd head kurt beck , but will likely see how the 2009 federal elections go before making his next move .
right now spd leaders are keeping a close eye on them .
he 's seen as one who does n't follow the party line lock-step , but who can win elections .
that gives him some clout , according to neugebauer . " he just has to wait for the right opportunities , " he said .

the book has moved many to take a closer look at a politician known as much for his partying as his policies . to some observers , the fact that klaus wowereit published his memoirs in september at the age of 53 was a case of a heightened sense of self-importance , perhaps even arrogance , or at least jumping the gun . his book , although entitled " … and that 's ok - my life in politics , " does not present a new political philosophy or ideas on how germany can succeed in a globalized economy .
rather , these are stories from his own life , of his hardscrabble childhood , his school days , his entry into public office , his finding love and happiness .
politics is present , but plays a secondary role . but those who think the book is nothing more than a vanity project by someone who believes his own life is inspirational are likely underestimating wowereit 's political and media savvy .
indeed , many observers think the book is an announcement by the social democratic , openly gay mayor to the public and his own spd party that berlin 's city hall is not the last stop on his political journey . " wowereit wants to play a larger role in national politics , " said gero neugebauer , professor emeritus of political science at berlin 's free university .
" this book allowed him to get into the media and get people talking about him again . " but all the talk has not necessarily been positive , and while wowereit is used to criticism as mayor of germany 's capital and largest city , his hinting at a desire to reach greater political heights has turned up the intensity of the spotlight on him . bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit partying in berlin with entertainer desirée nick public outing , skyrocketing popularity his book 's title references the event that turned wowereit from a local politician into an a-list celebrity who just happened to also sit in the mayor 's office .
in 2001 , during the campaign , he outed himself publicly in a speech with the words : " i 'm gay , and that 's ok . " suddenly , berlin had a mayor who seemed perfectly in synch with the city itself - open , risk-taking and just a step outside of the mainstream .
there was n't much industry to be found in the capital and unemployment was higher than almost anywhere else in germany , but it certainly knew how to party .
manufacturing sites were rare , but one could n't throw a rock without hitting a club or bar . wowereit could be found in more than a few of those locales , or at society functions , pressing the flesh and having a good time .
his office even came up with an unofficial slogan for berlin , " poor , but sexy . "
people lapped it up ; and with an opposition in disarray , wowereit 's popularity grew . the right stuff ? but as it looks like berlin might be too small a pond for " wowi , " as he 's affectionately known , critics are looking at his record and wondering if he has what it takes to jump to the federal level – and maybe one day even run for the top job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit and his partner jörn kubicki his sexuality does n't seem to figure large .
newspaper headlines have been fond of the expression " gay chancellor " of late and germans themselves are n't put off by it .
in a recent survey , 79 percent of germans said they did n't think homosexuality was a stumbling block on the way to the chancellery . " i think the population is further along than politicians when it comes to that , " said klaus jetz , director of the gay and lesbian federation of germany , who said he was n't surprised at the poll results .
" the sexuality of a chancellor does n't influence his or her policies . " that may be true , say others , but add that wowereit 's record in berlin , particularly when it comes to attracting industry , is not particularly good .
the berlin office of the free democrats , germany 's free-market liberal party , recently sent the mayor a book entitled " klaus wowereit 's ideas for more economic growth and jobs in berlin . "
the book was blank . while the mayor shows enthusiasm for attracting media and other creative - read " sexy " - companies to the capital , critics say he is blasé about getting big players here which could employ big numbers . " in general , he has an attitude that is hostile to the economy , " said markus löning , chair of the berlin fdp . " business people who are interested in investing in berlin ca n't even get an appointment with him . " others question his intellectual heft , and even wowereit himself admits in his book he was never a big reader .
in a questionnaire the mayor filled out at the end of 2004 , he could n't name the date the second world war began , the answer to 3 + 8 x 2 , or spell " rhythm . " in a blistering critique in the süddeutsche zeitung daily , long-time foreign correspondent roger boyes wrote : " often wowi simply acts like a bored teenager .

"
pithy , but not necessarily the image a dignified capital wants to project to the world .
the mayor asked the public if it had any better ideas . the capital 's famously flamboyant mayor klaus wowereit recently appointed a " berlin board , " entrusted to " position the berlin brand " internationally . its illustrious line-up includes architects hans kollhoff and peter hall , catherine mühlemann , mtv 's head of central and emerging markets , and the city 's education minister jürgen zöllner .
the mayor hopes the team , which began work in august , will help steer the capital to lasting global stardom , consolidate its reputation as a cutting edge cultural hotspot and provide it with useful professional contacts .
but wowi , as the mayor 's affectionately known , is also keen for the public to do its bit and has called on the city 's denizens to help come up with a new slogan for the city . " a corporate identity for berlin needs to come from its public , " he said .
" it ca n't be imposed from above . "
commercial clout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a city of many faces wowi himself was the man who first labeled berlin as " poor but sexy " - not , perhaps , the most persuasive branding strategy even if broadly accurate .
ideally , city slogans should be timeless , original and memorable .
a good one , like a good title , can be a valuable tool of identification .
and , as cities like las vegas -lrb- " what happens here , stays here " -rrb- can attest to , an effective slogan can also have considerable commercial value .
the competition designed to reinvent how people see berlin ends on oct .
1 , and the suggestions have been pouring in .
" the contest got a good reception , " the berlin senate 's spokesman günter kolodziej told spiegel online , adding that a second wind of enthusiasm was expected as the deadline approaches .
city of change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : city of encounters , indeed but not all the proposals have been serious .
berlin 's bi-weekly listings magazine zitty suggested the phrase " we do it all .
but we do it all wrong , " which has a certain ring of truth to it in the light of spectacular semi-disasters such as the expensive new central train station , which started falling apart as soon as the wind picked up .
another suggestion was " berlin : city of encounters " - a reference to the mayor 's party-loving reputation . but now it 's up to the public .
and according to the mayor , they 're more than equal to the task . " berlin secret weapon is its people , " wowereit stressed on the berlin city web site . " they are the real heroes of the berlin brand .
it is their personalities that make this city exciting and unique . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de lifestyle -pipe- 01.10.2007 rebranding the german capital großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some bright spark should be able to come up with a new slogan for berlin in recent years , berlin 's best-known slogan has been " poor but sexy . "
pithy , but not necessarily the image a dignified capital wants to project to the world .
the mayor asked the public if it had any better ideas . the capital 's famously flamboyant mayor klaus wowereit recently appointed a " berlin board , " entrusted to " position the berlin brand " internationally . its illustrious line-up includes architects hans kollhoff and peter hall , catherine mühlemann , mtv 's head of central and emerging markets , and the city 's education minister jürgen zöllner .
the mayor hopes the team , which began work in august , will help steer the capital to lasting global stardom , consolidate its reputation as a cutting edge cultural hotspot and provide it with useful professional contacts .
but wowi , as the mayor 's affectionately known , is also keen for the public to do its bit and has called on the city 's denizens to help come up with a new slogan for the city . " a corporate identity for berlin needs to come from its public , " he said .
" it ca n't be imposed from above . "
commercial clout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a city of many faces wowi himself was the man who first labeled berlin as " poor but sexy " - not , perhaps , the most persuasive branding strategy even if broadly accurate .
ideally , city slogans should be timeless , original and memorable .
a good one , like a good title , can be a valuable tool of identification .
and , as cities like las vegas -lrb- " what happens here , stays here " -rrb- can attest to , an effective slogan can also have considerable commercial value .
the competition designed to reinvent how people see berlin ends on oct .
1 , and the suggestions have been pouring in .
" the contest got a good reception , " the berlin senate 's spokesman günter kolodziej told spiegel online , adding that a second wind of enthusiasm was expected as the deadline approaches .
city of change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : city of encounters , indeed but not all the proposals have been serious .
berlin 's bi-weekly listings magazine zitty suggested the phrase " we do it all .
but we do it all wrong , " which has a certain ring of truth to it in the light of spectacular semi-disasters such as the expensive new central train station , which started falling apart as soon as the wind picked up .
another suggestion was " berlin : city of encounters " - a reference to the mayor 's party-loving reputation . but now it 's up to the public .
and according to the mayor , they 're more than equal to the task . " berlin secret weapon is its people , " wowereit stressed on the berlin city web site . " they are the real heroes of the berlin brand .
it is their personalities that make this city exciting and unique . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the latest survey among 9-14 year olds in germany sponsored by the lbs building society reveals that childhood in germany is fraught with the same fear of failure and psychosomatic illness that probably keeps the likes of donald trump awake at night .
comprehensive survey the report questioned over 6000 children in seven states on how they felt about family , school , politics and current affairs , asking them about their self-image , hopes and fears , pocket money , internet use , tv consumption and eating habits .
preying most on kids ' minds is school .
one third of those questioned said they were scared not just of bad grades , but also of being laughed at by their peers and their teachers .
over 50 percent admitted they felt stressed at school , saying they had been insulted , harassed or publicly humiliated in the week the survey was carried out , with one in five revealing the aggressor was a teacher .
academically , children felt particularly under pressure in bavaria and saxony , two states which regularly top the polls in national student assessment ratings .
tired and emotional bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much tv does n't make for happy kids as a result , many children internalize their worries .
one third of those polled said they suffered from frequent headaches and stomach aches .
" these are classic symptoms of stress and pressure , " said german family minister ursula von der leyen , who presented the report in berlin wednesday .
adding to physical ill-health is bad diet .
one in three children admitted they did n't always eat breakfast , with the same number admitting to eating candy on a regular basis .
one in five confessed they never or rarely eat vegetables , while one third would n't touch wholemeal bread .
one on five children feels overweight , one in ten too thin .
one in five children also said they seldom ate with their parents , while further results showed that these kids were more likely to feel ill often .
the children of unemployed parents are more likely to eat fast food , and these kids are correspondingly more inclined to suffer from illness and stress .
and although two thirds of 9-14s belong to sports ' clubs , the majority exercises just once a week .
" when we 've reached a point where tv and fast food have replaced shared mealtimes and exercise , then we need to act , " said von der leyen .
" exercise once a week is not enough " she added .
respecting boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family meals help kids stay healthy but it might prove difficult getting kids to sit down and eat dinner with their parents when most of those questioned said they want more privacy .
von der leyen said mothers should avoid snooping in their kids ' diaries , and fathers should make a point of knocking on the bedroom door before entering .
she also pointed out that children said they wanted more freedom of opinion and more leisure time , with 20 percent of those asked saying they hankered for more relaxation and play .
" we adults frequently make the mistake of underestimating our children , " she said .
" they can do more than we think , they 're more aware than we realize and they 're interested in more issues than we can imagine . "

but the latest survey among 9-14 year olds in germany sponsored by the lbs building society reveals that childhood in germany is fraught with the same fear of failure and psychosomatic illness that probably keeps the likes of donald trump awake at night .
comprehensive survey the report questioned over 6000 children in seven states on how they felt about family , school , politics and current affairs , asking them about their self-image , hopes and fears , pocket money , internet use , tv consumption and eating habits .
preying most on kids ' minds is school .
one third of those questioned said they were scared not just of bad grades , but also of being laughed at by their peers and their teachers .
over 50 percent admitted they felt stressed at school , saying they had been insulted , harassed or publicly humiliated in the week the survey was carried out , with one in five revealing the aggressor was a teacher .
academically , children felt particularly under pressure in bavaria and saxony , two states which regularly top the polls in national student assessment ratings .
tired and emotional bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much tv does n't make for happy kids as a result , many children internalize their worries .
one third of those polled said they suffered from frequent headaches and stomach aches .
" these are classic symptoms of stress and pressure , " said german family minister ursula von der leyen , who presented the report in berlin wednesday .
adding to physical ill-health is bad diet .
one in three children admitted they did n't always eat breakfast , with the same number admitting to eating candy on a regular basis .
one in five confessed they never or rarely eat vegetables , while one third would n't touch wholemeal bread .
one on five children feels overweight , one in ten too thin .
one in five children also said they seldom ate with their parents , while further results showed that these kids were more likely to feel ill often .
the children of unemployed parents are more likely to eat fast food , and these kids are correspondingly more inclined to suffer from illness and stress .
and although two thirds of 9-14s belong to sports ' clubs , the majority exercises just once a week .
" when we 've reached a point where tv and fast food have replaced shared mealtimes and exercise , then we need to act , " said von der leyen .
" exercise once a week is not enough " she added .
respecting boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family meals help kids stay healthy but it might prove difficult getting kids to sit down and eat dinner with their parents when most of those questioned said they want more privacy .
von der leyen said mothers should avoid snooping in their kids ' diaries , and fathers should make a point of knocking on the bedroom door before entering .
she also pointed out that children said they wanted more freedom of opinion and more leisure time , with 20 percent of those asked saying they hankered for more relaxation and play .
" we adults frequently make the mistake of underestimating our children , " she said .
" they can do more than we think , they 're more aware than we realize and they 're interested in more issues than we can imagine . "
" children need to be allowed to slow down and be given space to develop , " said von der leyen . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

30 , to forge a joint declaration against nuclear energy .
participating politicians called for more investments in energy-efficiency measures and renewable energies rather than nuclear power . " we are no anti-nuclear coalition , but we want to show alternatives , " said austrian environment minister josef pröll .
the declaration , focusing on the safety and security risks surrounding nuclear energy , said this form of energy was not the best way to fight climate change . matthias machnig , german deputy minister for environment , criticized the alleged positive role of nuclear energy in reducing global greenhouse gases as a " myth , " adding that the world 's combined power plants would only contribute with 8 percent to carbon dioxide reduction . the discussion on nuclear energy only slowed down investment into energy efficiency and alternative energy forms , he said . nuclear renaissance ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the chernobyl disaster led some countries to rethink their nuclear power strategy support for nuclear energy dropped after the 1986 chernobyl disaster but the energy source has come back into fashion as governments and officials look at strategies toward lowering greenhouse gas emissions .
recent increases in gas and oil prices as well as questions about the reliability of russian energy supplies have also raised european energy concerns . european union energy commissioner andris piebalgs said in an interview published in spanish daily el pais on monday that the eu should aim to generate 30 percent of its electricity from nuclear sources in order to ensure member states ' energy security . industry officials are promoting third-generation pressurized water reactors which provide greater energy , improved security and reduced waste compared to earlier versions of nuclear reactors .
these new reactors are still rejected by environmentalists . long-term ecological effects bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nuclear power opponents question what will become of radioactive waste but italy 's environment minister alfonso pecoraro scanio warned of the long-term ecological effects - his country is still dealing with nuclear waste , 20 years after quitting nuclear energy . latvia was the only country in the group that is actively moving ahead with expanding its nuclear energy capabilities , while all other seven members either have no nuclear energy or are planning a phase-out , like germany . the cooperation was no contradiction , latvia 's deputy environment secretary martins jirgens said , as he hoped the planned latvian involvement in the construction of the lithuanian nuclear reactor ignalina would not go ahead . an issue for national governments european commission chief jose manuel barroso urged eu nations on monday to hold a " total and frank debate " about the use of nuclear energy . " member states can not avoid the question of nuclear energy , " he said monday during an energy conference in madrid .
" it is not the eu 's role to decide if they should or should not use nuclear power . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's watertight defence did n't concede a single goal in the tournament , the first time ever that a soccer side has managed the feat .
31,000 fans in shanghai 's hongkou football stadium watched the fast-paced fifa women 's world cup final .
brazilian star striker marta , the top scorer in the tournament , failed to get in a penalty kick past goalkeeper nadine angerer , a goal which would have tied the game in the second half .
bildunterschrift : brazil 's marta grimaces after she failed to score a penalty kick " after the penalty save , i felt it was meant to be , " germany coach silvia neid said .
" we worked hard for each other , it was a great team performance .
it was important to work against marta , and we did a good job in pushing her to the sidelines . "
missed chances the nimble-footed brazilians were the better side in the first half , playing a fast aggressive game and piling up the pressure on the german defense .
marta , who won the best player of the tournament award , had the first chance of the game in the fourth minute with a long range drive stopped easily by angerer . seconds later , the physically stronger germans went on the attack when kerstin garefrekes was set free on the right only to slice her shot into the side netting .
in the eight minute , germany 's powerful defense seemed to falter for an instant when goalkeeper angerer failed to gather a free kick by brazil 's daniela .
the ball bounced out to formiga but she was unable to put the ball in the net .
daniela had another chance in the 23rd minute but was unlucky when she shot a left foot volley onto the post .
heroic saves by german goalie the germans finally picked up pace in the second half , determinedly pushing forward .
but it was only in the 52nd minute that they managed the breakthrough when captain birgit prinz was fed a pass by sandra smisek .
the veteran forward coolly slotted in the crossed ball on the turn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's defender aline , german forward sandra smisek and german midfielder melanie behringer fight for the ball but it was angerer who was the hero of the day when she stopped the spot kick by martha with her knees and then again when she held a flying strike by substitute rosana .
despite dominating ball possession , brazil 's spirited attack failed to break through the solid german defense and they failed to find an equalizer .
a stunning header by simone laudehr in the dying minutes of the game clinched the game for the ruthlessly efficient german side .
" germany deserved to win " " this was a very tough match , we missed a lot of chances especially when we were 1-0 down and marta missed a critical penalty , " said brazil coach jorge barcellos .
" but germany took their chances and scored .
i 'm very sad about this result but my players tried their best . "
the 21-year-old marta said she was crushed after the defeat but that the team had to look ahead . " it 's difficult to express my feelings .
the germans deserved to win , " she said .
" but we have to keep our chin up and prepare for the olympics in beijing .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de terrorism -pipe- 01.10.2007 eu takes battle against terrorism online großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu ministers are zooming in on internet sites eu interior ministers are debating tools in the fight against terrorism with special emphasis on shoring up online security borders by monitoring and blocking web sites to foil the planning of attacks on the internet . eu interior ministers meeting for informal counter-terrorism talks in lisbon on monday , oct .
1 , are zooming in on the role of the internet in the planning of terrorist attacks .
eu justice commissioner franco frattini is pushing for greater powers to monitor the web .
frattini is in favor of developing technology to block and monitor internet sites offering bomb-making recipes as well as making online recruiting of terrorists a punishable offense .
" they -lrb- terrorists -rrb- can find precise information and instructions for all kinds of terror attacks on the internet , for instance how to make bombs , " frattini said ahead of the meeting .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini wants to develop a whole range of new tools to fight terrorism however , the aim is not to " follow every person that ' googles ' the word ' bomb ' on the internet , " frattini added , referring to the wariness the proposed measures have triggered among critics and proponents of civil liberties .
online surveillance being stepped up in response to a recent series of arrests and the unfolding of terror plots and planned strikes in sweden , germany and austria , individual countries in europe are already moving ahead to step up surveillance of the internet .
in germany , interior minister wolfgang schäuble is seeking powers allowing investigators to send software that secretly installs itself on specific computers , relaying data to police computers as users operate online .
a court in germany is also trying a man for posting al qaeda hate messages and audio and video recordings , by osama bin laden among others , in an internet chartroom for islamists .
the defendant 's computer was being monitored for a year and a half by security officials before the man was arrested .
in sweden , too , the defense minister has cited the threat of terrorism to seek broad powers to monitor e-mail traffic without court orders .
controversial recording of data at monday 's meeting , frattini is expected to bring up another controversial security proposal .
following the example of the us , the commissioner wants to collect data on all airline passengers flying into the eu and keep a register of foreigners entering or leaving the bloc that would ultimately include details such as their photograph , fingerprint and even a retina scan .
under the proposals , law enforcement officials in all member states would be allowed to share the data .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini wants to gather data on all passengers flying into the eu " europe is a target of terrorism , just like the united states .
and i simply can not ignore that there is a real threat that one day terrorists will try once again to attack a country in the eu , " frattini said .
the commissioner also wants to create an eu-wide data bank in which police across the bloc can enter information on the theft of explosives .
the measure will help authorities follow the trail of terrorists faster and thus thwart attacks , according to frattini .
the eu commissioner is to present the exact details of his counterterrorism proposals in early november .
he is expected to lobby support for the plans among the eu 's 27 interior ministers at the informal talks in lisbon whose approval is crucial for the go-ahead . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and this evaluation does n't have anything to do with the fact that the german team succeeded in winning its second title in a row - something the men 's team has still never done . the 16 national teams have spectacularly shown that women 's soccer has absolutely nothing to do with the seemingly ineradicable views of armchair players .
the world cup was , without a doubt , a tournament played at a high technical and tactical level .
women 's soccer today is fairer than men 's , offensive and well-played at a pace that has clearly sped up .
of course , the men are still faster , but that 's the case in track and field , too .
are those races any more boring because of it ? the journey women 's soccer has taken from its beginnings when it was often chuckled at - or even openly ridiculed - can be shown in many ways .
while the women on the german team who won the 1989 european championships were rewarded with a coffee set , each member of the 2007 team will receive 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 71,165 -rrb- for winning the title .
and the nearly 40,000 spectators per game in china speak for themselves .
while the 1999 cup was broadcast in 67 countries , this time around it was 220 - and german television ratings were very high . the world cup in china has doubtlessly given women 's soccer a new worldwide impulse for further development .
the announcement from brazil to introduce a real professional league as soon as possible is only a small , first step .
if the sport still does n't make a giant leap in terms of public perception then it 's because of limited funding and the lack of a league structure . in comparison with men , there are also simply fewer women playing soccer , which lowers the number of truly gifted players .
the result is that the level of club soccer varies from club to club and is clearly lower than the soccer played by national teams .
that 's a reason why organizers should carefully consider whether the plan to increase the number of teams at the next world cup from 16 to 24 is the right decision . the world cup was also another test for the beijing summer olympics in 2008 , and it was a test spectators passed with flying colors while small and usually insignificant mistakes tarnished the organizers ' results . it leaves a bitter taste in many mouths when teams complain of sports espionage , journalists and players are constantly monitored and even have the feeling of being watched in their hotel rooms .
in this regard , the chinese can only be urgently advised to work out solutions to keep these scandals from resurfacing next year . wolfgang van kann is the head of dw-radio 's sports send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the latest survey among 9-14 year olds in germany sponsored by the lbs building society reveals that childhood in germany is fraught with the same fear of failure and psychosomatic illness that probably keeps the likes of donald trump awake at night .
comprehensive survey the report questioned over 6000 children in seven states on how they felt about family , school , politics and current affairs , asking them about their self-image , hopes and fears , pocket money , internet use , tv consumption and eating habits .
preying most on kids ' minds is school .
one third of those questioned said they were scared not just of bad grades , but also of being laughed at by their peers and their teachers .
over 50 percent admitted they felt stressed at school , saying they had been insulted , harassed or publicly humiliated in the week the survey was carried out , with one in five revealing the aggressor was a teacher .
academically , children felt particularly under pressure in bavaria and saxony , two states which regularly top the polls in national student assessment ratings .
tired and emotional bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much tv does n't make for happy kids as a result , many children internalize their worries .
one third of those polled said they suffered from frequent headaches and stomach aches .
" these are classic symptoms of stress and pressure , " said german family minister ursula von der leyen , who presented the report in berlin wednesday .
adding to physical ill-health is bad diet .
one in three children admitted they did n't always eat breakfast , with the same number admitting to eating candy on a regular basis .
one in five confessed they never or rarely eat vegetables , while one third would n't touch wholemeal bread .
one on five children feels overweight , one in ten too thin .
one in five children also said they seldom ate with their parents , while further results showed that these kids were more likely to feel ill often .
the children of unemployed parents are more likely to eat fast food , and these kids are correspondingly more inclined to suffer from illness and stress .
and although two thirds of 9-14s belong to sports ' clubs , the majority exercises just once a week .
" when we 've reached a point where tv and fast food have replaced shared mealtimes and exercise , then we need to act , " said von der leyen .
" exercise once a week is not enough " she added .
respecting boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family meals help kids stay healthy but it might prove difficult getting kids to sit down and eat dinner with their parents when most of those questioned said they want more privacy .
von der leyen said mothers should avoid snooping in their kids ' diaries , and fathers should make a point of knocking on the bedroom door before entering .
she also pointed out that children said they wanted more freedom of opinion and more leisure time , with 20 percent of those asked saying they hankered for more relaxation and play .
" we adults frequently make the mistake of underestimating our children , " she said .
" they can do more than we think , they 're more aware than we realize and they 're interested in more issues than we can imagine . "
" children need to be allowed to slow down and be given space to develop , " said von der leyen . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the latest survey among 9-14 year olds in germany sponsored by the lbs building society reveals that childhood in germany is fraught with the same fear of failure and psychosomatic illness that probably keeps the likes of donald trump awake at night .
comprehensive survey the report questioned over 6000 children in seven states on how they felt about family , school , politics and current affairs , asking them about their self-image , hopes and fears , pocket money , internet use , tv consumption and eating habits .
preying most on kids ' minds is school .
one third of those questioned said they were scared not just of bad grades , but also of being laughed at by their peers and their teachers .
over 50 percent admitted they felt stressed at school , saying they had been insulted , harassed or publicly humiliated in the week the survey was carried out , with one in five revealing the aggressor was a teacher .
academically , children felt particularly under pressure in bavaria and saxony , two states which regularly top the polls in national student assessment ratings .
tired and emotional bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : too much tv does n't make for happy kids as a result , many children internalize their worries .
one third of those polled said they suffered from frequent headaches and stomach aches .
" these are classic symptoms of stress and pressure , " said german family minister ursula von der leyen , who presented the report in berlin wednesday .
adding to physical ill-health is bad diet .
one in three children admitted they did n't always eat breakfast , with the same number admitting to eating candy on a regular basis .
one in five confessed they never or rarely eat vegetables , while one third would n't touch wholemeal bread .
one on five children feels overweight , one in ten too thin .
one in five children also said they seldom ate with their parents , while further results showed that these kids were more likely to feel ill often .
the children of unemployed parents are more likely to eat fast food , and these kids are correspondingly more inclined to suffer from illness and stress .
and although two thirds of 9-14s belong to sports ' clubs , the majority exercises just once a week .
" when we 've reached a point where tv and fast food have replaced shared mealtimes and exercise , then we need to act , " said von der leyen .
" exercise once a week is not enough " she added .
respecting boundaries bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : family meals help kids stay healthy but it might prove difficult getting kids to sit down and eat dinner with their parents when most of those questioned said they want more privacy .
von der leyen said mothers should avoid snooping in their kids ' diaries , and fathers should make a point of knocking on the bedroom door before entering .
she also pointed out that children said they wanted more freedom of opinion and more leisure time , with 20 percent of those asked saying they hankered for more relaxation and play .
" we adults frequently make the mistake of underestimating our children , " she said .
" they can do more than we think , they 're more aware than we realize and they 're interested in more issues than we can imagine . "
" children need to be allowed to slow down and be given space to develop , " said von der leyen . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's watertight defence did n't concede a single goal in the tournament , the first time ever that a soccer side has managed the feat .
31,000 fans in shanghai 's hongkou football stadium watched the fast-paced fifa women 's world cup final .
brazilian star striker marta , the top scorer in the tournament , failed to get in a penalty kick past goalkeeper nadine angerer , a goal which would have tied the game in the second half .
bildunterschrift : brazil 's marta grimaces after she failed to score a penalty kick " after the penalty save , i felt it was meant to be , " germany coach silvia neid said .
" we worked hard for each other , it was a great team performance .
it was important to work against marta , and we did a good job in pushing her to the sidelines . "
missed chances the nimble-footed brazilians were the better side in the first half , playing a fast aggressive game and piling up the pressure on the german defense .
marta , who won the best player of the tournament award , had the first chance of the game in the fourth minute with a long range drive stopped easily by angerer . seconds later , the physically stronger germans went on the attack when kerstin garefrekes was set free on the right only to slice her shot into the side netting .
in the eight minute , germany 's powerful defense seemed to falter for an instant when goalkeeper angerer failed to gather a free kick by brazil 's daniela .
the ball bounced out to formiga but she was unable to put the ball in the net .
daniela had another chance in the 23rd minute but was unlucky when she shot a left foot volley onto the post .
heroic saves by german goalie the germans finally picked up pace in the second half , determinedly pushing forward .
but it was only in the 52nd minute that they managed the breakthrough when captain birgit prinz was fed a pass by sandra smisek .
the veteran forward coolly slotted in the crossed ball on the turn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's defender aline , german forward sandra smisek and german midfielder melanie behringer fight for the ball but it was angerer who was the hero of the day when she stopped the spot kick by martha with her knees and then again when she held a flying strike by substitute rosana .
despite dominating ball possession , brazil 's spirited attack failed to break through the solid german defense and they failed to find an equalizer .
a stunning header by simone laudehr in the dying minutes of the game clinched the game for the ruthlessly efficient german side .
" germany deserved to win " " this was a very tough match , we missed a lot of chances especially when we were 1-0 down and marta missed a critical penalty , " said brazil coach jorge barcellos .
" but germany took their chances and scored .
i 'm very sad about this result but my players tried their best . "
the 21-year-old marta said she was crushed after the defeat but that the team had to look ahead . " it 's difficult to express my feelings .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 01.10.2007 as berlin mayor looks to own political future , scrutiny grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit poses with a copy of his autobiography berlin mayor klaus wowereit 's recent memoir has ignited discussion about his future political ambitions .
the book has moved many to take a closer look at a politician known as much for his partying as his policies . to some observers , the fact that klaus wowereit published his memoirs in september at the age of 53 was a case of a heightened sense of self-importance , perhaps even arrogance , or at least jumping the gun . his book , although entitled " … and that 's ok - my life in politics , " does not present a new political philosophy or ideas on how germany can succeed in a globalized economy .
rather , these are stories from his own life , of his hardscrabble childhood , his school days , his entry into public office , his finding love and happiness .
politics is present , but plays a secondary role . but those who think the book is nothing more than a vanity project by someone who believes his own life is inspirational are likely underestimating wowereit 's political and media savvy .
indeed , many observers think the book is an announcement by the social democratic , openly gay mayor to the public and his own spd party that berlin 's city hall is not the last stop on his political journey . " wowereit wants to play a larger role in national politics , " said gero neugebauer , professor emeritus of political science at berlin 's free university .
" this book allowed him to get into the media and get people talking about him again . " but all the talk has not necessarily been positive , and while wowereit is used to criticism as mayor of germany 's capital and largest city , his hinting at a desire to reach greater political heights has turned up the intensity of the spotlight on him . bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit partying in berlin with entertainer desirée nick public outing , skyrocketing popularity his book 's title references the event that turned wowereit from a local politician into an a-list celebrity who just happened to also sit in the mayor 's office .
in 2001 , during the campaign , he outed himself publicly in a speech with the words : " i 'm gay , and that 's ok . " suddenly , berlin had a mayor who seemed perfectly in synch with the city itself - open , risk-taking and just a step outside of the mainstream .
there was n't much industry to be found in the capital and unemployment was higher than almost anywhere else in germany , but it certainly knew how to party .
manufacturing sites were rare , but one could n't throw a rock without hitting a club or bar . wowereit could be found in more than a few of those locales , or at society functions , pressing the flesh and having a good time .
his office even came up with an unofficial slogan for berlin , " poor , but sexy . "
people lapped it up ; and with an opposition in disarray , wowereit 's popularity grew . the right stuff ? but as it looks like berlin might be too small a pond for " wowi , " as he 's affectionately known , critics are looking at his record and wondering if he has what it takes to jump to the federal level – and maybe one day even run for the top job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit and his partner jörn kubicki his sexuality does n't seem to figure large .
newspaper headlines have been fond of the expression " gay chancellor " of late and germans themselves are n't put off by it .
in a recent survey , 79 percent of germans said they did n't think homosexuality was a stumbling block on the way to the chancellery . " i think the population is further along than politicians when it comes to that , " said klaus jetz , director of the gay and lesbian federation of germany , who said he was n't surprised at the poll results .
" the sexuality of a chancellor does n't influence his or her policies . " that may be true , say others , but add that wowereit 's record in berlin , particularly when it comes to attracting industry , is not particularly good .
the berlin office of the free democrats , germany 's free-market liberal party , recently sent the mayor a book entitled " klaus wowereit 's ideas for more economic growth and jobs in berlin . "
the book was blank . while the mayor shows enthusiasm for attracting media and other creative - read " sexy " - companies to the capital , critics say he is blasé about getting big players here which could employ big numbers . " in general , he has an attitude that is hostile to the economy , " said markus löning , chair of the berlin fdp . " business people who are interested in investing in berlin ca n't even get an appointment with him . " others question his intellectual heft , and even wowereit himself admits in his book he was never a big reader .
in a questionnaire the mayor filled out at the end of 2004 , he could n't name the date the second world war began , the answer to 3 + 8 x 2 , or spell " rhythm . " in a blistering critique in the süddeutsche zeitung daily , long-time foreign correspondent roger boyes wrote : " often wowi simply acts like a bored teenager . " slow and steady - he 's got time but political scientist neugebauer is less critical of the mayor 's performance in office , saying he has made the best out of the very bad situation he found when he got there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wowereit is never been one to shy away from celebrities - here with sylvester stallone wowereit was able to bring the berlin spd out of a long-term crisis , has given berlin a new international profile that has brought in streams of tourists and has gotten the city 's budget under control by enacting strict spending controls .
his office has stepped up its efforts to bring high-tech and service sector jobs to the city . " he 's working with what he 's got , and going step by step , " said neugebauer , similar to the strategy of another german politician , angela merkel . and he can wait , he added , he 's young enough .
wowereit will not likely challenge current spd head kurt beck , but will likely see how the 2009 federal elections go before making his next move .
right now spd leaders are keeping a close eye on them .
he 's seen as one who does n't follow the party line lock-step , but who can win elections .
that gives him some clout , according to neugebauer . " he just has to wait for the right opportunities , " he said .
" and maybe still prove that he 's got some real substance to him . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
pithy , but not necessarily the image a dignified capital wants to project to the world .
the mayor asked the public if it had any better ideas . the capital 's famously flamboyant mayor klaus wowereit recently appointed a " berlin board , " entrusted to " position the berlin brand " internationally . its illustrious line-up includes architects hans kollhoff and peter hall , catherine mühlemann , mtv 's head of central and emerging markets , and the city 's education minister jürgen zöllner .
the mayor hopes the team , which began work in august , will help steer the capital to lasting global stardom , consolidate its reputation as a cutting edge cultural hotspot and provide it with useful professional contacts .
but wowi , as the mayor 's affectionately known , is also keen for the public to do its bit and has called on the city 's denizens to help come up with a new slogan for the city . " a corporate identity for berlin needs to come from its public , " he said .
" it ca n't be imposed from above . "
commercial clout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a city of many faces wowi himself was the man who first labeled berlin as " poor but sexy " - not , perhaps , the most persuasive branding strategy even if broadly accurate .
ideally , city slogans should be timeless , original and memorable .
a good one , like a good title , can be a valuable tool of identification .
and , as cities like las vegas -lrb- " what happens here , stays here " -rrb- can attest to , an effective slogan can also have considerable commercial value .
the competition designed to reinvent how people see berlin ends on oct .
1 , and the suggestions have been pouring in .
" the contest got a good reception , " the berlin senate 's spokesman günter kolodziej told spiegel online , adding that a second wind of enthusiasm was expected as the deadline approaches .
city of change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : city of encounters , indeed but not all the proposals have been serious .
berlin 's bi-weekly listings magazine zitty suggested the phrase " we do it all .
but we do it all wrong , " which has a certain ring of truth to it in the light of spectacular semi-disasters such as the expensive new central train station , which started falling apart as soon as the wind picked up .
another suggestion was " berlin : city of encounters " - a reference to the mayor 's party-loving reputation . but now it 's up to the public .
and according to the mayor , they 're more than equal to the task . " berlin secret weapon is its people , " wowereit stressed on the berlin city web site . " they are the real heroes of the berlin brand .
it is their personalities that make this city exciting and unique . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

"
pithy , but not necessarily the image a dignified capital wants to project to the world .
the mayor asked the public if it had any better ideas . the capital 's famously flamboyant mayor klaus wowereit recently appointed a " berlin board , " entrusted to " position the berlin brand " internationally . its illustrious line-up includes architects hans kollhoff and peter hall , catherine mühlemann , mtv 's head of central and emerging markets , and the city 's education minister jürgen zöllner .
the mayor hopes the team , which began work in august , will help steer the capital to lasting global stardom , consolidate its reputation as a cutting edge cultural hotspot and provide it with useful professional contacts .
but wowi , as the mayor 's affectionately known , is also keen for the public to do its bit and has called on the city 's denizens to help come up with a new slogan for the city . " a corporate identity for berlin needs to come from its public , " he said .
" it ca n't be imposed from above . "
commercial clout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a city of many faces wowi himself was the man who first labeled berlin as " poor but sexy " - not , perhaps , the most persuasive branding strategy even if broadly accurate .
ideally , city slogans should be timeless , original and memorable .
a good one , like a good title , can be a valuable tool of identification .
and , as cities like las vegas -lrb- " what happens here , stays here " -rrb- can attest to , an effective slogan can also have considerable commercial value .
the competition designed to reinvent how people see berlin ends on oct .
1 , and the suggestions have been pouring in .
" the contest got a good reception , " the berlin senate 's spokesman günter kolodziej told spiegel online , adding that a second wind of enthusiasm was expected as the deadline approaches .
city of change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : city of encounters , indeed but not all the proposals have been serious .
berlin 's bi-weekly listings magazine zitty suggested the phrase " we do it all .
but we do it all wrong , " which has a certain ring of truth to it in the light of spectacular semi-disasters such as the expensive new central train station , which started falling apart as soon as the wind picked up .
another suggestion was " berlin : city of encounters " - a reference to the mayor 's party-loving reputation . but now it 's up to the public .
and according to the mayor , they 're more than equal to the task . " berlin secret weapon is its people , " wowereit stressed on the berlin city web site . " they are the real heroes of the berlin brand .
it is their personalities that make this city exciting and unique . " dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

germany 's watertight defence did n't concede a single goal in the tournament , the first time ever that a soccer side has managed the feat .
31,000 fans in shanghai 's hongkou football stadium watched the fast-paced fifa women 's world cup final .
brazilian star striker marta , the top scorer in the tournament , failed to get in a penalty kick past goalkeeper nadine angerer , a goal which would have tied the game in the second half .
bildunterschrift : brazil 's marta grimaces after she failed to score a penalty kick " after the penalty save , i felt it was meant to be , " germany coach silvia neid said .
" we worked hard for each other , it was a great team performance .
it was important to work against marta , and we did a good job in pushing her to the sidelines . "
missed chances the nimble-footed brazilians were the better side in the first half , playing a fast aggressive game and piling up the pressure on the german defense .
marta , who won the best player of the tournament award , had the first chance of the game in the fourth minute with a long range drive stopped easily by angerer . seconds later , the physically stronger germans went on the attack when kerstin garefrekes was set free on the right only to slice her shot into the side netting .
in the eight minute , germany 's powerful defense seemed to falter for an instant when goalkeeper angerer failed to gather a free kick by brazil 's daniela .
the ball bounced out to formiga but she was unable to put the ball in the net .
daniela had another chance in the 23rd minute but was unlucky when she shot a left foot volley onto the post .
heroic saves by german goalie the germans finally picked up pace in the second half , determinedly pushing forward .
but it was only in the 52nd minute that they managed the breakthrough when captain birgit prinz was fed a pass by sandra smisek .
the veteran forward coolly slotted in the crossed ball on the turn .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : brazil 's defender aline , german forward sandra smisek and german midfielder melanie behringer fight for the ball but it was angerer who was the hero of the day when she stopped the spot kick by martha with her knees and then again when she held a flying strike by substitute rosana .
despite dominating ball possession , brazil 's spirited attack failed to break through the solid german defense and they failed to find an equalizer .
a stunning header by simone laudehr in the dying minutes of the game clinched the game for the ruthlessly efficient german side .
" germany deserved to win " " this was a very tough match , we missed a lot of chances especially when we were 1-0 down and marta missed a critical penalty , " said brazil coach jorge barcellos .
" but germany took their chances and scored .
i 'm very sad about this result but my players tried their best . "
the 21-year-old marta said she was crushed after the defeat but that the team had to look ahead . " it 's difficult to express my feelings .
the germans deserved to win , " she said .
" but we have to keep our chin up and prepare for the olympics in beijing .

the former world chess champion faces a daunting challenge , as pro-kremlin candidates are expected to win . kasparov is a leading force behind other russia , a coalition which unites liberals , leftists and nationalists who oppose russian president vladimir putin .
the russian constitution requires putin to step down after serving two four-year terms .
his has yet to endorse a potential successor , but his approval is seen as pivotal to the upcoming elections , which will be held in march 2 , 2008 .
kasparov 's coalition has little public support bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : campaign season is just around the corner kasparov , 44 , won 379 of 498 votes at other russia coalition 's national congress .
yet kasparov 's place on the march ballot remains uncertain .
his candidacy needs to be registered and will likely be blocked .
even if he is allowed to run , kasparov is not expected to pose a major threat to putin 's candidate .
while kasparov is well known in europe for his chess exploits , the latest poll by the independent levada news agency shows 3 percent of russians will vote for the other russia candidate .
" the goal of the other russia is not winning elections , but to have an election , " kasparov said , speaking in english on the sidelines of the congress .
" we 're trying to force the regime to accept our right to participate in free and fair elections , to agitate the russian population and the russian public to support our ideas . "
kasparov calls for unity in opposing kremlin bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : putin won easily last time around kasparov says that putin 's broad public support comes from the kremlin 's control over the media and the electoral process .

this will work only if we stay united , " kasparov said , adding the coalition stood for a " democratic and just russia . "
the other russia coalition is hampered by internal divisions and has been marginalized by the authorities .

" back then , the chess system wanted to maintain a cosy status quo , avoiding any candidate worthy of the name to fight karpov , " he has said .
" the political situation in russia today reminds me of that time . "
kasparov was born in the former soviet republic of azerbaijan to armenian-jewish parents .
he took up chess in 1963 at the age of 6 and was a junior champion by the age of 13 .
he became the world 's youngest chess champion when he beat karpov in 1985 at the age of 22 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 01.10.2007 as berlin mayor looks to own political future , scrutiny grows großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : berlin 's mayor klaus wowereit poses with a copy of his autobiography berlin mayor klaus wowereit 's recent memoir has ignited discussion about his future political ambitions .
the book has moved many to take a closer look at a politician known as much for his partying as his policies . to some observers , the fact that klaus wowereit published his memoirs in september at the age of 53 was a case of a heightened sense of self-importance , perhaps even arrogance , or at least jumping the gun . his book , although entitled " … and that 's ok - my life in politics , " does not present a new political philosophy or ideas on how germany can succeed in a globalized economy .
rather , these are stories from his own life , of his hardscrabble childhood , his school days , his entry into public office , his finding love and happiness .
politics is present , but plays a secondary role . but those who think the book is nothing more than a vanity project by someone who believes his own life is inspirational are likely underestimating wowereit 's political and media savvy .
indeed , many observers think the book is an announcement by the social democratic , openly gay mayor to the public and his own spd party that berlin 's city hall is not the last stop on his political journey . " wowereit wants to play a larger role in national politics , " said gero neugebauer , professor emeritus of political science at berlin 's free university .
" this book allowed him to get into the media and get people talking about him again . " but all the talk has not necessarily been positive , and while wowereit is used to criticism as mayor of germany 's capital and largest city , his hinting at a desire to reach greater political heights has turned up the intensity of the spotlight on him . bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit partying in berlin with entertainer desirée nick public outing , skyrocketing popularity his book 's title references the event that turned wowereit from a local politician into an a-list celebrity who just happened to also sit in the mayor 's office .
in 2001 , during the campaign , he outed himself publicly in a speech with the words : " i 'm gay , and that 's ok . " suddenly , berlin had a mayor who seemed perfectly in synch with the city itself - open , risk-taking and just a step outside of the mainstream .
there was n't much industry to be found in the capital and unemployment was higher than almost anywhere else in germany , but it certainly knew how to party .
manufacturing sites were rare , but one could n't throw a rock without hitting a club or bar . wowereit could be found in more than a few of those locales , or at society functions , pressing the flesh and having a good time .
his office even came up with an unofficial slogan for berlin , " poor , but sexy . "
people lapped it up ; and with an opposition in disarray , wowereit 's popularity grew . the right stuff ? but as it looks like berlin might be too small a pond for " wowi , " as he 's affectionately known , critics are looking at his record and wondering if he has what it takes to jump to the federal level – and maybe one day even run for the top job . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : klaus wowereit and his partner jörn kubicki his sexuality does n't seem to figure large .
newspaper headlines have been fond of the expression " gay chancellor " of late and germans themselves are n't put off by it .
in a recent survey , 79 percent of germans said they did n't think homosexuality was a stumbling block on the way to the chancellery . " i think the population is further along than politicians when it comes to that , " said klaus jetz , director of the gay and lesbian federation of germany , who said he was n't surprised at the poll results .
" the sexuality of a chancellor does n't influence his or her policies . " that may be true , say others , but add that wowereit 's record in berlin , particularly when it comes to attracting industry , is not particularly good .
the berlin office of the free democrats , germany 's free-market liberal party , recently sent the mayor a book entitled " klaus wowereit 's ideas for more economic growth and jobs in berlin . "
the book was blank . while the mayor shows enthusiasm for attracting media and other creative - read " sexy " - companies to the capital , critics say he is blasé about getting big players here which could employ big numbers . " in general , he has an attitude that is hostile to the economy , " said markus löning , chair of the berlin fdp . " business people who are interested in investing in berlin ca n't even get an appointment with him . " others question his intellectual heft , and even wowereit himself admits in his book he was never a big reader .
in a questionnaire the mayor filled out at the end of 2004 , he could n't name the date the second world war began , the answer to 3 + 8 x 2 , or spell " rhythm . " in a blistering critique in the süddeutsche zeitung daily , long-time foreign correspondent roger boyes wrote : " often wowi simply acts like a bored teenager . " slow and steady - he 's got time but political scientist neugebauer is less critical of the mayor 's performance in office , saying he has made the best out of the very bad situation he found when he got there . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wowereit is never been one to shy away from celebrities - here with sylvester stallone wowereit was able to bring the berlin spd out of a long-term crisis , has given berlin a new international profile that has brought in streams of tourists and has gotten the city 's budget under control by enacting strict spending controls .
his office has stepped up its efforts to bring high-tech and service sector jobs to the city . " he 's working with what he 's got , and going step by step , " said neugebauer , similar to the strategy of another german politician , angela merkel . and he can wait , he added , he 's young enough .
wowereit will not likely challenge current spd head kurt beck , but will likely see how the 2009 federal elections go before making his next move .
right now spd leaders are keeping a close eye on them .
he 's seen as one who does n't follow the party line lock-step , but who can win elections .
that gives him some clout , according to neugebauer . " he just has to wait for the right opportunities , " he said .
" and maybe still prove that he 's got some real substance to him . " kyle james send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

and this evaluation does n't have anything to do with the fact that the german team succeeded in winning its second title in a row - something the men 's team has still never done . the 16 national teams have spectacularly shown that women 's soccer has absolutely nothing to do with the seemingly ineradicable views of armchair players .
the world cup was , without a doubt , a tournament played at a high technical and tactical level .
women 's soccer today is fairer than men 's , offensive and well-played at a pace that has clearly sped up .
of course , the men are still faster , but that 's the case in track and field , too .
are those races any more boring because of it ? the journey women 's soccer has taken from its beginnings when it was often chuckled at - or even openly ridiculed - can be shown in many ways .
while the women on the german team who won the 1989 european championships were rewarded with a coffee set , each member of the 2007 team will receive 50,000 euros -lrb- $ 71,165 -rrb- for winning the title .
and the nearly 40,000 spectators per game in china speak for themselves .
while the 1999 cup was broadcast in 67 countries , this time around it was 220 - and german television ratings were very high . the world cup in china has doubtlessly given women 's soccer a new worldwide impulse for further development .
the announcement from brazil to introduce a real professional league as soon as possible is only a small , first step .
if the sport still does n't make a giant leap in terms of public perception then it 's because of limited funding and the lack of a league structure . in comparison with men , there are also simply fewer women playing soccer , which lowers the number of truly gifted players .
the result is that the level of club soccer varies from club to club and is clearly lower than the soccer played by national teams .
that 's a reason why organizers should carefully consider whether the plan to increase the number of teams at the next world cup from 16 to 24 is the right decision . the world cup was also another test for the beijing summer olympics in 2008 , and it was a test spectators passed with flying colors while small and usually insignificant mistakes tarnished the organizers ' results . it leaves a bitter taste in many mouths when teams complain of sports espionage , journalists and players are constantly monitored and even have the feeling of being watched in their hotel rooms .
in this regard , the chinese can only be urgently advised to work out solutions to keep these scandals from resurfacing next year . wolfgang van kann is the head of dw-radio 's sports send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

a report by friends of the earth says that the severn barrage would damage the environment and wildlife habitats .
the government is studying the scheme , which it is thought could produce up to 5 % of the uk 's electricity needs .
meanwhile , the sustainable development commission is due to release a tidal power report on monday , including the feasibility of a severn barrage .
' mega-project ' it could extend from the south wales coast near cardiff across the estuary to weston-super-mare .
the idea was first raised about 150 years ago , but environmental and cost concerns have always blocked approval .
it was last seriously considered in the 1970s and 80s .
how tidal power works as tide comes in , sea water passes through barrage to landward side at high tide , sluice gates shut , trapping water in estuary or basin when tide recedes on sea-side of barrage , sluice gates open water flows through barrage , driving turbines and generating power power can be generated in both directions , but this can affect efficiency and economics of project last year 's governmental energy review opened the door again , saying that the barrage should be re-evaluated .
friends of the earth 's report says a system of " tidal lagoons " - artificially created offshore pools - would be better for wildlife , cost less , produce 60 % more energy and not block shipping routes .
under the group 's alternative proposals , water would flow through turbines in and out of the lagoons as the tide rose and fell .
neil crumpton , friends of the earth 's energy campaigner , said that this would avoid the need to destroy natural habitats in the estuary .
he said : " the £ 14 billion severn barrage would be a hugely expensive , environmentally damaging and legally questionable mega-project .
" in contrast , a series of large lagoons in the severn estuary , possibly with a shoots barrage which could carry the london to south wales rail link , could offer a far better solution to harnessing the enormous power of the severn estuary . "
' jury 's out ' mudflats , saltmarshes and rocky along the estuary provide food for 65,000 birds during winter .
dr mark avery , the rspb 's conservation director , said : " tackling climate change is hugely important but this can be done without destroying irreplaceable national treasures like the severn estuary . "
severn barrage the barrage would be 16km -lrb- 10 miles -rrb- long it would power more than 200 turbines planners say it could create 35,000 construction jobs and between 10,000 and 40,000 permanent jobs the barrage could be generating electricity within 11 years , say planners " the severn estuary is one of the uk 's most important sites for water birds , " said the rspb 's conservation director mark avery .
greenpeace said it was expected that the sustainable development commission 's report was would recommend further analysis of the scheme .
john sauven , executive director of greenpeace uk , said that " the jury 's still out " on the best way to harness tidal power from the estuary without affecting birds .
at the labour party 's annual conference in bournemouth , business and enterprise secretary john hutton launched a feasibility study into the severn barrage .
a spokesman the department for business , enterprise and regulatory reform said the government was looking at all the options .
he added : " this includes both a barrage and tidal lagoons .
neither option has been ruled out .
" the sustainable development commission 's study has looked at all the various technologies .
we will await their report and consider it carefully . "

a report by friends of the earth says that the severn barrage would damage the environment and wildlife habitats .
the government is studying the scheme , which it is thought could produce up to 5 % of the uk 's electricity needs .
meanwhile , the sustainable development commission is due to release a tidal power report on monday , including the feasibility of a severn barrage .
' mega-project ' it could extend from the south wales coast near cardiff across the estuary to weston-super-mare .

friends of the earth 's report says a system of " tidal lagoons " - artificially created offshore pools - would be better for wildlife , cost less , produce 60 % more energy and not block shipping routes .
under the group 's alternative proposals , water would flow through turbines in and out of the lagoons as the tide rose and fell .
neil crumpton , friends of the earth 's energy campaigner , said that this would avoid the need to destroy natural habitats in the estuary .
he said : " the £ 14 billion severn barrage would be a hugely expensive , environmentally damaging and legally questionable mega-project .
" in contrast , a series of large lagoons in the severn estuary , possibly with a shoots barrage which could carry the london to south wales rail link , could offer a far better solution to harnessing the enormous power of the severn estuary . "
' jury 's out ' mudflats , saltmarshes and rocky along the estuary provide food for 65,000 birds during winter .
dr mark avery , the rspb 's conservation director , said : " tackling climate change is hugely important but this can be done without destroying irreplaceable national treasures like the severn estuary . "
severn barrage the barrage would be 16km -lrb- 10 miles -rrb- long it would power more than 200 turbines planners say it could create 35,000 construction jobs and between 10,000 and 40,000 permanent jobs the barrage could be generating electricity within 11 years , say planners " the severn estuary is one of the uk 's most important sites for water birds , " said the rspb 's conservation director mark avery .
greenpeace said it was expected that the sustainable development commission 's report was would recommend further analysis of the scheme .
john sauven , executive director of greenpeace uk , said that " the jury 's still out " on the best way to harness tidal power from the estuary without affecting birds .

a report by friends of the earth says that the severn barrage would damage the environment and wildlife habitats .
the government is studying the scheme , which it is thought could produce up to 5 % of the uk 's electricity needs .
meanwhile , the sustainable development commission is due to release a tidal power report on monday , including the feasibility of a severn barrage .
' mega-project ' it could extend from the south wales coast near cardiff across the estuary to weston-super-mare .
the idea was first raised about 150 years ago , but environmental and cost concerns have always blocked approval .
it was last seriously considered in the 1970s and 80s .
how tidal power works as tide comes in , sea water passes through barrage to landward side at high tide , sluice gates shut , trapping water in estuary or basin when tide recedes on sea-side of barrage , sluice gates open water flows through barrage , driving turbines and generating power power can be generated in both directions , but this can affect efficiency and economics of project last year 's governmental energy review opened the door again , saying that the barrage should be re-evaluated .
friends of the earth 's report says a system of " tidal lagoons " - artificially created offshore pools - would be better for wildlife , cost less , produce 60 % more energy and not block shipping routes .
under the group 's alternative proposals , water would flow through turbines in and out of the lagoons as the tide rose and fell .
neil crumpton , friends of the earth 's energy campaigner , said that this would avoid the need to destroy natural habitats in the estuary .
he said : " the £ 14 billion severn barrage would be a hugely expensive , environmentally damaging and legally questionable mega-project .
" in contrast , a series of large lagoons in the severn estuary , possibly with a shoots barrage which could carry the london to south wales rail link , could offer a far better solution to harnessing the enormous power of the severn estuary . "
' jury 's out ' mudflats , saltmarshes and rocky along the estuary provide food for 65,000 birds during winter .
dr mark avery , the rspb 's conservation director , said : " tackling climate change is hugely important but this can be done without destroying irreplaceable national treasures like the severn estuary . "
severn barrage the barrage would be 16km -lrb- 10 miles -rrb- long it would power more than 200 turbines planners say it could create 35,000 construction jobs and between 10,000 and 40,000 permanent jobs the barrage could be generating electricity within 11 years , say planners " the severn estuary is one of the uk 's most important sites for water birds , " said the rspb 's conservation director mark avery .
greenpeace said it was expected that the sustainable development commission 's report was would recommend further analysis of the scheme .
john sauven , executive director of greenpeace uk , said that " the jury 's still out " on the best way to harness tidal power from the estuary without affecting birds .
at the labour party 's annual conference in bournemouth , business and enterprise secretary john hutton launched a feasibility study into the severn barrage .
a spokesman the department for business , enterprise and regulatory reform said the government was looking at all the options .
he added : " this includes both a barrage and tidal lagoons .
neither option has been ruled out .
" the sustainable development commission 's study has looked at all the various technologies .
we will await their report and consider it carefully . "

wales 's chief medical officer said only 25 penalty notices had been issued since the ban began on 2 april .
dr tony jewell said : " a number of licensees have commented that trade has never been busier . "
however , landlords ' spokesman aneurin jones said : " i think the majority of people have lost business over it . "
figures released by the assembly government show almost 99 % of licensed premises in wales are complying with the smoking ban . "

officials are claiming public support for the ban has grown since it was brought in , with backing rising from 71 % in february 2006 to 80 % in may .
dr jewell said the ban was on course to deliver health benefits similar to those seen in scotland since its ban 18 months ago .
he said : " if wales benefits to the same extent we could expect a 17 % reduction of hospital admissions for patients with acute coronary syndrome amounting to 958 admissions .
" the ban will help to cut the number of deaths from second-hand smoke .
every year there will be an estimated 400 fewer premature deaths of non-smokers .
" i am pleased that the introduction the smoking ban has gone smoothly and i hope that individuals and businesses will continue to comply so that we ensure we maximise the health benefits of the ban . "
but mr jones , of licensed victuallers association wales , who runs a hotel in llanberis , gwynedd , said : " i do n't know who 's winning in the end .
" i 'm a non-smoker myself and it 's much nicer now to be in the public bar but i 'm not sure if it 's going to make people healthier .
" the ones that are not coming to the pub now are smoking and drinking among their children , at home . "
last month , doctors in wales called on the assembly government to ban cigarette vending machines and packets of 10 as a way to cut underage smoking .
at midnight on sunday , the minimum age for buying tobacco products increased from 16 to 18 in a bid to cut the number of young smokers .

a " non-political " charity , help for heroes , wants to build a gym and full-sized pool at headley court rehabilitation centre in surrey .
it is the idea of cartoonist bryn parry who served in the royal green jackets .
he said he had been " profoundly humbled " meeting soldiers and staff at selly oak hospital , birmingham , the first stop for injured service people .
general sir richard dannatt , chief of the general staff , is a trustee for the appeal and said there was an increased need for public support to improve facilities .
" as our operational commitments have become more intense , so the need for support from the nation has grown , " he said .
we would question why this needs to be delivered through the charitable sector rather than the government sue freeth " help for heroes gives the public a practical way to demonstrate their support for those serving our country . "
the charity 's first planned fund-raising event , a 320-mile bike ride through world war i and world war ii battlefields in france , is scheduled to take place in may next year .
mr parry said : " i just feel we ought to be showing we care and appreciate these brave young men .
" we owe a debt to these people and we need to ensure that if they are injured then they get the very best of care to help them overcome any disability . "
a new 30-bed ward has been added to the existing 170 beds at headley court in july to cope with the growing numbers of forces personnel injured in iraq and afghanistan .
in august , plans to turn a £ 1.7m house in nearby ashtead into a " home from home " for families of injured service personnel were approved by the local council .
cartoonist bryn parry served in the royal green jackets sue freeth , the royal british legion 's director of welfare , said improvements to rehabilitation facilities were " urgently needed " .
but she added that the new charity raised questions over the government 's approach to caring for the wounded .
" we would question why this needs to be delivered through the charitable sector rather than it being a top funding priority for the government . "
defence minister derek twigg said the government had invested heavily to make headley court a " world-class " facility .
" the offer of extra funding from help for heroes is very welcome , " he said .
" it will allow us to further improve the quality of life of patients at headley court . "

general sir richard dannatt , chief of the general staff , is a trustee for the appeal and said there was an increased need for public support to improve facilities .

the charity 's first planned fund-raising event , a 320-mile bike ride through world war i and world war ii battlefields in france , is scheduled to take place in may next year .

a " non-political " charity , help for heroes , wants to build a gym and full-sized pool at headley court rehabilitation centre in surrey .
it is the idea of cartoonist bryn parry who served in the royal green jackets .
he said he had been " profoundly humbled " meeting soldiers and staff at selly oak hospital , birmingham , the first stop for injured service people .
general sir richard dannatt , chief of the general staff , is a trustee for the appeal and said there was an increased need for public support to improve facilities .
" as our operational commitments have become more intense , so the need for support from the nation has grown , " he said .
we would question why this needs to be delivered through the charitable sector rather than the government sue freeth " help for heroes gives the public a practical way to demonstrate their support for those serving our country . "
the charity 's first planned fund-raising event , a 320-mile bike ride through world war i and world war ii battlefields in france , is scheduled to take place in may next year .
mr parry said : " i just feel we ought to be showing we care and appreciate these brave young men .
" we owe a debt to these people and we need to ensure that if they are injured then they get the very best of care to help them overcome any disability . "
a new 30-bed ward has been added to the existing 170 beds at headley court in july to cope with the growing numbers of forces personnel injured in iraq and afghanistan .
in august , plans to turn a £ 1.7m house in nearby ashtead into a " home from home " for families of injured service personnel were approved by the local council .
cartoonist bryn parry served in the royal green jackets sue freeth , the royal british legion 's director of welfare , said improvements to rehabilitation facilities were " urgently needed " .
but she added that the new charity raised questions over the government 's approach to caring for the wounded .
" we would question why this needs to be delivered through the charitable sector rather than it being a top funding priority for the government . "
defence minister derek twigg said the government had invested heavily to make headley court a " world-class " facility .
" the offer of extra funding from help for heroes is very welcome , " he said .
" it will allow us to further improve the quality of life of patients at headley court . "

those who had it were revered and stigmatised in equal measure for their supposedly divinely ordained condition .
julius caesar , peter the great , and byron are just a few of the best known historical figures to have had epilepsy .
but for the many over-65s in scotland who are increasingly being diagnosed , their condition is far from a gift from the gods .
older people are currently part of an invisible epidemic which is largely either misdiagnosed or ignored .
they make up scotland 's fastest growing group of people with epilepsy - a " demographic time bomb " which is due to grow inexorably as our society ages .
research suggests that there may be as many as 1,650 new cases of epilepsy in scotland each year in people aged 60 and above . "
it 's very disorientating and it can take a few minutes after the attack before i 'm fully aware of my surroundings " doreen jobson doreen jobson , 69 , from bishopbriggs , east dunbartonshire , is one such person who developed the condition later in life .
despite the challenge of dealing with the sudden onset of epilepsy , she looks remarkably fresh faced for a woman who is almost in her seventh decade .
her kind , unlined face , which usually features a thousand-watt smile , obscures the trauma she faced when she had her first seizure .
doreen said : " after the attack , i was given a number of tests and an eeg which could n't find anything .
" they just do n't know why the condition appears in some people and not others .
the attacks themselves were very frightening .
" i get a warning of a few seconds and then i 'm totally unconscious .
it 's very disorientating and it can take a few minutes after the attack before i 'm fully aware of my surroundings . "
epilepsy facts epilepsy is a neurological condition characterized by recurring seizures a seizure is a brief disturbance in the electrical activity of the brain the most common prescribed treatment for epilepsy is daily medication in some patients , vagus nerve stimulation treatment may reduce the frequency of seizures brain surgery may be performed if seizure activity is confined to a limited area of the brain she had her first attack in bed , leaving her husband fearing the worst .
he called an ambulance believing that she was in the midst of a heart attack .
doreen lost consciousness , began twitching violently and was covered in blood .
it emerged later that she had bitten her tongue .
tonic-clonic seizures , formerly known as grand mal seizures , are characterised by just such a loss of consciousness and rhythmical muscle contractions .
they are caused by abnormal electrical activity throughout the brain , so signs and symptoms can be seen across the whole body .
technological advancements she said : " eventually i was told i had epilepsy and i was totally taken aback .
it was like a bolt from the blue when i was diagnosed .
" i thought that epilepsy was something that you were born with .
i was dumbstruck because no-one in my family had ever had it and to be honest , i knew nothing about epilepsy .
" i had been feeling odd and kept getting a funny feeling of déjà vu .
i had some symptoms for about two years but often the feelings would disappear after a few minutes .
" i went to the doctors and they said there was nothing wrong with me .
i was eventually given tranquilisers which i declined to take . "
misdiagnosis is a major issue and bodies such as epilepsy scotland estimate that epilepsy has a misdiagnosis rate of about 30 % .
technological advancements in medical imaging mean that diagnosis is becoming more accurate but not all health boards have access to the expensive equipment .
despite the scale of the social issue of older people with epilepsy , it has rarely been investigated .
one study , however , found that older people with epilepsy diagnosed in later life were more anxious and depressed than those diagnosed earlier and their overall perception of quality of life was more likely to be negative .
the report 's authors called for far more work into the " psychosocial consequences " of the condition on older people .
however , doreen does not look like someone who has been frightened into submission by the relatively late and unexpected arrival of her condition .
busy lifestyle she is far from helpless : she worked for many years as a medical secretary and maintains a business-like air , coming across as both efficient and eminently capable .
as an active member of the local church , she still has a busy lifestyle and has only had to give up one beloved activity - driving .
she said : " it was a nuisance especially when the kids were younger because i could n't drive them around the way i used to .
" i do n't let it get in the way of me living a normal life .
i am actually grateful that having epilepsy has raised my awareness of the condition and its treatment . "
coping with both old age and epilepsy is undoubtedly a challenge , but the slowly growing clamour for improved services and heightened awareness means that many have been left with that most important factor : hope .

stephen stewart bbc scotland news website drugs can be very effective in the treatment of epilepsy many older people still live in fear of the perceived stigma attached to epilepsy .
fear and misunderstanding still surround the condition and some can be left with depression after their diagnosis .
the elderly are especially sensitive to the term ' epilepsy ' which some view as pejorative .
but the future is bright for those struggling to cope with a diagnosis : the outcome with suitable medication is usually very good .
professor martin j brodie , director of the epilepsy unit at the western infirmary in glasgow , said : " the problem with epilepsy in the elderly is that the seizures are almost invariably a consequence of concomitant brain dysfunction due , for instance , to cerebrovascular disease or dementia .
" these patients are seen by a range of specialists .
very few of them are referred to my own epilepsy service here at the western infirmary .
the increasing number of older people in scotland is one of the key drivers in our work and exactly why we are developing an action plan for long-term conditions government spokeswoman " there is now increasing interest by geriatricians in epilepsy and the other conditions that can mimic epileptic seizures . "
the scottish government also said that more resources were being dedicated to the growth in older people with epilepsy .
a spokeswoman said : " we know from our work on the management of long-term conditions such as epilepsy , that getting an accurate diagnosis as early as possible is extremely important .
' population time bomb ' " the increasing number of older people in scotland is one of the key drivers in our work and exactly why we are developing an action plan for long-term conditions . "
epilepsy scotland , however , said that more must be done to deal with the crisis as more than a quarter of the population would be aged 65 or older by 2031 .
a spokeswoman said : " unfortunately , the general public see epilepsy as something that happens in childhood .
" people do n't realise epilepsy is more likely to happen in later life .
we face a population time bomb .
epilepsy is triggered by disturbances in the brain 's electrical activity " change needs to come from the top .
health boards need to realise this is a problem and plan for it accordingly . "
scotland has a shortage of doctors who specialise in epilepsy and not every health board employs epilepsy specialist nurses .
nhs quality improvement scotland is currently developing clinical standards for all neurological conditions , including epilepsy .
but crucially , there are no specialist services or clinics for older people with epilepsy - yet .

browsing speeds have been slow , the places you can go have been restricted because surfing has to be done via the portal of your carrier and the cost of just using the net has been very high .
but slowly and steadily the situation is changing .
t-mobile , vodafone , orange and three offer flat rate price plans for using the net .
o2 will introduce its flat rate plan in october - just prior to the uk iphone launch .
however , most impose monthly data download limits and some stop customers using some net services - such as skype or streaming video .
some operators also levy extra charges if a customer exceeds the monthly data limit or downloads data , be it music or video , rather than just browse .
anyone planning to get a net service on their mobile would be well advised to click around on the operators ' website to see what you do , and do not , get for your money .
pattern recognition the numbers of mobile phone users accessing the web is growing steadily .
the most recent figures available , for february 2007 , from the mobile data association show that almost 15 million people use the web via their handsets each month .
t-mobile was the first in the uk to bring in a flat-rate pricing plan for net use under the banner of its " web and walk " service .
richard warmsley , head of internet on the move at t-mobile , said more than 500,000 people had signed up to " web and walk " in the 18 months since it was launched .
lifestyle changes and the increasingly connected lives of 21st century britons was driving many people to use the service , he said .
" usage is as diverse as the people using it , " he said .
phones are becoming devices that can handle all kinds of data increasingly , he said , what people do on a pc they want to do on a phone too .
" social networking has rocketed up the charts recently , " he said .
sites such as bebo , myspace , facebook and ebay have become very popular destinations for customers .
" half of our customers surf the internet on their mobile when they are at home watching tv , " he said .
" they do not need to go to a laptop and fire it up .
the mobile is there for them . "
broad church for al russell , vodafone 's head of mobile internet services , it is not just lifestyle changes that have conspired to get people signing up to browse on their handset .
flat rate prices , accelerating mobile data speeds , increasing numbers of handsets that are web capable and the tearing down of the walls around operators ' portals have all helped to " liberate usage " among customers .
uk mobile data plans vodafone - £ 7.50 a month -lrb- 120mb monthly limit -rrb- t mobile - £ 7.50 a month -lrb- 1gb monthly limit -rrb- orange - £ 8 a month -lrb- 30mb monthly limit -rrb- 3 - £ 5 a month -lrb- 1gb monthly limit -rrb- 02 - £ 7.50 -lrb- 200mb monthly limit -rrb- but , he said , it was hard to predict what people wanted to do when browsing the web via the phone .
some , he said , used the phone to help when they were out and about but what people looked for was very diverse .
" it 's different and relevant to the individual , " said mr russell , " it 's the real long tail of relevance . "
for jayanthi rangarajan , head of novarra which works with operators to get mobile net access working , the reason mobile operators want to get their customers surfing via their handsets is simple : money .
in mature markets competition was putting pressure on the cash that operators make from voice calls - the main source of revenue for many , she said .
walled gardens have become stores for games , ringtones and wallpapers mobile firms had to get their customers using data to offset how much they stood to lose as voice revenue declines , said ms rangarajan .
" operators can see the data average return per user -lrb- arpu -rrb- grow and that 's compelling and that 's a driver , " she said .
statistics gathered by novarra show that open web browsing boosts data downloads from an average of 0.18 megabytes per day to 0.6 .
operators had started to realise too that , for many , the mobile phone is the gadget they carry with them all day and may become the preferred way to access the net .
" there 's a huge population of people that are not sitting in front of a computer all day , " she said .
getting more people to use the web on their phone also helped drive them to spend more money on the portals operators have created , she said .
customers that use the mobile net also make much more use of the portals that operators run .
" if you 're now starting to look at your telephone rather than put it to your ear there 's more chance you 're going to start interacting with what 's offered via the portal , " said ms rangarajan .
" and that could go far beyond games , ringtones , screensavers and wallpapers . "
having people look at their phones means they become mobile billboards and potential sites to serve up adverts - yet another way for the operators to recoup some cash .
but , she said , operators had to be careful about how they made use of what they knew about customers and how they served up adverts .
" the potential for doing it wrong is so much more apparent , " she said .

browsing speeds have been slow , the places you can go have been restricted because surfing has to be done via the portal of your carrier and the cost of just using the net has been very high .
but slowly and steadily the situation is changing .
t-mobile , vodafone , orange and three offer flat rate price plans for using the net .
o2 will introduce its flat rate plan in october - just prior to the uk iphone launch .
however , most impose monthly data download limits and some stop customers using some net services - such as skype or streaming video .
some operators also levy extra charges if a customer exceeds the monthly data limit or downloads data , be it music or video , rather than just browse .
anyone planning to get a net service on their mobile would be well advised to click around on the operators ' website to see what you do , and do not , get for your money .
pattern recognition the numbers of mobile phone users accessing the web is growing steadily .
the most recent figures available , for february 2007 , from the mobile data association show that almost 15 million people use the web via their handsets each month .
t-mobile was the first in the uk to bring in a flat-rate pricing plan for net use under the banner of its " web and walk " service .
richard warmsley , head of internet on the move at t-mobile , said more than 500,000 people had signed up to " web and walk " in the 18 months since it was launched .
lifestyle changes and the increasingly connected lives of 21st century britons was driving many people to use the service , he said .
" usage is as diverse as the people using it , " he said .
phones are becoming devices that can handle all kinds of data increasingly , he said , what people do on a pc they want to do on a phone too .
" social networking has rocketed up the charts recently , " he said .
sites such as bebo , myspace , facebook and ebay have become very popular destinations for customers .
" half of our customers surf the internet on their mobile when they are at home watching tv , " he said .
" they do not need to go to a laptop and fire it up .
the mobile is there for them . "
broad church for al russell , vodafone 's head of mobile internet services , it is not just lifestyle changes that have conspired to get people signing up to browse on their handset .
flat rate prices , accelerating mobile data speeds , increasing numbers of handsets that are web capable and the tearing down of the walls around operators ' portals have all helped to " liberate usage " among customers .
uk mobile data plans vodafone - £ 7.50 a month -lrb- 120mb monthly limit -rrb- t mobile - £ 7.50 a month -lrb- 1gb monthly limit -rrb- orange - £ 8 a month -lrb- 30mb monthly limit -rrb- 3 - £ 5 a month -lrb- 1gb monthly limit -rrb- 02 - £ 7.50 -lrb- 200mb monthly limit -rrb- but , he said , it was hard to predict what people wanted to do when browsing the web via the phone .
some , he said , used the phone to help when they were out and about but what people looked for was very diverse .
" it 's different and relevant to the individual , " said mr russell , " it 's the real long tail of relevance . "
for jayanthi rangarajan , head of novarra which works with operators to get mobile net access working , the reason mobile operators want to get their customers surfing via their handsets is simple : money .
in mature markets competition was putting pressure on the cash that operators make from voice calls - the main source of revenue for many , she said .
walled gardens have become stores for games , ringtones and wallpapers mobile firms had to get their customers using data to offset how much they stood to lose as voice revenue declines , said ms rangarajan .
" operators can see the data average return per user -lrb- arpu -rrb- grow and that 's compelling and that 's a driver , " she said .
statistics gathered by novarra show that open web browsing boosts data downloads from an average of 0.18 megabytes per day to 0.6 .
operators had started to realise too that , for many , the mobile phone is the gadget they carry with them all day and may become the preferred way to access the net .
" there 's a huge population of people that are not sitting in front of a computer all day , " she said .
getting more people to use the web on their phone also helped drive them to spend more money on the portals operators have created , she said .
customers that use the mobile net also make much more use of the portals that operators run .
" if you 're now starting to look at your telephone rather than put it to your ear there 's more chance you 're going to start interacting with what 's offered via the portal , " said ms rangarajan .
" and that could go far beyond games , ringtones , screensavers and wallpapers . "
having people look at their phones means they become mobile billboards and potential sites to serve up adverts - yet another way for the operators to recoup some cash .
but , she said , operators had to be careful about how they made use of what they knew about customers and how they served up adverts .
" the potential for doing it wrong is so much more apparent , " she said .
