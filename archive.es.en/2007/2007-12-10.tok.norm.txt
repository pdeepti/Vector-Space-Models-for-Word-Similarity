program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 10.12.2007 sarkozy forced to defend gadhafi visit as france revolts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was taken aback by the strong reaction to gadhafi 's visit to france french president nicolas sarkozy on monday , dec .
10 , fiercely defended moammar gadhafi , shortly after the libyan leader began a controversial five-day visit to france . " today , france is welcoming a head of state who decided definitively to renounce weapons of mass destruction , " sarkozy told journalists after a one-hour meeting with gadhafi at the elysee palace .
" france is welcoming a head of state who definitively renounced terrorism .
a head of state who has compensated the victims " of libyan state-sponsored terrorist acts .
the french president added that libya wanted to become a full-fledged member of the international community .
" it is my deepest conviction that france must speak with all those who want to be integrated in the international community , " he said .
apparently unfazed by the controversy that preceded his arrival in paris monday afternoon , a smiling gadhafi shook hands with sarkozy and waved to journalists .
gadhafi 's first official visit to france in 34 years has provoked an angry debate in france , with even members of sarkozy 's government openly critical of the visit .
in an interview published monday in the daily le parisien , junior minister for human rights rama yade fiercely criticized the date of the visit , which begins on international human rights day , and said she would not take part in the state dinner sarkozy was hosting for gadhafi later monday .
human rights minister scolded by sarkozy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy first reached out to gadhafi in libya in july " the choice of this is a strong symbol , i would even say scandalously strong , " yade told the daily .
" colonel gadhafi must understand that our country is not a doormat on which a leader , terrorist or not , can clean his bloody feet of their infamy . "
her comments apparently displeased sarkozy .
yade was summoned to the elysee palace and chided for her frankness .
she said after the meeting with the president that her comments had been taken out of context and " caricatured " and that she was not , " in principle , " against gadhafi 's visit .
however , the french people apparently agree with yade 's original stance .
according to a poll made public on monday by the weekly paris match , nearly two of three french adults are opposed to gadhafi 's visit .
foreign minister says trusting libya is a risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner made his feelings known in no uncertain terms yade also received backing for her comments from foreign minister bernard kouchner , a well-known campaigner for human rights .
" she was right to speak as she did , " kouchner told france inter radio on monday .
kouchner also appeared to distance himself from the visit , adding that he was " resigned " to gadhafi coming to france and hoped that it would help speed up the " evolution " in libya .
in an opinion piece published monday in the daily la croix , kouchner described the high-wire act gadhafi 's visit has forced him - and france - to perform .
" no question of forgetting the name of the victims imputed to him , " he said .
" no question of forgetting their sufferings .
gadhafi has abandoned weapons of mass destruction and renounced terrorism for his country .
should we believe him and renew relations with libya ?
it 's a risk , but we will keep our eyes open . "
ex-presidential candidates weigh in with criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidential rivals bayrou and royal agreed on gadhafi meanwhile , the centrist former presidential candidate francois bayrou told rmc radio on monday that the libyan leader was a " bloody dictator " and that he would not take part in the diplomatic reception for him .
on sunday , former socialist party presidential candidate segolene royal said sarkozy was " trampling on france 's human rights tradition , " and told canal plus television that it was " heinous , shocking and even unacceptable " that france gave backing to " a system of torture in prison . "
apparently shaken by the controversy , sarkozy also defended his own human rights record , saying that he and his government had liberated the bulgarian nurses who had been sentenced to death by a libyan court for infecting children with aids .
" france liberated them , " sarkozy said .
" i demanded it and i obtained it . "
he also noted that he was the only french president to openly demand , at a press conference in beijing , that china outlaw the death penalty .
sarkozy noted that gadhafi would sign contracts later monday totaling about 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- .
these deals would involve a nuclear reactor for a seawater desalinization plant , a variety of armaments and other economic contracts , the french president said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with germany preparing for the european championships in austria and switzerland next june , löw is keen to have at least one of his goalkeepers playing regularly in the run up to the tournament .
lehmann has been replaced by spaniard manuel almunia at arsenal and has only played three times for the first team all season .
timo hildebrand , germany 's number two keeper , is in a similar situation at valencia where he has been struggling to hold down a place since his summer move to spain from stuttgart .
löw has made it clear that 38-year-old lehmann must ascertain what his chances of winning back his place in the arsenal side are before the germany coach holds talks with his number one over the christmas break . germany coach fretting over benched keepers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw intends to discuss lehmann 's future at christmas " wenger and jens are both people who have done a great deal for arsenal , " löw told german sports agency sid .
" they should be able to discuss the matter and get a better understanding of the situation .
it is crucial jens has a concrete understanding of what is going on and is not trying to guess . "
after suffering an elbow and achilles tendon injury in september , lehmann has been unable to win his place back between the posts from almunia , a situation that worries löw .
" naturally , it is important a player has regular games , so he can stay sharp and get into a rhythm , " the germany coach added .
lehmann has been linked with a return to the bundesliga during the winter break , with vfl wolfsburg expressing their interest in the former borussia dortmund stopper .
while lehmann himself has given no indication that he wants to leave arsenal , he has consistently made comments about his situation at the north london club during his time on the sidelines , leading to a rift with his rival almunia and angering his employers .
arsenal boss dismisses wolves interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenger wo n't sell lehmann despite the goalie 's criticism despite lehmann 's vocal displeasure , arsenal boss wenger has dismissed rumors linking his unsettled goalkeeper with a return to his native germany in the january transfer window .
" it 's not true , " wenger said .
" it 's only newspaper talk because nothing concrete has been discussed between me and jens and nothing between me and wolfsburg . at the moment i do not want to speculate on any movement in the transfer window .
we want to focus on our games and jens is part of that . "
back in germany , both oliver bierhoff , the national team 's general manager , and former number one oliver kahn have urged lehmann to switch clubs in january if he wants to keep his euro 2008 dreams alive .
quit now to keep dream alive , say bierhoff and kahn " looking ahead at euro 2008 it is certainly important that we have a goalkeeper who plays all the time .
should that not be the case , i would advise him to look for a new club during the winter break where he can play continuously , " bierhoff said in october .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn and lehmann have been bitter rivals for years kahn , who lost his place in the national team to lehmann before the 2006 world cup , recently told his bitter rival to quit arsenal for the sake of his international career , should the future in london remain bleak .
" jens lehmann 's services to the national team have been impeccable , but you ca n't play in a european championship when you are not in the team , " kahn told dsf television .

10 , fiercely defended moammar gadhafi , shortly after the libyan leader began a controversial five-day visit to france . " today , france is welcoming a head of state who decided definitively to renounce weapons of mass destruction , " sarkozy told journalists after a one-hour meeting with gadhafi at the elysee palace .
" france is welcoming a head of state who definitively renounced terrorism .
a head of state who has compensated the victims " of libyan state-sponsored terrorist acts .
the french president added that libya wanted to become a full-fledged member of the international community .
" it is my deepest conviction that france must speak with all those who want to be integrated in the international community , " he said .
apparently unfazed by the controversy that preceded his arrival in paris monday afternoon , a smiling gadhafi shook hands with sarkozy and waved to journalists .
gadhafi 's first official visit to france in 34 years has provoked an angry debate in france , with even members of sarkozy 's government openly critical of the visit .
in an interview published monday in the daily le parisien , junior minister for human rights rama yade fiercely criticized the date of the visit , which begins on international human rights day , and said she would not take part in the state dinner sarkozy was hosting for gadhafi later monday .
human rights minister scolded by sarkozy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy first reached out to gadhafi in libya in july " the choice of this is a strong symbol , i would even say scandalously strong , " yade told the daily .
" colonel gadhafi must understand that our country is not a doormat on which a leader , terrorist or not , can clean his bloody feet of their infamy . "
her comments apparently displeased sarkozy .
yade was summoned to the elysee palace and chided for her frankness .
she said after the meeting with the president that her comments had been taken out of context and " caricatured " and that she was not , " in principle , " against gadhafi 's visit .
however , the french people apparently agree with yade 's original stance .
according to a poll made public on monday by the weekly paris match , nearly two of three french adults are opposed to gadhafi 's visit .
foreign minister says trusting libya is a risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner made his feelings known in no uncertain terms yade also received backing for her comments from foreign minister bernard kouchner , a well-known campaigner for human rights .
" she was right to speak as she did , " kouchner told france inter radio on monday .
kouchner also appeared to distance himself from the visit , adding that he was " resigned " to gadhafi coming to france and hoped that it would help speed up the " evolution " in libya .
in an opinion piece published monday in the daily la croix , kouchner described the high-wire act gadhafi 's visit has forced him - and france - to perform .
" no question of forgetting the name of the victims imputed to him , " he said .
" no question of forgetting their sufferings .
gadhafi has abandoned weapons of mass destruction and renounced terrorism for his country .
should we believe him and renew relations with libya ?
it 's a risk , but we will keep our eyes open . "
ex-presidential candidates weigh in with criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidential rivals bayrou and royal agreed on gadhafi meanwhile , the centrist former presidential candidate francois bayrou told rmc radio on monday that the libyan leader was a " bloody dictator " and that he would not take part in the diplomatic reception for him .
on sunday , former socialist party presidential candidate segolene royal said sarkozy was " trampling on france 's human rights tradition , " and told canal plus television that it was " heinous , shocking and even unacceptable " that france gave backing to " a system of torture in prison . "
apparently shaken by the controversy , sarkozy also defended his own human rights record , saying that he and his government had liberated the bulgarian nurses who had been sentenced to death by a libyan court for infecting children with aids .
" france liberated them , " sarkozy said .
" i demanded it and i obtained it . "
he also noted that he was the only french president to openly demand , at a press conference in beijing , that china outlaw the death penalty .
sarkozy noted that gadhafi would sign contracts later monday totaling about 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- .
these deals would involve a nuclear reactor for a seawater desalinization plant , a variety of armaments and other economic contracts , the french president said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" today , france is welcoming a head of state who decided definitively to renounce weapons of mass destruction , " sarkozy told journalists after a one-hour meeting with gadhafi at the elysee palace .
" france is welcoming a head of state who definitively renounced terrorism .
a head of state who has compensated the victims " of libyan state-sponsored terrorist acts .
the french president added that libya wanted to become a full-fledged member of the international community .
" it is my deepest conviction that france must speak with all those who want to be integrated in the international community , " he said .
apparently unfazed by the controversy that preceded his arrival in paris monday afternoon , a smiling gadhafi shook hands with sarkozy and waved to journalists .
gadhafi 's first official visit to france in 34 years has provoked an angry debate in france , with even members of sarkozy 's government openly critical of the visit .
in an interview published monday in the daily le parisien , junior minister for human rights rama yade fiercely criticized the date of the visit , which begins on international human rights day , and said she would not take part in the state dinner sarkozy was hosting for gadhafi later monday .
human rights minister scolded by sarkozy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy first reached out to gadhafi in libya in july " the choice of this is a strong symbol , i would even say scandalously strong , " yade told the daily .
" colonel gadhafi must understand that our country is not a doormat on which a leader , terrorist or not , can clean his bloody feet of their infamy . "
her comments apparently displeased sarkozy .
yade was summoned to the elysee palace and chided for her frankness .
she said after the meeting with the president that her comments had been taken out of context and " caricatured " and that she was not , " in principle , " against gadhafi 's visit .
however , the french people apparently agree with yade 's original stance .

" she was right to speak as she did , " kouchner told france inter radio on monday .
kouchner also appeared to distance himself from the visit , adding that he was " resigned " to gadhafi coming to france and hoped that it would help speed up the " evolution " in libya .
in an opinion piece published monday in the daily la croix , kouchner described the high-wire act gadhafi 's visit has forced him - and france - to perform .
" no question of forgetting the name of the victims imputed to him , " he said .
" no question of forgetting their sufferings .
gadhafi has abandoned weapons of mass destruction and renounced terrorism for his country .

on sunday , former socialist party presidential candidate segolene royal said sarkozy was " trampling on france 's human rights tradition , " and told canal plus television that it was " heinous , shocking and even unacceptable " that france gave backing to " a system of torture in prison . "
apparently shaken by the controversy , sarkozy also defended his own human rights record , saying that he and his government had liberated the bulgarian nurses who had been sentenced to death by a libyan court for infecting children with aids .
" france liberated them , " sarkozy said .
" i demanded it and i obtained it . "
he also noted that he was the only french president to openly demand , at a press conference in beijing , that china outlaw the death penalty .

the fact that medvedev 's not a member of putin 's party makes it even more likely that he 'll become russia 's next leader . " i fully support this candidacy , " putin on monday , dec .
10 , was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency after four parties , headed by the ruling united russia , named medvedev as their candidate .
" as far as the candidacy of medvedev is concerned , i have known him for more than 17 years , i have worked with him closely all these years , and i completely and fully support this candidacy , " putin said in video footage shown on state television .
putin will step down following the march 2 presidential elections after serving two consecutive terms .
while there is no clear favorite in the race to replace him , it is expected that any candidate which has putin 's endorsement will go on to win the election .
despite the rise through the ranks of fellow first deputy prime minister sergei ivanov and the appointment of the little-known finance expert viktor zubkov as prime minister in september , medvedev is now seen as the front runner for the presidency after gaining putin 's official endorsement .
putin 's announcement ends months of speculation fuelled by the president 's erratic promotions and random praise of members of his retinue .
medvedev set to be pro-kremlin parties ' candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev stands to gain four presidential nominations medvedev , who chairs energy giant gazprom 's supervisory board , has an extra advantage in addition to that .

the four parties are set to officially announce medvedev as their candidate for the presidential elections at their upcoming party congresses .
a lawyer by trade , medvedev is a kremlin insider seen as a staunch putin loyalist , owing his rise to power to the incumbent president who hired him in the early 1990s to work on his staff at the saint petersburg local government .
he served as putin 's campaign manager for his successful 2000 election run and was rewarded for his services first with the position of presidential chief of staff and then the post at gazprom .
medvedev also heads the kremlin 's " national projects , " a program created to use russia 's massive profits from energy sales to rebuild crumbling infrastructure and social support system .

unlike putin , medvedev has no known connections with the kgb , but is considered a top player within the saint petersburg clan that dominates the upper echelons of power .
with his in-depth knowledge of the bureaucracy , medvedev is credited with having helped build the pyramid of power that has contributed to securing putin 's position at the top .

what was your impression of the first week ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has said it 's ready to discuss climate goals , bals said christoph bals : there was one really big shift in the position of the rapidly developing countries , mainly in china .
this was very constructive .
it was just two years ago that china said that only in the second half of the century would they be ready to negotiate seriously about commitments , and now they seem to be ready to start with these negotiations .
this was a very constructive spirit from china and also from other rapidly developing countries , like mexico , like south africa and like brazil . the united states produces the most greenhouse gas emissions , and is one of the only industrial countries that has not ratified the kyoto protocol .
in the past the us has tried to block negotiations .
is that true this year as well ? they are not really blocking negotiations at the moment , but they are still trying to start a parallel process for voluntary action .
this would undermine the entire process .
they want to have major conferences next year just to discuss this issue of voluntary activities .
this is one way of blocking without really blocking the negotiations . the united states says it wants to meet with the top industrial nations to discuss technology transfer to developing countries .
is n't this an important issue ? it is an extremely important issue .
that is why it should be a strong part of the un framework convention on climate change agenda .
we need a legally binding framework and we need a strong incentive structure for this technology transfer .
there is no reason why this could n't happen .
but i do n't think we need an additional process for technology transfer . people have different expectations for bali .
some are saying the least common denominator would be agreement on a timeline for a roadmap for setting up a new climate change protocol by 2009 .
what do you think the next week will bring ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knowing what exact steps to take next will be key to slowing climate change , bals said we definitely need a roadmap , and we need a strong mandate for the roadmap , so we know what direction it is going in .
but this must be ambitious , which means that we need some targets for 2020 .
we need an agreement that the peak of climate emissions should be between 2015 and 2020 to prevent global climate change .
parts of this ambitious roadmap are also technology transfer , a clear concept for avoided deforestation , and the future of the emissions trading system . but what we need now are first steps showing that we want to start with concrete steps .
i think we will have pilot projects in the forestry field of how we want to prevent deforestation . you are saying that topics like avoided deforestation , or including airline emissions and transportation in general into a post-kyoto protocol , will be touched on here , but will not go into a bali agreement ? we will not get a bali agreement , we will get a bali mandate - that is what we are hoping for .
anybody who wants a bali agreement does n't take seriously the fact that we want a great transformation of society , and this ca n't be organized in a 14-day conference .
we need 10 conferences in the next two years to organize this .
what we need now is a strong mandate , so that we can begin to negotiate with all relevant actors .
that is my hope for the end of this week . interview : kateri jochum , bali , indonesia send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the fact that medvedev 's not a member of putin 's party makes it even more likely that he 'll become russia 's next leader . " i fully support this candidacy , " putin on monday , dec .
10 , was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency after four parties , headed by the ruling united russia , named medvedev as their candidate .
" as far as the candidacy of medvedev is concerned , i have known him for more than 17 years , i have worked with him closely all these years , and i completely and fully support this candidacy , " putin said in video footage shown on state television .
putin will step down following the march 2 presidential elections after serving two consecutive terms .
while there is no clear favorite in the race to replace him , it is expected that any candidate which has putin 's endorsement will go on to win the election .
despite the rise through the ranks of fellow first deputy prime minister sergei ivanov and the appointment of the little-known finance expert viktor zubkov as prime minister in september , medvedev is now seen as the front runner for the presidency after gaining putin 's official endorsement .
putin 's announcement ends months of speculation fuelled by the president 's erratic promotions and random praise of members of his retinue .
medvedev set to be pro-kremlin parties ' candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev stands to gain four presidential nominations medvedev , who chairs energy giant gazprom 's supervisory board , has an extra advantage in addition to that .
as he is not affiliated with any party he can be nominated by all four pro-kremlin political parties - united russia , a just russia , a civil front and the agrarian party - as their candidate .
the four parties are set to officially announce medvedev as their candidate for the presidential elections at their upcoming party congresses .
a lawyer by trade , medvedev is a kremlin insider seen as a staunch putin loyalist , owing his rise to power to the incumbent president who hired him in the early 1990s to work on his staff at the saint petersburg local government .
he served as putin 's campaign manager for his successful 2000 election run and was rewarded for his services first with the position of presidential chief of staff and then the post at gazprom .
medvedev also heads the kremlin 's " national projects , " a program created to use russia 's massive profits from energy sales to rebuild crumbling infrastructure and social support system .
putin 's heir apparent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev contributed to putin 's rise to power medvedev 's appointment as first deputy prime minister in charge of national projects in health , education and housing in november 2005 first started the rumors that putin had chosen his heir apparent .

even if you 're not a great fan of feathered fowl or fruit-baring trees , surely the thought is what counts ? but what if your true love is a soccer club and on the first day of christmas it gives you the mocking grin of a fierce rival ?
would you still be so graceful in receiving this gift ?
or would you be looking for a largely flightless bird to stick where the christmas sun do n't shine ?
this was the dilemma facing a supporter of german soccer club schalke 04 recently .
passionate schalke fan tobias meier joyfully opened the first door of his treasured club advent calendar expecting a chocolate treat and instead received the beaming visage of werder bremen 's midfielder diego .
schalke santa hid the terrible truth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's fans did n't react well to the bremen surprise if the shock of finding the brazilian nemesis of your beloved team behind door no. 1 was n't enough , tobias discovered this was not an isolated case .
his father peter also had the same problem with the calendar , which sported a picture of santa claus in the team 's royal blue uniform on the front .
after recovering from the shock , the meiers investigated further with the help of the club authorities and found out that a mistake at the italian printers meant roughly 40 of the 40,000 schalke calendars were printed with pictures of bremen stars inside .
" we were totally shocked , " tobias told german tabloid bild .
" we immediately opened the other doors and found there were bremen stars behind every window - it was n't the surprise i was expecting . "
both schalke and bremen had their club calendars made at the same printers near milan which led to the mix-up .
cut-price calendars not flying off the shelves schalke 's club shop in gelsenkirchen has now reduced the remaining advent gifts bearing the wrong pictures from 2.95 euros -lrb- $ 4.30 -rrb- to 1.45 euros , but , unsurprisingly , there are few takers for the tainted calendars even at a knock-down price .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : möller does n't expect any bremen stars under the tree the firm who printed the calendars is offering to swap any bearing the mistake and schalke manager andreas möller has issued a reassurance to worried fans .
" it 's no problem , " he said tongue firmly planted in cheek , " it 's not as though anyone will find a werder bremen player under their christmas tree . "

with germany preparing for the european championships in austria and switzerland next june , löw is keen to have at least one of his goalkeepers playing regularly in the run up to the tournament .
lehmann has been replaced by spaniard manuel almunia at arsenal and has only played three times for the first team all season .
timo hildebrand , germany 's number two keeper , is in a similar situation at valencia where he has been struggling to hold down a place since his summer move to spain from stuttgart .
löw has made it clear that 38-year-old lehmann must ascertain what his chances of winning back his place in the arsenal side are before the germany coach holds talks with his number one over the christmas break . germany coach fretting over benched keepers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw intends to discuss lehmann 's future at christmas " wenger and jens are both people who have done a great deal for arsenal , " löw told german sports agency sid .
" they should be able to discuss the matter and get a better understanding of the situation .
it is crucial jens has a concrete understanding of what is going on and is not trying to guess . "
after suffering an elbow and achilles tendon injury in september , lehmann has been unable to win his place back between the posts from almunia , a situation that worries löw .
" naturally , it is important a player has regular games , so he can stay sharp and get into a rhythm , " the germany coach added .
lehmann has been linked with a return to the bundesliga during the winter break , with vfl wolfsburg expressing their interest in the former borussia dortmund stopper .
while lehmann himself has given no indication that he wants to leave arsenal , he has consistently made comments about his situation at the north london club during his time on the sidelines , leading to a rift with his rival almunia and angering his employers .

back in germany , both oliver bierhoff , the national team 's general manager , and former number one oliver kahn have urged lehmann to switch clubs in january if he wants to keep his euro 2008 dreams alive .
quit now to keep dream alive , say bierhoff and kahn " looking ahead at euro 2008 it is certainly important that we have a goalkeeper who plays all the time .
should that not be the case , i would advise him to look for a new club during the winter break where he can play continuously , " bierhoff said in october .

the fact that medvedev 's not a member of putin 's party makes it even more likely that he 'll become russia 's next leader . " i fully support this candidacy , " putin on monday , dec .
10 , was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency after four parties , headed by the ruling united russia , named medvedev as their candidate .
" as far as the candidacy of medvedev is concerned , i have known him for more than 17 years , i have worked with him closely all these years , and i completely and fully support this candidacy , " putin said in video footage shown on state television .
putin will step down following the march 2 presidential elections after serving two consecutive terms .
while there is no clear favorite in the race to replace him , it is expected that any candidate which has putin 's endorsement will go on to win the election .
despite the rise through the ranks of fellow first deputy prime minister sergei ivanov and the appointment of the little-known finance expert viktor zubkov as prime minister in september , medvedev is now seen as the front runner for the presidency after gaining putin 's official endorsement .

the four parties are set to officially announce medvedev as their candidate for the presidential elections at their upcoming party congresses .
a lawyer by trade , medvedev is a kremlin insider seen as a staunch putin loyalist , owing his rise to power to the incumbent president who hired him in the early 1990s to work on his staff at the saint petersburg local government .
he served as putin 's campaign manager for his successful 2000 election run and was rewarded for his services first with the position of presidential chief of staff and then the post at gazprom .

10 , the eu , the us and russia said further talks over kosovo 's status would be superfluous .
the serbian province could declare independence any time . key european powers and the united states are gearing up to recognize kosovo as an independent state , while serbia , backed by russia , has said it will never accept a self-ruling kosovo . in response to the deadlock , the so-called kosovo troika - made up of the eu , the us and russia - ended four months of un-initiated talks on friday by concluding that negotiations had failed . us secretary of state condoleezza rice has also made it clear that it is too late for negotiations on kosovo 's future status - a stance that her russian counterpart sergei lavrov criticized on the weekend as being the biggest obstacle to a solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's ethnic albanian parties are united in their calls for independence " neither party was willing to cede its position on the fundamental question of sovereignty over kosovo , " the troika report said .
" this is regrettable , as a negotiated settlement is in the best interests of both parties . " the mediators said the two sides did find some issues they could agree on and promised to work together on reconciliation , even if they could n't break through on the big question of kosovo 's status . kosovo 's albanian majority appealed to the west on sunday to back their bid for independence .
a joint statement from government and opposition leaders said : " the people of kosovo urgently need clarity about their future . " the eu 's foreign ministers will meet behind closed doors on monday with the eu envoy to the kosovo talks , wolfgang ischinger , to discuss ways to prevent violence in the case that kosovo albanians declare independence . eu letter reveals bloc 's internal divide in a separate letter addressed to the european union member states , germany , france , britain and italy said that continuing talks would be pointless . diplomats said that the letter was intended for those countries in the bloc that continue to advocate further talks , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper reported . romania , slovakia and spain have been hesitant to back independence for kosovo due to fears that the move would encourage their own ethnic minorities to break away .
cyprus , which is divided into a greek and internationally unrecognized turkish portion , has also found the one-sidedness of the kosovo independence proposal hard to swallow , as has greece . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger said the troika did everything " humanly possible " to negotiate a deal " it 's regrettable that the eu member states , due to their respective domestic situations , have reached different conclusions , " the eu 's coordinator for the stability pact for south-eastern europe , erhard busek , told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
" the different positions of eu states on the issue of kosovo 's status invite russia and china to interfere . " solana : kosovo 's future is in the eu leaders of the 27-nation bloc are to confirm the impasse in a statement at a summit this coming friday , diplomats told reuters news agency . they are also expected to verify their willingness to dispatch police and justice missions and appoint a high representative to oversee kosovo if asked to by the kosovo-albanian government and the united nations . " it is clear that the future of serbia and kosovo lies in the european union .
that 's something that both sides agree on , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in an interview with germany 's welt am sonntag newspaper . the un security council is due to discuss the kosovo troika 's report on dec .

10 , fiercely defended moammar gadhafi , shortly after the libyan leader began a controversial five-day visit to france . " today , france is welcoming a head of state who decided definitively to renounce weapons of mass destruction , " sarkozy told journalists after a one-hour meeting with gadhafi at the elysee palace .
" france is welcoming a head of state who definitively renounced terrorism .
a head of state who has compensated the victims " of libyan state-sponsored terrorist acts .
the french president added that libya wanted to become a full-fledged member of the international community .
" it is my deepest conviction that france must speak with all those who want to be integrated in the international community , " he said .
apparently unfazed by the controversy that preceded his arrival in paris monday afternoon , a smiling gadhafi shook hands with sarkozy and waved to journalists .
gadhafi 's first official visit to france in 34 years has provoked an angry debate in france , with even members of sarkozy 's government openly critical of the visit .
in an interview published monday in the daily le parisien , junior minister for human rights rama yade fiercely criticized the date of the visit , which begins on international human rights day , and said she would not take part in the state dinner sarkozy was hosting for gadhafi later monday .
human rights minister scolded by sarkozy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy first reached out to gadhafi in libya in july " the choice of this is a strong symbol , i would even say scandalously strong , " yade told the daily .
" colonel gadhafi must understand that our country is not a doormat on which a leader , terrorist or not , can clean his bloody feet of their infamy . "
her comments apparently displeased sarkozy .
yade was summoned to the elysee palace and chided for her frankness .
she said after the meeting with the president that her comments had been taken out of context and " caricatured " and that she was not , " in principle , " against gadhafi 's visit .
however , the french people apparently agree with yade 's original stance .
according to a poll made public on monday by the weekly paris match , nearly two of three french adults are opposed to gadhafi 's visit .
foreign minister says trusting libya is a risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner made his feelings known in no uncertain terms yade also received backing for her comments from foreign minister bernard kouchner , a well-known campaigner for human rights .
" she was right to speak as she did , " kouchner told france inter radio on monday .
kouchner also appeared to distance himself from the visit , adding that he was " resigned " to gadhafi coming to france and hoped that it would help speed up the " evolution " in libya .
in an opinion piece published monday in the daily la croix , kouchner described the high-wire act gadhafi 's visit has forced him - and france - to perform .
" no question of forgetting the name of the victims imputed to him , " he said .
" no question of forgetting their sufferings .
gadhafi has abandoned weapons of mass destruction and renounced terrorism for his country .
should we believe him and renew relations with libya ?
it 's a risk , but we will keep our eyes open . "
ex-presidential candidates weigh in with criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidential rivals bayrou and royal agreed on gadhafi meanwhile , the centrist former presidential candidate francois bayrou told rmc radio on monday that the libyan leader was a " bloody dictator " and that he would not take part in the diplomatic reception for him .
on sunday , former socialist party presidential candidate segolene royal said sarkozy was " trampling on france 's human rights tradition , " and told canal plus television that it was " heinous , shocking and even unacceptable " that france gave backing to " a system of torture in prison . "
apparently shaken by the controversy , sarkozy also defended his own human rights record , saying that he and his government had liberated the bulgarian nurses who had been sentenced to death by a libyan court for infecting children with aids .
" france liberated them , " sarkozy said .
" i demanded it and i obtained it . "
he also noted that he was the only french president to openly demand , at a press conference in beijing , that china outlaw the death penalty .
sarkozy noted that gadhafi would sign contracts later monday totaling about 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- .
these deals would involve a nuclear reactor for a seawater desalinization plant , a variety of armaments and other economic contracts , the french president said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 , the eu , the us and russia said further talks over kosovo 's status would be superfluous .
the serbian province could declare independence any time . key european powers and the united states are gearing up to recognize kosovo as an independent state , while serbia , backed by russia , has said it will never accept a self-ruling kosovo . in response to the deadlock , the so-called kosovo troika - made up of the eu , the us and russia - ended four months of un-initiated talks on friday by concluding that negotiations had failed . us secretary of state condoleezza rice has also made it clear that it is too late for negotiations on kosovo 's future status - a stance that her russian counterpart sergei lavrov criticized on the weekend as being the biggest obstacle to a solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's ethnic albanian parties are united in their calls for independence " neither party was willing to cede its position on the fundamental question of sovereignty over kosovo , " the troika report said .
" this is regrettable , as a negotiated settlement is in the best interests of both parties . " the mediators said the two sides did find some issues they could agree on and promised to work together on reconciliation , even if they could n't break through on the big question of kosovo 's status . kosovo 's albanian majority appealed to the west on sunday to back their bid for independence .
a joint statement from government and opposition leaders said : " the people of kosovo urgently need clarity about their future . " the eu 's foreign ministers will meet behind closed doors on monday with the eu envoy to the kosovo talks , wolfgang ischinger , to discuss ways to prevent violence in the case that kosovo albanians declare independence . eu letter reveals bloc 's internal divide in a separate letter addressed to the european union member states , germany , france , britain and italy said that continuing talks would be pointless . diplomats said that the letter was intended for those countries in the bloc that continue to advocate further talks , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper reported . romania , slovakia and spain have been hesitant to back independence for kosovo due to fears that the move would encourage their own ethnic minorities to break away .
cyprus , which is divided into a greek and internationally unrecognized turkish portion , has also found the one-sidedness of the kosovo independence proposal hard to swallow , as has greece . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger said the troika did everything " humanly possible " to negotiate a deal " it 's regrettable that the eu member states , due to their respective domestic situations , have reached different conclusions , " the eu 's coordinator for the stability pact for south-eastern europe , erhard busek , told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
" the different positions of eu states on the issue of kosovo 's status invite russia and china to interfere . " solana : kosovo 's future is in the eu leaders of the 27-nation bloc are to confirm the impasse in a statement at a summit this coming friday , diplomats told reuters news agency . they are also expected to verify their willingness to dispatch police and justice missions and appoint a high representative to oversee kosovo if asked to by the kosovo-albanian government and the united nations . " it is clear that the future of serbia and kosovo lies in the european union .
that 's something that both sides agree on , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in an interview with germany 's welt am sonntag newspaper . the un security council is due to discuss the kosovo troika 's report on dec .

" naturally , it is important a player has regular games , so he can stay sharp and get into a rhythm , " the germany coach added .
lehmann has been linked with a return to the bundesliga during the winter break , with vfl wolfsburg expressing their interest in the former borussia dortmund stopper .

" it 's only newspaper talk because nothing concrete has been discussed between me and jens and nothing between me and wolfsburg . at the moment i do not want to speculate on any movement in the transfer window .
we want to focus on our games and jens is part of that . "
back in germany , both oliver bierhoff , the national team 's general manager , and former number one oliver kahn have urged lehmann to switch clubs in january if he wants to keep his euro 2008 dreams alive .
quit now to keep dream alive , say bierhoff and kahn " looking ahead at euro 2008 it is certainly important that we have a goalkeeper who plays all the time .

10 , the eu , the us and russia said further talks over kosovo 's status would be superfluous .
the serbian province could declare independence any time . key european powers and the united states are gearing up to recognize kosovo as an independent state , while serbia , backed by russia , has said it will never accept a self-ruling kosovo . in response to the deadlock , the so-called kosovo troika - made up of the eu , the us and russia - ended four months of un-initiated talks on friday by concluding that negotiations had failed . us secretary of state condoleezza rice has also made it clear that it is too late for negotiations on kosovo 's future status - a stance that her russian counterpart sergei lavrov criticized on the weekend as being the biggest obstacle to a solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's ethnic albanian parties are united in their calls for independence " neither party was willing to cede its position on the fundamental question of sovereignty over kosovo , " the troika report said .
" this is regrettable , as a negotiated settlement is in the best interests of both parties . " the mediators said the two sides did find some issues they could agree on and promised to work together on reconciliation , even if they could n't break through on the big question of kosovo 's status . kosovo 's albanian majority appealed to the west on sunday to back their bid for independence .
a joint statement from government and opposition leaders said : " the people of kosovo urgently need clarity about their future . " the eu 's foreign ministers will meet behind closed doors on monday with the eu envoy to the kosovo talks , wolfgang ischinger , to discuss ways to prevent violence in the case that kosovo albanians declare independence . eu letter reveals bloc 's internal divide in a separate letter addressed to the european union member states , germany , france , britain and italy said that continuing talks would be pointless . diplomats said that the letter was intended for those countries in the bloc that continue to advocate further talks , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper reported . romania , slovakia and spain have been hesitant to back independence for kosovo due to fears that the move would encourage their own ethnic minorities to break away .
cyprus , which is divided into a greek and internationally unrecognized turkish portion , has also found the one-sidedness of the kosovo independence proposal hard to swallow , as has greece . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger said the troika did everything " humanly possible " to negotiate a deal " it 's regrettable that the eu member states , due to their respective domestic situations , have reached different conclusions , " the eu 's coordinator for the stability pact for south-eastern europe , erhard busek , told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
" the different positions of eu states on the issue of kosovo 's status invite russia and china to interfere . " solana : kosovo 's future is in the eu leaders of the 27-nation bloc are to confirm the impasse in a statement at a summit this coming friday , diplomats told reuters news agency . they are also expected to verify their willingness to dispatch police and justice missions and appoint a high representative to oversee kosovo if asked to by the kosovo-albanian government and the united nations . " it is clear that the future of serbia and kosovo lies in the european union .
that 's something that both sides agree on , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in an interview with germany 's welt am sonntag newspaper . the un security council is due to discuss the kosovo troika 's report on dec .

what was your impression of the first week ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has said it 's ready to discuss climate goals , bals said christoph bals : there was one really big shift in the position of the rapidly developing countries , mainly in china .
this was very constructive .
it was just two years ago that china said that only in the second half of the century would they be ready to negotiate seriously about commitments , and now they seem to be ready to start with these negotiations .
this was a very constructive spirit from china and also from other rapidly developing countries , like mexico , like south africa and like brazil . the united states produces the most greenhouse gas emissions , and is one of the only industrial countries that has not ratified the kyoto protocol .
in the past the us has tried to block negotiations .
is that true this year as well ? they are not really blocking negotiations at the moment , but they are still trying to start a parallel process for voluntary action .
this would undermine the entire process .
they want to have major conferences next year just to discuss this issue of voluntary activities .
this is one way of blocking without really blocking the negotiations . the united states says it wants to meet with the top industrial nations to discuss technology transfer to developing countries .
is n't this an important issue ? it is an extremely important issue .
that is why it should be a strong part of the un framework convention on climate change agenda .
we need a legally binding framework and we need a strong incentive structure for this technology transfer .
there is no reason why this could n't happen .
but i do n't think we need an additional process for technology transfer . people have different expectations for bali .
some are saying the least common denominator would be agreement on a timeline for a roadmap for setting up a new climate change protocol by 2009 .
what do you think the next week will bring ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knowing what exact steps to take next will be key to slowing climate change , bals said we definitely need a roadmap , and we need a strong mandate for the roadmap , so we know what direction it is going in .
but this must be ambitious , which means that we need some targets for 2020 .
we need an agreement that the peak of climate emissions should be between 2015 and 2020 to prevent global climate change .
parts of this ambitious roadmap are also technology transfer , a clear concept for avoided deforestation , and the future of the emissions trading system . but what we need now are first steps showing that we want to start with concrete steps .
i think we will have pilot projects in the forestry field of how we want to prevent deforestation . you are saying that topics like avoided deforestation , or including airline emissions and transportation in general into a post-kyoto protocol , will be touched on here , but will not go into a bali agreement ? we will not get a bali agreement , we will get a bali mandate - that is what we are hoping for .
anybody who wants a bali agreement does n't take seriously the fact that we want a great transformation of society , and this ca n't be organized in a 14-day conference .
we need 10 conferences in the next two years to organize this .
what we need now is a strong mandate , so that we can begin to negotiate with all relevant actors .

with germany preparing for the european championships in austria and switzerland next june , löw is keen to have at least one of his goalkeepers playing regularly in the run up to the tournament .
lehmann has been replaced by spaniard manuel almunia at arsenal and has only played three times for the first team all season .
timo hildebrand , germany 's number two keeper , is in a similar situation at valencia where he has been struggling to hold down a place since his summer move to spain from stuttgart .
löw has made it clear that 38-year-old lehmann must ascertain what his chances of winning back his place in the arsenal side are before the germany coach holds talks with his number one over the christmas break . germany coach fretting over benched keepers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw intends to discuss lehmann 's future at christmas " wenger and jens are both people who have done a great deal for arsenal , " löw told german sports agency sid .
" they should be able to discuss the matter and get a better understanding of the situation .
it is crucial jens has a concrete understanding of what is going on and is not trying to guess . "
after suffering an elbow and achilles tendon injury in september , lehmann has been unable to win his place back between the posts from almunia , a situation that worries löw .
" naturally , it is important a player has regular games , so he can stay sharp and get into a rhythm , " the germany coach added .
lehmann has been linked with a return to the bundesliga during the winter break , with vfl wolfsburg expressing their interest in the former borussia dortmund stopper .
while lehmann himself has given no indication that he wants to leave arsenal , he has consistently made comments about his situation at the north london club during his time on the sidelines , leading to a rift with his rival almunia and angering his employers .
arsenal boss dismisses wolves interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenger wo n't sell lehmann despite the goalie 's criticism despite lehmann 's vocal displeasure , arsenal boss wenger has dismissed rumors linking his unsettled goalkeeper with a return to his native germany in the january transfer window .
" it 's not true , " wenger said .
" it 's only newspaper talk because nothing concrete has been discussed between me and jens and nothing between me and wolfsburg . at the moment i do not want to speculate on any movement in the transfer window .
we want to focus on our games and jens is part of that . "
back in germany , both oliver bierhoff , the national team 's general manager , and former number one oliver kahn have urged lehmann to switch clubs in january if he wants to keep his euro 2008 dreams alive .
quit now to keep dream alive , say bierhoff and kahn " looking ahead at euro 2008 it is certainly important that we have a goalkeeper who plays all the time .
should that not be the case , i would advise him to look for a new club during the winter break where he can play continuously , " bierhoff said in october .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn and lehmann have been bitter rivals for years kahn , who lost his place in the national team to lehmann before the 2006 world cup , recently told his bitter rival to quit arsenal for the sake of his international career , should the future in london remain bleak .
" jens lehmann 's services to the national team have been impeccable , but you ca n't play in a european championship when you are not in the team , " kahn told dsf television .
" that 's why it would be best for him to go and play where he will be in the team . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what was your impression of the first week ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has said it 's ready to discuss climate goals , bals said christoph bals : there was one really big shift in the position of the rapidly developing countries , mainly in china .
this was very constructive .
it was just two years ago that china said that only in the second half of the century would they be ready to negotiate seriously about commitments , and now they seem to be ready to start with these negotiations .
this was a very constructive spirit from china and also from other rapidly developing countries , like mexico , like south africa and like brazil . the united states produces the most greenhouse gas emissions , and is one of the only industrial countries that has not ratified the kyoto protocol .
in the past the us has tried to block negotiations .
is that true this year as well ? they are not really blocking negotiations at the moment , but they are still trying to start a parallel process for voluntary action .
this would undermine the entire process .
they want to have major conferences next year just to discuss this issue of voluntary activities .
this is one way of blocking without really blocking the negotiations . the united states says it wants to meet with the top industrial nations to discuss technology transfer to developing countries .
is n't this an important issue ? it is an extremely important issue .
that is why it should be a strong part of the un framework convention on climate change agenda .
we need a legally binding framework and we need a strong incentive structure for this technology transfer .
there is no reason why this could n't happen .
but i do n't think we need an additional process for technology transfer . people have different expectations for bali .
some are saying the least common denominator would be agreement on a timeline for a roadmap for setting up a new climate change protocol by 2009 .
what do you think the next week will bring ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knowing what exact steps to take next will be key to slowing climate change , bals said we definitely need a roadmap , and we need a strong mandate for the roadmap , so we know what direction it is going in .
but this must be ambitious , which means that we need some targets for 2020 .
we need an agreement that the peak of climate emissions should be between 2015 and 2020 to prevent global climate change .
parts of this ambitious roadmap are also technology transfer , a clear concept for avoided deforestation , and the future of the emissions trading system . but what we need now are first steps showing that we want to start with concrete steps .
i think we will have pilot projects in the forestry field of how we want to prevent deforestation . you are saying that topics like avoided deforestation , or including airline emissions and transportation in general into a post-kyoto protocol , will be touched on here , but will not go into a bali agreement ? we will not get a bali agreement , we will get a bali mandate - that is what we are hoping for .
anybody who wants a bali agreement does n't take seriously the fact that we want a great transformation of society , and this ca n't be organized in a 14-day conference .
we need 10 conferences in the next two years to organize this .
what we need now is a strong mandate , so that we can begin to negotiate with all relevant actors .
that is my hope for the end of this week . interview : kateri jochum , bali , indonesia send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 , the eu , the us and russia said further talks over kosovo 's status would be superfluous .
the serbian province could declare independence any time . key european powers and the united states are gearing up to recognize kosovo as an independent state , while serbia , backed by russia , has said it will never accept a self-ruling kosovo . in response to the deadlock , the so-called kosovo troika - made up of the eu , the us and russia - ended four months of un-initiated talks on friday by concluding that negotiations had failed . us secretary of state condoleezza rice has also made it clear that it is too late for negotiations on kosovo 's future status - a stance that her russian counterpart sergei lavrov criticized on the weekend as being the biggest obstacle to a solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's ethnic albanian parties are united in their calls for independence " neither party was willing to cede its position on the fundamental question of sovereignty over kosovo , " the troika report said .
" this is regrettable , as a negotiated settlement is in the best interests of both parties . " the mediators said the two sides did find some issues they could agree on and promised to work together on reconciliation , even if they could n't break through on the big question of kosovo 's status . kosovo 's albanian majority appealed to the west on sunday to back their bid for independence .
a joint statement from government and opposition leaders said : " the people of kosovo urgently need clarity about their future . " the eu 's foreign ministers will meet behind closed doors on monday with the eu envoy to the kosovo talks , wolfgang ischinger , to discuss ways to prevent violence in the case that kosovo albanians declare independence . eu letter reveals bloc 's internal divide in a separate letter addressed to the european union member states , germany , france , britain and italy said that continuing talks would be pointless . diplomats said that the letter was intended for those countries in the bloc that continue to advocate further talks , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper reported . romania , slovakia and spain have been hesitant to back independence for kosovo due to fears that the move would encourage their own ethnic minorities to break away .
cyprus , which is divided into a greek and internationally unrecognized turkish portion , has also found the one-sidedness of the kosovo independence proposal hard to swallow , as has greece . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger said the troika did everything " humanly possible " to negotiate a deal " it 's regrettable that the eu member states , due to their respective domestic situations , have reached different conclusions , " the eu 's coordinator for the stability pact for south-eastern europe , erhard busek , told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
" the different positions of eu states on the issue of kosovo 's status invite russia and china to interfere . " solana : kosovo 's future is in the eu leaders of the 27-nation bloc are to confirm the impasse in a statement at a summit this coming friday , diplomats told reuters news agency . they are also expected to verify their willingness to dispatch police and justice missions and appoint a high representative to oversee kosovo if asked to by the kosovo-albanian government and the united nations . " it is clear that the future of serbia and kosovo lies in the european union .
that 's something that both sides agree on , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in an interview with germany 's welt am sonntag newspaper . the un security council is due to discuss the kosovo troika 's report on dec .

10 , fiercely defended moammar gadhafi , shortly after the libyan leader began a controversial five-day visit to france . " today , france is welcoming a head of state who decided definitively to renounce weapons of mass destruction , " sarkozy told journalists after a one-hour meeting with gadhafi at the elysee palace .
" france is welcoming a head of state who definitively renounced terrorism .
a head of state who has compensated the victims " of libyan state-sponsored terrorist acts .
the french president added that libya wanted to become a full-fledged member of the international community .
" it is my deepest conviction that france must speak with all those who want to be integrated in the international community , " he said .
apparently unfazed by the controversy that preceded his arrival in paris monday afternoon , a smiling gadhafi shook hands with sarkozy and waved to journalists .
gadhafi 's first official visit to france in 34 years has provoked an angry debate in france , with even members of sarkozy 's government openly critical of the visit .
in an interview published monday in the daily le parisien , junior minister for human rights rama yade fiercely criticized the date of the visit , which begins on international human rights day , and said she would not take part in the state dinner sarkozy was hosting for gadhafi later monday .
human rights minister scolded by sarkozy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy first reached out to gadhafi in libya in july " the choice of this is a strong symbol , i would even say scandalously strong , " yade told the daily .
" colonel gadhafi must understand that our country is not a doormat on which a leader , terrorist or not , can clean his bloody feet of their infamy . "
her comments apparently displeased sarkozy .
yade was summoned to the elysee palace and chided for her frankness .
she said after the meeting with the president that her comments had been taken out of context and " caricatured " and that she was not , " in principle , " against gadhafi 's visit .
however , the french people apparently agree with yade 's original stance .
according to a poll made public on monday by the weekly paris match , nearly two of three french adults are opposed to gadhafi 's visit .
foreign minister says trusting libya is a risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner made his feelings known in no uncertain terms yade also received backing for her comments from foreign minister bernard kouchner , a well-known campaigner for human rights .
" she was right to speak as she did , " kouchner told france inter radio on monday .
kouchner also appeared to distance himself from the visit , adding that he was " resigned " to gadhafi coming to france and hoped that it would help speed up the " evolution " in libya .
in an opinion piece published monday in the daily la croix , kouchner described the high-wire act gadhafi 's visit has forced him - and france - to perform .
" no question of forgetting the name of the victims imputed to him , " he said .
" no question of forgetting their sufferings .
gadhafi has abandoned weapons of mass destruction and renounced terrorism for his country .
should we believe him and renew relations with libya ?
it 's a risk , but we will keep our eyes open . "
ex-presidential candidates weigh in with criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidential rivals bayrou and royal agreed on gadhafi meanwhile , the centrist former presidential candidate francois bayrou told rmc radio on monday that the libyan leader was a " bloody dictator " and that he would not take part in the diplomatic reception for him .
on sunday , former socialist party presidential candidate segolene royal said sarkozy was " trampling on france 's human rights tradition , " and told canal plus television that it was " heinous , shocking and even unacceptable " that france gave backing to " a system of torture in prison . "
apparently shaken by the controversy , sarkozy also defended his own human rights record , saying that he and his government had liberated the bulgarian nurses who had been sentenced to death by a libyan court for infecting children with aids .
" france liberated them , " sarkozy said .
" i demanded it and i obtained it . "
he also noted that he was the only french president to openly demand , at a press conference in beijing , that china outlaw the death penalty .
sarkozy noted that gadhafi would sign contracts later monday totaling about 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- .
these deals would involve a nuclear reactor for a seawater desalinization plant , a variety of armaments and other economic contracts , the french president said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 , the eu , the us and russia said further talks over kosovo 's status would be superfluous .
the serbian province could declare independence any time . key european powers and the united states are gearing up to recognize kosovo as an independent state , while serbia , backed by russia , has said it will never accept a self-ruling kosovo . in response to the deadlock , the so-called kosovo troika - made up of the eu , the us and russia - ended four months of un-initiated talks on friday by concluding that negotiations had failed . us secretary of state condoleezza rice has also made it clear that it is too late for negotiations on kosovo 's future status - a stance that her russian counterpart sergei lavrov criticized on the weekend as being the biggest obstacle to a solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's ethnic albanian parties are united in their calls for independence " neither party was willing to cede its position on the fundamental question of sovereignty over kosovo , " the troika report said .
" this is regrettable , as a negotiated settlement is in the best interests of both parties . " the mediators said the two sides did find some issues they could agree on and promised to work together on reconciliation , even if they could n't break through on the big question of kosovo 's status . kosovo 's albanian majority appealed to the west on sunday to back their bid for independence .
a joint statement from government and opposition leaders said : " the people of kosovo urgently need clarity about their future . " the eu 's foreign ministers will meet behind closed doors on monday with the eu envoy to the kosovo talks , wolfgang ischinger , to discuss ways to prevent violence in the case that kosovo albanians declare independence . eu letter reveals bloc 's internal divide in a separate letter addressed to the european union member states , germany , france , britain and italy said that continuing talks would be pointless . diplomats said that the letter was intended for those countries in the bloc that continue to advocate further talks , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper reported . romania , slovakia and spain have been hesitant to back independence for kosovo due to fears that the move would encourage their own ethnic minorities to break away .
cyprus , which is divided into a greek and internationally unrecognized turkish portion , has also found the one-sidedness of the kosovo independence proposal hard to swallow , as has greece . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger said the troika did everything " humanly possible " to negotiate a deal " it 's regrettable that the eu member states , due to their respective domestic situations , have reached different conclusions , " the eu 's coordinator for the stability pact for south-eastern europe , erhard busek , told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
" the different positions of eu states on the issue of kosovo 's status invite russia and china to interfere . " solana : kosovo 's future is in the eu leaders of the 27-nation bloc are to confirm the impasse in a statement at a summit this coming friday , diplomats told reuters news agency . they are also expected to verify their willingness to dispatch police and justice missions and appoint a high representative to oversee kosovo if asked to by the kosovo-albanian government and the united nations . " it is clear that the future of serbia and kosovo lies in the european union .
that 's something that both sides agree on , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in an interview with germany 's welt am sonntag newspaper . the un security council is due to discuss the kosovo troika 's report on dec .

after recovering from the shock , the meiers investigated further with the help of the club authorities and found out that a mistake at the italian printers meant roughly 40 of the 40,000 schalke calendars were printed with pictures of bremen stars inside .
" we were totally shocked , " tobias told german tabloid bild .
" we immediately opened the other doors and found there were bremen stars behind every window - it was n't the surprise i was expecting . "
both schalke and bremen had their club calendars made at the same printers near milan which led to the mix-up .
cut-price calendars not flying off the shelves schalke 's club shop in gelsenkirchen has now reduced the remaining advent gifts bearing the wrong pictures from 2.95 euros -lrb- $ 4.30 -rrb- to 1.45 euros , but , unsurprisingly , there are few takers for the tainted calendars even at a knock-down price .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : möller does n't expect any bremen stars under the tree the firm who printed the calendars is offering to swap any bearing the mistake and schalke manager andreas möller has issued a reassurance to worried fans .
" it 's no problem , " he said tongue firmly planted in cheek , " it 's not as though anyone will find a werder bremen player under their christmas tree . "
given schalke 's current form and that of their rivals , maybe that would n't be such a bad thing , herr möller ! dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with germany preparing for the european championships in austria and switzerland next june , löw is keen to have at least one of his goalkeepers playing regularly in the run up to the tournament .
lehmann has been replaced by spaniard manuel almunia at arsenal and has only played three times for the first team all season .
timo hildebrand , germany 's number two keeper , is in a similar situation at valencia where he has been struggling to hold down a place since his summer move to spain from stuttgart .

it is crucial jens has a concrete understanding of what is going on and is not trying to guess . "
after suffering an elbow and achilles tendon injury in september , lehmann has been unable to win his place back between the posts from almunia , a situation that worries löw .
" naturally , it is important a player has regular games , so he can stay sharp and get into a rhythm , " the germany coach added .
lehmann has been linked with a return to the bundesliga during the winter break , with vfl wolfsburg expressing their interest in the former borussia dortmund stopper .
while lehmann himself has given no indication that he wants to leave arsenal , he has consistently made comments about his situation at the north london club during his time on the sidelines , leading to a rift with his rival almunia and angering his employers .

" it 's only newspaper talk because nothing concrete has been discussed between me and jens and nothing between me and wolfsburg . at the moment i do not want to speculate on any movement in the transfer window .
we want to focus on our games and jens is part of that . "
back in germany , both oliver bierhoff , the national team 's general manager , and former number one oliver kahn have urged lehmann to switch clubs in january if he wants to keep his euro 2008 dreams alive .
quit now to keep dream alive , say bierhoff and kahn " looking ahead at euro 2008 it is certainly important that we have a goalkeeper who plays all the time .

would you still be so graceful in receiving this gift ?
or would you be looking for a largely flightless bird to stick where the christmas sun do n't shine ?
this was the dilemma facing a supporter of german soccer club schalke 04 recently .
passionate schalke fan tobias meier joyfully opened the first door of his treasured club advent calendar expecting a chocolate treat and instead received the beaming visage of werder bremen 's midfielder diego .
schalke santa hid the terrible truth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's fans did n't react well to the bremen surprise if the shock of finding the brazilian nemesis of your beloved team behind door no. 1 was n't enough , tobias discovered this was not an isolated case .
his father peter also had the same problem with the calendar , which sported a picture of santa claus in the team 's royal blue uniform on the front .
after recovering from the shock , the meiers investigated further with the help of the club authorities and found out that a mistake at the italian printers meant roughly 40 of the 40,000 schalke calendars were printed with pictures of bremen stars inside .
" we were totally shocked , " tobias told german tabloid bild .
" we immediately opened the other doors and found there were bremen stars behind every window - it was n't the surprise i was expecting . "
both schalke and bremen had their club calendars made at the same printers near milan which led to the mix-up .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de climate -pipe- 10.12.2007 bali talks must end with clear mandate , says climate expert großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delegates need to leave bali with a clear roadmap for moving forward , one expert said as un-sponsored climate change talks enter their second week in bali , germanwatch 's christoph bals told deutsche welle progress was being made but positive change would come only at the end of a much longer process . christoph bals is the executive policy director of germanwatch , a non-profit , non-governmental initiative that addresses international issues including trade and the environment . dw-world.de : international work groups met in bali for the first week of the climate change conference and each country is here with its own agenda .
what was your impression of the first week ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has said it 's ready to discuss climate goals , bals said christoph bals : there was one really big shift in the position of the rapidly developing countries , mainly in china .
this was very constructive .
it was just two years ago that china said that only in the second half of the century would they be ready to negotiate seriously about commitments , and now they seem to be ready to start with these negotiations .
this was a very constructive spirit from china and also from other rapidly developing countries , like mexico , like south africa and like brazil . the united states produces the most greenhouse gas emissions , and is one of the only industrial countries that has not ratified the kyoto protocol .
in the past the us has tried to block negotiations .
is that true this year as well ? they are not really blocking negotiations at the moment , but they are still trying to start a parallel process for voluntary action .
this would undermine the entire process .
they want to have major conferences next year just to discuss this issue of voluntary activities .
this is one way of blocking without really blocking the negotiations . the united states says it wants to meet with the top industrial nations to discuss technology transfer to developing countries .
is n't this an important issue ? it is an extremely important issue .
that is why it should be a strong part of the un framework convention on climate change agenda .
we need a legally binding framework and we need a strong incentive structure for this technology transfer .
there is no reason why this could n't happen .
but i do n't think we need an additional process for technology transfer . people have different expectations for bali .
some are saying the least common denominator would be agreement on a timeline for a roadmap for setting up a new climate change protocol by 2009 .
what do you think the next week will bring ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knowing what exact steps to take next will be key to slowing climate change , bals said we definitely need a roadmap , and we need a strong mandate for the roadmap , so we know what direction it is going in .
but this must be ambitious , which means that we need some targets for 2020 .
we need an agreement that the peak of climate emissions should be between 2015 and 2020 to prevent global climate change .
parts of this ambitious roadmap are also technology transfer , a clear concept for avoided deforestation , and the future of the emissions trading system . but what we need now are first steps showing that we want to start with concrete steps .
i think we will have pilot projects in the forestry field of how we want to prevent deforestation . you are saying that topics like avoided deforestation , or including airline emissions and transportation in general into a post-kyoto protocol , will be touched on here , but will not go into a bali agreement ? we will not get a bali agreement , we will get a bali mandate - that is what we are hoping for .
anybody who wants a bali agreement does n't take seriously the fact that we want a great transformation of society , and this ca n't be organized in a 14-day conference .
we need 10 conferences in the next two years to organize this .
what we need now is a strong mandate , so that we can begin to negotiate with all relevant actors .
that is my hope for the end of this week . interview : kateri jochum , bali , indonesia send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with germany preparing for the european championships in austria and switzerland next june , löw is keen to have at least one of his goalkeepers playing regularly in the run up to the tournament .
lehmann has been replaced by spaniard manuel almunia at arsenal and has only played three times for the first team all season .
timo hildebrand , germany 's number two keeper , is in a similar situation at valencia where he has been struggling to hold down a place since his summer move to spain from stuttgart .
löw has made it clear that 38-year-old lehmann must ascertain what his chances of winning back his place in the arsenal side are before the germany coach holds talks with his number one over the christmas break . germany coach fretting over benched keepers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw intends to discuss lehmann 's future at christmas " wenger and jens are both people who have done a great deal for arsenal , " löw told german sports agency sid .
" they should be able to discuss the matter and get a better understanding of the situation .
it is crucial jens has a concrete understanding of what is going on and is not trying to guess . "
after suffering an elbow and achilles tendon injury in september , lehmann has been unable to win his place back between the posts from almunia , a situation that worries löw .
" naturally , it is important a player has regular games , so he can stay sharp and get into a rhythm , " the germany coach added .
lehmann has been linked with a return to the bundesliga during the winter break , with vfl wolfsburg expressing their interest in the former borussia dortmund stopper .
while lehmann himself has given no indication that he wants to leave arsenal , he has consistently made comments about his situation at the north london club during his time on the sidelines , leading to a rift with his rival almunia and angering his employers .
arsenal boss dismisses wolves interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenger wo n't sell lehmann despite the goalie 's criticism despite lehmann 's vocal displeasure , arsenal boss wenger has dismissed rumors linking his unsettled goalkeeper with a return to his native germany in the january transfer window .
" it 's not true , " wenger said .
" it 's only newspaper talk because nothing concrete has been discussed between me and jens and nothing between me and wolfsburg . at the moment i do not want to speculate on any movement in the transfer window .
we want to focus on our games and jens is part of that . "
back in germany , both oliver bierhoff , the national team 's general manager , and former number one oliver kahn have urged lehmann to switch clubs in january if he wants to keep his euro 2008 dreams alive .
quit now to keep dream alive , say bierhoff and kahn " looking ahead at euro 2008 it is certainly important that we have a goalkeeper who plays all the time .
should that not be the case , i would advise him to look for a new club during the winter break where he can play continuously , " bierhoff said in october .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn and lehmann have been bitter rivals for years kahn , who lost his place in the national team to lehmann before the 2006 world cup , recently told his bitter rival to quit arsenal for the sake of his international career , should the future in london remain bleak .
" jens lehmann 's services to the national team have been impeccable , but you ca n't play in a european championship when you are not in the team , " kahn told dsf television .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 10.12.2007 sarkozy forced to defend gadhafi visit as france revolts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was taken aback by the strong reaction to gadhafi 's visit to france french president nicolas sarkozy on monday , dec .
10 , fiercely defended moammar gadhafi , shortly after the libyan leader began a controversial five-day visit to france . " today , france is welcoming a head of state who decided definitively to renounce weapons of mass destruction , " sarkozy told journalists after a one-hour meeting with gadhafi at the elysee palace .
" france is welcoming a head of state who definitively renounced terrorism .
a head of state who has compensated the victims " of libyan state-sponsored terrorist acts .
the french president added that libya wanted to become a full-fledged member of the international community .
" it is my deepest conviction that france must speak with all those who want to be integrated in the international community , " he said .
apparently unfazed by the controversy that preceded his arrival in paris monday afternoon , a smiling gadhafi shook hands with sarkozy and waved to journalists .
gadhafi 's first official visit to france in 34 years has provoked an angry debate in france , with even members of sarkozy 's government openly critical of the visit .
in an interview published monday in the daily le parisien , junior minister for human rights rama yade fiercely criticized the date of the visit , which begins on international human rights day , and said she would not take part in the state dinner sarkozy was hosting for gadhafi later monday .
human rights minister scolded by sarkozy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy first reached out to gadhafi in libya in july " the choice of this is a strong symbol , i would even say scandalously strong , " yade told the daily .
" colonel gadhafi must understand that our country is not a doormat on which a leader , terrorist or not , can clean his bloody feet of their infamy . "
her comments apparently displeased sarkozy .
yade was summoned to the elysee palace and chided for her frankness .
she said after the meeting with the president that her comments had been taken out of context and " caricatured " and that she was not , " in principle , " against gadhafi 's visit .
however , the french people apparently agree with yade 's original stance .
according to a poll made public on monday by the weekly paris match , nearly two of three french adults are opposed to gadhafi 's visit .
foreign minister says trusting libya is a risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner made his feelings known in no uncertain terms yade also received backing for her comments from foreign minister bernard kouchner , a well-known campaigner for human rights .
" she was right to speak as she did , " kouchner told france inter radio on monday .
kouchner also appeared to distance himself from the visit , adding that he was " resigned " to gadhafi coming to france and hoped that it would help speed up the " evolution " in libya .
in an opinion piece published monday in the daily la croix , kouchner described the high-wire act gadhafi 's visit has forced him - and france - to perform .
" no question of forgetting the name of the victims imputed to him , " he said .
" no question of forgetting their sufferings .
gadhafi has abandoned weapons of mass destruction and renounced terrorism for his country .
should we believe him and renew relations with libya ?
it 's a risk , but we will keep our eyes open . "
ex-presidential candidates weigh in with criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidential rivals bayrou and royal agreed on gadhafi meanwhile , the centrist former presidential candidate francois bayrou told rmc radio on monday that the libyan leader was a " bloody dictator " and that he would not take part in the diplomatic reception for him .
on sunday , former socialist party presidential candidate segolene royal said sarkozy was " trampling on france 's human rights tradition , " and told canal plus television that it was " heinous , shocking and even unacceptable " that france gave backing to " a system of torture in prison . "
apparently shaken by the controversy , sarkozy also defended his own human rights record , saying that he and his government had liberated the bulgarian nurses who had been sentenced to death by a libyan court for infecting children with aids .
" france liberated them , " sarkozy said .
" i demanded it and i obtained it . "
he also noted that he was the only french president to openly demand , at a press conference in beijing , that china outlaw the death penalty .
sarkozy noted that gadhafi would sign contracts later monday totaling about 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- .
these deals would involve a nuclear reactor for a seawater desalinization plant , a variety of armaments and other economic contracts , the french president said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de national team -pipe- 10.12.2007 germany coach löw concerned with goalie lehmann 's inactivity großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lehmann 's current position at arsenal - which is usually a sitting one - worries löw the continuing saga surrounding jens lehmann 's tenure as arsenal 's first team goalkeeper and his future as the national number one took a new turn over the weekend with an intervention by germany coach joachim löw . löw , concerned that his current first choice goalie has been warming the arsenal bench since the end of august , has insisted lehmann speaks to his club boss arsene wenger about his lack of first-team action .
with germany preparing for the european championships in austria and switzerland next june , löw is keen to have at least one of his goalkeepers playing regularly in the run up to the tournament .
lehmann has been replaced by spaniard manuel almunia at arsenal and has only played three times for the first team all season .
timo hildebrand , germany 's number two keeper , is in a similar situation at valencia where he has been struggling to hold down a place since his summer move to spain from stuttgart .
löw has made it clear that 38-year-old lehmann must ascertain what his chances of winning back his place in the arsenal side are before the germany coach holds talks with his number one over the christmas break . germany coach fretting over benched keepers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw intends to discuss lehmann 's future at christmas " wenger and jens are both people who have done a great deal for arsenal , " löw told german sports agency sid .
" they should be able to discuss the matter and get a better understanding of the situation .
it is crucial jens has a concrete understanding of what is going on and is not trying to guess . "
after suffering an elbow and achilles tendon injury in september , lehmann has been unable to win his place back between the posts from almunia , a situation that worries löw .
" naturally , it is important a player has regular games , so he can stay sharp and get into a rhythm , " the germany coach added .
lehmann has been linked with a return to the bundesliga during the winter break , with vfl wolfsburg expressing their interest in the former borussia dortmund stopper .
while lehmann himself has given no indication that he wants to leave arsenal , he has consistently made comments about his situation at the north london club during his time on the sidelines , leading to a rift with his rival almunia and angering his employers .
arsenal boss dismisses wolves interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenger wo n't sell lehmann despite the goalie 's criticism despite lehmann 's vocal displeasure , arsenal boss wenger has dismissed rumors linking his unsettled goalkeeper with a return to his native germany in the january transfer window .
" it 's not true , " wenger said .
" it 's only newspaper talk because nothing concrete has been discussed between me and jens and nothing between me and wolfsburg . at the moment i do not want to speculate on any movement in the transfer window .
we want to focus on our games and jens is part of that . "
back in germany , both oliver bierhoff , the national team 's general manager , and former number one oliver kahn have urged lehmann to switch clubs in january if he wants to keep his euro 2008 dreams alive .
quit now to keep dream alive , say bierhoff and kahn " looking ahead at euro 2008 it is certainly important that we have a goalkeeper who plays all the time .
should that not be the case , i would advise him to look for a new club during the winter break where he can play continuously , " bierhoff said in october .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn and lehmann have been bitter rivals for years kahn , who lost his place in the national team to lehmann before the 2006 world cup , recently told his bitter rival to quit arsenal for the sake of his international career , should the future in london remain bleak .
" jens lehmann 's services to the national team have been impeccable , but you ca n't play in a european championship when you are not in the team , " kahn told dsf television .
" that 's why it would be best for him to go and play where he will be in the team . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de lehmann willing to drop down a division for germany jens lehmann has told a german soccer magazine that he would transfer to a second-division club in a bid to retain his status as germany 's starting keeper .
but would that secure his position for euro 2008 ? -lrb- 13.11.2007 -rrb- lehmann 's arsenal fortunes could affect his status for germany it took jens lehmann almost a decade to supplant ollie kahn as germany 's starting keeper .

10 , fiercely defended moammar gadhafi , shortly after the libyan leader began a controversial five-day visit to france . " today , france is welcoming a head of state who decided definitively to renounce weapons of mass destruction , " sarkozy told journalists after a one-hour meeting with gadhafi at the elysee palace .
" france is welcoming a head of state who definitively renounced terrorism .
a head of state who has compensated the victims " of libyan state-sponsored terrorist acts .
the french president added that libya wanted to become a full-fledged member of the international community .
" it is my deepest conviction that france must speak with all those who want to be integrated in the international community , " he said .
apparently unfazed by the controversy that preceded his arrival in paris monday afternoon , a smiling gadhafi shook hands with sarkozy and waved to journalists .
gadhafi 's first official visit to france in 34 years has provoked an angry debate in france , with even members of sarkozy 's government openly critical of the visit .
in an interview published monday in the daily le parisien , junior minister for human rights rama yade fiercely criticized the date of the visit , which begins on international human rights day , and said she would not take part in the state dinner sarkozy was hosting for gadhafi later monday .
human rights minister scolded by sarkozy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy first reached out to gadhafi in libya in july " the choice of this is a strong symbol , i would even say scandalously strong , " yade told the daily .
" colonel gadhafi must understand that our country is not a doormat on which a leader , terrorist or not , can clean his bloody feet of their infamy . "
her comments apparently displeased sarkozy .
yade was summoned to the elysee palace and chided for her frankness .
she said after the meeting with the president that her comments had been taken out of context and " caricatured " and that she was not , " in principle , " against gadhafi 's visit .
however , the french people apparently agree with yade 's original stance .
according to a poll made public on monday by the weekly paris match , nearly two of three french adults are opposed to gadhafi 's visit .
foreign minister says trusting libya is a risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner made his feelings known in no uncertain terms yade also received backing for her comments from foreign minister bernard kouchner , a well-known campaigner for human rights .
" she was right to speak as she did , " kouchner told france inter radio on monday .
kouchner also appeared to distance himself from the visit , adding that he was " resigned " to gadhafi coming to france and hoped that it would help speed up the " evolution " in libya .
in an opinion piece published monday in the daily la croix , kouchner described the high-wire act gadhafi 's visit has forced him - and france - to perform .
" no question of forgetting the name of the victims imputed to him , " he said .
" no question of forgetting their sufferings .
gadhafi has abandoned weapons of mass destruction and renounced terrorism for his country .
should we believe him and renew relations with libya ?
it 's a risk , but we will keep our eyes open . "

on sunday , former socialist party presidential candidate segolene royal said sarkozy was " trampling on france 's human rights tradition , " and told canal plus television that it was " heinous , shocking and even unacceptable " that france gave backing to " a system of torture in prison . "
apparently shaken by the controversy , sarkozy also defended his own human rights record , saying that he and his government had liberated the bulgarian nurses who had been sentenced to death by a libyan court for infecting children with aids .
" france liberated them , " sarkozy said .
" i demanded it and i obtained it . "
he also noted that he was the only french president to openly demand , at a press conference in beijing , that china outlaw the death penalty .
sarkozy noted that gadhafi would sign contracts later monday totaling about 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- .

what was your impression of the first week ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has said it 's ready to discuss climate goals , bals said christoph bals : there was one really big shift in the position of the rapidly developing countries , mainly in china .
this was very constructive .
it was just two years ago that china said that only in the second half of the century would they be ready to negotiate seriously about commitments , and now they seem to be ready to start with these negotiations .
this was a very constructive spirit from china and also from other rapidly developing countries , like mexico , like south africa and like brazil . the united states produces the most greenhouse gas emissions , and is one of the only industrial countries that has not ratified the kyoto protocol .
in the past the us has tried to block negotiations .
is that true this year as well ? they are not really blocking negotiations at the moment , but they are still trying to start a parallel process for voluntary action .
this would undermine the entire process .
they want to have major conferences next year just to discuss this issue of voluntary activities .
this is one way of blocking without really blocking the negotiations . the united states says it wants to meet with the top industrial nations to discuss technology transfer to developing countries .
is n't this an important issue ? it is an extremely important issue .
that is why it should be a strong part of the un framework convention on climate change agenda .
we need a legally binding framework and we need a strong incentive structure for this technology transfer .
there is no reason why this could n't happen .
but i do n't think we need an additional process for technology transfer . people have different expectations for bali .
some are saying the least common denominator would be agreement on a timeline for a roadmap for setting up a new climate change protocol by 2009 .
what do you think the next week will bring ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knowing what exact steps to take next will be key to slowing climate change , bals said we definitely need a roadmap , and we need a strong mandate for the roadmap , so we know what direction it is going in .
but this must be ambitious , which means that we need some targets for 2020 .
we need an agreement that the peak of climate emissions should be between 2015 and 2020 to prevent global climate change .
parts of this ambitious roadmap are also technology transfer , a clear concept for avoided deforestation , and the future of the emissions trading system . but what we need now are first steps showing that we want to start with concrete steps .
i think we will have pilot projects in the forestry field of how we want to prevent deforestation . you are saying that topics like avoided deforestation , or including airline emissions and transportation in general into a post-kyoto protocol , will be touched on here , but will not go into a bali agreement ? we will not get a bali agreement , we will get a bali mandate - that is what we are hoping for .
anybody who wants a bali agreement does n't take seriously the fact that we want a great transformation of society , and this ca n't be organized in a 14-day conference .
we need 10 conferences in the next two years to organize this .
what we need now is a strong mandate , so that we can begin to negotiate with all relevant actors .
that is my hope for the end of this week . interview : kateri jochum , bali , indonesia send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what was your impression of the first week ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has said it 's ready to discuss climate goals , bals said christoph bals : there was one really big shift in the position of the rapidly developing countries , mainly in china .
this was very constructive .
it was just two years ago that china said that only in the second half of the century would they be ready to negotiate seriously about commitments , and now they seem to be ready to start with these negotiations .
this was a very constructive spirit from china and also from other rapidly developing countries , like mexico , like south africa and like brazil . the united states produces the most greenhouse gas emissions , and is one of the only industrial countries that has not ratified the kyoto protocol .
in the past the us has tried to block negotiations .
is that true this year as well ? they are not really blocking negotiations at the moment , but they are still trying to start a parallel process for voluntary action .
this would undermine the entire process .
they want to have major conferences next year just to discuss this issue of voluntary activities .
this is one way of blocking without really blocking the negotiations . the united states says it wants to meet with the top industrial nations to discuss technology transfer to developing countries .
is n't this an important issue ? it is an extremely important issue .
that is why it should be a strong part of the un framework convention on climate change agenda .
we need a legally binding framework and we need a strong incentive structure for this technology transfer .
there is no reason why this could n't happen .
but i do n't think we need an additional process for technology transfer . people have different expectations for bali .
some are saying the least common denominator would be agreement on a timeline for a roadmap for setting up a new climate change protocol by 2009 .
what do you think the next week will bring ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knowing what exact steps to take next will be key to slowing climate change , bals said we definitely need a roadmap , and we need a strong mandate for the roadmap , so we know what direction it is going in .
but this must be ambitious , which means that we need some targets for 2020 .
we need an agreement that the peak of climate emissions should be between 2015 and 2020 to prevent global climate change .
parts of this ambitious roadmap are also technology transfer , a clear concept for avoided deforestation , and the future of the emissions trading system . but what we need now are first steps showing that we want to start with concrete steps .
i think we will have pilot projects in the forestry field of how we want to prevent deforestation . you are saying that topics like avoided deforestation , or including airline emissions and transportation in general into a post-kyoto protocol , will be touched on here , but will not go into a bali agreement ? we will not get a bali agreement , we will get a bali mandate - that is what we are hoping for .
anybody who wants a bali agreement does n't take seriously the fact that we want a great transformation of society , and this ca n't be organized in a 14-day conference .
we need 10 conferences in the next two years to organize this .
what we need now is a strong mandate , so that we can begin to negotiate with all relevant actors .
that is my hope for the end of this week . interview : kateri jochum , bali , indonesia send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the fact that medvedev 's not a member of putin 's party makes it even more likely that he 'll become russia 's next leader . " i fully support this candidacy , " putin on monday , dec .
10 , was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency after four parties , headed by the ruling united russia , named medvedev as their candidate .
" as far as the candidacy of medvedev is concerned , i have known him for more than 17 years , i have worked with him closely all these years , and i completely and fully support this candidacy , " putin said in video footage shown on state television .
putin will step down following the march 2 presidential elections after serving two consecutive terms .
while there is no clear favorite in the race to replace him , it is expected that any candidate which has putin 's endorsement will go on to win the election .
despite the rise through the ranks of fellow first deputy prime minister sergei ivanov and the appointment of the little-known finance expert viktor zubkov as prime minister in september , medvedev is now seen as the front runner for the presidency after gaining putin 's official endorsement .
putin 's announcement ends months of speculation fuelled by the president 's erratic promotions and random praise of members of his retinue .
medvedev set to be pro-kremlin parties ' candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev stands to gain four presidential nominations medvedev , who chairs energy giant gazprom 's supervisory board , has an extra advantage in addition to that .
as he is not affiliated with any party he can be nominated by all four pro-kremlin political parties - united russia , a just russia , a civil front and the agrarian party - as their candidate .
the four parties are set to officially announce medvedev as their candidate for the presidential elections at their upcoming party congresses .
a lawyer by trade , medvedev is a kremlin insider seen as a staunch putin loyalist , owing his rise to power to the incumbent president who hired him in the early 1990s to work on his staff at the saint petersburg local government .
he served as putin 's campaign manager for his successful 2000 election run and was rewarded for his services first with the position of presidential chief of staff and then the post at gazprom .
medvedev also heads the kremlin 's " national projects , " a program created to use russia 's massive profits from energy sales to rebuild crumbling infrastructure and social support system .
putin 's heir apparent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev contributed to putin 's rise to power medvedev 's appointment as first deputy prime minister in charge of national projects in health , education and housing in november 2005 first started the rumors that putin had chosen his heir apparent .
unlike putin , medvedev has no known connections with the kgb , but is considered a top player within the saint petersburg clan that dominates the upper echelons of power .
with his in-depth knowledge of the bureaucracy , medvedev is credited with having helped build the pyramid of power that has contributed to securing putin 's position at the top .

the fact that medvedev 's not a member of putin 's party makes it even more likely that he 'll become russia 's next leader . " i fully support this candidacy , " putin on monday , dec .
10 , was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency after four parties , headed by the ruling united russia , named medvedev as their candidate .
" as far as the candidacy of medvedev is concerned , i have known him for more than 17 years , i have worked with him closely all these years , and i completely and fully support this candidacy , " putin said in video footage shown on state television .
putin will step down following the march 2 presidential elections after serving two consecutive terms .
while there is no clear favorite in the race to replace him , it is expected that any candidate which has putin 's endorsement will go on to win the election .
despite the rise through the ranks of fellow first deputy prime minister sergei ivanov and the appointment of the little-known finance expert viktor zubkov as prime minister in september , medvedev is now seen as the front runner for the presidency after gaining putin 's official endorsement .
putin 's announcement ends months of speculation fuelled by the president 's erratic promotions and random praise of members of his retinue .
medvedev set to be pro-kremlin parties ' candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev stands to gain four presidential nominations medvedev , who chairs energy giant gazprom 's supervisory board , has an extra advantage in addition to that .
as he is not affiliated with any party he can be nominated by all four pro-kremlin political parties - united russia , a just russia , a civil front and the agrarian party - as their candidate .
the four parties are set to officially announce medvedev as their candidate for the presidential elections at their upcoming party congresses .
a lawyer by trade , medvedev is a kremlin insider seen as a staunch putin loyalist , owing his rise to power to the incumbent president who hired him in the early 1990s to work on his staff at the saint petersburg local government .
he served as putin 's campaign manager for his successful 2000 election run and was rewarded for his services first with the position of presidential chief of staff and then the post at gazprom .
medvedev also heads the kremlin 's " national projects , " a program created to use russia 's massive profits from energy sales to rebuild crumbling infrastructure and social support system .

what was your impression of the first week ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has said it 's ready to discuss climate goals , bals said christoph bals : there was one really big shift in the position of the rapidly developing countries , mainly in china .
this was very constructive .
it was just two years ago that china said that only in the second half of the century would they be ready to negotiate seriously about commitments , and now they seem to be ready to start with these negotiations .
this was a very constructive spirit from china and also from other rapidly developing countries , like mexico , like south africa and like brazil . the united states produces the most greenhouse gas emissions , and is one of the only industrial countries that has not ratified the kyoto protocol .
in the past the us has tried to block negotiations .
is that true this year as well ? they are not really blocking negotiations at the moment , but they are still trying to start a parallel process for voluntary action .
this would undermine the entire process .
they want to have major conferences next year just to discuss this issue of voluntary activities .
this is one way of blocking without really blocking the negotiations . the united states says it wants to meet with the top industrial nations to discuss technology transfer to developing countries .
is n't this an important issue ? it is an extremely important issue .
that is why it should be a strong part of the un framework convention on climate change agenda .
we need a legally binding framework and we need a strong incentive structure for this technology transfer .
there is no reason why this could n't happen .
but i do n't think we need an additional process for technology transfer . people have different expectations for bali .
some are saying the least common denominator would be agreement on a timeline for a roadmap for setting up a new climate change protocol by 2009 .
what do you think the next week will bring ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knowing what exact steps to take next will be key to slowing climate change , bals said we definitely need a roadmap , and we need a strong mandate for the roadmap , so we know what direction it is going in .
but this must be ambitious , which means that we need some targets for 2020 .
we need an agreement that the peak of climate emissions should be between 2015 and 2020 to prevent global climate change .
parts of this ambitious roadmap are also technology transfer , a clear concept for avoided deforestation , and the future of the emissions trading system . but what we need now are first steps showing that we want to start with concrete steps .
i think we will have pilot projects in the forestry field of how we want to prevent deforestation . you are saying that topics like avoided deforestation , or including airline emissions and transportation in general into a post-kyoto protocol , will be touched on here , but will not go into a bali agreement ? we will not get a bali agreement , we will get a bali mandate - that is what we are hoping for .
anybody who wants a bali agreement does n't take seriously the fact that we want a great transformation of society , and this ca n't be organized in a 14-day conference .
we need 10 conferences in the next two years to organize this .
what we need now is a strong mandate , so that we can begin to negotiate with all relevant actors .
that is my hope for the end of this week . interview : kateri jochum , bali , indonesia send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

is n't this an important issue ? it is an extremely important issue .
that is why it should be a strong part of the un framework convention on climate change agenda .
we need a legally binding framework and we need a strong incentive structure for this technology transfer .
there is no reason why this could n't happen .
but i do n't think we need an additional process for technology transfer . people have different expectations for bali .
some are saying the least common denominator would be agreement on a timeline for a roadmap for setting up a new climate change protocol by 2009 .
what do you think the next week will bring ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knowing what exact steps to take next will be key to slowing climate change , bals said we definitely need a roadmap , and we need a strong mandate for the roadmap , so we know what direction it is going in .
but this must be ambitious , which means that we need some targets for 2020 .
we need an agreement that the peak of climate emissions should be between 2015 and 2020 to prevent global climate change .
parts of this ambitious roadmap are also technology transfer , a clear concept for avoided deforestation , and the future of the emissions trading system . but what we need now are first steps showing that we want to start with concrete steps .
i think we will have pilot projects in the forestry field of how we want to prevent deforestation . you are saying that topics like avoided deforestation , or including airline emissions and transportation in general into a post-kyoto protocol , will be touched on here , but will not go into a bali agreement ? we will not get a bali agreement , we will get a bali mandate - that is what we are hoping for .
anybody who wants a bali agreement does n't take seriously the fact that we want a great transformation of society , and this ca n't be organized in a 14-day conference .
we need 10 conferences in the next two years to organize this .
what we need now is a strong mandate , so that we can begin to negotiate with all relevant actors .
that is my hope for the end of this week . interview : kateri jochum , bali , indonesia send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

what was your impression of the first week ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has said it 's ready to discuss climate goals , bals said christoph bals : there was one really big shift in the position of the rapidly developing countries , mainly in china .
this was very constructive .
it was just two years ago that china said that only in the second half of the century would they be ready to negotiate seriously about commitments , and now they seem to be ready to start with these negotiations .
this was a very constructive spirit from china and also from other rapidly developing countries , like mexico , like south africa and like brazil . the united states produces the most greenhouse gas emissions , and is one of the only industrial countries that has not ratified the kyoto protocol .
in the past the us has tried to block negotiations .

with germany preparing for the european championships in austria and switzerland next june , löw is keen to have at least one of his goalkeepers playing regularly in the run up to the tournament .
lehmann has been replaced by spaniard manuel almunia at arsenal and has only played three times for the first team all season .
timo hildebrand , germany 's number two keeper , is in a similar situation at valencia where he has been struggling to hold down a place since his summer move to spain from stuttgart .
löw has made it clear that 38-year-old lehmann must ascertain what his chances of winning back his place in the arsenal side are before the germany coach holds talks with his number one over the christmas break . germany coach fretting over benched keepers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw intends to discuss lehmann 's future at christmas " wenger and jens are both people who have done a great deal for arsenal , " löw told german sports agency sid .
" they should be able to discuss the matter and get a better understanding of the situation .
it is crucial jens has a concrete understanding of what is going on and is not trying to guess . "
after suffering an elbow and achilles tendon injury in september , lehmann has been unable to win his place back between the posts from almunia , a situation that worries löw .
" naturally , it is important a player has regular games , so he can stay sharp and get into a rhythm , " the germany coach added .
lehmann has been linked with a return to the bundesliga during the winter break , with vfl wolfsburg expressing their interest in the former borussia dortmund stopper .
while lehmann himself has given no indication that he wants to leave arsenal , he has consistently made comments about his situation at the north london club during his time on the sidelines , leading to a rift with his rival almunia and angering his employers .
arsenal boss dismisses wolves interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenger wo n't sell lehmann despite the goalie 's criticism despite lehmann 's vocal displeasure , arsenal boss wenger has dismissed rumors linking his unsettled goalkeeper with a return to his native germany in the january transfer window .
" it 's not true , " wenger said .
" it 's only newspaper talk because nothing concrete has been discussed between me and jens and nothing between me and wolfsburg . at the moment i do not want to speculate on any movement in the transfer window .
we want to focus on our games and jens is part of that . "
back in germany , both oliver bierhoff , the national team 's general manager , and former number one oliver kahn have urged lehmann to switch clubs in january if he wants to keep his euro 2008 dreams alive .
quit now to keep dream alive , say bierhoff and kahn " looking ahead at euro 2008 it is certainly important that we have a goalkeeper who plays all the time .
should that not be the case , i would advise him to look for a new club during the winter break where he can play continuously , " bierhoff said in october .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn and lehmann have been bitter rivals for years kahn , who lost his place in the national team to lehmann before the 2006 world cup , recently told his bitter rival to quit arsenal for the sake of his international career , should the future in london remain bleak .
" jens lehmann 's services to the national team have been impeccable , but you ca n't play in a european championship when you are not in the team , " kahn told dsf television .
" that 's why it would be best for him to go and play where he will be in the team . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

with germany preparing for the european championships in austria and switzerland next june , löw is keen to have at least one of his goalkeepers playing regularly in the run up to the tournament .
lehmann has been replaced by spaniard manuel almunia at arsenal and has only played three times for the first team all season .
timo hildebrand , germany 's number two keeper , is in a similar situation at valencia where he has been struggling to hold down a place since his summer move to spain from stuttgart .
löw has made it clear that 38-year-old lehmann must ascertain what his chances of winning back his place in the arsenal side are before the germany coach holds talks with his number one over the christmas break . germany coach fretting over benched keepers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw intends to discuss lehmann 's future at christmas " wenger and jens are both people who have done a great deal for arsenal , " löw told german sports agency sid .
" they should be able to discuss the matter and get a better understanding of the situation .
it is crucial jens has a concrete understanding of what is going on and is not trying to guess . "
after suffering an elbow and achilles tendon injury in september , lehmann has been unable to win his place back between the posts from almunia , a situation that worries löw .
" naturally , it is important a player has regular games , so he can stay sharp and get into a rhythm , " the germany coach added .
lehmann has been linked with a return to the bundesliga during the winter break , with vfl wolfsburg expressing their interest in the former borussia dortmund stopper .
while lehmann himself has given no indication that he wants to leave arsenal , he has consistently made comments about his situation at the north london club during his time on the sidelines , leading to a rift with his rival almunia and angering his employers .
arsenal boss dismisses wolves interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenger wo n't sell lehmann despite the goalie 's criticism despite lehmann 's vocal displeasure , arsenal boss wenger has dismissed rumors linking his unsettled goalkeeper with a return to his native germany in the january transfer window .
" it 's not true , " wenger said .
" it 's only newspaper talk because nothing concrete has been discussed between me and jens and nothing between me and wolfsburg . at the moment i do not want to speculate on any movement in the transfer window .
we want to focus on our games and jens is part of that . "
back in germany , both oliver bierhoff , the national team 's general manager , and former number one oliver kahn have urged lehmann to switch clubs in january if he wants to keep his euro 2008 dreams alive .
quit now to keep dream alive , say bierhoff and kahn " looking ahead at euro 2008 it is certainly important that we have a goalkeeper who plays all the time .
should that not be the case , i would advise him to look for a new club during the winter break where he can play continuously , " bierhoff said in october .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn and lehmann have been bitter rivals for years kahn , who lost his place in the national team to lehmann before the 2006 world cup , recently told his bitter rival to quit arsenal for the sake of his international career , should the future in london remain bleak .
" jens lehmann 's services to the national team have been impeccable , but you ca n't play in a european championship when you are not in the team , " kahn told dsf television .
" that 's why it would be best for him to go and play where he will be in the team . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 , the eu , the us and russia said further talks over kosovo 's status would be superfluous .
the serbian province could declare independence any time . key european powers and the united states are gearing up to recognize kosovo as an independent state , while serbia , backed by russia , has said it will never accept a self-ruling kosovo . in response to the deadlock , the so-called kosovo troika - made up of the eu , the us and russia - ended four months of un-initiated talks on friday by concluding that negotiations had failed . us secretary of state condoleezza rice has also made it clear that it is too late for negotiations on kosovo 's future status - a stance that her russian counterpart sergei lavrov criticized on the weekend as being the biggest obstacle to a solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's ethnic albanian parties are united in their calls for independence " neither party was willing to cede its position on the fundamental question of sovereignty over kosovo , " the troika report said .
" this is regrettable , as a negotiated settlement is in the best interests of both parties . " the mediators said the two sides did find some issues they could agree on and promised to work together on reconciliation , even if they could n't break through on the big question of kosovo 's status . kosovo 's albanian majority appealed to the west on sunday to back their bid for independence .
a joint statement from government and opposition leaders said : " the people of kosovo urgently need clarity about their future . " the eu 's foreign ministers will meet behind closed doors on monday with the eu envoy to the kosovo talks , wolfgang ischinger , to discuss ways to prevent violence in the case that kosovo albanians declare independence . eu letter reveals bloc 's internal divide in a separate letter addressed to the european union member states , germany , france , britain and italy said that continuing talks would be pointless . diplomats said that the letter was intended for those countries in the bloc that continue to advocate further talks , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper reported . romania , slovakia and spain have been hesitant to back independence for kosovo due to fears that the move would encourage their own ethnic minorities to break away .
cyprus , which is divided into a greek and internationally unrecognized turkish portion , has also found the one-sidedness of the kosovo independence proposal hard to swallow , as has greece . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger said the troika did everything " humanly possible " to negotiate a deal " it 's regrettable that the eu member states , due to their respective domestic situations , have reached different conclusions , " the eu 's coordinator for the stability pact for south-eastern europe , erhard busek , told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
" the different positions of eu states on the issue of kosovo 's status invite russia and china to interfere . " solana : kosovo 's future is in the eu leaders of the 27-nation bloc are to confirm the impasse in a statement at a summit this coming friday , diplomats told reuters news agency . they are also expected to verify their willingness to dispatch police and justice missions and appoint a high representative to oversee kosovo if asked to by the kosovo-albanian government and the united nations . " it is clear that the future of serbia and kosovo lies in the european union .
that 's something that both sides agree on , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in an interview with germany 's welt am sonntag newspaper . the un security council is due to discuss the kosovo troika 's report on dec .

even if you 're not a great fan of feathered fowl or fruit-baring trees , surely the thought is what counts ? but what if your true love is a soccer club and on the first day of christmas it gives you the mocking grin of a fierce rival ?
would you still be so graceful in receiving this gift ?
or would you be looking for a largely flightless bird to stick where the christmas sun do n't shine ?
this was the dilemma facing a supporter of german soccer club schalke 04 recently .
passionate schalke fan tobias meier joyfully opened the first door of his treasured club advent calendar expecting a chocolate treat and instead received the beaming visage of werder bremen 's midfielder diego .
schalke santa hid the terrible truth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's fans did n't react well to the bremen surprise if the shock of finding the brazilian nemesis of your beloved team behind door no. 1 was n't enough , tobias discovered this was not an isolated case .
his father peter also had the same problem with the calendar , which sported a picture of santa claus in the team 's royal blue uniform on the front .
after recovering from the shock , the meiers investigated further with the help of the club authorities and found out that a mistake at the italian printers meant roughly 40 of the 40,000 schalke calendars were printed with pictures of bremen stars inside .
" we were totally shocked , " tobias told german tabloid bild .
" we immediately opened the other doors and found there were bremen stars behind every window - it was n't the surprise i was expecting . "
both schalke and bremen had their club calendars made at the same printers near milan which led to the mix-up .
cut-price calendars not flying off the shelves schalke 's club shop in gelsenkirchen has now reduced the remaining advent gifts bearing the wrong pictures from 2.95 euros -lrb- $ 4.30 -rrb- to 1.45 euros , but , unsurprisingly , there are few takers for the tainted calendars even at a knock-down price .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : möller does n't expect any bremen stars under the tree the firm who printed the calendars is offering to swap any bearing the mistake and schalke manager andreas möller has issued a reassurance to worried fans .
" it 's no problem , " he said tongue firmly planted in cheek , " it 's not as though anyone will find a werder bremen player under their christmas tree . "

even if you 're not a great fan of feathered fowl or fruit-baring trees , surely the thought is what counts ? but what if your true love is a soccer club and on the first day of christmas it gives you the mocking grin of a fierce rival ?
would you still be so graceful in receiving this gift ?
or would you be looking for a largely flightless bird to stick where the christmas sun do n't shine ?
this was the dilemma facing a supporter of german soccer club schalke 04 recently .
passionate schalke fan tobias meier joyfully opened the first door of his treasured club advent calendar expecting a chocolate treat and instead received the beaming visage of werder bremen 's midfielder diego .
schalke santa hid the terrible truth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's fans did n't react well to the bremen surprise if the shock of finding the brazilian nemesis of your beloved team behind door no. 1 was n't enough , tobias discovered this was not an isolated case .
his father peter also had the same problem with the calendar , which sported a picture of santa claus in the team 's royal blue uniform on the front .
after recovering from the shock , the meiers investigated further with the help of the club authorities and found out that a mistake at the italian printers meant roughly 40 of the 40,000 schalke calendars were printed with pictures of bremen stars inside .
" we were totally shocked , " tobias told german tabloid bild .
" we immediately opened the other doors and found there were bremen stars behind every window - it was n't the surprise i was expecting . "
both schalke and bremen had their club calendars made at the same printers near milan which led to the mix-up .
cut-price calendars not flying off the shelves schalke 's club shop in gelsenkirchen has now reduced the remaining advent gifts bearing the wrong pictures from 2.95 euros -lrb- $ 4.30 -rrb- to 1.45 euros , but , unsurprisingly , there are few takers for the tainted calendars even at a knock-down price .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : möller does n't expect any bremen stars under the tree the firm who printed the calendars is offering to swap any bearing the mistake and schalke manager andreas möller has issued a reassurance to worried fans .

what was your impression of the first week ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has said it 's ready to discuss climate goals , bals said christoph bals : there was one really big shift in the position of the rapidly developing countries , mainly in china .
this was very constructive .
it was just two years ago that china said that only in the second half of the century would they be ready to negotiate seriously about commitments , and now they seem to be ready to start with these negotiations .
this was a very constructive spirit from china and also from other rapidly developing countries , like mexico , like south africa and like brazil . the united states produces the most greenhouse gas emissions , and is one of the only industrial countries that has not ratified the kyoto protocol .
in the past the us has tried to block negotiations .
is that true this year as well ? they are not really blocking negotiations at the moment , but they are still trying to start a parallel process for voluntary action .
this would undermine the entire process .
they want to have major conferences next year just to discuss this issue of voluntary activities .
this is one way of blocking without really blocking the negotiations . the united states says it wants to meet with the top industrial nations to discuss technology transfer to developing countries .
is n't this an important issue ? it is an extremely important issue .
that is why it should be a strong part of the un framework convention on climate change agenda .
we need a legally binding framework and we need a strong incentive structure for this technology transfer .
there is no reason why this could n't happen .
but i do n't think we need an additional process for technology transfer . people have different expectations for bali .
some are saying the least common denominator would be agreement on a timeline for a roadmap for setting up a new climate change protocol by 2009 .
what do you think the next week will bring ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knowing what exact steps to take next will be key to slowing climate change , bals said we definitely need a roadmap , and we need a strong mandate for the roadmap , so we know what direction it is going in .
but this must be ambitious , which means that we need some targets for 2020 .
we need an agreement that the peak of climate emissions should be between 2015 and 2020 to prevent global climate change .
parts of this ambitious roadmap are also technology transfer , a clear concept for avoided deforestation , and the future of the emissions trading system . but what we need now are first steps showing that we want to start with concrete steps .
i think we will have pilot projects in the forestry field of how we want to prevent deforestation . you are saying that topics like avoided deforestation , or including airline emissions and transportation in general into a post-kyoto protocol , will be touched on here , but will not go into a bali agreement ? we will not get a bali agreement , we will get a bali mandate - that is what we are hoping for .
anybody who wants a bali agreement does n't take seriously the fact that we want a great transformation of society , and this ca n't be organized in a 14-day conference .
we need 10 conferences in the next two years to organize this .
what we need now is a strong mandate , so that we can begin to negotiate with all relevant actors .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 10.12.2007 sarkozy forced to defend gadhafi visit as france revolts großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy was taken aback by the strong reaction to gadhafi 's visit to france french president nicolas sarkozy on monday , dec .
10 , fiercely defended moammar gadhafi , shortly after the libyan leader began a controversial five-day visit to france . " today , france is welcoming a head of state who decided definitively to renounce weapons of mass destruction , " sarkozy told journalists after a one-hour meeting with gadhafi at the elysee palace .
" france is welcoming a head of state who definitively renounced terrorism .
a head of state who has compensated the victims " of libyan state-sponsored terrorist acts .
the french president added that libya wanted to become a full-fledged member of the international community .
" it is my deepest conviction that france must speak with all those who want to be integrated in the international community , " he said .
apparently unfazed by the controversy that preceded his arrival in paris monday afternoon , a smiling gadhafi shook hands with sarkozy and waved to journalists .
gadhafi 's first official visit to france in 34 years has provoked an angry debate in france , with even members of sarkozy 's government openly critical of the visit .
in an interview published monday in the daily le parisien , junior minister for human rights rama yade fiercely criticized the date of the visit , which begins on international human rights day , and said she would not take part in the state dinner sarkozy was hosting for gadhafi later monday .
human rights minister scolded by sarkozy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy first reached out to gadhafi in libya in july " the choice of this is a strong symbol , i would even say scandalously strong , " yade told the daily .
" colonel gadhafi must understand that our country is not a doormat on which a leader , terrorist or not , can clean his bloody feet of their infamy . "
her comments apparently displeased sarkozy .
yade was summoned to the elysee palace and chided for her frankness .
she said after the meeting with the president that her comments had been taken out of context and " caricatured " and that she was not , " in principle , " against gadhafi 's visit .
however , the french people apparently agree with yade 's original stance .
according to a poll made public on monday by the weekly paris match , nearly two of three french adults are opposed to gadhafi 's visit .
foreign minister says trusting libya is a risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner made his feelings known in no uncertain terms yade also received backing for her comments from foreign minister bernard kouchner , a well-known campaigner for human rights .
" she was right to speak as she did , " kouchner told france inter radio on monday .
kouchner also appeared to distance himself from the visit , adding that he was " resigned " to gadhafi coming to france and hoped that it would help speed up the " evolution " in libya .
in an opinion piece published monday in the daily la croix , kouchner described the high-wire act gadhafi 's visit has forced him - and france - to perform .
" no question of forgetting the name of the victims imputed to him , " he said .
" no question of forgetting their sufferings .
gadhafi has abandoned weapons of mass destruction and renounced terrorism for his country .
should we believe him and renew relations with libya ?
it 's a risk , but we will keep our eyes open . "
ex-presidential candidates weigh in with criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidential rivals bayrou and royal agreed on gadhafi meanwhile , the centrist former presidential candidate francois bayrou told rmc radio on monday that the libyan leader was a " bloody dictator " and that he would not take part in the diplomatic reception for him .
on sunday , former socialist party presidential candidate segolene royal said sarkozy was " trampling on france 's human rights tradition , " and told canal plus television that it was " heinous , shocking and even unacceptable " that france gave backing to " a system of torture in prison . "
apparently shaken by the controversy , sarkozy also defended his own human rights record , saying that he and his government had liberated the bulgarian nurses who had been sentenced to death by a libyan court for infecting children with aids .
" france liberated them , " sarkozy said .
" i demanded it and i obtained it . "
he also noted that he was the only french president to openly demand , at a press conference in beijing , that china outlaw the death penalty .
sarkozy noted that gadhafi would sign contracts later monday totaling about 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- .
these deals would involve a nuclear reactor for a seawater desalinization plant , a variety of armaments and other economic contracts , the french president said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in an interview published monday in the daily le parisien , junior minister for human rights rama yade fiercely criticized the date of the visit , which begins on international human rights day , and said she would not take part in the state dinner sarkozy was hosting for gadhafi later monday .
human rights minister scolded by sarkozy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy first reached out to gadhafi in libya in july " the choice of this is a strong symbol , i would even say scandalously strong , " yade told the daily .
" colonel gadhafi must understand that our country is not a doormat on which a leader , terrorist or not , can clean his bloody feet of their infamy . "
her comments apparently displeased sarkozy .
yade was summoned to the elysee palace and chided for her frankness .
she said after the meeting with the president that her comments had been taken out of context and " caricatured " and that she was not , " in principle , " against gadhafi 's visit .
however , the french people apparently agree with yade 's original stance .

kouchner also appeared to distance himself from the visit , adding that he was " resigned " to gadhafi coming to france and hoped that it would help speed up the " evolution " in libya .
in an opinion piece published monday in the daily la croix , kouchner described the high-wire act gadhafi 's visit has forced him - and france - to perform .
" no question of forgetting the name of the victims imputed to him , " he said .
" no question of forgetting their sufferings .

on sunday , former socialist party presidential candidate segolene royal said sarkozy was " trampling on france 's human rights tradition , " and told canal plus television that it was " heinous , shocking and even unacceptable " that france gave backing to " a system of torture in prison . "
apparently shaken by the controversy , sarkozy also defended his own human rights record , saying that he and his government had liberated the bulgarian nurses who had been sentenced to death by a libyan court for infecting children with aids .
" france liberated them , " sarkozy said .
" i demanded it and i obtained it . "
he also noted that he was the only french president to openly demand , at a press conference in beijing , that china outlaw the death penalty .

with germany preparing for the european championships in austria and switzerland next june , löw is keen to have at least one of his goalkeepers playing regularly in the run up to the tournament .
lehmann has been replaced by spaniard manuel almunia at arsenal and has only played three times for the first team all season .
timo hildebrand , germany 's number two keeper , is in a similar situation at valencia where he has been struggling to hold down a place since his summer move to spain from stuttgart .
löw has made it clear that 38-year-old lehmann must ascertain what his chances of winning back his place in the arsenal side are before the germany coach holds talks with his number one over the christmas break . germany coach fretting over benched keepers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw intends to discuss lehmann 's future at christmas " wenger and jens are both people who have done a great deal for arsenal , " löw told german sports agency sid .
" they should be able to discuss the matter and get a better understanding of the situation .
it is crucial jens has a concrete understanding of what is going on and is not trying to guess . "
after suffering an elbow and achilles tendon injury in september , lehmann has been unable to win his place back between the posts from almunia , a situation that worries löw .
" naturally , it is important a player has regular games , so he can stay sharp and get into a rhythm , " the germany coach added .
lehmann has been linked with a return to the bundesliga during the winter break , with vfl wolfsburg expressing their interest in the former borussia dortmund stopper .
while lehmann himself has given no indication that he wants to leave arsenal , he has consistently made comments about his situation at the north london club during his time on the sidelines , leading to a rift with his rival almunia and angering his employers .
arsenal boss dismisses wolves interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenger wo n't sell lehmann despite the goalie 's criticism despite lehmann 's vocal displeasure , arsenal boss wenger has dismissed rumors linking his unsettled goalkeeper with a return to his native germany in the january transfer window .
" it 's not true , " wenger said .
" it 's only newspaper talk because nothing concrete has been discussed between me and jens and nothing between me and wolfsburg . at the moment i do not want to speculate on any movement in the transfer window .
we want to focus on our games and jens is part of that . "
back in germany , both oliver bierhoff , the national team 's general manager , and former number one oliver kahn have urged lehmann to switch clubs in january if he wants to keep his euro 2008 dreams alive .
quit now to keep dream alive , say bierhoff and kahn " looking ahead at euro 2008 it is certainly important that we have a goalkeeper who plays all the time .
should that not be the case , i would advise him to look for a new club during the winter break where he can play continuously , " bierhoff said in october .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kahn and lehmann have been bitter rivals for years kahn , who lost his place in the national team to lehmann before the 2006 world cup , recently told his bitter rival to quit arsenal for the sake of his international career , should the future in london remain bleak .
" jens lehmann 's services to the national team have been impeccable , but you ca n't play in a european championship when you are not in the team , " kahn told dsf television .

" as far as the candidacy of medvedev is concerned , i have known him for more than 17 years , i have worked with him closely all these years , and i completely and fully support this candidacy , " putin said in video footage shown on state television .
putin will step down following the march 2 presidential elections after serving two consecutive terms .
while there is no clear favorite in the race to replace him , it is expected that any candidate which has putin 's endorsement will go on to win the election .
despite the rise through the ranks of fellow first deputy prime minister sergei ivanov and the appointment of the little-known finance expert viktor zubkov as prime minister in september , medvedev is now seen as the front runner for the presidency after gaining putin 's official endorsement .
putin 's announcement ends months of speculation fuelled by the president 's erratic promotions and random praise of members of his retinue .

a lawyer by trade , medvedev is a kremlin insider seen as a staunch putin loyalist , owing his rise to power to the incumbent president who hired him in the early 1990s to work on his staff at the saint petersburg local government .
he served as putin 's campaign manager for his successful 2000 election run and was rewarded for his services first with the position of presidential chief of staff and then the post at gazprom .
medvedev also heads the kremlin 's " national projects , " a program created to use russia 's massive profits from energy sales to rebuild crumbling infrastructure and social support system .

unlike putin , medvedev has no known connections with the kgb , but is considered a top player within the saint petersburg clan that dominates the upper echelons of power .

even if you 're not a great fan of feathered fowl or fruit-baring trees , surely the thought is what counts ? but what if your true love is a soccer club and on the first day of christmas it gives you the mocking grin of a fierce rival ?
would you still be so graceful in receiving this gift ?
or would you be looking for a largely flightless bird to stick where the christmas sun do n't shine ?
this was the dilemma facing a supporter of german soccer club schalke 04 recently .
passionate schalke fan tobias meier joyfully opened the first door of his treasured club advent calendar expecting a chocolate treat and instead received the beaming visage of werder bremen 's midfielder diego .
schalke santa hid the terrible truth bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's fans did n't react well to the bremen surprise if the shock of finding the brazilian nemesis of your beloved team behind door no. 1 was n't enough , tobias discovered this was not an isolated case .
his father peter also had the same problem with the calendar , which sported a picture of santa claus in the team 's royal blue uniform on the front .
after recovering from the shock , the meiers investigated further with the help of the club authorities and found out that a mistake at the italian printers meant roughly 40 of the 40,000 schalke calendars were printed with pictures of bremen stars inside .
" we were totally shocked , " tobias told german tabloid bild .
" we immediately opened the other doors and found there were bremen stars behind every window - it was n't the surprise i was expecting . "
both schalke and bremen had their club calendars made at the same printers near milan which led to the mix-up .
cut-price calendars not flying off the shelves schalke 's club shop in gelsenkirchen has now reduced the remaining advent gifts bearing the wrong pictures from 2.95 euros -lrb- $ 4.30 -rrb- to 1.45 euros , but , unsurprisingly , there are few takers for the tainted calendars even at a knock-down price .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : möller does n't expect any bremen stars under the tree the firm who printed the calendars is offering to swap any bearing the mistake and schalke manager andreas möller has issued a reassurance to worried fans .
" it 's no problem , " he said tongue firmly planted in cheek , " it 's not as though anyone will find a werder bremen player under their christmas tree . "

the serbian province could declare independence any time . key european powers and the united states are gearing up to recognize kosovo as an independent state , while serbia , backed by russia , has said it will never accept a self-ruling kosovo . in response to the deadlock , the so-called kosovo troika - made up of the eu , the us and russia - ended four months of un-initiated talks on friday by concluding that negotiations had failed . us secretary of state condoleezza rice has also made it clear that it is too late for negotiations on kosovo 's future status - a stance that her russian counterpart sergei lavrov criticized on the weekend as being the biggest obstacle to a solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's ethnic albanian parties are united in their calls for independence " neither party was willing to cede its position on the fundamental question of sovereignty over kosovo , " the troika report said .
" this is regrettable , as a negotiated settlement is in the best interests of both parties . " the mediators said the two sides did find some issues they could agree on and promised to work together on reconciliation , even if they could n't break through on the big question of kosovo 's status . kosovo 's albanian majority appealed to the west on sunday to back their bid for independence .
a joint statement from government and opposition leaders said : " the people of kosovo urgently need clarity about their future . " the eu 's foreign ministers will meet behind closed doors on monday with the eu envoy to the kosovo talks , wolfgang ischinger , to discuss ways to prevent violence in the case that kosovo albanians declare independence . eu letter reveals bloc 's internal divide in a separate letter addressed to the european union member states , germany , france , britain and italy said that continuing talks would be pointless . diplomats said that the letter was intended for those countries in the bloc that continue to advocate further talks , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper reported . romania , slovakia and spain have been hesitant to back independence for kosovo due to fears that the move would encourage their own ethnic minorities to break away .
cyprus , which is divided into a greek and internationally unrecognized turkish portion , has also found the one-sidedness of the kosovo independence proposal hard to swallow , as has greece . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger said the troika did everything " humanly possible " to negotiate a deal " it 's regrettable that the eu member states , due to their respective domestic situations , have reached different conclusions , " the eu 's coordinator for the stability pact for south-eastern europe , erhard busek , told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
" the different positions of eu states on the issue of kosovo 's status invite russia and china to interfere . " solana : kosovo 's future is in the eu leaders of the 27-nation bloc are to confirm the impasse in a statement at a summit this coming friday , diplomats told reuters news agency . they are also expected to verify their willingness to dispatch police and justice missions and appoint a high representative to oversee kosovo if asked to by the kosovo-albanian government and the united nations . " it is clear that the future of serbia and kosovo lies in the european union .
that 's something that both sides agree on , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in an interview with germany 's welt am sonntag newspaper . the un security council is due to discuss the kosovo troika 's report on dec .

the fact that medvedev 's not a member of putin 's party makes it even more likely that he 'll become russia 's next leader . " i fully support this candidacy , " putin on monday , dec .
10 , was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency after four parties , headed by the ruling united russia , named medvedev as their candidate .
" as far as the candidacy of medvedev is concerned , i have known him for more than 17 years , i have worked with him closely all these years , and i completely and fully support this candidacy , " putin said in video footage shown on state television .
putin will step down following the march 2 presidential elections after serving two consecutive terms .
while there is no clear favorite in the race to replace him , it is expected that any candidate which has putin 's endorsement will go on to win the election .
despite the rise through the ranks of fellow first deputy prime minister sergei ivanov and the appointment of the little-known finance expert viktor zubkov as prime minister in september , medvedev is now seen as the front runner for the presidency after gaining putin 's official endorsement .
putin 's announcement ends months of speculation fuelled by the president 's erratic promotions and random praise of members of his retinue .
medvedev set to be pro-kremlin parties ' candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev stands to gain four presidential nominations medvedev , who chairs energy giant gazprom 's supervisory board , has an extra advantage in addition to that .
as he is not affiliated with any party he can be nominated by all four pro-kremlin political parties - united russia , a just russia , a civil front and the agrarian party - as their candidate .
the four parties are set to officially announce medvedev as their candidate for the presidential elections at their upcoming party congresses .
a lawyer by trade , medvedev is a kremlin insider seen as a staunch putin loyalist , owing his rise to power to the incumbent president who hired him in the early 1990s to work on his staff at the saint petersburg local government .
he served as putin 's campaign manager for his successful 2000 election run and was rewarded for his services first with the position of presidential chief of staff and then the post at gazprom .
medvedev also heads the kremlin 's " national projects , " a program created to use russia 's massive profits from energy sales to rebuild crumbling infrastructure and social support system .

unlike putin , medvedev has no known connections with the kgb , but is considered a top player within the saint petersburg clan that dominates the upper echelons of power .
with his in-depth knowledge of the bureaucracy , medvedev is credited with having helped build the pyramid of power that has contributed to securing putin 's position at the top .

this was the dilemma facing a supporter of german soccer club schalke 04 recently .
passionate schalke fan tobias meier joyfully opened the first door of his treasured club advent calendar expecting a chocolate treat and instead received the beaming visage of werder bremen 's midfielder diego .

his father peter also had the same problem with the calendar , which sported a picture of santa claus in the team 's royal blue uniform on the front .
after recovering from the shock , the meiers investigated further with the help of the club authorities and found out that a mistake at the italian printers meant roughly 40 of the 40,000 schalke calendars were printed with pictures of bremen stars inside .
" we were totally shocked , " tobias told german tabloid bild .
" we immediately opened the other doors and found there were bremen stars behind every window - it was n't the surprise i was expecting . "
both schalke and bremen had their club calendars made at the same printers near milan which led to the mix-up .

" as far as the candidacy of medvedev is concerned , i have known him for more than 17 years , i have worked with him closely all these years , and i completely and fully support this candidacy , " putin said in video footage shown on state television .
putin will step down following the march 2 presidential elections after serving two consecutive terms .
while there is no clear favorite in the race to replace him , it is expected that any candidate which has putin 's endorsement will go on to win the election .
despite the rise through the ranks of fellow first deputy prime minister sergei ivanov and the appointment of the little-known finance expert viktor zubkov as prime minister in september , medvedev is now seen as the front runner for the presidency after gaining putin 's official endorsement .
putin 's announcement ends months of speculation fuelled by the president 's erratic promotions and random praise of members of his retinue .
medvedev set to be pro-kremlin parties ' candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev stands to gain four presidential nominations medvedev , who chairs energy giant gazprom 's supervisory board , has an extra advantage in addition to that .
as he is not affiliated with any party he can be nominated by all four pro-kremlin political parties - united russia , a just russia , a civil front and the agrarian party - as their candidate .
the four parties are set to officially announce medvedev as their candidate for the presidential elections at their upcoming party congresses .
a lawyer by trade , medvedev is a kremlin insider seen as a staunch putin loyalist , owing his rise to power to the incumbent president who hired him in the early 1990s to work on his staff at the saint petersburg local government .
he served as putin 's campaign manager for his successful 2000 election run and was rewarded for his services first with the position of presidential chief of staff and then the post at gazprom .
medvedev also heads the kremlin 's " national projects , " a program created to use russia 's massive profits from energy sales to rebuild crumbling infrastructure and social support system .
putin 's heir apparent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev contributed to putin 's rise to power medvedev 's appointment as first deputy prime minister in charge of national projects in health , education and housing in november 2005 first started the rumors that putin had chosen his heir apparent .
unlike putin , medvedev has no known connections with the kgb , but is considered a top player within the saint petersburg clan that dominates the upper echelons of power .
with his in-depth knowledge of the bureaucracy , medvedev is credited with having helped build the pyramid of power that has contributed to securing putin 's position at the top .
but he has also said that he feels closer to liberal ideas of democracy and the free market and is seen as moderate in his western-leaning views .
he once said his foreign policy views were " european . " dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 , the eu , the us and russia said further talks over kosovo 's status would be superfluous .
the serbian province could declare independence any time . key european powers and the united states are gearing up to recognize kosovo as an independent state , while serbia , backed by russia , has said it will never accept a self-ruling kosovo . in response to the deadlock , the so-called kosovo troika - made up of the eu , the us and russia - ended four months of un-initiated talks on friday by concluding that negotiations had failed . us secretary of state condoleezza rice has also made it clear that it is too late for negotiations on kosovo 's future status - a stance that her russian counterpart sergei lavrov criticized on the weekend as being the biggest obstacle to a solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's ethnic albanian parties are united in their calls for independence " neither party was willing to cede its position on the fundamental question of sovereignty over kosovo , " the troika report said .
" this is regrettable , as a negotiated settlement is in the best interests of both parties . " the mediators said the two sides did find some issues they could agree on and promised to work together on reconciliation , even if they could n't break through on the big question of kosovo 's status . kosovo 's albanian majority appealed to the west on sunday to back their bid for independence .
a joint statement from government and opposition leaders said : " the people of kosovo urgently need clarity about their future . " the eu 's foreign ministers will meet behind closed doors on monday with the eu envoy to the kosovo talks , wolfgang ischinger , to discuss ways to prevent violence in the case that kosovo albanians declare independence . eu letter reveals bloc 's internal divide in a separate letter addressed to the european union member states , germany , france , britain and italy said that continuing talks would be pointless . diplomats said that the letter was intended for those countries in the bloc that continue to advocate further talks , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper reported . romania , slovakia and spain have been hesitant to back independence for kosovo due to fears that the move would encourage their own ethnic minorities to break away .
cyprus , which is divided into a greek and internationally unrecognized turkish portion , has also found the one-sidedness of the kosovo independence proposal hard to swallow , as has greece . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger said the troika did everything " humanly possible " to negotiate a deal " it 's regrettable that the eu member states , due to their respective domestic situations , have reached different conclusions , " the eu 's coordinator for the stability pact for south-eastern europe , erhard busek , told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
" the different positions of eu states on the issue of kosovo 's status invite russia and china to interfere . " solana : kosovo 's future is in the eu leaders of the 27-nation bloc are to confirm the impasse in a statement at a summit this coming friday , diplomats told reuters news agency . they are also expected to verify their willingness to dispatch police and justice missions and appoint a high representative to oversee kosovo if asked to by the kosovo-albanian government and the united nations . " it is clear that the future of serbia and kosovo lies in the european union .
that 's something that both sides agree on , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in an interview with germany 's welt am sonntag newspaper . the un security council is due to discuss the kosovo troika 's report on dec .

10 , the eu , the us and russia said further talks over kosovo 's status would be superfluous .
the serbian province could declare independence any time . key european powers and the united states are gearing up to recognize kosovo as an independent state , while serbia , backed by russia , has said it will never accept a self-ruling kosovo . in response to the deadlock , the so-called kosovo troika - made up of the eu , the us and russia - ended four months of un-initiated talks on friday by concluding that negotiations had failed . us secretary of state condoleezza rice has also made it clear that it is too late for negotiations on kosovo 's future status - a stance that her russian counterpart sergei lavrov criticized on the weekend as being the biggest obstacle to a solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's ethnic albanian parties are united in their calls for independence " neither party was willing to cede its position on the fundamental question of sovereignty over kosovo , " the troika report said .
" this is regrettable , as a negotiated settlement is in the best interests of both parties . " the mediators said the two sides did find some issues they could agree on and promised to work together on reconciliation , even if they could n't break through on the big question of kosovo 's status . kosovo 's albanian majority appealed to the west on sunday to back their bid for independence .
a joint statement from government and opposition leaders said : " the people of kosovo urgently need clarity about their future . " the eu 's foreign ministers will meet behind closed doors on monday with the eu envoy to the kosovo talks , wolfgang ischinger , to discuss ways to prevent violence in the case that kosovo albanians declare independence . eu letter reveals bloc 's internal divide in a separate letter addressed to the european union member states , germany , france , britain and italy said that continuing talks would be pointless . diplomats said that the letter was intended for those countries in the bloc that continue to advocate further talks , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper reported . romania , slovakia and spain have been hesitant to back independence for kosovo due to fears that the move would encourage their own ethnic minorities to break away .
cyprus , which is divided into a greek and internationally unrecognized turkish portion , has also found the one-sidedness of the kosovo independence proposal hard to swallow , as has greece . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger said the troika did everything " humanly possible " to negotiate a deal " it 's regrettable that the eu member states , due to their respective domestic situations , have reached different conclusions , " the eu 's coordinator for the stability pact for south-eastern europe , erhard busek , told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
" the different positions of eu states on the issue of kosovo 's status invite russia and china to interfere . " solana : kosovo 's future is in the eu leaders of the 27-nation bloc are to confirm the impasse in a statement at a summit this coming friday , diplomats told reuters news agency . they are also expected to verify their willingness to dispatch police and justice missions and appoint a high representative to oversee kosovo if asked to by the kosovo-albanian government and the united nations . " it is clear that the future of serbia and kosovo lies in the european union .
that 's something that both sides agree on , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in an interview with germany 's welt am sonntag newspaper . the un security council is due to discuss the kosovo troika 's report on dec .

what was your impression of the first week ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has said it 's ready to discuss climate goals , bals said christoph bals : there was one really big shift in the position of the rapidly developing countries , mainly in china .
this was very constructive .
it was just two years ago that china said that only in the second half of the century would they be ready to negotiate seriously about commitments , and now they seem to be ready to start with these negotiations .
this was a very constructive spirit from china and also from other rapidly developing countries , like mexico , like south africa and like brazil . the united states produces the most greenhouse gas emissions , and is one of the only industrial countries that has not ratified the kyoto protocol .
in the past the us has tried to block negotiations .
is that true this year as well ? they are not really blocking negotiations at the moment , but they are still trying to start a parallel process for voluntary action .
this would undermine the entire process .
they want to have major conferences next year just to discuss this issue of voluntary activities .
this is one way of blocking without really blocking the negotiations . the united states says it wants to meet with the top industrial nations to discuss technology transfer to developing countries .
is n't this an important issue ? it is an extremely important issue .
that is why it should be a strong part of the un framework convention on climate change agenda .
we need a legally binding framework and we need a strong incentive structure for this technology transfer .
there is no reason why this could n't happen .
but i do n't think we need an additional process for technology transfer . people have different expectations for bali .
some are saying the least common denominator would be agreement on a timeline for a roadmap for setting up a new climate change protocol by 2009 .
what do you think the next week will bring ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knowing what exact steps to take next will be key to slowing climate change , bals said we definitely need a roadmap , and we need a strong mandate for the roadmap , so we know what direction it is going in .
but this must be ambitious , which means that we need some targets for 2020 .
we need an agreement that the peak of climate emissions should be between 2015 and 2020 to prevent global climate change .
parts of this ambitious roadmap are also technology transfer , a clear concept for avoided deforestation , and the future of the emissions trading system . but what we need now are first steps showing that we want to start with concrete steps .
i think we will have pilot projects in the forestry field of how we want to prevent deforestation . you are saying that topics like avoided deforestation , or including airline emissions and transportation in general into a post-kyoto protocol , will be touched on here , but will not go into a bali agreement ? we will not get a bali agreement , we will get a bali mandate - that is what we are hoping for .
anybody who wants a bali agreement does n't take seriously the fact that we want a great transformation of society , and this ca n't be organized in a 14-day conference .
we need 10 conferences in the next two years to organize this .
what we need now is a strong mandate , so that we can begin to negotiate with all relevant actors .
that is my hope for the end of this week . interview : kateri jochum , bali , indonesia send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the eu 's foreign ministers will meet behind closed doors on monday with the eu envoy to the kosovo talks , wolfgang ischinger , to discuss ways to prevent violence in the case that kosovo albanians declare independence . eu letter reveals bloc 's internal divide in a separate letter addressed to the european union member states , germany , france , britain and italy said that continuing talks would be pointless . diplomats said that the letter was intended for those countries in the bloc that continue to advocate further talks , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper reported . romania , slovakia and spain have been hesitant to back independence for kosovo due to fears that the move would encourage their own ethnic minorities to break away .
cyprus , which is divided into a greek and internationally unrecognized turkish portion , has also found the one-sidedness of the kosovo independence proposal hard to swallow , as has greece . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger said the troika did everything " humanly possible " to negotiate a deal " it 's regrettable that the eu member states , due to their respective domestic situations , have reached different conclusions , " the eu 's coordinator for the stability pact for south-eastern europe , erhard busek , told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
" the different positions of eu states on the issue of kosovo 's status invite russia and china to interfere . " solana : kosovo 's future is in the eu leaders of the 27-nation bloc are to confirm the impasse in a statement at a summit this coming friday , diplomats told reuters news agency . they are also expected to verify their willingness to dispatch police and justice missions and appoint a high representative to oversee kosovo if asked to by the kosovo-albanian government and the united nations . " it is clear that the future of serbia and kosovo lies in the european union .
that 's something that both sides agree on , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in an interview with germany 's welt am sonntag newspaper . the un security council is due to discuss the kosovo troika 's report on dec .

with germany preparing for the european championships in austria and switzerland next june , löw is keen to have at least one of his goalkeepers playing regularly in the run up to the tournament .
lehmann has been replaced by spaniard manuel almunia at arsenal and has only played three times for the first team all season .
timo hildebrand , germany 's number two keeper , is in a similar situation at valencia where he has been struggling to hold down a place since his summer move to spain from stuttgart .
löw has made it clear that 38-year-old lehmann must ascertain what his chances of winning back his place in the arsenal side are before the germany coach holds talks with his number one over the christmas break . germany coach fretting over benched keepers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw intends to discuss lehmann 's future at christmas " wenger and jens are both people who have done a great deal for arsenal , " löw told german sports agency sid .
" they should be able to discuss the matter and get a better understanding of the situation .
it is crucial jens has a concrete understanding of what is going on and is not trying to guess . "
after suffering an elbow and achilles tendon injury in september , lehmann has been unable to win his place back between the posts from almunia , a situation that worries löw .
" naturally , it is important a player has regular games , so he can stay sharp and get into a rhythm , " the germany coach added .
lehmann has been linked with a return to the bundesliga during the winter break , with vfl wolfsburg expressing their interest in the former borussia dortmund stopper .
while lehmann himself has given no indication that he wants to leave arsenal , he has consistently made comments about his situation at the north london club during his time on the sidelines , leading to a rift with his rival almunia and angering his employers .

" it 's only newspaper talk because nothing concrete has been discussed between me and jens and nothing between me and wolfsburg . at the moment i do not want to speculate on any movement in the transfer window .
we want to focus on our games and jens is part of that . "
back in germany , both oliver bierhoff , the national team 's general manager , and former number one oliver kahn have urged lehmann to switch clubs in january if he wants to keep his euro 2008 dreams alive .
quit now to keep dream alive , say bierhoff and kahn " looking ahead at euro 2008 it is certainly important that we have a goalkeeper who plays all the time .

what was your impression of the first week ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has said it 's ready to discuss climate goals , bals said christoph bals : there was one really big shift in the position of the rapidly developing countries , mainly in china .
this was very constructive .
it was just two years ago that china said that only in the second half of the century would they be ready to negotiate seriously about commitments , and now they seem to be ready to start with these negotiations .
this was a very constructive spirit from china and also from other rapidly developing countries , like mexico , like south africa and like brazil . the united states produces the most greenhouse gas emissions , and is one of the only industrial countries that has not ratified the kyoto protocol .
in the past the us has tried to block negotiations .
is that true this year as well ? they are not really blocking negotiations at the moment , but they are still trying to start a parallel process for voluntary action .
this would undermine the entire process .
they want to have major conferences next year just to discuss this issue of voluntary activities .
this is one way of blocking without really blocking the negotiations . the united states says it wants to meet with the top industrial nations to discuss technology transfer to developing countries .
is n't this an important issue ? it is an extremely important issue .
that is why it should be a strong part of the un framework convention on climate change agenda .
we need a legally binding framework and we need a strong incentive structure for this technology transfer .
there is no reason why this could n't happen .
but i do n't think we need an additional process for technology transfer . people have different expectations for bali .
some are saying the least common denominator would be agreement on a timeline for a roadmap for setting up a new climate change protocol by 2009 .
what do you think the next week will bring ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knowing what exact steps to take next will be key to slowing climate change , bals said we definitely need a roadmap , and we need a strong mandate for the roadmap , so we know what direction it is going in .
but this must be ambitious , which means that we need some targets for 2020 .
we need an agreement that the peak of climate emissions should be between 2015 and 2020 to prevent global climate change .
parts of this ambitious roadmap are also technology transfer , a clear concept for avoided deforestation , and the future of the emissions trading system . but what we need now are first steps showing that we want to start with concrete steps .
i think we will have pilot projects in the forestry field of how we want to prevent deforestation . you are saying that topics like avoided deforestation , or including airline emissions and transportation in general into a post-kyoto protocol , will be touched on here , but will not go into a bali agreement ? we will not get a bali agreement , we will get a bali mandate - that is what we are hoping for .
anybody who wants a bali agreement does n't take seriously the fact that we want a great transformation of society , and this ca n't be organized in a 14-day conference .
we need 10 conferences in the next two years to organize this .
what we need now is a strong mandate , so that we can begin to negotiate with all relevant actors .

or would you be looking for a largely flightless bird to stick where the christmas sun do n't shine ?
this was the dilemma facing a supporter of german soccer club schalke 04 recently .
passionate schalke fan tobias meier joyfully opened the first door of his treasured club advent calendar expecting a chocolate treat and instead received the beaming visage of werder bremen 's midfielder diego .

his father peter also had the same problem with the calendar , which sported a picture of santa claus in the team 's royal blue uniform on the front .
after recovering from the shock , the meiers investigated further with the help of the club authorities and found out that a mistake at the italian printers meant roughly 40 of the 40,000 schalke calendars were printed with pictures of bremen stars inside .

" we immediately opened the other doors and found there were bremen stars behind every window - it was n't the surprise i was expecting . "
both schalke and bremen had their club calendars made at the same printers near milan which led to the mix-up .

10 , the eu , the us and russia said further talks over kosovo 's status would be superfluous .
the serbian province could declare independence any time . key european powers and the united states are gearing up to recognize kosovo as an independent state , while serbia , backed by russia , has said it will never accept a self-ruling kosovo . in response to the deadlock , the so-called kosovo troika - made up of the eu , the us and russia - ended four months of un-initiated talks on friday by concluding that negotiations had failed . us secretary of state condoleezza rice has also made it clear that it is too late for negotiations on kosovo 's future status - a stance that her russian counterpart sergei lavrov criticized on the weekend as being the biggest obstacle to a solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's ethnic albanian parties are united in their calls for independence " neither party was willing to cede its position on the fundamental question of sovereignty over kosovo , " the troika report said .
" this is regrettable , as a negotiated settlement is in the best interests of both parties . " the mediators said the two sides did find some issues they could agree on and promised to work together on reconciliation , even if they could n't break through on the big question of kosovo 's status . kosovo 's albanian majority appealed to the west on sunday to back their bid for independence .
a joint statement from government and opposition leaders said : " the people of kosovo urgently need clarity about their future . " the eu 's foreign ministers will meet behind closed doors on monday with the eu envoy to the kosovo talks , wolfgang ischinger , to discuss ways to prevent violence in the case that kosovo albanians declare independence . eu letter reveals bloc 's internal divide in a separate letter addressed to the european union member states , germany , france , britain and italy said that continuing talks would be pointless . diplomats said that the letter was intended for those countries in the bloc that continue to advocate further talks , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper reported . romania , slovakia and spain have been hesitant to back independence for kosovo due to fears that the move would encourage their own ethnic minorities to break away .
cyprus , which is divided into a greek and internationally unrecognized turkish portion , has also found the one-sidedness of the kosovo independence proposal hard to swallow , as has greece . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger said the troika did everything " humanly possible " to negotiate a deal " it 's regrettable that the eu member states , due to their respective domestic situations , have reached different conclusions , " the eu 's coordinator for the stability pact for south-eastern europe , erhard busek , told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .

what was your impression of the first week ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has said it 's ready to discuss climate goals , bals said christoph bals : there was one really big shift in the position of the rapidly developing countries , mainly in china .
this was very constructive .
it was just two years ago that china said that only in the second half of the century would they be ready to negotiate seriously about commitments , and now they seem to be ready to start with these negotiations .
this was a very constructive spirit from china and also from other rapidly developing countries , like mexico , like south africa and like brazil . the united states produces the most greenhouse gas emissions , and is one of the only industrial countries that has not ratified the kyoto protocol .
in the past the us has tried to block negotiations .
is that true this year as well ? they are not really blocking negotiations at the moment , but they are still trying to start a parallel process for voluntary action .
this would undermine the entire process .
they want to have major conferences next year just to discuss this issue of voluntary activities .
this is one way of blocking without really blocking the negotiations . the united states says it wants to meet with the top industrial nations to discuss technology transfer to developing countries .
is n't this an important issue ? it is an extremely important issue .
that is why it should be a strong part of the un framework convention on climate change agenda .
we need a legally binding framework and we need a strong incentive structure for this technology transfer .
there is no reason why this could n't happen .
but i do n't think we need an additional process for technology transfer . people have different expectations for bali .
some are saying the least common denominator would be agreement on a timeline for a roadmap for setting up a new climate change protocol by 2009 .
what do you think the next week will bring ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knowing what exact steps to take next will be key to slowing climate change , bals said we definitely need a roadmap , and we need a strong mandate for the roadmap , so we know what direction it is going in .
but this must be ambitious , which means that we need some targets for 2020 .
we need an agreement that the peak of climate emissions should be between 2015 and 2020 to prevent global climate change .
parts of this ambitious roadmap are also technology transfer , a clear concept for avoided deforestation , and the future of the emissions trading system . but what we need now are first steps showing that we want to start with concrete steps .
i think we will have pilot projects in the forestry field of how we want to prevent deforestation . you are saying that topics like avoided deforestation , or including airline emissions and transportation in general into a post-kyoto protocol , will be touched on here , but will not go into a bali agreement ? we will not get a bali agreement , we will get a bali mandate - that is what we are hoping for .
anybody who wants a bali agreement does n't take seriously the fact that we want a great transformation of society , and this ca n't be organized in a 14-day conference .
we need 10 conferences in the next two years to organize this .
what we need now is a strong mandate , so that we can begin to negotiate with all relevant actors .

what was your impression of the first week ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has said it 's ready to discuss climate goals , bals said christoph bals : there was one really big shift in the position of the rapidly developing countries , mainly in china .
this was very constructive .
it was just two years ago that china said that only in the second half of the century would they be ready to negotiate seriously about commitments , and now they seem to be ready to start with these negotiations .
this was a very constructive spirit from china and also from other rapidly developing countries , like mexico , like south africa and like brazil . the united states produces the most greenhouse gas emissions , and is one of the only industrial countries that has not ratified the kyoto protocol .
in the past the us has tried to block negotiations .
is that true this year as well ? they are not really blocking negotiations at the moment , but they are still trying to start a parallel process for voluntary action .
this would undermine the entire process .
they want to have major conferences next year just to discuss this issue of voluntary activities .
this is one way of blocking without really blocking the negotiations . the united states says it wants to meet with the top industrial nations to discuss technology transfer to developing countries .
is n't this an important issue ? it is an extremely important issue .
that is why it should be a strong part of the un framework convention on climate change agenda .
we need a legally binding framework and we need a strong incentive structure for this technology transfer .
there is no reason why this could n't happen .
but i do n't think we need an additional process for technology transfer . people have different expectations for bali .
some are saying the least common denominator would be agreement on a timeline for a roadmap for setting up a new climate change protocol by 2009 .
what do you think the next week will bring ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knowing what exact steps to take next will be key to slowing climate change , bals said we definitely need a roadmap , and we need a strong mandate for the roadmap , so we know what direction it is going in .
but this must be ambitious , which means that we need some targets for 2020 .
we need an agreement that the peak of climate emissions should be between 2015 and 2020 to prevent global climate change .
parts of this ambitious roadmap are also technology transfer , a clear concept for avoided deforestation , and the future of the emissions trading system . but what we need now are first steps showing that we want to start with concrete steps .
i think we will have pilot projects in the forestry field of how we want to prevent deforestation . you are saying that topics like avoided deforestation , or including airline emissions and transportation in general into a post-kyoto protocol , will be touched on here , but will not go into a bali agreement ? we will not get a bali agreement , we will get a bali mandate - that is what we are hoping for .
anybody who wants a bali agreement does n't take seriously the fact that we want a great transformation of society , and this ca n't be organized in a 14-day conference .
we need 10 conferences in the next two years to organize this .
what we need now is a strong mandate , so that we can begin to negotiate with all relevant actors .
that is my hope for the end of this week . interview : kateri jochum , bali , indonesia send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the fact that medvedev 's not a member of putin 's party makes it even more likely that he 'll become russia 's next leader . " i fully support this candidacy , " putin on monday , dec .
10 , was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency after four parties , headed by the ruling united russia , named medvedev as their candidate .
" as far as the candidacy of medvedev is concerned , i have known him for more than 17 years , i have worked with him closely all these years , and i completely and fully support this candidacy , " putin said in video footage shown on state television .
putin will step down following the march 2 presidential elections after serving two consecutive terms .
while there is no clear favorite in the race to replace him , it is expected that any candidate which has putin 's endorsement will go on to win the election .
despite the rise through the ranks of fellow first deputy prime minister sergei ivanov and the appointment of the little-known finance expert viktor zubkov as prime minister in september , medvedev is now seen as the front runner for the presidency after gaining putin 's official endorsement .
putin 's announcement ends months of speculation fuelled by the president 's erratic promotions and random praise of members of his retinue .
medvedev set to be pro-kremlin parties ' candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev stands to gain four presidential nominations medvedev , who chairs energy giant gazprom 's supervisory board , has an extra advantage in addition to that .
as he is not affiliated with any party he can be nominated by all four pro-kremlin political parties - united russia , a just russia , a civil front and the agrarian party - as their candidate .
the four parties are set to officially announce medvedev as their candidate for the presidential elections at their upcoming party congresses .
a lawyer by trade , medvedev is a kremlin insider seen as a staunch putin loyalist , owing his rise to power to the incumbent president who hired him in the early 1990s to work on his staff at the saint petersburg local government .
he served as putin 's campaign manager for his successful 2000 election run and was rewarded for his services first with the position of presidential chief of staff and then the post at gazprom .
medvedev also heads the kremlin 's " national projects , " a program created to use russia 's massive profits from energy sales to rebuild crumbling infrastructure and social support system .
putin 's heir apparent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev contributed to putin 's rise to power medvedev 's appointment as first deputy prime minister in charge of national projects in health , education and housing in november 2005 first started the rumors that putin had chosen his heir apparent .
unlike putin , medvedev has no known connections with the kgb , but is considered a top player within the saint petersburg clan that dominates the upper echelons of power .
with his in-depth knowledge of the bureaucracy , medvedev is credited with having helped build the pyramid of power that has contributed to securing putin 's position at the top .
but he has also said that he feels closer to liberal ideas of democracy and the free market and is seen as moderate in his western-leaning views .

what was your impression of the first week ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has said it 's ready to discuss climate goals , bals said christoph bals : there was one really big shift in the position of the rapidly developing countries , mainly in china .
this was very constructive .
it was just two years ago that china said that only in the second half of the century would they be ready to negotiate seriously about commitments , and now they seem to be ready to start with these negotiations .
this was a very constructive spirit from china and also from other rapidly developing countries , like mexico , like south africa and like brazil . the united states produces the most greenhouse gas emissions , and is one of the only industrial countries that has not ratified the kyoto protocol .
in the past the us has tried to block negotiations .
is that true this year as well ? they are not really blocking negotiations at the moment , but they are still trying to start a parallel process for voluntary action .
this would undermine the entire process .
they want to have major conferences next year just to discuss this issue of voluntary activities .
this is one way of blocking without really blocking the negotiations . the united states says it wants to meet with the top industrial nations to discuss technology transfer to developing countries .
is n't this an important issue ? it is an extremely important issue .
that is why it should be a strong part of the un framework convention on climate change agenda .
we need a legally binding framework and we need a strong incentive structure for this technology transfer .
there is no reason why this could n't happen .
but i do n't think we need an additional process for technology transfer . people have different expectations for bali .
some are saying the least common denominator would be agreement on a timeline for a roadmap for setting up a new climate change protocol by 2009 .
what do you think the next week will bring ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knowing what exact steps to take next will be key to slowing climate change , bals said we definitely need a roadmap , and we need a strong mandate for the roadmap , so we know what direction it is going in .
but this must be ambitious , which means that we need some targets for 2020 .
we need an agreement that the peak of climate emissions should be between 2015 and 2020 to prevent global climate change .
parts of this ambitious roadmap are also technology transfer , a clear concept for avoided deforestation , and the future of the emissions trading system . but what we need now are first steps showing that we want to start with concrete steps .
i think we will have pilot projects in the forestry field of how we want to prevent deforestation . you are saying that topics like avoided deforestation , or including airline emissions and transportation in general into a post-kyoto protocol , will be touched on here , but will not go into a bali agreement ? we will not get a bali agreement , we will get a bali mandate - that is what we are hoping for .
anybody who wants a bali agreement does n't take seriously the fact that we want a great transformation of society , and this ca n't be organized in a 14-day conference .
we need 10 conferences in the next two years to organize this .
what we need now is a strong mandate , so that we can begin to negotiate with all relevant actors .
that is my hope for the end of this week . interview : kateri jochum , bali , indonesia send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 , was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency after four parties , headed by the ruling united russia , named medvedev as their candidate .
" as far as the candidacy of medvedev is concerned , i have known him for more than 17 years , i have worked with him closely all these years , and i completely and fully support this candidacy , " putin said in video footage shown on state television .
putin will step down following the march 2 presidential elections after serving two consecutive terms .
while there is no clear favorite in the race to replace him , it is expected that any candidate which has putin 's endorsement will go on to win the election .
despite the rise through the ranks of fellow first deputy prime minister sergei ivanov and the appointment of the little-known finance expert viktor zubkov as prime minister in september , medvedev is now seen as the front runner for the presidency after gaining putin 's official endorsement .
putin 's announcement ends months of speculation fuelled by the president 's erratic promotions and random praise of members of his retinue .
medvedev set to be pro-kremlin parties ' candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev stands to gain four presidential nominations medvedev , who chairs energy giant gazprom 's supervisory board , has an extra advantage in addition to that .
as he is not affiliated with any party he can be nominated by all four pro-kremlin political parties - united russia , a just russia , a civil front and the agrarian party - as their candidate .
the four parties are set to officially announce medvedev as their candidate for the presidential elections at their upcoming party congresses .
a lawyer by trade , medvedev is a kremlin insider seen as a staunch putin loyalist , owing his rise to power to the incumbent president who hired him in the early 1990s to work on his staff at the saint petersburg local government .
he served as putin 's campaign manager for his successful 2000 election run and was rewarded for his services first with the position of presidential chief of staff and then the post at gazprom .
medvedev also heads the kremlin 's " national projects , " a program created to use russia 's massive profits from energy sales to rebuild crumbling infrastructure and social support system .

unlike putin , medvedev has no known connections with the kgb , but is considered a top player within the saint petersburg clan that dominates the upper echelons of power .
with his in-depth knowledge of the bureaucracy , medvedev is credited with having helped build the pyramid of power that has contributed to securing putin 's position at the top .

" today , france is welcoming a head of state who decided definitively to renounce weapons of mass destruction , " sarkozy told journalists after a one-hour meeting with gadhafi at the elysee palace .
" france is welcoming a head of state who definitively renounced terrorism .
a head of state who has compensated the victims " of libyan state-sponsored terrorist acts .
the french president added that libya wanted to become a full-fledged member of the international community .
" it is my deepest conviction that france must speak with all those who want to be integrated in the international community , " he said .
apparently unfazed by the controversy that preceded his arrival in paris monday afternoon , a smiling gadhafi shook hands with sarkozy and waved to journalists .
gadhafi 's first official visit to france in 34 years has provoked an angry debate in france , with even members of sarkozy 's government openly critical of the visit .
in an interview published monday in the daily le parisien , junior minister for human rights rama yade fiercely criticized the date of the visit , which begins on international human rights day , and said she would not take part in the state dinner sarkozy was hosting for gadhafi later monday .

" she was right to speak as she did , " kouchner told france inter radio on monday .
kouchner also appeared to distance himself from the visit , adding that he was " resigned " to gadhafi coming to france and hoped that it would help speed up the " evolution " in libya .
in an opinion piece published monday in the daily la croix , kouchner described the high-wire act gadhafi 's visit has forced him - and france - to perform .
" no question of forgetting the name of the victims imputed to him , " he said .
" no question of forgetting their sufferings .

on sunday , former socialist party presidential candidate segolene royal said sarkozy was " trampling on france 's human rights tradition , " and told canal plus television that it was " heinous , shocking and even unacceptable " that france gave backing to " a system of torture in prison . "
apparently shaken by the controversy , sarkozy also defended his own human rights record , saying that he and his government had liberated the bulgarian nurses who had been sentenced to death by a libyan court for infecting children with aids .
" france liberated them , " sarkozy said .
" i demanded it and i obtained it . "
he also noted that he was the only french president to openly demand , at a press conference in beijing , that china outlaw the death penalty .
sarkozy noted that gadhafi would sign contracts later monday totaling about 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- .

human rights minister scolded by sarkozy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy first reached out to gadhafi in libya in july " the choice of this is a strong symbol , i would even say scandalously strong , " yade told the daily .
" colonel gadhafi must understand that our country is not a doormat on which a leader , terrorist or not , can clean his bloody feet of their infamy . "
her comments apparently displeased sarkozy .
yade was summoned to the elysee palace and chided for her frankness .
she said after the meeting with the president that her comments had been taken out of context and " caricatured " and that she was not , " in principle , " against gadhafi 's visit .
however , the french people apparently agree with yade 's original stance .
according to a poll made public on monday by the weekly paris match , nearly two of three french adults are opposed to gadhafi 's visit .
foreign minister says trusting libya is a risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner made his feelings known in no uncertain terms yade also received backing for her comments from foreign minister bernard kouchner , a well-known campaigner for human rights .
" she was right to speak as she did , " kouchner told france inter radio on monday .
kouchner also appeared to distance himself from the visit , adding that he was " resigned " to gadhafi coming to france and hoped that it would help speed up the " evolution " in libya .
in an opinion piece published monday in the daily la croix , kouchner described the high-wire act gadhafi 's visit has forced him - and france - to perform .
" no question of forgetting the name of the victims imputed to him , " he said .
" no question of forgetting their sufferings .
gadhafi has abandoned weapons of mass destruction and renounced terrorism for his country .
should we believe him and renew relations with libya ?
it 's a risk , but we will keep our eyes open . "
ex-presidential candidates weigh in with criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidential rivals bayrou and royal agreed on gadhafi meanwhile , the centrist former presidential candidate francois bayrou told rmc radio on monday that the libyan leader was a " bloody dictator " and that he would not take part in the diplomatic reception for him .
on sunday , former socialist party presidential candidate segolene royal said sarkozy was " trampling on france 's human rights tradition , " and told canal plus television that it was " heinous , shocking and even unacceptable " that france gave backing to " a system of torture in prison . "
apparently shaken by the controversy , sarkozy also defended his own human rights record , saying that he and his government had liberated the bulgarian nurses who had been sentenced to death by a libyan court for infecting children with aids .
" france liberated them , " sarkozy said .
" i demanded it and i obtained it . "
he also noted that he was the only french president to openly demand , at a press conference in beijing , that china outlaw the death penalty .
sarkozy noted that gadhafi would sign contracts later monday totaling about 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- .
these deals would involve a nuclear reactor for a seawater desalinization plant , a variety of armaments and other economic contracts , the french president said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the fact that medvedev 's not a member of putin 's party makes it even more likely that he 'll become russia 's next leader . " i fully support this candidacy , " putin on monday , dec .
10 , was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency after four parties , headed by the ruling united russia , named medvedev as their candidate .
" as far as the candidacy of medvedev is concerned , i have known him for more than 17 years , i have worked with him closely all these years , and i completely and fully support this candidacy , " putin said in video footage shown on state television .
putin will step down following the march 2 presidential elections after serving two consecutive terms .
while there is no clear favorite in the race to replace him , it is expected that any candidate which has putin 's endorsement will go on to win the election .
despite the rise through the ranks of fellow first deputy prime minister sergei ivanov and the appointment of the little-known finance expert viktor zubkov as prime minister in september , medvedev is now seen as the front runner for the presidency after gaining putin 's official endorsement .
putin 's announcement ends months of speculation fuelled by the president 's erratic promotions and random praise of members of his retinue .
medvedev set to be pro-kremlin parties ' candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev stands to gain four presidential nominations medvedev , who chairs energy giant gazprom 's supervisory board , has an extra advantage in addition to that .
as he is not affiliated with any party he can be nominated by all four pro-kremlin political parties - united russia , a just russia , a civil front and the agrarian party - as their candidate .
the four parties are set to officially announce medvedev as their candidate for the presidential elections at their upcoming party congresses .
a lawyer by trade , medvedev is a kremlin insider seen as a staunch putin loyalist , owing his rise to power to the incumbent president who hired him in the early 1990s to work on his staff at the saint petersburg local government .
he served as putin 's campaign manager for his successful 2000 election run and was rewarded for his services first with the position of presidential chief of staff and then the post at gazprom .
medvedev also heads the kremlin 's " national projects , " a program created to use russia 's massive profits from energy sales to rebuild crumbling infrastructure and social support system .

unlike putin , medvedev has no known connections with the kgb , but is considered a top player within the saint petersburg clan that dominates the upper echelons of power .
with his in-depth knowledge of the bureaucracy , medvedev is credited with having helped build the pyramid of power that has contributed to securing putin 's position at the top .

the fact that medvedev 's not a member of putin 's party makes it even more likely that he 'll become russia 's next leader . " i fully support this candidacy , " putin on monday , dec .
10 , was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency after four parties , headed by the ruling united russia , named medvedev as their candidate .
" as far as the candidacy of medvedev is concerned , i have known him for more than 17 years , i have worked with him closely all these years , and i completely and fully support this candidacy , " putin said in video footage shown on state television .
putin will step down following the march 2 presidential elections after serving two consecutive terms .
while there is no clear favorite in the race to replace him , it is expected that any candidate which has putin 's endorsement will go on to win the election .
despite the rise through the ranks of fellow first deputy prime minister sergei ivanov and the appointment of the little-known finance expert viktor zubkov as prime minister in september , medvedev is now seen as the front runner for the presidency after gaining putin 's official endorsement .
putin 's announcement ends months of speculation fuelled by the president 's erratic promotions and random praise of members of his retinue .
medvedev set to be pro-kremlin parties ' candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev stands to gain four presidential nominations medvedev , who chairs energy giant gazprom 's supervisory board , has an extra advantage in addition to that .
as he is not affiliated with any party he can be nominated by all four pro-kremlin political parties - united russia , a just russia , a civil front and the agrarian party - as their candidate .
the four parties are set to officially announce medvedev as their candidate for the presidential elections at their upcoming party congresses .
a lawyer by trade , medvedev is a kremlin insider seen as a staunch putin loyalist , owing his rise to power to the incumbent president who hired him in the early 1990s to work on his staff at the saint petersburg local government .
he served as putin 's campaign manager for his successful 2000 election run and was rewarded for his services first with the position of presidential chief of staff and then the post at gazprom .
medvedev also heads the kremlin 's " national projects , " a program created to use russia 's massive profits from energy sales to rebuild crumbling infrastructure and social support system .
putin 's heir apparent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev contributed to putin 's rise to power medvedev 's appointment as first deputy prime minister in charge of national projects in health , education and housing in november 2005 first started the rumors that putin had chosen his heir apparent .
unlike putin , medvedev has no known connections with the kgb , but is considered a top player within the saint petersburg clan that dominates the upper echelons of power .
with his in-depth knowledge of the bureaucracy , medvedev is credited with having helped build the pyramid of power that has contributed to securing putin 's position at the top .

with germany preparing for the european championships in austria and switzerland next june , löw is keen to have at least one of his goalkeepers playing regularly in the run up to the tournament .
lehmann has been replaced by spaniard manuel almunia at arsenal and has only played three times for the first team all season .
timo hildebrand , germany 's number two keeper , is in a similar situation at valencia where he has been struggling to hold down a place since his summer move to spain from stuttgart .
löw has made it clear that 38-year-old lehmann must ascertain what his chances of winning back his place in the arsenal side are before the germany coach holds talks with his number one over the christmas break . germany coach fretting over benched keepers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw intends to discuss lehmann 's future at christmas " wenger and jens are both people who have done a great deal for arsenal , " löw told german sports agency sid .

it is crucial jens has a concrete understanding of what is going on and is not trying to guess . "
after suffering an elbow and achilles tendon injury in september , lehmann has been unable to win his place back between the posts from almunia , a situation that worries löw .
" naturally , it is important a player has regular games , so he can stay sharp and get into a rhythm , " the germany coach added .
lehmann has been linked with a return to the bundesliga during the winter break , with vfl wolfsburg expressing their interest in the former borussia dortmund stopper .
while lehmann himself has given no indication that he wants to leave arsenal , he has consistently made comments about his situation at the north london club during his time on the sidelines , leading to a rift with his rival almunia and angering his employers .

" it 's not true , " wenger said .
" it 's only newspaper talk because nothing concrete has been discussed between me and jens and nothing between me and wolfsburg . at the moment i do not want to speculate on any movement in the transfer window .
we want to focus on our games and jens is part of that . "
back in germany , both oliver bierhoff , the national team 's general manager , and former number one oliver kahn have urged lehmann to switch clubs in january if he wants to keep his euro 2008 dreams alive .
quit now to keep dream alive , say bierhoff and kahn " looking ahead at euro 2008 it is certainly important that we have a goalkeeper who plays all the time .
should that not be the case , i would advise him to look for a new club during the winter break where he can play continuously , " bierhoff said in october .

" jens lehmann 's services to the national team have been impeccable , but you ca n't play in a european championship when you are not in the team , " kahn told dsf television .

with germany preparing for the european championships in austria and switzerland next june , löw is keen to have at least one of his goalkeepers playing regularly in the run up to the tournament .
lehmann has been replaced by spaniard manuel almunia at arsenal and has only played three times for the first team all season .
timo hildebrand , germany 's number two keeper , is in a similar situation at valencia where he has been struggling to hold down a place since his summer move to spain from stuttgart .
löw has made it clear that 38-year-old lehmann must ascertain what his chances of winning back his place in the arsenal side are before the germany coach holds talks with his number one over the christmas break . germany coach fretting over benched keepers bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw intends to discuss lehmann 's future at christmas " wenger and jens are both people who have done a great deal for arsenal , " löw told german sports agency sid .
" they should be able to discuss the matter and get a better understanding of the situation .
it is crucial jens has a concrete understanding of what is going on and is not trying to guess . "
after suffering an elbow and achilles tendon injury in september , lehmann has been unable to win his place back between the posts from almunia , a situation that worries löw .
" naturally , it is important a player has regular games , so he can stay sharp and get into a rhythm , " the germany coach added .
lehmann has been linked with a return to the bundesliga during the winter break , with vfl wolfsburg expressing their interest in the former borussia dortmund stopper .
while lehmann himself has given no indication that he wants to leave arsenal , he has consistently made comments about his situation at the north london club during his time on the sidelines , leading to a rift with his rival almunia and angering his employers .
arsenal boss dismisses wolves interest bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wenger wo n't sell lehmann despite the goalie 's criticism despite lehmann 's vocal displeasure , arsenal boss wenger has dismissed rumors linking his unsettled goalkeeper with a return to his native germany in the january transfer window .
" it 's not true , " wenger said .
" it 's only newspaper talk because nothing concrete has been discussed between me and jens and nothing between me and wolfsburg . at the moment i do not want to speculate on any movement in the transfer window .
we want to focus on our games and jens is part of that . "
back in germany , both oliver bierhoff , the national team 's general manager , and former number one oliver kahn have urged lehmann to switch clubs in january if he wants to keep his euro 2008 dreams alive .
quit now to keep dream alive , say bierhoff and kahn " looking ahead at euro 2008 it is certainly important that we have a goalkeeper who plays all the time .

10 , fiercely defended moammar gadhafi , shortly after the libyan leader began a controversial five-day visit to france . " today , france is welcoming a head of state who decided definitively to renounce weapons of mass destruction , " sarkozy told journalists after a one-hour meeting with gadhafi at the elysee palace .
" france is welcoming a head of state who definitively renounced terrorism .
a head of state who has compensated the victims " of libyan state-sponsored terrorist acts .
the french president added that libya wanted to become a full-fledged member of the international community .
" it is my deepest conviction that france must speak with all those who want to be integrated in the international community , " he said .
apparently unfazed by the controversy that preceded his arrival in paris monday afternoon , a smiling gadhafi shook hands with sarkozy and waved to journalists .
gadhafi 's first official visit to france in 34 years has provoked an angry debate in france , with even members of sarkozy 's government openly critical of the visit .
in an interview published monday in the daily le parisien , junior minister for human rights rama yade fiercely criticized the date of the visit , which begins on international human rights day , and said she would not take part in the state dinner sarkozy was hosting for gadhafi later monday .
human rights minister scolded by sarkozy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy first reached out to gadhafi in libya in july " the choice of this is a strong symbol , i would even say scandalously strong , " yade told the daily .
" colonel gadhafi must understand that our country is not a doormat on which a leader , terrorist or not , can clean his bloody feet of their infamy . "
her comments apparently displeased sarkozy .
yade was summoned to the elysee palace and chided for her frankness .
she said after the meeting with the president that her comments had been taken out of context and " caricatured " and that she was not , " in principle , " against gadhafi 's visit .
however , the french people apparently agree with yade 's original stance .
according to a poll made public on monday by the weekly paris match , nearly two of three french adults are opposed to gadhafi 's visit .
foreign minister says trusting libya is a risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner made his feelings known in no uncertain terms yade also received backing for her comments from foreign minister bernard kouchner , a well-known campaigner for human rights .
" she was right to speak as she did , " kouchner told france inter radio on monday .
kouchner also appeared to distance himself from the visit , adding that he was " resigned " to gadhafi coming to france and hoped that it would help speed up the " evolution " in libya .
in an opinion piece published monday in the daily la croix , kouchner described the high-wire act gadhafi 's visit has forced him - and france - to perform .
" no question of forgetting the name of the victims imputed to him , " he said .
" no question of forgetting their sufferings .
gadhafi has abandoned weapons of mass destruction and renounced terrorism for his country .

it 's a risk , but we will keep our eyes open . "
ex-presidential candidates weigh in with criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidential rivals bayrou and royal agreed on gadhafi meanwhile , the centrist former presidential candidate francois bayrou told rmc radio on monday that the libyan leader was a " bloody dictator " and that he would not take part in the diplomatic reception for him .
on sunday , former socialist party presidential candidate segolene royal said sarkozy was " trampling on france 's human rights tradition , " and told canal plus television that it was " heinous , shocking and even unacceptable " that france gave backing to " a system of torture in prison . "
apparently shaken by the controversy , sarkozy also defended his own human rights record , saying that he and his government had liberated the bulgarian nurses who had been sentenced to death by a libyan court for infecting children with aids .
" france liberated them , " sarkozy said .
" i demanded it and i obtained it . "
he also noted that he was the only french president to openly demand , at a press conference in beijing , that china outlaw the death penalty .
sarkozy noted that gadhafi would sign contracts later monday totaling about 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- .

10 , the eu , the us and russia said further talks over kosovo 's status would be superfluous .
the serbian province could declare independence any time . key european powers and the united states are gearing up to recognize kosovo as an independent state , while serbia , backed by russia , has said it will never accept a self-ruling kosovo . in response to the deadlock , the so-called kosovo troika - made up of the eu , the us and russia - ended four months of un-initiated talks on friday by concluding that negotiations had failed . us secretary of state condoleezza rice has also made it clear that it is too late for negotiations on kosovo 's future status - a stance that her russian counterpart sergei lavrov criticized on the weekend as being the biggest obstacle to a solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's ethnic albanian parties are united in their calls for independence " neither party was willing to cede its position on the fundamental question of sovereignty over kosovo , " the troika report said .
" this is regrettable , as a negotiated settlement is in the best interests of both parties . " the mediators said the two sides did find some issues they could agree on and promised to work together on reconciliation , even if they could n't break through on the big question of kosovo 's status . kosovo 's albanian majority appealed to the west on sunday to back their bid for independence .
a joint statement from government and opposition leaders said : " the people of kosovo urgently need clarity about their future . " the eu 's foreign ministers will meet behind closed doors on monday with the eu envoy to the kosovo talks , wolfgang ischinger , to discuss ways to prevent violence in the case that kosovo albanians declare independence . eu letter reveals bloc 's internal divide in a separate letter addressed to the european union member states , germany , france , britain and italy said that continuing talks would be pointless . diplomats said that the letter was intended for those countries in the bloc that continue to advocate further talks , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper reported . romania , slovakia and spain have been hesitant to back independence for kosovo due to fears that the move would encourage their own ethnic minorities to break away .
cyprus , which is divided into a greek and internationally unrecognized turkish portion , has also found the one-sidedness of the kosovo independence proposal hard to swallow , as has greece . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger said the troika did everything " humanly possible " to negotiate a deal " it 's regrettable that the eu member states , due to their respective domestic situations , have reached different conclusions , " the eu 's coordinator for the stability pact for south-eastern europe , erhard busek , told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
" the different positions of eu states on the issue of kosovo 's status invite russia and china to interfere . " solana : kosovo 's future is in the eu leaders of the 27-nation bloc are to confirm the impasse in a statement at a summit this coming friday , diplomats told reuters news agency . they are also expected to verify their willingness to dispatch police and justice missions and appoint a high representative to oversee kosovo if asked to by the kosovo-albanian government and the united nations . " it is clear that the future of serbia and kosovo lies in the european union .
that 's something that both sides agree on , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in an interview with germany 's welt am sonntag newspaper . the un security council is due to discuss the kosovo troika 's report on dec .

10 , the eu , the us and russia said further talks over kosovo 's status would be superfluous .
the serbian province could declare independence any time . key european powers and the united states are gearing up to recognize kosovo as an independent state , while serbia , backed by russia , has said it will never accept a self-ruling kosovo . in response to the deadlock , the so-called kosovo troika - made up of the eu , the us and russia - ended four months of un-initiated talks on friday by concluding that negotiations had failed . us secretary of state condoleezza rice has also made it clear that it is too late for negotiations on kosovo 's future status - a stance that her russian counterpart sergei lavrov criticized on the weekend as being the biggest obstacle to a solution . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kosovo 's ethnic albanian parties are united in their calls for independence " neither party was willing to cede its position on the fundamental question of sovereignty over kosovo , " the troika report said .
" this is regrettable , as a negotiated settlement is in the best interests of both parties . " the mediators said the two sides did find some issues they could agree on and promised to work together on reconciliation , even if they could n't break through on the big question of kosovo 's status . kosovo 's albanian majority appealed to the west on sunday to back their bid for independence .
a joint statement from government and opposition leaders said : " the people of kosovo urgently need clarity about their future . " the eu 's foreign ministers will meet behind closed doors on monday with the eu envoy to the kosovo talks , wolfgang ischinger , to discuss ways to prevent violence in the case that kosovo albanians declare independence . eu letter reveals bloc 's internal divide in a separate letter addressed to the european union member states , germany , france , britain and italy said that continuing talks would be pointless . diplomats said that the letter was intended for those countries in the bloc that continue to advocate further talks , the frankfurter allgemeine zeitung newspaper reported . romania , slovakia and spain have been hesitant to back independence for kosovo due to fears that the move would encourage their own ethnic minorities to break away .
cyprus , which is divided into a greek and internationally unrecognized turkish portion , has also found the one-sidedness of the kosovo independence proposal hard to swallow , as has greece . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ischinger said the troika did everything " humanly possible " to negotiate a deal " it 's regrettable that the eu member states , due to their respective domestic situations , have reached different conclusions , " the eu 's coordinator for the stability pact for south-eastern europe , erhard busek , told berlin daily der tagesspiegel .
" the different positions of eu states on the issue of kosovo 's status invite russia and china to interfere . " solana : kosovo 's future is in the eu leaders of the 27-nation bloc are to confirm the impasse in a statement at a summit this coming friday , diplomats told reuters news agency . they are also expected to verify their willingness to dispatch police and justice missions and appoint a high representative to oversee kosovo if asked to by the kosovo-albanian government and the united nations . " it is clear that the future of serbia and kosovo lies in the european union .
that 's something that both sides agree on , " eu foreign policy chief javier solana said in an interview with germany 's welt am sonntag newspaper . the un security council is due to discuss the kosovo troika 's report on dec .

what was your impression of the first week ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : china has said it 's ready to discuss climate goals , bals said christoph bals : there was one really big shift in the position of the rapidly developing countries , mainly in china .
this was very constructive .
it was just two years ago that china said that only in the second half of the century would they be ready to negotiate seriously about commitments , and now they seem to be ready to start with these negotiations .
this was a very constructive spirit from china and also from other rapidly developing countries , like mexico , like south africa and like brazil . the united states produces the most greenhouse gas emissions , and is one of the only industrial countries that has not ratified the kyoto protocol .
in the past the us has tried to block negotiations .
is that true this year as well ? they are not really blocking negotiations at the moment , but they are still trying to start a parallel process for voluntary action .
this would undermine the entire process .
they want to have major conferences next year just to discuss this issue of voluntary activities .
this is one way of blocking without really blocking the negotiations . the united states says it wants to meet with the top industrial nations to discuss technology transfer to developing countries .
is n't this an important issue ? it is an extremely important issue .
that is why it should be a strong part of the un framework convention on climate change agenda .
we need a legally binding framework and we need a strong incentive structure for this technology transfer .
there is no reason why this could n't happen .
but i do n't think we need an additional process for technology transfer . people have different expectations for bali .
some are saying the least common denominator would be agreement on a timeline for a roadmap for setting up a new climate change protocol by 2009 .
what do you think the next week will bring ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knowing what exact steps to take next will be key to slowing climate change , bals said we definitely need a roadmap , and we need a strong mandate for the roadmap , so we know what direction it is going in .
but this must be ambitious , which means that we need some targets for 2020 .
we need an agreement that the peak of climate emissions should be between 2015 and 2020 to prevent global climate change .
parts of this ambitious roadmap are also technology transfer , a clear concept for avoided deforestation , and the future of the emissions trading system . but what we need now are first steps showing that we want to start with concrete steps .
i think we will have pilot projects in the forestry field of how we want to prevent deforestation . you are saying that topics like avoided deforestation , or including airline emissions and transportation in general into a post-kyoto protocol , will be touched on here , but will not go into a bali agreement ? we will not get a bali agreement , we will get a bali mandate - that is what we are hoping for .
anybody who wants a bali agreement does n't take seriously the fact that we want a great transformation of society , and this ca n't be organized in a 14-day conference .
we need 10 conferences in the next two years to organize this .
what we need now is a strong mandate , so that we can begin to negotiate with all relevant actors .
that is my hope for the end of this week . interview : kateri jochum , bali , indonesia send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

this was very constructive .
it was just two years ago that china said that only in the second half of the century would they be ready to negotiate seriously about commitments , and now they seem to be ready to start with these negotiations .
this was a very constructive spirit from china and also from other rapidly developing countries , like mexico , like south africa and like brazil . the united states produces the most greenhouse gas emissions , and is one of the only industrial countries that has not ratified the kyoto protocol .
in the past the us has tried to block negotiations .

his father peter also had the same problem with the calendar , which sported a picture of santa claus in the team 's royal blue uniform on the front .

10 , fiercely defended moammar gadhafi , shortly after the libyan leader began a controversial five-day visit to france . " today , france is welcoming a head of state who decided definitively to renounce weapons of mass destruction , " sarkozy told journalists after a one-hour meeting with gadhafi at the elysee palace .
" france is welcoming a head of state who definitively renounced terrorism .
a head of state who has compensated the victims " of libyan state-sponsored terrorist acts .
the french president added that libya wanted to become a full-fledged member of the international community .
" it is my deepest conviction that france must speak with all those who want to be integrated in the international community , " he said .
apparently unfazed by the controversy that preceded his arrival in paris monday afternoon , a smiling gadhafi shook hands with sarkozy and waved to journalists .
gadhafi 's first official visit to france in 34 years has provoked an angry debate in france , with even members of sarkozy 's government openly critical of the visit .
in an interview published monday in the daily le parisien , junior minister for human rights rama yade fiercely criticized the date of the visit , which begins on international human rights day , and said she would not take part in the state dinner sarkozy was hosting for gadhafi later monday .
human rights minister scolded by sarkozy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy first reached out to gadhafi in libya in july " the choice of this is a strong symbol , i would even say scandalously strong , " yade told the daily .
" colonel gadhafi must understand that our country is not a doormat on which a leader , terrorist or not , can clean his bloody feet of their infamy . "
her comments apparently displeased sarkozy .
yade was summoned to the elysee palace and chided for her frankness .
she said after the meeting with the president that her comments had been taken out of context and " caricatured " and that she was not , " in principle , " against gadhafi 's visit .
however , the french people apparently agree with yade 's original stance .
according to a poll made public on monday by the weekly paris match , nearly two of three french adults are opposed to gadhafi 's visit .
foreign minister says trusting libya is a risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner made his feelings known in no uncertain terms yade also received backing for her comments from foreign minister bernard kouchner , a well-known campaigner for human rights .
" she was right to speak as she did , " kouchner told france inter radio on monday .
kouchner also appeared to distance himself from the visit , adding that he was " resigned " to gadhafi coming to france and hoped that it would help speed up the " evolution " in libya .
in an opinion piece published monday in the daily la croix , kouchner described the high-wire act gadhafi 's visit has forced him - and france - to perform .
" no question of forgetting the name of the victims imputed to him , " he said .
" no question of forgetting their sufferings .
gadhafi has abandoned weapons of mass destruction and renounced terrorism for his country .
should we believe him and renew relations with libya ?
it 's a risk , but we will keep our eyes open . "
ex-presidential candidates weigh in with criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : presidential rivals bayrou and royal agreed on gadhafi meanwhile , the centrist former presidential candidate francois bayrou told rmc radio on monday that the libyan leader was a " bloody dictator " and that he would not take part in the diplomatic reception for him .
on sunday , former socialist party presidential candidate segolene royal said sarkozy was " trampling on france 's human rights tradition , " and told canal plus television that it was " heinous , shocking and even unacceptable " that france gave backing to " a system of torture in prison . "
apparently shaken by the controversy , sarkozy also defended his own human rights record , saying that he and his government had liberated the bulgarian nurses who had been sentenced to death by a libyan court for infecting children with aids .
" france liberated them , " sarkozy said .
" i demanded it and i obtained it . "
he also noted that he was the only french president to openly demand , at a press conference in beijing , that china outlaw the death penalty .
sarkozy noted that gadhafi would sign contracts later monday totaling about 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- .
these deals would involve a nuclear reactor for a seawater desalinization plant , a variety of armaments and other economic contracts , the french president said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

she said after the meeting with the president that her comments had been taken out of context and " caricatured " and that she was not , " in principle , " against gadhafi 's visit .
however , the french people apparently agree with yade 's original stance .
according to a poll made public on monday by the weekly paris match , nearly two of three french adults are opposed to gadhafi 's visit .
foreign minister says trusting libya is a risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner made his feelings known in no uncertain terms yade also received backing for her comments from foreign minister bernard kouchner , a well-known campaigner for human rights .
" she was right to speak as she did , " kouchner told france inter radio on monday .
kouchner also appeared to distance himself from the visit , adding that he was " resigned " to gadhafi coming to france and hoped that it would help speed up the " evolution " in libya .
in an opinion piece published monday in the daily la croix , kouchner described the high-wire act gadhafi 's visit has forced him - and france - to perform .
" no question of forgetting the name of the victims imputed to him , " he said .
" no question of forgetting their sufferings .
gadhafi has abandoned weapons of mass destruction and renounced terrorism for his country .

it 's a risk , but we will keep our eyes open . "

on sunday , former socialist party presidential candidate segolene royal said sarkozy was " trampling on france 's human rights tradition , " and told canal plus television that it was " heinous , shocking and even unacceptable " that france gave backing to " a system of torture in prison . "
apparently shaken by the controversy , sarkozy also defended his own human rights record , saying that he and his government had liberated the bulgarian nurses who had been sentenced to death by a libyan court for infecting children with aids .
" france liberated them , " sarkozy said .
" i demanded it and i obtained it . "
he also noted that he was the only french president to openly demand , at a press conference in beijing , that china outlaw the death penalty .
sarkozy noted that gadhafi would sign contracts later monday totaling about 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- .
these deals would involve a nuclear reactor for a seawater desalinization plant , a variety of armaments and other economic contracts , the french president said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

10 , fiercely defended moammar gadhafi , shortly after the libyan leader began a controversial five-day visit to france . " today , france is welcoming a head of state who decided definitively to renounce weapons of mass destruction , " sarkozy told journalists after a one-hour meeting with gadhafi at the elysee palace .
" france is welcoming a head of state who definitively renounced terrorism .
a head of state who has compensated the victims " of libyan state-sponsored terrorist acts .
the french president added that libya wanted to become a full-fledged member of the international community .
" it is my deepest conviction that france must speak with all those who want to be integrated in the international community , " he said .
apparently unfazed by the controversy that preceded his arrival in paris monday afternoon , a smiling gadhafi shook hands with sarkozy and waved to journalists .
gadhafi 's first official visit to france in 34 years has provoked an angry debate in france , with even members of sarkozy 's government openly critical of the visit .
in an interview published monday in the daily le parisien , junior minister for human rights rama yade fiercely criticized the date of the visit , which begins on international human rights day , and said she would not take part in the state dinner sarkozy was hosting for gadhafi later monday .
human rights minister scolded by sarkozy bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy first reached out to gadhafi in libya in july " the choice of this is a strong symbol , i would even say scandalously strong , " yade told the daily .
" colonel gadhafi must understand that our country is not a doormat on which a leader , terrorist or not , can clean his bloody feet of their infamy . "
her comments apparently displeased sarkozy .
yade was summoned to the elysee palace and chided for her frankness .
she said after the meeting with the president that her comments had been taken out of context and " caricatured " and that she was not , " in principle , " against gadhafi 's visit .
however , the french people apparently agree with yade 's original stance .
according to a poll made public on monday by the weekly paris match , nearly two of three french adults are opposed to gadhafi 's visit .
foreign minister says trusting libya is a risk bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kouchner made his feelings known in no uncertain terms yade also received backing for her comments from foreign minister bernard kouchner , a well-known campaigner for human rights .
" she was right to speak as she did , " kouchner told france inter radio on monday .
kouchner also appeared to distance himself from the visit , adding that he was " resigned " to gadhafi coming to france and hoped that it would help speed up the " evolution " in libya .
in an opinion piece published monday in the daily la croix , kouchner described the high-wire act gadhafi 's visit has forced him - and france - to perform .
" no question of forgetting the name of the victims imputed to him , " he said .
" no question of forgetting their sufferings .
gadhafi has abandoned weapons of mass destruction and renounced terrorism for his country .

on sunday , former socialist party presidential candidate segolene royal said sarkozy was " trampling on france 's human rights tradition , " and told canal plus television that it was " heinous , shocking and even unacceptable " that france gave backing to " a system of torture in prison . "
apparently shaken by the controversy , sarkozy also defended his own human rights record , saying that he and his government had liberated the bulgarian nurses who had been sentenced to death by a libyan court for infecting children with aids .
" france liberated them , " sarkozy said .
" i demanded it and i obtained it . "
he also noted that he was the only french president to openly demand , at a press conference in beijing , that china outlaw the death penalty .
sarkozy noted that gadhafi would sign contracts later monday totaling about 10 billion euros -lrb- $ 14.6 billion -rrb- .
these deals would involve a nuclear reactor for a seawater desalinization plant , a variety of armaments and other economic contracts , the french president said . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the fact that medvedev 's not a member of putin 's party makes it even more likely that he 'll become russia 's next leader . " i fully support this candidacy , " putin on monday , dec .
10 , was quoted as saying by the interfax news agency after four parties , headed by the ruling united russia , named medvedev as their candidate .
" as far as the candidacy of medvedev is concerned , i have known him for more than 17 years , i have worked with him closely all these years , and i completely and fully support this candidacy , " putin said in video footage shown on state television .
putin will step down following the march 2 presidential elections after serving two consecutive terms .
while there is no clear favorite in the race to replace him , it is expected that any candidate which has putin 's endorsement will go on to win the election .
despite the rise through the ranks of fellow first deputy prime minister sergei ivanov and the appointment of the little-known finance expert viktor zubkov as prime minister in september , medvedev is now seen as the front runner for the presidency after gaining putin 's official endorsement .
putin 's announcement ends months of speculation fuelled by the president 's erratic promotions and random praise of members of his retinue .
medvedev set to be pro-kremlin parties ' candidate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : medvedev stands to gain four presidential nominations medvedev , who chairs energy giant gazprom 's supervisory board , has an extra advantage in addition to that .

the four parties are set to officially announce medvedev as their candidate for the presidential elections at their upcoming party congresses .
a lawyer by trade , medvedev is a kremlin insider seen as a staunch putin loyalist , owing his rise to power to the incumbent president who hired him in the early 1990s to work on his staff at the saint petersburg local government .
he served as putin 's campaign manager for his successful 2000 election run and was rewarded for his services first with the position of presidential chief of staff and then the post at gazprom .
medvedev also heads the kremlin 's " national projects , " a program created to use russia 's massive profits from energy sales to rebuild crumbling infrastructure and social support system .

unlike putin , medvedev has no known connections with the kgb , but is considered a top player within the saint petersburg clan that dominates the upper echelons of power .
with his in-depth knowledge of the bureaucracy , medvedev is credited with having helped build the pyramid of power that has contributed to securing putin 's position at the top .

the deadly mates campaign will see traffic officers stopping young drivers and handing out promotional material .
one in four car drivers killed or seriously injured in crashes in wales is under 25 , say police .
the most dangerous drivers are young men with passengers because they drive for the thrill of it and to " show off " , said a road safety scheme spokesman .
gwent police will run the two-week campaign for the three other forces in wales and the mid and south wales safety camera partnership .
the campaign has a website and dedicated police road patrols will target young drivers .

" their friends put pressure on them to take risks at the wheel for a laugh or they race other cars which is stupid and really dangerous , " said mr moore .
" making sharp risky driving moves at speed or driving too close behind other cars is really dangerous as they wo n't be able to brake in time if , for example , a child runs into the road , " he said .
" the most dangerous people behind the wheel are young men with passengers - because they drive faster for the thrill of it and to show off . "

blackstone is creating a consortium , thought to include a chinese sovereign wealth fund , to make the bid , it said .
rio has already dismissed a hostile takeover approach of about $ 130bn -lrb- £ 63.2bn -rrb- from bhp billion as too low .
blackstone plans to break up the business , selling off different parts of the mining firm , the paper says .
this would involve undoing a merger completed earlier this year with aluminium maker alcan , it added .
china links in a bid to defend itself against bhp 's unwanted offer , anglo-australian firm rio has already said it will look to boost shareholder value by selling off $ 30bn-worth of its business , including two uranium projects in australia and a zinc , lead and silver mine in the us .
analysts say that rio 's refusal to team up with bhp is indicative of its conviction that mineral and metal prices will stay high for years to come , fuelled by strong demand from emerging economies such as china and india .

analysts say that rio 's refusal to team up with bhp is indicative of its conviction that mineral and metal prices will stay high for years to come , fuelled by strong demand from emerging economies such as china and india .

the institute for public policy research -lrb- ippr -rrb- says asbos can be ineffective and " speed children into the criminal justice system " .
but it does not want them scrapped , saying they give the right message on what sort of behaviour is tolerated .
the home office says the majority of asbos are issued to adults .
it says their purpose is to protect the law-abiding majority from the anti-social minority .
' empty punishment ' home office minister vernon coaker told radio 4 's today programme that local communities were calling for more asbos .
he said : " there 's been in the last few years 10,000 asbos , that 's not a huge number , 5,000 for young people - targeted at those who are causing real problems .
" and the evidence from local communities themselves is that they believe they make a real difference .
they help to prevent harming communities . "
the ippr 's julia margo told bbc news asbos could be " empty punishments " as there was no requirement for children to be assessed before an order was made .
" if you breach an anti-social behaviour order , you end up in a court , so they can sometimes speed children into the criminal justice system .
" asbos are given for very low level misbehaviours in the community , so something like graffitiing a wall or public property or hanging outside with your friends and irritating neighbours or being very loud or noisy in a public place . "
" the root of the problem is the kind of adult that young people are mixing with , so that problem needs to be addressed , not just the individual child 's behaviour " julia margo she said the orders were often ineffective , as they were breached by 46 % of children issued with them .
she suggested the maximum asbo length should be scaled back from 10 years to two years and the minimum from two years to six months .
" we do n't think we should completely get rid of asbo legislation because it is important and it does send out the right message about what kind of behaviour we tolerate in our community but we need to scale them back . "
' badge of honour ' the ippr says asbos for younger children should always be accompanied by a family or parenting order to address the " context of the behaviour " .
ms margo said the most common factors behind a child offending was not spending much time with their parents and having a parent or adult carer who had committed a crime .
" so that really suggests that the root of the problem is the kind of adult that young people are mixing with , so that problem needs to be addressed , not just the individual child 's behaviour , " she said .
the ippr says greater investment in playgrounds and clubs such as scouts and cadets could reduce offending by giving youngsters something constructive to do as well as encouraging adults to spend quality time with young people in their communities .
paul cavadino , chief executive of crime reduction charity nacro , said asbos had a high failure rate among young people .
" in itself , it does n't provide positive support for the child or family to help them to change their behaviour .
" in some cases they can be used as a badge of honour and that means the child tries to live up to the hard image which he or she thinks the asbo gives them - and that in itself can make matters worse . "

anti-social behaviour orders can become a " self-fulfilling prophecy " and should not be imposed on the under-12s , a think tank says .
the institute for public policy research -lrb- ippr -rrb- says asbos can be ineffective and " speed children into the criminal justice system " .
but it does not want them scrapped , saying they give the right message on what sort of behaviour is tolerated .
the home office says the majority of asbos are issued to adults .
it says their purpose is to protect the law-abiding majority from the anti-social minority .
' empty punishment ' home office minister vernon coaker told radio 4 's today programme that local communities were calling for more asbos .
he said : " there 's been in the last few years 10,000 asbos , that 's not a huge number , 5,000 for young people - targeted at those who are causing real problems .
" and the evidence from local communities themselves is that they believe they make a real difference .
they help to prevent harming communities . "
the ippr 's julia margo told bbc news asbos could be " empty punishments " as there was no requirement for children to be assessed before an order was made .
" if you breach an anti-social behaviour order , you end up in a court , so they can sometimes speed children into the criminal justice system .
" asbos are given for very low level misbehaviours in the community , so something like graffitiing a wall or public property or hanging outside with your friends and irritating neighbours or being very loud or noisy in a public place . "
the root of the problem is the kind of adult that young people are mixing with , so that problem needs to be addressed , not just the individual child 's behaviour julia margo she said the orders were often ineffective , as they were breached by 46 % of children issued with them .
she suggested the maximum asbo length should be scaled back from 10 years to two years and the minimum from two years to six months .
" we do n't think we should completely get rid of asbo legislation because it is important and it does send out the right message about what kind of behaviour we tolerate in our community but we need to scale them back . "
' badge of honour ' the ippr says asbos for younger children should always be accompanied by a family or parenting order to address the " context of the behaviour " .
ms margo said the most common factors behind a child offending was not spending much time with their parents and having a parent or adult carer who had committed a crime .
" so that really suggests that the root of the problem is the kind of adult that young people are mixing with , so that problem needs to be addressed , not just the individual child 's behaviour , " she said .
the ippr says greater investment in playgrounds and clubs such as scouts and cadets could reduce offending by giving youngsters something constructive to do as well as encouraging adults to spend quality time with young people in their communities .
paul cavadino , chief executive of crime reduction charity nacro , said asbos had a high failure rate among young people .
" in itself , it does n't provide positive support for the child or family to help them to change their behaviour .
" in some cases they can be used as a badge of honour and that means the child tries to live up to the hard image which he or she thinks the asbo gives them - and that in itself can make matters worse . "

it says their purpose is to protect the law-abiding majority from the anti-social minority .
' empty punishment ' home office minister vernon coaker told radio 4 's today programme that local communities were calling for more asbos .
he said : " there 's been in the last few years 10,000 asbos , that 's not a huge number , 5,000 for young people - targeted at those who are causing real problems .
" and the evidence from local communities themselves is that they believe they make a real difference .
they help to prevent harming communities . "
the ippr 's julia margo told bbc news asbos could be " empty punishments " as there was no requirement for children to be assessed before an order was made .
" if you breach an anti-social behaviour order , you end up in a court , so they can sometimes speed children into the criminal justice system .
" asbos are given for very low level misbehaviours in the community , so something like graffitiing a wall or public property or hanging outside with your friends and irritating neighbours or being very loud or noisy in a public place . "
the root of the problem is the kind of adult that young people are mixing with , so that problem needs to be addressed , not just the individual child 's behaviour julia margo she said the orders were often ineffective , as they were breached by 46 % of children issued with them .
she suggested the maximum asbo length should be scaled back from 10 years to two years and the minimum from two years to six months .
" we do n't think we should completely get rid of asbo legislation because it is important and it does send out the right message about what kind of behaviour we tolerate in our community but we need to scale them back . "
' badge of honour ' the ippr says asbos for younger children should always be accompanied by a family or parenting order to address the " context of the behaviour " .
ms margo said the most common factors behind a child offending was not spending much time with their parents and having a parent or adult carer who had committed a crime .
" so that really suggests that the root of the problem is the kind of adult that young people are mixing with , so that problem needs to be addressed , not just the individual child 's behaviour , " she said .
the ippr says greater investment in playgrounds and clubs such as scouts and cadets could reduce offending by giving youngsters something constructive to do as well as encouraging adults to spend quality time with young people in their communities .
paul cavadino , chief executive of crime reduction charity nacro , said asbos had a high failure rate among young people .
" in itself , it does n't provide positive support for the child or family to help them to change their behaviour .
" in some cases they can be used as a badge of honour and that means the child tries to live up to the hard image which he or she thinks the asbo gives them - and that in itself can make matters worse . "

but in an upbeat statement , the uk bank said it expected full-year profits to be in line with analysts ' expectations , despite the sub-prime hit .
it attributed the limited effect of the credit crunch to a lower-risk strategy than that of uk rivals .
barclays and royal bank of scotland -lrb- rbs -rrb- have both reported higher losses .
' good performance ' lloyds tsb 's chief executive eric daniels said the " relatively limited " write-down was based on losses that occurred in the four months until the end of october .
in that time , tumbling house prices in the us and rising mortgage defaults among the nation 's riskiest borrowers meant that loans to which the uk bank was exposed were worth less than they thought .
however , it reassured investors that the group remained on track to " deliver a good performance for the year " , adding that it remained confident in earnings prospects for the foreseeable future .
" whilst no bank has been immune from the recent turbulence , the relatively limited impact of the market dislocation on the group has been more than offset by the significant profit on the sales of non-core businesses , " said lloyds tsb chief executive eric daniels .
the sale of lloyds tsb registrars and the abbey life insurance business will add an extra £ 675m to pre-tax profit in the second half of 2007 .

but in an upbeat statement , the uk bank said it expected full-year profits to be in line with analysts ' expectations , despite the sub-prime hit .
it attributed the limited effect of the credit crunch to a lower-risk strategy than that of uk rivals .
barclays and royal bank of scotland -lrb- rbs -rrb- have both reported higher losses .
' good performance ' lloyds tsb 's chief executive eric daniels said the " relatively limited " write-down was based on losses that occurred in the four months until the end of october .
in that time , tumbling house prices in the us and rising mortgage defaults among the nation 's riskiest borrowers meant that loans to which the uk bank was exposed were worth less than they thought .

president chavez sees the imf and world bank as tools of the us the idea was first put forward by venezuelan president hugo chavez in december 2006 as part of his battle against the influence of the us and the international financial institutions , which he has decried as " tools of washington " .
argentina , brazil , bolivia , ecuador , paraguay , uruguay and venezuela have all joined the initiative .
chile and peru decided to remain on the sidelines , while colombia , which had expressed interest , has put its decision on hold following recent disagreements between colombian president alvaro uribe and mr chavez .
according to venezuelan finance minister rodrigo cabezas , the creation of a new organisation is " a demonstration that times have changed " .
the bank of the south , known as banco del sur in spanish and banco do sul in portuguese , he explains , will be funded and run by south american countries themselves .
lack of reforms analysts believe the bank of the south initiative reflects the increased unpopularity of the imf and the world bank among many south american countries .
venezuela 's finance minister says the imf is too hard on poor nations mark weisbrot , co-director of the center for economic and policy research in washington , also sees it as one of many signs of a new independence from institutions such as the imf and its " unwanted austerity measures " .
" at the beginning of this decade , scepticism in latin america was sealed when argentina disregarded imf advice by defaulting on its debt and then experienced robust economic recovery , " mr weisbrot said .
luis maldonado , a presidential representative to the government body that helps regulate ecuador 's banking sector , argues that " latin america has been impoverished and harassed long enough that we have no other choice -lsb- but to -rsb- start the bank of the south . "
venezuela has gone so far as to threaten to leave the imf - although it has not set any date for such a move .
" if the imf does not abandon its record of implementing tough policies with regards to emerging countries and being totally benevolent to developed countries , as it was in the last us mortgage crisis , it will struggle to regain its credibility , " said mr cabezas .
bolivia finds it harder to borrow since renationalising energy firms pulling out of the imf would amount to a technical default on venezuela 's bonds and would raise the cost of future borrowing in global markets .
other members of the bank of the south share many of venezuela 's concerns about the imf , but have made clear that they do not intend to leave it or other international institutions .
gustavo guzman , bolivia 's ambassador to washington , explained to the bbc that the bank would provide a much-needed " alternative source " of funds .
he points out that it has been difficult for bolivia to get loans from the imf and international markets since the government 's recent moves to renationalise its oil and natural gas industry .
colombian finance minister oscar ivan zuluaga said at a meeting in new york that the banco del sur was seen as an effort to integrate the countries of south america and " nothing more than that " .
obstacles venezuela hopes that the newly created bank , which will be based in caracas , will begin to operate in 2008 , but there are several obstacles .
the amount each country will contribute to the bank and how it will raise additional capital are details which have not been disclosed .
these issues may prove a major obstacle .
brazil and venezuela differ , for example , on how shares in the bank should be distributed .
venezuela also insists that the initial capital contribution should not be mandatory , but rather a " donation " relating to each country 's gdp .
meanwhile , ecuador wants each member country to make a contribution " equal to or greater " than it makes to the inter-american development bank -lrb- iadb -rrb- and world bank .
mixed reactions the bank of the south proposition has been greeted with caution by most analysts , although they agree that having more options for countries seeking funding is not a bad idea .
in bolivia , the government is keen to help indigenous communities former world bank chief economist and nobel-prize winning economist joseph stiglitz has endorsed the bank on those grounds .
" it 's good to have competition in most markets , including the market for development lending , " he said .
michael shifter , latin american expert at the washington-based inter-american dialogue , said that while it was " tempting to dismiss the banco del sur because of the political agenda behind it " , he would advise sceptics to wait and see .
" chavez 's political agenda is undeniable , but so is the money he has at his disposal right now , " he said .
" over the longer run , the initiative will have real problems because of politicisation , but in the meantime it would be a mistake to underestimate its possibilities . "
mr shifter also feels the timing is fortunate .
" banco del sur is taking off precisely when traditional multilateral institutions like the inter-american development bank and world bank are struggling to redefine their missions and adapt to new circumstances , " he said .
" everything is in flux , so anything can happen . "
good governance even the representatives of the multilateral credit organisations seem reluctant to dismiss banco del sur .
robert zoellick has urged the banco del sur to ensure transparency the world bank 's vice president for latin america , pamela cox , recently said that there was enough scope for both agencies to work in the region .
" the banco del sur is a complement , not a competitor , " she said .
and the new president of the world bank , robert zoellick , offered advice to the bank on transparency .
" one of the lessons we have learned on good development practices is that they should be combined with good governance , proper respect for the laws and firm practices against corruption , " mr zoellick said .

brian taylor 's blog a report due to be released this week calls for testing of more pupils , abolition of standard grades and the launch of a new broad-ranging leavers certificate .
ministers say they will consider the report carefully but wo n't make any further comment on the document until publication at 1600 gmt on tuesday .
international experts are flying into scotland for the event .
the report from the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , an international research body , is separate from a limited report it released last week , which indicated scottish pupils are not doing as well as they used to in three key subjects .
the new document , quality and equity of schooling in scotland , is a special one-off major report commissioned by former education minister peter peacock .
the broad-ranging study highlights many strengths of our education system - but also serious problems such as the large number of pupils who do badly at school and end up doing little or nothing when they leave .
it says there are other countries which are more successful in educating children from disadvantaged backgrounds . "
the report 's authors say our secondaries are too academic and should go much further to ensure pupils have the chance to begin learning a trade or skill " the document states : " who you are in scotland is far more important than what school you attend , and at present scottish schools are not strong enough to ensure who you are does not count . "
all children should be tested , it argues , so that there is reliable evidence of what progress they and their schools are making .
researchers propose this is done by rolling out the scottish survey of achievement which is carried out by independent education staff who visit schools .
at present the ssa assesses only a sample of children .
the report says this test data should be used to hold to account the local authorities given money by the scottish government to run our schools .
it states : " there is -lrb- also -rrb- a concern that without reliable data on student achievement and school performance throughout scotland the suitability and effectiveness of the current methodology for distributing grants to local authorities can not be tested . "
although the authorities - and schools - would be held to account more under the document 's proposals - they would in return have more autonomy over staff and the curriculum .
the report 's authors say our secondaries are too academic and should go much further to ensure pupils have the chance to begin learning a trade or skill .
they also say children should not necessarily be sent to college to do this vocational education - teaching them on site would be more socially inclusive .
standard grades should be phased out , the oecd report says , partly because the lower levels do not have much status and act as a block on the development of vocational education in schools .
the researchers are calling for the launch of a scottish certificate of education - a " graduation " certificate for young people in schools , colleges or jobs to mark completion of an approved programme of studies or training .
they also challenge the value of some current courses , set up by exam body the scottish qualifications authority .
these , they said , have been set up with input from " institutions that do not deliver the product and have no connection with the consumers , either teachers or students , while exercising very considerable influence over design " .
responding to the report , professor douglas weir , of strathclyde university , said : " we already have a big improvement programme under way in scottish schools .

brian taylor 's blog a report due to be released this week calls for testing of more pupils , abolition of standard grades and the launch of a new broad-ranging leavers certificate .
ministers say they will consider the report carefully but wo n't make any further comment on the document until publication at 1600 gmt on tuesday .
international experts are flying into scotland for the event .
the report from the organisation for economic co-operation and development -lrb- oecd -rrb- , an international research body , is separate from a limited report it released last week , which indicated scottish pupils are not doing as well as they used to in three key subjects .
the new document , quality and equity of schooling in scotland , is a special one-off major report commissioned by former education minister peter peacock .
the broad-ranging study highlights many strengths of our education system - but also serious problems such as the large number of pupils who do badly at school and end up doing little or nothing when they leave .
it says there are other countries which are more successful in educating children from disadvantaged backgrounds .
the report 's authors say our secondaries are too academic and should go much further to ensure pupils have the chance to begin learning a trade or skill the document states : " who you are in scotland is far more important than what school you attend , and at present scottish schools are not strong enough to ensure who you are does not count . "
all children should be tested , it argues , so that there is reliable evidence of what progress they and their schools are making .
researchers propose this is done by rolling out the scottish survey of achievement which is carried out by independent education staff who visit schools .
at present the ssa assesses only a sample of children .
the report says this test data should be used to hold to account the local authorities given money by the scottish government to run our schools .
it states : " there is -lrb- also -rrb- a concern that without reliable data on student achievement and school performance throughout scotland the suitability and effectiveness of the current methodology for distributing grants to local authorities can not be tested . "
although the authorities - and schools - would be held to account more under the document 's proposals - they would in return have more autonomy over staff and the curriculum .
the researchers are calling for phasing out of standard grades the report 's authors say our secondaries are too academic and should go much further to ensure pupils have the chance to begin learning a trade or skill .
they also say children should not necessarily be sent to college to do this vocational education - teaching them on site would be more socially inclusive .
standard grades should be phased out , the oecd report says , partly because the lower levels do not have much status and act as a block on the development of vocational education in schools .
the researchers are calling for the launch of a scottish certificate of education - a " graduation " certificate for young people in schools , colleges or jobs to mark completion of an approved programme of studies or training .
they also challenge the value of some current courses , set up by exam body the scottish qualifications authority .
these , they said , have been set up with input from " institutions that do not deliver the product and have no connection with the consumers , either teachers or students , while exercising very considerable influence over design " .
responding to the report , professor douglas weir , of strathclyde university , said : " we already have a big improvement programme under way in scottish schools .
