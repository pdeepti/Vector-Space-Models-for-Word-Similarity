bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to raise its profile as a destination for elite scholars ferrero-waldner said the eu is sensitive to concerns about brain drain that such programs cause in developing countries , where there 's always a fear top students will leave for an education abroad and never return .
erasmus mundus diplomas awarded during the program 's second phase would only become valid once a student returns home , ferrero-waldner said .
the erasmus mundus program evolved from the erasmus exchange program , which promotes student exchanges within europe .
approximately 155,000 european students participated in the erasmus program during the 2005-2006 school year . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia followed suit on saturday by announcing that it would suspend its obligations under the conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty .
if the trend continues , the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty could be next .
and then europe , freshly liberated from the cold-war threat of instant extinction , will be bristling with missiles . " in spain , conservative daily abc commented that russia 's decision to suspend the cfe treaty was bad news , but not necessarily because it meant that this could revive old military threats .
" the move shows that moscow 's political leaders , starting with putin himself , still think in terms of the long-gone categories of the cold war . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is putin telling europeans to look across the atlantic for a solution ?
vienna 's liberal paper der standard meanwhile said that the russians were acting out of principle to avoid any meddling in their sphere of influence and a strategic disadvantage .
" the planned us missile defense system is part of that .
the bush administration has talked poland and the czech republic into it and duped the other nato states that wanted to slow things down and negotiate with russia rather than have washington make all the decisions alone .
putin has given the west 150 days to fulfill his demands regarding a reform of the cfe treaty .
europe can thank bush for that . " poland 's conservative rzeczpospolita wrote that putin acted as he had promised .
" it 's important to keep a cool head now , " the daily commented , adding that the announcement came as polish president lech kaczynski was on his way to the us to discuss the missile defense system with george w. bush .
" it also happened at a point , when russia is conducting military exercises on a large scale ... putin 's saber-rattling also affects europe .
in all conversations with eu politicians , one has to say : see for yourself what the kremlin is doing and draw your own conclusions . " the handelsblatt newspaper from düsseldorf in germany on the other hand commented that putin had a solid argument on his side .
" a majority of nato states did n't ratify the 1999 version of this arms control agreement .
but the russian president still has to tolerate questions regarding the motivation behind his act of defiance .
does he want to build new tanks , new fighter planes ?
if so , what does he want to do with them ?
is he dreaming of a renaissance of the gloried soviet empire ?
putin should know where his real interests lie : in a pacific europe that offers a giant market for russia 's rich energy treasures . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel meets french president nicolas sarkozy in toulouse monday to find a solution to the ongoing malaise at the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and its airbus subsidiary . when german chancellor angela merkel meets french president nicolas sarkozy in toulouse , the hometown of european plane maker airbus , on monday the discussions will include talks on improving the management of its politically-charged parent company , eads .
it is widely expected that merkel and sarkozy will agree to scrap the company 's dual management system which sees a french and german executive share the functions of the eads chief executive and chairman positions .
many , including the current heads of the company themselves , have blamed this complicated structure , as well as the difficulty of balancing other national interests at the heart of the company , for numerous problems afflicting airbus .
" eads has to become a normal company , " president sarkozy said at the paris air show last month , underlining complications caused by the group 's unusual management and shareholder structure .
" we agree with the view that a company like eads can only exist if it has efficient structures , " said merkel at the end of may after a meeting with the french prime minister francois fillon .
airbus losses blamed on management structure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co-ceo enders is expected to have the position to himself airbus posted a massive loss last year despite delivering a record number of planes , and the company is eager to push through a radical restructuring plan to correct some of the organizational and commercial problems blamed for the poor performance .
the spectacular fall into the red was caused mainly by delays and production problems with the airbus a380 superjumbo , which is set to enter service later this year , with some of the difficulties blamed on dysfunctional management .
although a consensus has formed for scrapping the dual management system , neither side is believed to have settled on who would take up which job to preserve the franco-german balance in the company .
the most likely scenario is that the current french co-chairman of the group , arnaud lagardere , would assume the eads chairmanship on his own , while german co-chief executive tom enders would become sole chief executive .
enders fellow chief executive louis gallois , who is also chief executive of airbus , would remain head of the plane maker and focus entirely on its restructuring plan .
shareholders also attending summit the main controlling shareholders in eads , the german automaker daimlerchrysler and the french media and defense company lagardere , will also both attend the meeting on monday .
the two companies dominate a pact of controlling shareholders that also includes the french state , the spanish state and a consortium of public and private german investors .
as well as discussing eads and airbus , the two leaders will also discuss the troubled european project to produce a rival to the us-owned global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- as well as " the means to improve the economic governance of europe , " said a spokesman for the french presidency .
sarkonomics likely to feature on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has put his financial cat among the eu pigeons this latter subject could be a source of tension after sarkozy 's frequent attacks on the european central bank , which he holds responsible for boosting the value of the euro .
the euro hit fresh record highs against the dollar and yen on thursday , which penalizes european exporters by making their products more expensive in international markets .
merkel said tuesday that she was against orchestrating a fall in the euro and defended the independence of the european central bank .
merkel is also against opening up the shareholders pact to other investors , which sarkozy favors in order " to finance the launch of new planes and counteract the strong euro , " said his spokesman .
a final source of tension on monday could be demonstrations by disgruntled airbus workers protesting against the company 's restructuring plan , which foresees 10,000 job cuts in the next four years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 16.07.2007 ethics council urges relaxing german stem cell rules in a move welcomed by german researchers , the national ethics council on monday recommended easing legal restrictions intended to limit german scientists ' ability to conduct stem cell research . as germany 's top body when it comes to medical ethical issues , 14 of the national ethics council 's 24 members recommended a series of amendments to a 2002 stem cell law banning the production of embryonic cells that scientists have said hinders them from conducting research on par with international institutes . the council also said lawmakers should lift a ban placed on german scientists , both in and outside the country , on using cell lines created after jan .
1 , 2002 .
instead of using a cut-off date , the council recommended establishing an independent panel to evaluate scientists ' plans on a case-by-case basis . " if the current rules remain , german science will be hopelessly sidelined , " said horst dreier , speaking for the 14 members who favor changing the law , adding that the new law should explicitly state that new embryonic stem cell lines should come from widely available sources , not from manufacturers looking to profit from their production . expansion to permitted uses recommended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists could be arrested for conducting some forms of stem cell research the 2002 law also prevented germans from using the 20 stem cell lines they were allowed to access for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes , limiting their work to basic research .
stem cell advocates say research in the field could eventually lead to treatments for diabetes and parkinson 's disease . stem cell research remains a sensitive issue in germany due to country 's nazi past , and nine nec members voted against recommending amendments to the current regulations , saying in a statement that it would " hollow out the stem cell law . " no therapies on the horizon the minority group also said there was no reason to reevaluate the issue because therapies based on embryonic stem cell research are not likely to be developed in the foreseeable future .
the group also criticized the decision to allow researchers to make use of embryonic stem cells in their research but not allow them to create the cells themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists have said they are " miles away " from treatments based on stem cell research the german bishop 's conference said no changes should be made to the current law . " the demands of even important research interests can not under any circumstances lead to human embryos being created , " the catholic group said in a statement .
" we must not subordinate the protection of life to the freedom of research . " the german research society , however , welcomed the nec 's recommendations . " this will provide a positive impulse for stem cell research in germany , " society vice-president jörg hinrich hacker said . political decision in autumn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is divided on the issue of stem cell research politicians said they would raise the issue of embryonic stem cell research in the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , this autumn . " we will suggest moving the cut-off date to may 1 , 2007 , " rene röspel , the social democratic party 's research expert , told the berliner zeitung in an interview appearing tuesday .
" that is enough for the most versatile studies . " whether germany actually changes the law is certain to be subject to debate , as it was in 2002 . " the non-unanimous vote in the ethics council reflect the divides that this question also creates in the parliament , " ilse aigner , the research policy expert for germany 's two christian conservative parties , told tuesday 's handelsblatt newspaper . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if the current rules remain , german science will be hopelessly sidelined , " said horst dreier , speaking for the 14 members who favor changing the law , adding that the new law should explicitly state that new embryonic stem cell lines should come from widely available sources , not from manufacturers looking to profit from their production . expansion to permitted uses recommended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists could be arrested for conducting some forms of stem cell research the 2002 law also prevented germans from using the 20 stem cell lines they were allowed to access for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes , limiting their work to basic research .

erasmus mundus hopes to become the eu 's answer to the prestigious us fulbright program . erasmus mundus , started in 2004 , is designed to help european students who want to spend a year at foreign universities outside the european union and also helps bring foreign students and scholars to the eu . from 2004 to 2008 , the initial program had a budget of 230 million euros -lrb- $ 318 million -rrb- , and more than 2,300 students have participated in the exchanges .
both the funding and number of grants available will jump in 2009 as the eu has approved a five-year budget of 950 million euros . widened scope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mundus goes beyond the erasmus program eu education commissioner jan figel said the second phase of the program , which will begin with the new funding boost in 2009 , will widen erasmus mundus ' scope to include more students from india , iran and china .
there will also be more grants for doctoral students and an increase in the amount of financial aid .
erasmus mundus will become " the trademark for eu cooperation with third countries in the field of higher education , " figel said . taking on the fulbright brand erasmus mundus is seen as the european answer to the us fulbright program , which started in 1946 .
the fulbright program promotes international study by giving out approximately 6,000 competitive grants to students and scholars each year and has an annual budget of around $ 180 million . " i think that fulbright studies are really a brand name in europe and the friendships , the cooperation and the way of experience that this has brought about , this is exactly what we would like to create , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to raise its profile as a destination for elite scholars ferrero-waldner said the eu is sensitive to concerns about brain drain that such programs cause in developing countries , where there 's always a fear top students will leave for an education abroad and never return .
erasmus mundus diplomas awarded during the program 's second phase would only become valid once a student returns home , ferrero-waldner said .
the erasmus mundus program evolved from the erasmus exchange program , which promotes student exchanges within europe .
approximately 155,000 european students participated in the erasmus program during the 2005-2006 school year . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel meets french president nicolas sarkozy in toulouse monday to find a solution to the ongoing malaise at the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and its airbus subsidiary . when german chancellor angela merkel meets french president nicolas sarkozy in toulouse , the hometown of european plane maker airbus , on monday the discussions will include talks on improving the management of its politically-charged parent company , eads .
it is widely expected that merkel and sarkozy will agree to scrap the company 's dual management system which sees a french and german executive share the functions of the eads chief executive and chairman positions .
many , including the current heads of the company themselves , have blamed this complicated structure , as well as the difficulty of balancing other national interests at the heart of the company , for numerous problems afflicting airbus .
" eads has to become a normal company , " president sarkozy said at the paris air show last month , underlining complications caused by the group 's unusual management and shareholder structure .
" we agree with the view that a company like eads can only exist if it has efficient structures , " said merkel at the end of may after a meeting with the french prime minister francois fillon .
airbus losses blamed on management structure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co-ceo enders is expected to have the position to himself airbus posted a massive loss last year despite delivering a record number of planes , and the company is eager to push through a radical restructuring plan to correct some of the organizational and commercial problems blamed for the poor performance .
the spectacular fall into the red was caused mainly by delays and production problems with the airbus a380 superjumbo , which is set to enter service later this year , with some of the difficulties blamed on dysfunctional management .
although a consensus has formed for scrapping the dual management system , neither side is believed to have settled on who would take up which job to preserve the franco-german balance in the company .
the most likely scenario is that the current french co-chairman of the group , arnaud lagardere , would assume the eads chairmanship on his own , while german co-chief executive tom enders would become sole chief executive .
enders fellow chief executive louis gallois , who is also chief executive of airbus , would remain head of the plane maker and focus entirely on its restructuring plan .
shareholders also attending summit the main controlling shareholders in eads , the german automaker daimlerchrysler and the french media and defense company lagardere , will also both attend the meeting on monday .
the two companies dominate a pact of controlling shareholders that also includes the french state , the spanish state and a consortium of public and private german investors .
as well as discussing eads and airbus , the two leaders will also discuss the troubled european project to produce a rival to the us-owned global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- as well as " the means to improve the economic governance of europe , " said a spokesman for the french presidency .
sarkonomics likely to feature on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has put his financial cat among the eu pigeons this latter subject could be a source of tension after sarkozy 's frequent attacks on the european central bank , which he holds responsible for boosting the value of the euro .

merkel said tuesday that she was against orchestrating a fall in the euro and defended the independence of the european central bank .
merkel is also against opening up the shareholders pact to other investors , which sarkozy favors in order " to finance the launch of new planes and counteract the strong euro , " said his spokesman .
a final source of tension on monday could be demonstrations by disgruntled airbus workers protesting against the company 's restructuring plan , which foresees 10,000 job cuts in the next four years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de energy -pipe- 16.07.2007 burning diapers heat german retirement homes großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the liebenau foundation 's care homes are heated by burning the soiled diapers of residents patents are pending on europe 's first furnace fired entirely by soiled nappies , which was constructed for the liebenau foundation , an operator of rest homes in the south-west corner of germany . nurses and carers at the handicapped and old people 's homes are proud that every disposable diaper helps save a little fossil fuel .
" when this thing is running , we do n't need any gas or oil in the building , " said chief technician marco nauerz in the furnace room of the foundation 's main site at meckenbeuren near lake constance .
the 11-meter-high -lrb- 36-feet-high -rrb- plant can consume 8 million diapers annually .
by nauerz ' calculation , that means it can continuously eliminate the waste from 12,000 incontinent patients .
there is no risk the supply will dry up .
liebenau has already signed up 40 rest homes , some of which it owns and others run by other operators , as suppliers , and it expects to double the number by the end of the year .
the diapers are packed in plastic sacks and arrive in airtight garbage trucks .
" you ca n't smell anything here , can you ? " said nauerz , showing the " fuel " shed , where extractor fans suck out any odors .
nauerz , 55 , and no stranger to diapers as a father of three , has gained new respect for the soiled nappy through his work .
as much stored energy as wet chopped wood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youngsters can provide their own energy source too engineers say they have an average moisture content of 58 percent and can release as much energy as wet chopped wood .
at 910 degrees celsius , they burn in seconds .
the foundation uses the energy to heat water in bathrooms and in its laundry to clean towels and sheets .
the total cost of the plant , the " fuel " depot and new pipes came to 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- , nauerz estimates .
best of all , liebenau expects to make a profit from diapers , as it charges rest-home operators to get rid of the waste .
the fees are lower than those at land-fills or commercial incinerators .
to date , the foundation has had to pay 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 481,880 -rrb- annually in land-fill fees for its own 2.1 million used diapers per year .
the furnace was jointly developed by liebenau staff and an engineering company in bregenz , austria .
an automatic conveyer from the hopper to the furnace was also specially made for the job .
german law does not recognize diapers as fuel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chuck another nappy on the fire ... or maybe not the partners were surprised to run into legal difficulties , seeing as german law makes no provision for diapers as fuel .
the plant had to have flue-gas treatment like regular commercial incinerators , although the engineers say diapers are mainly organic : just cellulose , biodegradable plastic film and the contents .
as a non-profit charity , liebenau is also concerned about being kind to the environment , so it insists that all the diapers be " local produce " and rejects long-distance transport of the new fuel .
instead , it hopes to sell the furnaces elsewhere in europe .
patents have been applied for , and nauerz said the partners were developing a business model .
baby diapers are not expected to enter the model , as householders can dump these in domestic rubbish at no extra charge . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that included speedy approval in the british parliament for agreements on eu guidelines for a new treaty hammered out recently at a brussels summit provided they were implemented in a new treaty text under portugal 's eu presidency .
experts say brown , who has met merkel before at a summit in berlin when he was chancellor of the exchequer , may find merkel to be a leader he can work with .
" she is " a conciliator and somebody who manages power in a non-triumphalist way , " said hugo brady , a researcher at the centre for european reform in london .
" the problem will be if brown , under pressure at home , demands more , " brady said .
ahead of brown 's visit , the german government had praised his decision to make berlin his first stop during his european trip .
merkel had said she hoped to continue the close relations with britain she had enjoyed with brown 's predecessor , tony blair , adding it was particularly important for the well-being of europe and transatlantic ties .
meeting clouded by russian expulsions the meeting , which touched on security issues as well as climate and aid to africa , was overshadowed by an earlier decision by britain to expel four russian diplomats from london over the poisoning of former agent alexander litvinenko .
" i have no apologies for the action we have taken , " brown said in berlin . " i hope it 's understood in other parts of the world that we are not prepared to allow a situation of lawlessness to develop in london as a result of a failure to act . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between london and moscow are at a low british foreign secretary david miliband announced the decision to parliament earlier monday due to russia 's refusal to extradite the chief suspect in the case , former kgb agent andrei lugovoi .
lugovoi is accused of administering a highly radioactive poison to litvinenko when they met for tea in a central london hotel last november .
litvinenko , an outspoken kremlin critic , died three weeks later in hospital .
" we want the best possible relationships with russia .
we want to work together with russia , constructively on all the major international issues that we face , on iraq , on the middle east , " brown added .
a strong signal to europe much has been made both in britain and in germany of brown 's decision to travel to europe rather than flying to washington on his first trip abroad since taking office .
analysts have speculated whether it marks a new shift in britain 's foreign policy and gives a clear signal to european leaders that brown is serious about his country 's ties with the eu .
germany 's süddeutsche zeitung said it was a positive sign that brown had arranged to visit berlin without even scheduling a date for his washington trip .
the prime minister appeared to prefer " a certain distance to the us more out of inner conviction than populist need , " the paper said .
but miliband on sunday contradicted speculation of a cooling of relations with washington after the change of government in britain , saying the us remained the country 's " single most important bilateral partner . " a new european axis ? brown met the german chancellor just hours after a summit between merkel and nicolas sarkozy in which the new french president spoke of a " great day for the franco-german axis " after agreeing on a shake-up at ailing european plane-maker airbus .
brown is to meet with sarkozy on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's big three - merkel , sarkozy and brown experts believe it marks the establishment of a new axis between the leaders of europe 's three most powerful countries .
" it really has become obvious that blair had a terrible set of partners -lsb- in chirac and schröder -rsb- , " said brady .
" brown is much luckier ; he inherits a dynamic french leader and a chancellor who shares a lot of his basic instincts . "
while traditionally , france and germany have been considered closer to each other than to britain , merkel is capable as being as close to brown as any french leader , argued brady .
" if the pair forms a strong working relationship , they may even serve as a useful foil for sarkozy , " he said .
roderick parkes , a research associate at the german institute for international and security affairs parkes was less optimistic , believing that positive associations with merkel and sarkozy are expedient for brown at a time when the leadership of britain 's traditional ally - the united states - is led by a president whose own political days are numbered .
the prime minister " encourages talk of a ' european trio ' of sarkozy , merkel and brown , associating himself with two politicians who are perceived as forward looking and are seen to have brought a new momentum to a stagnant european political landscape , " parkes said . emma wynne -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that included speedy approval in the british parliament for agreements on eu guidelines for a new treaty hammered out recently at a brussels summit provided they were implemented in a new treaty text under portugal 's eu presidency .
experts say brown , who has met merkel before at a summit in berlin when he was chancellor of the exchequer , may find merkel to be a leader he can work with .
" she is " a conciliator and somebody who manages power in a non-triumphalist way , " said hugo brady , a researcher at the centre for european reform in london .
" the problem will be if brown , under pressure at home , demands more , " brady said .
ahead of brown 's visit , the german government had praised his decision to make berlin his first stop during his european trip .
merkel had said she hoped to continue the close relations with britain she had enjoyed with brown 's predecessor , tony blair , adding it was particularly important for the well-being of europe and transatlantic ties .
meeting clouded by russian expulsions the meeting , which touched on security issues as well as climate and aid to africa , was overshadowed by an earlier decision by britain to expel four russian diplomats from london over the poisoning of former agent alexander litvinenko .
" i have no apologies for the action we have taken , " brown said in berlin . " i hope it 's understood in other parts of the world that we are not prepared to allow a situation of lawlessness to develop in london as a result of a failure to act . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between london and moscow are at a low british foreign secretary david miliband announced the decision to parliament earlier monday due to russia 's refusal to extradite the chief suspect in the case , former kgb agent andrei lugovoi .
lugovoi is accused of administering a highly radioactive poison to litvinenko when they met for tea in a central london hotel last november .
litvinenko , an outspoken kremlin critic , died three weeks later in hospital .
" we want the best possible relationships with russia .
we want to work together with russia , constructively on all the major international issues that we face , on iraq , on the middle east , " brown added .
a strong signal to europe much has been made both in britain and in germany of brown 's decision to travel to europe rather than flying to washington on his first trip abroad since taking office .
analysts have speculated whether it marks a new shift in britain 's foreign policy and gives a clear signal to european leaders that brown is serious about his country 's ties with the eu .
germany 's süddeutsche zeitung said it was a positive sign that brown had arranged to visit berlin without even scheduling a date for his washington trip .
the prime minister appeared to prefer " a certain distance to the us more out of inner conviction than populist need , " the paper said .
but miliband on sunday contradicted speculation of a cooling of relations with washington after the change of government in britain , saying the us remained the country 's " single most important bilateral partner . " a new european axis ? brown met the german chancellor just hours after a summit between merkel and nicolas sarkozy in which the new french president spoke of a " great day for the franco-german axis " after agreeing on a shake-up at ailing european plane-maker airbus .
brown is to meet with sarkozy on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's big three - merkel , sarkozy and brown experts believe it marks the establishment of a new axis between the leaders of europe 's three most powerful countries .
" it really has become obvious that blair had a terrible set of partners -lsb- in chirac and schröder -rsb- , " said brady .
" brown is much luckier ; he inherits a dynamic french leader and a chancellor who shares a lot of his basic instincts . "
while traditionally , france and germany have been considered closer to each other than to britain , merkel is capable as being as close to brown as any french leader , argued brady .
" if the pair forms a strong working relationship , they may even serve as a useful foil for sarkozy , " he said .
roderick parkes , a research associate at the german institute for international and security affairs parkes was less optimistic , believing that positive associations with merkel and sarkozy are expedient for brown at a time when the leadership of britain 's traditional ally - the united states - is led by a president whose own political days are numbered .
the prime minister " encourages talk of a ' european trio ' of sarkozy , merkel and brown , associating himself with two politicians who are perceived as forward looking and are seen to have brought a new momentum to a stagnant european political landscape , " parkes said . emma wynne -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , 2002 .
instead of using a cut-off date , the council recommended establishing an independent panel to evaluate scientists ' plans on a case-by-case basis . " if the current rules remain , german science will be hopelessly sidelined , " said horst dreier , speaking for the 14 members who favor changing the law , adding that the new law should explicitly state that new embryonic stem cell lines should come from widely available sources , not from manufacturers looking to profit from their production . expansion to permitted uses recommended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists could be arrested for conducting some forms of stem cell research the 2002 law also prevented germans from using the 20 stem cell lines they were allowed to access for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes , limiting their work to basic research .
stem cell advocates say research in the field could eventually lead to treatments for diabetes and parkinson 's disease . stem cell research remains a sensitive issue in germany due to country 's nazi past , and nine nec members voted against recommending amendments to the current regulations , saying in a statement that it would " hollow out the stem cell law . " no therapies on the horizon the minority group also said there was no reason to reevaluate the issue because therapies based on embryonic stem cell research are not likely to be developed in the foreseeable future .

" we must not subordinate the protection of life to the freedom of research . " the german research society , however , welcomed the nec 's recommendations .

" this is the very first time that the german government will be asked to take responsibility and to care for those of the second generation in israel and indeed , worldwide , " said gideon fisher , an attorney representing the plaintiffs , before filing the suit at tel aviv district court on monday .
some 4,000 people have joined the lawsuit so far .
but baruch mazor , who heads the fisher fund , a charity that looks after so-called second-generation holocaust survivors , said that 4 to 5 percent of the 400,000 children of holocaust survivors in israel require psychotherapy as they suffer from an irrational fear of starvation and incapacitating bouts of depression .
stocking bread , hiding pain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : death camp inmates received almost no food " i have an obsession about food , especially bread , " a 58-year-old woman who was not named said on israeli radio on sunday , according to ap .
she added that she was obsessed about stocking bread as her parents fought for bread crumbs at auschwitz death camp .
" it was forbidden in our house to show pain or say that you 're sad , " she added .
" my father taught us not to express our feelings and hide our hurt .
that was very , very hard . "
a first step towards recognition mazor said that many of the people involved in the suit can not work because of their ailments and are therefore not able to pay for any treatment .
he called the lawsuit a first step towards recognizing the fate of the children of holocaust survivors .
ap reported that it 's not clear whether a ruling by an israeli court would be binding for a foreign defendant - in this case , germany .
mazor reportedly wants to use the israeli verdict for a later lawsuit filed with a german or international court .

" this is the very first time that the german government will be asked to take responsibility and to care for those of the second generation in israel and indeed , worldwide , " said gideon fisher , an attorney representing the plaintiffs , before filing the suit at tel aviv district court on monday .
some 4,000 people have joined the lawsuit so far .
but baruch mazor , who heads the fisher fund , a charity that looks after so-called second-generation holocaust survivors , said that 4 to 5 percent of the 400,000 children of holocaust survivors in israel require psychotherapy as they suffer from an irrational fear of starvation and incapacitating bouts of depression .
stocking bread , hiding pain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : death camp inmates received almost no food " i have an obsession about food , especially bread , " a 58-year-old woman who was not named said on israeli radio on sunday , according to ap .
she added that she was obsessed about stocking bread as her parents fought for bread crumbs at auschwitz death camp .
" it was forbidden in our house to show pain or say that you 're sad , " she added .
" my father taught us not to express our feelings and hide our hurt .
that was very , very hard . "
a first step towards recognition mazor said that many of the people involved in the suit can not work because of their ailments and are therefore not able to pay for any treatment .
he called the lawsuit a first step towards recognizing the fate of the children of holocaust survivors .
ap reported that it 's not clear whether a ruling by an israeli court would be binding for a foreign defendant - in this case , germany .
mazor reportedly wants to use the israeli verdict for a later lawsuit filed with a german or international court .

" when this thing is running , we do n't need any gas or oil in the building , " said chief technician marco nauerz in the furnace room of the foundation 's main site at meckenbeuren near lake constance .
the 11-meter-high -lrb- 36-feet-high -rrb- plant can consume 8 million diapers annually .
by nauerz ' calculation , that means it can continuously eliminate the waste from 12,000 incontinent patients .
there is no risk the supply will dry up .
liebenau has already signed up 40 rest homes , some of which it owns and others run by other operators , as suppliers , and it expects to double the number by the end of the year .
the diapers are packed in plastic sacks and arrive in airtight garbage trucks .
" you ca n't smell anything here , can you ? " said nauerz , showing the " fuel " shed , where extractor fans suck out any odors .
nauerz , 55 , and no stranger to diapers as a father of three , has gained new respect for the soiled nappy through his work .
as much stored energy as wet chopped wood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youngsters can provide their own energy source too engineers say they have an average moisture content of 58 percent and can release as much energy as wet chopped wood .
at 910 degrees celsius , they burn in seconds .
the foundation uses the energy to heat water in bathrooms and in its laundry to clean towels and sheets .
the total cost of the plant , the " fuel " depot and new pipes came to 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- , nauerz estimates .
best of all , liebenau expects to make a profit from diapers , as it charges rest-home operators to get rid of the waste .
the fees are lower than those at land-fills or commercial incinerators .
to date , the foundation has had to pay 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 481,880 -rrb- annually in land-fill fees for its own 2.1 million used diapers per year .
the furnace was jointly developed by liebenau staff and an engineering company in bregenz , austria .
an automatic conveyer from the hopper to the furnace was also specially made for the job .
german law does not recognize diapers as fuel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chuck another nappy on the fire ... or maybe not the partners were surprised to run into legal difficulties , seeing as german law makes no provision for diapers as fuel .
the plant had to have flue-gas treatment like regular commercial incinerators , although the engineers say diapers are mainly organic : just cellulose , biodegradable plastic film and the contents .
as a non-profit charity , liebenau is also concerned about being kind to the environment , so it insists that all the diapers be " local produce " and rejects long-distance transport of the new fuel .
instead , it hopes to sell the furnaces elsewhere in europe .
patents have been applied for , and nauerz said the partners were developing a business model .
baby diapers are not expected to enter the model , as householders can dump these in domestic rubbish at no extra charge . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

erasmus mundus hopes to become the eu 's answer to the prestigious us fulbright program . erasmus mundus , started in 2004 , is designed to help european students who want to spend a year at foreign universities outside the european union and also helps bring foreign students and scholars to the eu . from 2004 to 2008 , the initial program had a budget of 230 million euros -lrb- $ 318 million -rrb- , and more than 2,300 students have participated in the exchanges .
both the funding and number of grants available will jump in 2009 as the eu has approved a five-year budget of 950 million euros . widened scope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mundus goes beyond the erasmus program eu education commissioner jan figel said the second phase of the program , which will begin with the new funding boost in 2009 , will widen erasmus mundus ' scope to include more students from india , iran and china .
there will also be more grants for doctoral students and an increase in the amount of financial aid .

the fulbright program promotes international study by giving out approximately 6,000 competitive grants to students and scholars each year and has an annual budget of around $ 180 million .

erasmus mundus diplomas awarded during the program 's second phase would only become valid once a student returns home , ferrero-waldner said .

" when this thing is running , we do n't need any gas or oil in the building , " said chief technician marco nauerz in the furnace room of the foundation 's main site at meckenbeuren near lake constance .
the 11-meter-high -lrb- 36-feet-high -rrb- plant can consume 8 million diapers annually .
by nauerz ' calculation , that means it can continuously eliminate the waste from 12,000 incontinent patients .
there is no risk the supply will dry up .
liebenau has already signed up 40 rest homes , some of which it owns and others run by other operators , as suppliers , and it expects to double the number by the end of the year .
the diapers are packed in plastic sacks and arrive in airtight garbage trucks .
" you ca n't smell anything here , can you ? " said nauerz , showing the " fuel " shed , where extractor fans suck out any odors .

the foundation uses the energy to heat water in bathrooms and in its laundry to clean towels and sheets .
the total cost of the plant , the " fuel " depot and new pipes came to 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- , nauerz estimates .
best of all , liebenau expects to make a profit from diapers , as it charges rest-home operators to get rid of the waste .
the fees are lower than those at land-fills or commercial incinerators .
to date , the foundation has had to pay 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 481,880 -rrb- annually in land-fill fees for its own 2.1 million used diapers per year .

" when this thing is running , we do n't need any gas or oil in the building , " said chief technician marco nauerz in the furnace room of the foundation 's main site at meckenbeuren near lake constance .
the 11-meter-high -lrb- 36-feet-high -rrb- plant can consume 8 million diapers annually .
by nauerz ' calculation , that means it can continuously eliminate the waste from 12,000 incontinent patients .
there is no risk the supply will dry up .
liebenau has already signed up 40 rest homes , some of which it owns and others run by other operators , as suppliers , and it expects to double the number by the end of the year .
the diapers are packed in plastic sacks and arrive in airtight garbage trucks .
" you ca n't smell anything here , can you ? " said nauerz , showing the " fuel " shed , where extractor fans suck out any odors .

the foundation uses the energy to heat water in bathrooms and in its laundry to clean towels and sheets .
the total cost of the plant , the " fuel " depot and new pipes came to 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- , nauerz estimates .
best of all , liebenau expects to make a profit from diapers , as it charges rest-home operators to get rid of the waste .
the fees are lower than those at land-fills or commercial incinerators .
to date , the foundation has had to pay 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 481,880 -rrb- annually in land-fill fees for its own 2.1 million used diapers per year .

german chancellor angela merkel meets french president nicolas sarkozy in toulouse monday to find a solution to the ongoing malaise at the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and its airbus subsidiary . when german chancellor angela merkel meets french president nicolas sarkozy in toulouse , the hometown of european plane maker airbus , on monday the discussions will include talks on improving the management of its politically-charged parent company , eads .
it is widely expected that merkel and sarkozy will agree to scrap the company 's dual management system which sees a french and german executive share the functions of the eads chief executive and chairman positions .
many , including the current heads of the company themselves , have blamed this complicated structure , as well as the difficulty of balancing other national interests at the heart of the company , for numerous problems afflicting airbus .
" eads has to become a normal company , " president sarkozy said at the paris air show last month , underlining complications caused by the group 's unusual management and shareholder structure .
" we agree with the view that a company like eads can only exist if it has efficient structures , " said merkel at the end of may after a meeting with the french prime minister francois fillon .
airbus losses blamed on management structure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co-ceo enders is expected to have the position to himself airbus posted a massive loss last year despite delivering a record number of planes , and the company is eager to push through a radical restructuring plan to correct some of the organizational and commercial problems blamed for the poor performance .
the spectacular fall into the red was caused mainly by delays and production problems with the airbus a380 superjumbo , which is set to enter service later this year , with some of the difficulties blamed on dysfunctional management .
although a consensus has formed for scrapping the dual management system , neither side is believed to have settled on who would take up which job to preserve the franco-german balance in the company .
the most likely scenario is that the current french co-chairman of the group , arnaud lagardere , would assume the eads chairmanship on his own , while german co-chief executive tom enders would become sole chief executive .
enders fellow chief executive louis gallois , who is also chief executive of airbus , would remain head of the plane maker and focus entirely on its restructuring plan .
shareholders also attending summit the main controlling shareholders in eads , the german automaker daimlerchrysler and the french media and defense company lagardere , will also both attend the meeting on monday .
the two companies dominate a pact of controlling shareholders that also includes the french state , the spanish state and a consortium of public and private german investors .
as well as discussing eads and airbus , the two leaders will also discuss the troubled european project to produce a rival to the us-owned global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- as well as " the means to improve the economic governance of europe , " said a spokesman for the french presidency .
sarkonomics likely to feature on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has put his financial cat among the eu pigeons this latter subject could be a source of tension after sarkozy 's frequent attacks on the european central bank , which he holds responsible for boosting the value of the euro .
the euro hit fresh record highs against the dollar and yen on thursday , which penalizes european exporters by making their products more expensive in international markets .
merkel said tuesday that she was against orchestrating a fall in the euro and defended the independence of the european central bank .
merkel is also against opening up the shareholders pact to other investors , which sarkozy favors in order " to finance the launch of new planes and counteract the strong euro , " said his spokesman .
a final source of tension on monday could be demonstrations by disgruntled airbus workers protesting against the company 's restructuring plan , which foresees 10,000 job cuts in the next four years .

russia followed suit on saturday by announcing that it would suspend its obligations under the conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty .
if the trend continues , the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty could be next .
and then europe , freshly liberated from the cold-war threat of instant extinction , will be bristling with missiles . " in spain , conservative daily abc commented that russia 's decision to suspend the cfe treaty was bad news , but not necessarily because it meant that this could revive old military threats .
" the move shows that moscow 's political leaders , starting with putin himself , still think in terms of the long-gone categories of the cold war . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is putin telling europeans to look across the atlantic for a solution ?
vienna 's liberal paper der standard meanwhile said that the russians were acting out of principle to avoid any meddling in their sphere of influence and a strategic disadvantage .
" the planned us missile defense system is part of that .
the bush administration has talked poland and the czech republic into it and duped the other nato states that wanted to slow things down and negotiate with russia rather than have washington make all the decisions alone .
putin has given the west 150 days to fulfill his demands regarding a reform of the cfe treaty .
europe can thank bush for that . " poland 's conservative rzeczpospolita wrote that putin acted as he had promised .
" it 's important to keep a cool head now , " the daily commented , adding that the announcement came as polish president lech kaczynski was on his way to the us to discuss the missile defense system with george w. bush .
" it also happened at a point , when russia is conducting military exercises on a large scale ... putin 's saber-rattling also affects europe .
in all conversations with eu politicians , one has to say : see for yourself what the kremlin is doing and draw your own conclusions . " the handelsblatt newspaper from düsseldorf in germany on the other hand commented that putin had a solid argument on his side .
" a majority of nato states did n't ratify the 1999 version of this arms control agreement .
but the russian president still has to tolerate questions regarding the motivation behind his act of defiance .
does he want to build new tanks , new fighter planes ?
if so , what does he want to do with them ?
is he dreaming of a renaissance of the gloried soviet empire ?
putin should know where his real interests lie : in a pacific europe that offers a giant market for russia 's rich energy treasures . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?
dw-world.de europe , us , nato " disappointed " by russia 's treaty decision the united states and nato , along with several european states , expressed disappointment saturday over russia 's suspension of its participation in a key arms control treaty .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 16.07.2007 european press review : putin 's saber-rattling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " mother russia " is unlikely to prepare for an attack europe 's editorials monday commented on russian president putin 's decision to suspend a key arms control treaty , but some were hopeful that moscow 's leader would rethink the move before it takes effect later this year . britain 's the guardian wrote that " the current fad of tearing up vital arms-control agreements was started by america when it abrogated the anti-ballistic missile treaty in order to build its missile shield .
russia followed suit on saturday by announcing that it would suspend its obligations under the conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty .
if the trend continues , the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty could be next .
and then europe , freshly liberated from the cold-war threat of instant extinction , will be bristling with missiles . " in spain , conservative daily abc commented that russia 's decision to suspend the cfe treaty was bad news , but not necessarily because it meant that this could revive old military threats .
" the move shows that moscow 's political leaders , starting with putin himself , still think in terms of the long-gone categories of the cold war . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is putin telling europeans to look across the atlantic for a solution ?
vienna 's liberal paper der standard meanwhile said that the russians were acting out of principle to avoid any meddling in their sphere of influence and a strategic disadvantage .
" the planned us missile defense system is part of that .
the bush administration has talked poland and the czech republic into it and duped the other nato states that wanted to slow things down and negotiate with russia rather than have washington make all the decisions alone .
putin has given the west 150 days to fulfill his demands regarding a reform of the cfe treaty .
europe can thank bush for that . " poland 's conservative rzeczpospolita wrote that putin acted as he had promised .
" it 's important to keep a cool head now , " the daily commented , adding that the announcement came as polish president lech kaczynski was on his way to the us to discuss the missile defense system with george w. bush .
" it also happened at a point , when russia is conducting military exercises on a large scale ... putin 's saber-rattling also affects europe .
in all conversations with eu politicians , one has to say : see for yourself what the kremlin is doing and draw your own conclusions . " the handelsblatt newspaper from düsseldorf in germany on the other hand commented that putin had a solid argument on his side .
" a majority of nato states did n't ratify the 1999 version of this arms control agreement .
but the russian president still has to tolerate questions regarding the motivation behind his act of defiance .
does he want to build new tanks , new fighter planes ?
if so , what does he want to do with them ?
is he dreaming of a renaissance of the gloried soviet empire ?
putin should know where his real interests lie : in a pacific europe that offers a giant market for russia 's rich energy treasures . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the organizations said the transaction would make a mockery of the eu arms and trade restrictions that were imposed on burma , also known as myanmar , for its human rights abuses .
" the eu embargo explicitly states that no military equipment should be supplied , either directly or indirectly , for use in myanmar , " said roy isbister from saferworld , one of the report 's compilers .
" what 's the point in having an arms embargo if it is not going to be implemented or enforced ? "

the advanced light helicopter was developed in association with eurocopter deutschland and is built by hindustan aeronautics limited .
according to the report , it would not be operational without vital components from eu member states , including rocket launchers from belgium , rockets , guns and engines from france , brake systems from italy ; fuel tanks and gearboxes from britain and protective equipment from sweden .

" greater attention has to be given to the end-use agreements and the re-export of components from eu member states , " she said .
" otherwise , these states could find themselves indirectly propping up a brutal regime which they themselves have condemned and whose violations have amounted to crimes against humanity . "

" this is the very first time that the german government will be asked to take responsibility and to care for those of the second generation in israel and indeed , worldwide , " said gideon fisher , an attorney representing the plaintiffs , before filing the suit at tel aviv district court on monday .
some 4,000 people have joined the lawsuit so far .
but baruch mazor , who heads the fisher fund , a charity that looks after so-called second-generation holocaust survivors , said that 4 to 5 percent of the 400,000 children of holocaust survivors in israel require psychotherapy as they suffer from an irrational fear of starvation and incapacitating bouts of depression .
stocking bread , hiding pain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : death camp inmates received almost no food " i have an obsession about food , especially bread , " a 58-year-old woman who was not named said on israeli radio on sunday , according to ap .
she added that she was obsessed about stocking bread as her parents fought for bread crumbs at auschwitz death camp .
" it was forbidden in our house to show pain or say that you 're sad , " she added .
" my father taught us not to express our feelings and hide our hurt .
that was very , very hard . "
a first step towards recognition mazor said that many of the people involved in the suit can not work because of their ailments and are therefore not able to pay for any treatment .
he called the lawsuit a first step towards recognizing the fate of the children of holocaust survivors .
ap reported that it 's not clear whether a ruling by an israeli court would be binding for a foreign defendant - in this case , germany .

" this is the very first time that the german government will be asked to take responsibility and to care for those of the second generation in israel and indeed , worldwide , " said gideon fisher , an attorney representing the plaintiffs , before filing the suit at tel aviv district court on monday .
some 4,000 people have joined the lawsuit so far .
but baruch mazor , who heads the fisher fund , a charity that looks after so-called second-generation holocaust survivors , said that 4 to 5 percent of the 400,000 children of holocaust survivors in israel require psychotherapy as they suffer from an irrational fear of starvation and incapacitating bouts of depression .

" it was forbidden in our house to show pain or say that you 're sad , " she added .
" my father taught us not to express our feelings and hide our hurt .
that was very , very hard . "
a first step towards recognition mazor said that many of the people involved in the suit can not work because of their ailments and are therefore not able to pay for any treatment .
he called the lawsuit a first step towards recognizing the fate of the children of holocaust survivors .
ap reported that it 's not clear whether a ruling by an israeli court would be binding for a foreign defendant - in this case , germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 16.07.2007 ethics council urges relaxing german stem cell rules in a move welcomed by german researchers , the national ethics council on monday recommended easing legal restrictions intended to limit german scientists ' ability to conduct stem cell research . as germany 's top body when it comes to medical ethical issues , 14 of the national ethics council 's 24 members recommended a series of amendments to a 2002 stem cell law banning the production of embryonic cells that scientists have said hinders them from conducting research on par with international institutes . the council also said lawmakers should lift a ban placed on german scientists , both in and outside the country , on using cell lines created after jan .
1 , 2002 .
instead of using a cut-off date , the council recommended establishing an independent panel to evaluate scientists ' plans on a case-by-case basis . " if the current rules remain , german science will be hopelessly sidelined , " said horst dreier , speaking for the 14 members who favor changing the law , adding that the new law should explicitly state that new embryonic stem cell lines should come from widely available sources , not from manufacturers looking to profit from their production . expansion to permitted uses recommended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists could be arrested for conducting some forms of stem cell research the 2002 law also prevented germans from using the 20 stem cell lines they were allowed to access for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes , limiting their work to basic research .
stem cell advocates say research in the field could eventually lead to treatments for diabetes and parkinson 's disease . stem cell research remains a sensitive issue in germany due to country 's nazi past , and nine nec members voted against recommending amendments to the current regulations , saying in a statement that it would " hollow out the stem cell law . " no therapies on the horizon the minority group also said there was no reason to reevaluate the issue because therapies based on embryonic stem cell research are not likely to be developed in the foreseeable future .
the group also criticized the decision to allow researchers to make use of embryonic stem cells in their research but not allow them to create the cells themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists have said they are " miles away " from treatments based on stem cell research the german bishop 's conference said no changes should be made to the current law .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 16.07.2007 ethics council urges relaxing german stem cell rules in a move welcomed by german researchers , the national ethics council on monday recommended easing legal restrictions intended to limit german scientists ' ability to conduct stem cell research . as germany 's top body when it comes to medical ethical issues , 14 of the national ethics council 's 24 members recommended a series of amendments to a 2002 stem cell law banning the production of embryonic cells that scientists have said hinders them from conducting research on par with international institutes . the council also said lawmakers should lift a ban placed on german scientists , both in and outside the country , on using cell lines created after jan .
1 , 2002 .
instead of using a cut-off date , the council recommended establishing an independent panel to evaluate scientists ' plans on a case-by-case basis . " if the current rules remain , german science will be hopelessly sidelined , " said horst dreier , speaking for the 14 members who favor changing the law , adding that the new law should explicitly state that new embryonic stem cell lines should come from widely available sources , not from manufacturers looking to profit from their production . expansion to permitted uses recommended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists could be arrested for conducting some forms of stem cell research the 2002 law also prevented germans from using the 20 stem cell lines they were allowed to access for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes , limiting their work to basic research .
stem cell advocates say research in the field could eventually lead to treatments for diabetes and parkinson 's disease . stem cell research remains a sensitive issue in germany due to country 's nazi past , and nine nec members voted against recommending amendments to the current regulations , saying in a statement that it would " hollow out the stem cell law . " no therapies on the horizon the minority group also said there was no reason to reevaluate the issue because therapies based on embryonic stem cell research are not likely to be developed in the foreseeable future .
the group also criticized the decision to allow researchers to make use of embryonic stem cells in their research but not allow them to create the cells themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists have said they are " miles away " from treatments based on stem cell research the german bishop 's conference said no changes should be made to the current law . " the demands of even important research interests can not under any circumstances lead to human embryos being created , " the catholic group said in a statement .
" we must not subordinate the protection of life to the freedom of research . " the german research society , however , welcomed the nec 's recommendations .

that included speedy approval in the british parliament for agreements on eu guidelines for a new treaty hammered out recently at a brussels summit provided they were implemented in a new treaty text under portugal 's eu presidency .
experts say brown , who has met merkel before at a summit in berlin when he was chancellor of the exchequer , may find merkel to be a leader he can work with .
" she is " a conciliator and somebody who manages power in a non-triumphalist way , " said hugo brady , a researcher at the centre for european reform in london .
" the problem will be if brown , under pressure at home , demands more , " brady said .
ahead of brown 's visit , the german government had praised his decision to make berlin his first stop during his european trip .
merkel had said she hoped to continue the close relations with britain she had enjoyed with brown 's predecessor , tony blair , adding it was particularly important for the well-being of europe and transatlantic ties .
meeting clouded by russian expulsions the meeting , which touched on security issues as well as climate and aid to africa , was overshadowed by an earlier decision by britain to expel four russian diplomats from london over the poisoning of former agent alexander litvinenko .
" i have no apologies for the action we have taken , " brown said in berlin . " i hope it 's understood in other parts of the world that we are not prepared to allow a situation of lawlessness to develop in london as a result of a failure to act . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between london and moscow are at a low british foreign secretary david miliband announced the decision to parliament earlier monday due to russia 's refusal to extradite the chief suspect in the case , former kgb agent andrei lugovoi .
lugovoi is accused of administering a highly radioactive poison to litvinenko when they met for tea in a central london hotel last november .
litvinenko , an outspoken kremlin critic , died three weeks later in hospital .
" we want the best possible relationships with russia .
we want to work together with russia , constructively on all the major international issues that we face , on iraq , on the middle east , " brown added .
a strong signal to europe much has been made both in britain and in germany of brown 's decision to travel to europe rather than flying to washington on his first trip abroad since taking office .
analysts have speculated whether it marks a new shift in britain 's foreign policy and gives a clear signal to european leaders that brown is serious about his country 's ties with the eu .
germany 's süddeutsche zeitung said it was a positive sign that brown had arranged to visit berlin without even scheduling a date for his washington trip .
the prime minister appeared to prefer " a certain distance to the us more out of inner conviction than populist need , " the paper said .
but miliband on sunday contradicted speculation of a cooling of relations with washington after the change of government in britain , saying the us remained the country 's " single most important bilateral partner . " a new european axis ? brown met the german chancellor just hours after a summit between merkel and nicolas sarkozy in which the new french president spoke of a " great day for the franco-german axis " after agreeing on a shake-up at ailing european plane-maker airbus .
brown is to meet with sarkozy on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's big three - merkel , sarkozy and brown experts believe it marks the establishment of a new axis between the leaders of europe 's three most powerful countries .
" it really has become obvious that blair had a terrible set of partners -lsb- in chirac and schröder -rsb- , " said brady .
" brown is much luckier ; he inherits a dynamic french leader and a chancellor who shares a lot of his basic instincts . "
while traditionally , france and germany have been considered closer to each other than to britain , merkel is capable as being as close to brown as any french leader , argued brady .
" if the pair forms a strong working relationship , they may even serve as a useful foil for sarkozy , " he said .
roderick parkes , a research associate at the german institute for international and security affairs parkes was less optimistic , believing that positive associations with merkel and sarkozy are expedient for brown at a time when the leadership of britain 's traditional ally - the united states - is led by a president whose own political days are numbered .
the prime minister " encourages talk of a ' european trio ' of sarkozy , merkel and brown , associating himself with two politicians who are perceived as forward looking and are seen to have brought a new momentum to a stagnant european political landscape , " parkes said . emma wynne -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel meets french president nicolas sarkozy in toulouse monday to find a solution to the ongoing malaise at the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and its airbus subsidiary . when german chancellor angela merkel meets french president nicolas sarkozy in toulouse , the hometown of european plane maker airbus , on monday the discussions will include talks on improving the management of its politically-charged parent company , eads .
it is widely expected that merkel and sarkozy will agree to scrap the company 's dual management system which sees a french and german executive share the functions of the eads chief executive and chairman positions .
many , including the current heads of the company themselves , have blamed this complicated structure , as well as the difficulty of balancing other national interests at the heart of the company , for numerous problems afflicting airbus .
" eads has to become a normal company , " president sarkozy said at the paris air show last month , underlining complications caused by the group 's unusual management and shareholder structure .
" we agree with the view that a company like eads can only exist if it has efficient structures , " said merkel at the end of may after a meeting with the french prime minister francois fillon .
airbus losses blamed on management structure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co-ceo enders is expected to have the position to himself airbus posted a massive loss last year despite delivering a record number of planes , and the company is eager to push through a radical restructuring plan to correct some of the organizational and commercial problems blamed for the poor performance .
the spectacular fall into the red was caused mainly by delays and production problems with the airbus a380 superjumbo , which is set to enter service later this year , with some of the difficulties blamed on dysfunctional management .
although a consensus has formed for scrapping the dual management system , neither side is believed to have settled on who would take up which job to preserve the franco-german balance in the company .
the most likely scenario is that the current french co-chairman of the group , arnaud lagardere , would assume the eads chairmanship on his own , while german co-chief executive tom enders would become sole chief executive .
enders fellow chief executive louis gallois , who is also chief executive of airbus , would remain head of the plane maker and focus entirely on its restructuring plan .
shareholders also attending summit the main controlling shareholders in eads , the german automaker daimlerchrysler and the french media and defense company lagardere , will also both attend the meeting on monday .

german chancellor angela merkel meets french president nicolas sarkozy in toulouse monday to find a solution to the ongoing malaise at the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and its airbus subsidiary . when german chancellor angela merkel meets french president nicolas sarkozy in toulouse , the hometown of european plane maker airbus , on monday the discussions will include talks on improving the management of its politically-charged parent company , eads .
it is widely expected that merkel and sarkozy will agree to scrap the company 's dual management system which sees a french and german executive share the functions of the eads chief executive and chairman positions .
many , including the current heads of the company themselves , have blamed this complicated structure , as well as the difficulty of balancing other national interests at the heart of the company , for numerous problems afflicting airbus .
" eads has to become a normal company , " president sarkozy said at the paris air show last month , underlining complications caused by the group 's unusual management and shareholder structure .
" we agree with the view that a company like eads can only exist if it has efficient structures , " said merkel at the end of may after a meeting with the french prime minister francois fillon .
airbus losses blamed on management structure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co-ceo enders is expected to have the position to himself airbus posted a massive loss last year despite delivering a record number of planes , and the company is eager to push through a radical restructuring plan to correct some of the organizational and commercial problems blamed for the poor performance .
the spectacular fall into the red was caused mainly by delays and production problems with the airbus a380 superjumbo , which is set to enter service later this year , with some of the difficulties blamed on dysfunctional management .
although a consensus has formed for scrapping the dual management system , neither side is believed to have settled on who would take up which job to preserve the franco-german balance in the company .
the most likely scenario is that the current french co-chairman of the group , arnaud lagardere , would assume the eads chairmanship on his own , while german co-chief executive tom enders would become sole chief executive .
enders fellow chief executive louis gallois , who is also chief executive of airbus , would remain head of the plane maker and focus entirely on its restructuring plan .
shareholders also attending summit the main controlling shareholders in eads , the german automaker daimlerchrysler and the french media and defense company lagardere , will also both attend the meeting on monday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 16.07.2007 ethics council urges relaxing german stem cell rules in a move welcomed by german researchers , the national ethics council on monday recommended easing legal restrictions intended to limit german scientists ' ability to conduct stem cell research . as germany 's top body when it comes to medical ethical issues , 14 of the national ethics council 's 24 members recommended a series of amendments to a 2002 stem cell law banning the production of embryonic cells that scientists have said hinders them from conducting research on par with international institutes . the council also said lawmakers should lift a ban placed on german scientists , both in and outside the country , on using cell lines created after jan .
1 , 2002 .
instead of using a cut-off date , the council recommended establishing an independent panel to evaluate scientists ' plans on a case-by-case basis . " if the current rules remain , german science will be hopelessly sidelined , " said horst dreier , speaking for the 14 members who favor changing the law , adding that the new law should explicitly state that new embryonic stem cell lines should come from widely available sources , not from manufacturers looking to profit from their production . expansion to permitted uses recommended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists could be arrested for conducting some forms of stem cell research the 2002 law also prevented germans from using the 20 stem cell lines they were allowed to access for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes , limiting their work to basic research .
stem cell advocates say research in the field could eventually lead to treatments for diabetes and parkinson 's disease . stem cell research remains a sensitive issue in germany due to country 's nazi past , and nine nec members voted against recommending amendments to the current regulations , saying in a statement that it would " hollow out the stem cell law . " no therapies on the horizon the minority group also said there was no reason to reevaluate the issue because therapies based on embryonic stem cell research are not likely to be developed in the foreseeable future .
the group also criticized the decision to allow researchers to make use of embryonic stem cells in their research but not allow them to create the cells themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists have said they are " miles away " from treatments based on stem cell research the german bishop 's conference said no changes should be made to the current law . " the demands of even important research interests can not under any circumstances lead to human embryos being created , " the catholic group said in a statement .
" we must not subordinate the protection of life to the freedom of research . " the german research society , however , welcomed the nec 's recommendations . " this will provide a positive impulse for stem cell research in germany , " society vice-president jörg hinrich hacker said . political decision in autumn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is divided on the issue of stem cell research politicians said they would raise the issue of embryonic stem cell research in the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , this autumn . " we will suggest moving the cut-off date to may 1 , 2007 , " rene röspel , the social democratic party 's research expert , told the berliner zeitung in an interview appearing tuesday .
" that is enough for the most versatile studies . " whether germany actually changes the law is certain to be subject to debate , as it was in 2002 . " the non-unanimous vote in the ethics council reflect the divides that this question also creates in the parliament , " ilse aigner , the research policy expert for germany 's two christian conservative parties , told tuesday 's handelsblatt newspaper . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel meets french president nicolas sarkozy in toulouse monday to find a solution to the ongoing malaise at the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and its airbus subsidiary . when german chancellor angela merkel meets french president nicolas sarkozy in toulouse , the hometown of european plane maker airbus , on monday the discussions will include talks on improving the management of its politically-charged parent company , eads .
it is widely expected that merkel and sarkozy will agree to scrap the company 's dual management system which sees a french and german executive share the functions of the eads chief executive and chairman positions .
many , including the current heads of the company themselves , have blamed this complicated structure , as well as the difficulty of balancing other national interests at the heart of the company , for numerous problems afflicting airbus .
" eads has to become a normal company , " president sarkozy said at the paris air show last month , underlining complications caused by the group 's unusual management and shareholder structure .
" we agree with the view that a company like eads can only exist if it has efficient structures , " said merkel at the end of may after a meeting with the french prime minister francois fillon .
airbus losses blamed on management structure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co-ceo enders is expected to have the position to himself airbus posted a massive loss last year despite delivering a record number of planes , and the company is eager to push through a radical restructuring plan to correct some of the organizational and commercial problems blamed for the poor performance .
the spectacular fall into the red was caused mainly by delays and production problems with the airbus a380 superjumbo , which is set to enter service later this year , with some of the difficulties blamed on dysfunctional management .
although a consensus has formed for scrapping the dual management system , neither side is believed to have settled on who would take up which job to preserve the franco-german balance in the company .
the most likely scenario is that the current french co-chairman of the group , arnaud lagardere , would assume the eads chairmanship on his own , while german co-chief executive tom enders would become sole chief executive .
enders fellow chief executive louis gallois , who is also chief executive of airbus , would remain head of the plane maker and focus entirely on its restructuring plan .
shareholders also attending summit the main controlling shareholders in eads , the german automaker daimlerchrysler and the french media and defense company lagardere , will also both attend the meeting on monday .
the two companies dominate a pact of controlling shareholders that also includes the french state , the spanish state and a consortium of public and private german investors .
as well as discussing eads and airbus , the two leaders will also discuss the troubled european project to produce a rival to the us-owned global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- as well as " the means to improve the economic governance of europe , " said a spokesman for the french presidency .
sarkonomics likely to feature on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has put his financial cat among the eu pigeons this latter subject could be a source of tension after sarkozy 's frequent attacks on the european central bank , which he holds responsible for boosting the value of the euro .
the euro hit fresh record highs against the dollar and yen on thursday , which penalizes european exporters by making their products more expensive in international markets .
merkel said tuesday that she was against orchestrating a fall in the euro and defended the independence of the european central bank .
merkel is also against opening up the shareholders pact to other investors , which sarkozy favors in order " to finance the launch of new planes and counteract the strong euro , " said his spokesman .
a final source of tension on monday could be demonstrations by disgruntled airbus workers protesting against the company 's restructuring plan , which foresees 10,000 job cuts in the next four years .
the hard-left trade union cgt has called for workers to challenge the plans , dubbed " power8 " by the company . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" when this thing is running , we do n't need any gas or oil in the building , " said chief technician marco nauerz in the furnace room of the foundation 's main site at meckenbeuren near lake constance .
the 11-meter-high -lrb- 36-feet-high -rrb- plant can consume 8 million diapers annually .
by nauerz ' calculation , that means it can continuously eliminate the waste from 12,000 incontinent patients .
there is no risk the supply will dry up .
liebenau has already signed up 40 rest homes , some of which it owns and others run by other operators , as suppliers , and it expects to double the number by the end of the year .
the diapers are packed in plastic sacks and arrive in airtight garbage trucks .
" you ca n't smell anything here , can you ? " said nauerz , showing the " fuel " shed , where extractor fans suck out any odors .
nauerz , 55 , and no stranger to diapers as a father of three , has gained new respect for the soiled nappy through his work .

at 910 degrees celsius , they burn in seconds .
the foundation uses the energy to heat water in bathrooms and in its laundry to clean towels and sheets .
the total cost of the plant , the " fuel " depot and new pipes came to 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- , nauerz estimates .
best of all , liebenau expects to make a profit from diapers , as it charges rest-home operators to get rid of the waste .
the fees are lower than those at land-fills or commercial incinerators .
to date , the foundation has had to pay 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 481,880 -rrb- annually in land-fill fees for its own 2.1 million used diapers per year .
the furnace was jointly developed by liebenau staff and an engineering company in bregenz , austria .
an automatic conveyer from the hopper to the furnace was also specially made for the job .
german law does not recognize diapers as fuel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chuck another nappy on the fire ... or maybe not the partners were surprised to run into legal difficulties , seeing as german law makes no provision for diapers as fuel .
the plant had to have flue-gas treatment like regular commercial incinerators , although the engineers say diapers are mainly organic : just cellulose , biodegradable plastic film and the contents .
as a non-profit charity , liebenau is also concerned about being kind to the environment , so it insists that all the diapers be " local produce " and rejects long-distance transport of the new fuel .
instead , it hopes to sell the furnaces elsewhere in europe .

russia followed suit on saturday by announcing that it would suspend its obligations under the conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty .
if the trend continues , the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty could be next .
and then europe , freshly liberated from the cold-war threat of instant extinction , will be bristling with missiles . " in spain , conservative daily abc commented that russia 's decision to suspend the cfe treaty was bad news , but not necessarily because it meant that this could revive old military threats .
" the move shows that moscow 's political leaders , starting with putin himself , still think in terms of the long-gone categories of the cold war . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is putin telling europeans to look across the atlantic for a solution ?
vienna 's liberal paper der standard meanwhile said that the russians were acting out of principle to avoid any meddling in their sphere of influence and a strategic disadvantage .
" the planned us missile defense system is part of that .
the bush administration has talked poland and the czech republic into it and duped the other nato states that wanted to slow things down and negotiate with russia rather than have washington make all the decisions alone .
putin has given the west 150 days to fulfill his demands regarding a reform of the cfe treaty .
europe can thank bush for that . " poland 's conservative rzeczpospolita wrote that putin acted as he had promised .
" it 's important to keep a cool head now , " the daily commented , adding that the announcement came as polish president lech kaczynski was on his way to the us to discuss the missile defense system with george w. bush .
" it also happened at a point , when russia is conducting military exercises on a large scale ... putin 's saber-rattling also affects europe .
in all conversations with eu politicians , one has to say : see for yourself what the kremlin is doing and draw your own conclusions . " the handelsblatt newspaper from düsseldorf in germany on the other hand commented that putin had a solid argument on his side .
" a majority of nato states did n't ratify the 1999 version of this arms control agreement .
but the russian president still has to tolerate questions regarding the motivation behind his act of defiance .
does he want to build new tanks , new fighter planes ?
if so , what does he want to do with them ?
is he dreaming of a renaissance of the gloried soviet empire ?
putin should know where his real interests lie : in a pacific europe that offers a giant market for russia 's rich energy treasures . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 16.07.2007 ethics council urges relaxing german stem cell rules in a move welcomed by german researchers , the national ethics council on monday recommended easing legal restrictions intended to limit german scientists ' ability to conduct stem cell research . as germany 's top body when it comes to medical ethical issues , 14 of the national ethics council 's 24 members recommended a series of amendments to a 2002 stem cell law banning the production of embryonic cells that scientists have said hinders them from conducting research on par with international institutes . the council also said lawmakers should lift a ban placed on german scientists , both in and outside the country , on using cell lines created after jan .
1 , 2002 .
instead of using a cut-off date , the council recommended establishing an independent panel to evaluate scientists ' plans on a case-by-case basis . " if the current rules remain , german science will be hopelessly sidelined , " said horst dreier , speaking for the 14 members who favor changing the law , adding that the new law should explicitly state that new embryonic stem cell lines should come from widely available sources , not from manufacturers looking to profit from their production . expansion to permitted uses recommended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists could be arrested for conducting some forms of stem cell research the 2002 law also prevented germans from using the 20 stem cell lines they were allowed to access for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes , limiting their work to basic research .
stem cell advocates say research in the field could eventually lead to treatments for diabetes and parkinson 's disease . stem cell research remains a sensitive issue in germany due to country 's nazi past , and nine nec members voted against recommending amendments to the current regulations , saying in a statement that it would " hollow out the stem cell law . " no therapies on the horizon the minority group also said there was no reason to reevaluate the issue because therapies based on embryonic stem cell research are not likely to be developed in the foreseeable future .
the group also criticized the decision to allow researchers to make use of embryonic stem cells in their research but not allow them to create the cells themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists have said they are " miles away " from treatments based on stem cell research the german bishop 's conference said no changes should be made to the current law . " the demands of even important research interests can not under any circumstances lead to human embryos being created , " the catholic group said in a statement .
" we must not subordinate the protection of life to the freedom of research . " the german research society , however , welcomed the nec 's recommendations . " this will provide a positive impulse for stem cell research in germany , " society vice-president jörg hinrich hacker said . political decision in autumn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is divided on the issue of stem cell research politicians said they would raise the issue of embryonic stem cell research in the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , this autumn . " we will suggest moving the cut-off date to may 1 , 2007 , " rene röspel , the social democratic party 's research expert , told the berliner zeitung in an interview appearing tuesday .
" that is enough for the most versatile studies . " whether germany actually changes the law is certain to be subject to debate , as it was in 2002 . " the non-unanimous vote in the ethics council reflect the divides that this question also creates in the parliament , " ilse aigner , the research policy expert for germany 's two christian conservative parties , told tuesday 's handelsblatt newspaper . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is the very first time that the german government will be asked to take responsibility and to care for those of the second generation in israel and indeed , worldwide , " said gideon fisher , an attorney representing the plaintiffs , before filing the suit at tel aviv district court on monday .
some 4,000 people have joined the lawsuit so far .
but baruch mazor , who heads the fisher fund , a charity that looks after so-called second-generation holocaust survivors , said that 4 to 5 percent of the 400,000 children of holocaust survivors in israel require psychotherapy as they suffer from an irrational fear of starvation and incapacitating bouts of depression .

" it was forbidden in our house to show pain or say that you 're sad , " she added .
" my father taught us not to express our feelings and hide our hurt .
that was very , very hard . "
a first step towards recognition mazor said that many of the people involved in the suit can not work because of their ailments and are therefore not able to pay for any treatment .
he called the lawsuit a first step towards recognizing the fate of the children of holocaust survivors .
ap reported that it 's not clear whether a ruling by an israeli court would be binding for a foreign defendant - in this case , germany .

erasmus mundus hopes to become the eu 's answer to the prestigious us fulbright program . erasmus mundus , started in 2004 , is designed to help european students who want to spend a year at foreign universities outside the european union and also helps bring foreign students and scholars to the eu . from 2004 to 2008 , the initial program had a budget of 230 million euros -lrb- $ 318 million -rrb- , and more than 2,300 students have participated in the exchanges .
both the funding and number of grants available will jump in 2009 as the eu has approved a five-year budget of 950 million euros . widened scope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mundus goes beyond the erasmus program eu education commissioner jan figel said the second phase of the program , which will begin with the new funding boost in 2009 , will widen erasmus mundus ' scope to include more students from india , iran and china .
there will also be more grants for doctoral students and an increase in the amount of financial aid .
erasmus mundus will become " the trademark for eu cooperation with third countries in the field of higher education , " figel said . taking on the fulbright brand erasmus mundus is seen as the european answer to the us fulbright program , which started in 1946 .
the fulbright program promotes international study by giving out approximately 6,000 competitive grants to students and scholars each year and has an annual budget of around $ 180 million . " i think that fulbright studies are really a brand name in europe and the friendships , the cooperation and the way of experience that this has brought about , this is exactly what we would like to create , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to raise its profile as a destination for elite scholars ferrero-waldner said the eu is sensitive to concerns about brain drain that such programs cause in developing countries , where there 's always a fear top students will leave for an education abroad and never return .
erasmus mundus diplomas awarded during the program 's second phase would only become valid once a student returns home , ferrero-waldner said .
the erasmus mundus program evolved from the erasmus exchange program , which promotes student exchanges within europe .
approximately 155,000 european students participated in the erasmus program during the 2005-2006 school year . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 16.07.2007 ethics council urges relaxing german stem cell rules in a move welcomed by german researchers , the national ethics council on monday recommended easing legal restrictions intended to limit german scientists ' ability to conduct stem cell research . as germany 's top body when it comes to medical ethical issues , 14 of the national ethics council 's 24 members recommended a series of amendments to a 2002 stem cell law banning the production of embryonic cells that scientists have said hinders them from conducting research on par with international institutes . the council also said lawmakers should lift a ban placed on german scientists , both in and outside the country , on using cell lines created after jan .
1 , 2002 .
instead of using a cut-off date , the council recommended establishing an independent panel to evaluate scientists ' plans on a case-by-case basis . " if the current rules remain , german science will be hopelessly sidelined , " said horst dreier , speaking for the 14 members who favor changing the law , adding that the new law should explicitly state that new embryonic stem cell lines should come from widely available sources , not from manufacturers looking to profit from their production . expansion to permitted uses recommended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists could be arrested for conducting some forms of stem cell research the 2002 law also prevented germans from using the 20 stem cell lines they were allowed to access for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes , limiting their work to basic research .
stem cell advocates say research in the field could eventually lead to treatments for diabetes and parkinson 's disease . stem cell research remains a sensitive issue in germany due to country 's nazi past , and nine nec members voted against recommending amendments to the current regulations , saying in a statement that it would " hollow out the stem cell law . " no therapies on the horizon the minority group also said there was no reason to reevaluate the issue because therapies based on embryonic stem cell research are not likely to be developed in the foreseeable future .
the group also criticized the decision to allow researchers to make use of embryonic stem cells in their research but not allow them to create the cells themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists have said they are " miles away " from treatments based on stem cell research the german bishop 's conference said no changes should be made to the current law . " the demands of even important research interests can not under any circumstances lead to human embryos being created , " the catholic group said in a statement .
" we must not subordinate the protection of life to the freedom of research . " the german research society , however , welcomed the nec 's recommendations . " this will provide a positive impulse for stem cell research in germany , " society vice-president jörg hinrich hacker said . political decision in autumn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is divided on the issue of stem cell research politicians said they would raise the issue of embryonic stem cell research in the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , this autumn . " we will suggest moving the cut-off date to may 1 , 2007 , " rene röspel , the social democratic party 's research expert , told the berliner zeitung in an interview appearing tuesday .
" that is enough for the most versatile studies . " whether germany actually changes the law is certain to be subject to debate , as it was in 2002 . " the non-unanimous vote in the ethics council reflect the divides that this question also creates in the parliament , " ilse aigner , the research policy expert for germany 's two christian conservative parties , told tuesday 's handelsblatt newspaper . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

while ullrich has only been seriously implicated in a doping scandal , riis has confessed to taking performance-enhancing drugs . as if addressing his disgraced generation , gerdemann said that " we must show people that cycling can be a sport without doping .
but it is certainly not with the old school that we will evolve .

" i 'm a climber , and a pure climber , " rasmussen said .
" if i have to go all the way , and take the yellow jersey all the way to paris , i will have to climb faster than i have ever done in my life . " there 's still two more weeks of racing and i still have 110 kilometers of time-trialing to negotiate , " he added .

erasmus mundus hopes to become the eu 's answer to the prestigious us fulbright program . erasmus mundus , started in 2004 , is designed to help european students who want to spend a year at foreign universities outside the european union and also helps bring foreign students and scholars to the eu . from 2004 to 2008 , the initial program had a budget of 230 million euros -lrb- $ 318 million -rrb- , and more than 2,300 students have participated in the exchanges .
both the funding and number of grants available will jump in 2009 as the eu has approved a five-year budget of 950 million euros . widened scope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mundus goes beyond the erasmus program eu education commissioner jan figel said the second phase of the program , which will begin with the new funding boost in 2009 , will widen erasmus mundus ' scope to include more students from india , iran and china .
there will also be more grants for doctoral students and an increase in the amount of financial aid .
erasmus mundus will become " the trademark for eu cooperation with third countries in the field of higher education , " figel said . taking on the fulbright brand erasmus mundus is seen as the european answer to the us fulbright program , which started in 1946 .
the fulbright program promotes international study by giving out approximately 6,000 competitive grants to students and scholars each year and has an annual budget of around $ 180 million . " i think that fulbright studies are really a brand name in europe and the friendships , the cooperation and the way of experience that this has brought about , this is exactly what we would like to create , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to raise its profile as a destination for elite scholars ferrero-waldner said the eu is sensitive to concerns about brain drain that such programs cause in developing countries , where there 's always a fear top students will leave for an education abroad and never return .
erasmus mundus diplomas awarded during the program 's second phase would only become valid once a student returns home , ferrero-waldner said .
the erasmus mundus program evolved from the erasmus exchange program , which promotes student exchanges within europe .
approximately 155,000 european students participated in the erasmus program during the 2005-2006 school year . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is the very first time that the german government will be asked to take responsibility and to care for those of the second generation in israel and indeed , worldwide , " said gideon fisher , an attorney representing the plaintiffs , before filing the suit at tel aviv district court on monday .
some 4,000 people have joined the lawsuit so far .
but baruch mazor , who heads the fisher fund , a charity that looks after so-called second-generation holocaust survivors , said that 4 to 5 percent of the 400,000 children of holocaust survivors in israel require psychotherapy as they suffer from an irrational fear of starvation and incapacitating bouts of depression .

" this is the very first time that the german government will be asked to take responsibility and to care for those of the second generation in israel and indeed , worldwide , " said gideon fisher , an attorney representing the plaintiffs , before filing the suit at tel aviv district court on monday .
some 4,000 people have joined the lawsuit so far .
but baruch mazor , who heads the fisher fund , a charity that looks after so-called second-generation holocaust survivors , said that 4 to 5 percent of the 400,000 children of holocaust survivors in israel require psychotherapy as they suffer from an irrational fear of starvation and incapacitating bouts of depression .

she added that she was obsessed about stocking bread as her parents fought for bread crumbs at auschwitz death camp .
" it was forbidden in our house to show pain or say that you 're sad , " she added .
" my father taught us not to express our feelings and hide our hurt .
that was very , very hard . "
a first step towards recognition mazor said that many of the people involved in the suit can not work because of their ailments and are therefore not able to pay for any treatment .
he called the lawsuit a first step towards recognizing the fate of the children of holocaust survivors .
ap reported that it 's not clear whether a ruling by an israeli court would be binding for a foreign defendant - in this case , germany .

the fulbright program promotes international study by giving out approximately 6,000 competitive grants to students and scholars each year and has an annual budget of around $ 180 million . " i think that fulbright studies are really a brand name in europe and the friendships , the cooperation and the way of experience that this has brought about , this is exactly what we would like to create , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to raise its profile as a destination for elite scholars ferrero-waldner said the eu is sensitive to concerns about brain drain that such programs cause in developing countries , where there 's always a fear top students will leave for an education abroad and never return .
erasmus mundus diplomas awarded during the program 's second phase would only become valid once a student returns home , ferrero-waldner said .
the erasmus mundus program evolved from the erasmus exchange program , which promotes student exchanges within europe .
approximately 155,000 european students participated in the erasmus program during the 2005-2006 school year . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" if the current rules remain , german science will be hopelessly sidelined , " said horst dreier , speaking for the 14 members who favor changing the law , adding that the new law should explicitly state that new embryonic stem cell lines should come from widely available sources , not from manufacturers looking to profit from their production . expansion to permitted uses recommended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists could be arrested for conducting some forms of stem cell research the 2002 law also prevented germans from using the 20 stem cell lines they were allowed to access for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes , limiting their work to basic research .

german chancellor angela merkel meets french president nicolas sarkozy in toulouse monday to find a solution to the ongoing malaise at the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and its airbus subsidiary . when german chancellor angela merkel meets french president nicolas sarkozy in toulouse , the hometown of european plane maker airbus , on monday the discussions will include talks on improving the management of its politically-charged parent company , eads .
it is widely expected that merkel and sarkozy will agree to scrap the company 's dual management system which sees a french and german executive share the functions of the eads chief executive and chairman positions .
many , including the current heads of the company themselves , have blamed this complicated structure , as well as the difficulty of balancing other national interests at the heart of the company , for numerous problems afflicting airbus .
" eads has to become a normal company , " president sarkozy said at the paris air show last month , underlining complications caused by the group 's unusual management and shareholder structure .
" we agree with the view that a company like eads can only exist if it has efficient structures , " said merkel at the end of may after a meeting with the french prime minister francois fillon .
airbus losses blamed on management structure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co-ceo enders is expected to have the position to himself airbus posted a massive loss last year despite delivering a record number of planes , and the company is eager to push through a radical restructuring plan to correct some of the organizational and commercial problems blamed for the poor performance .
the spectacular fall into the red was caused mainly by delays and production problems with the airbus a380 superjumbo , which is set to enter service later this year , with some of the difficulties blamed on dysfunctional management .
although a consensus has formed for scrapping the dual management system , neither side is believed to have settled on who would take up which job to preserve the franco-german balance in the company .
the most likely scenario is that the current french co-chairman of the group , arnaud lagardere , would assume the eads chairmanship on his own , while german co-chief executive tom enders would become sole chief executive .
enders fellow chief executive louis gallois , who is also chief executive of airbus , would remain head of the plane maker and focus entirely on its restructuring plan .
shareholders also attending summit the main controlling shareholders in eads , the german automaker daimlerchrysler and the french media and defense company lagardere , will also both attend the meeting on monday .
the two companies dominate a pact of controlling shareholders that also includes the french state , the spanish state and a consortium of public and private german investors .
as well as discussing eads and airbus , the two leaders will also discuss the troubled european project to produce a rival to the us-owned global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- as well as " the means to improve the economic governance of europe , " said a spokesman for the french presidency .
sarkonomics likely to feature on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has put his financial cat among the eu pigeons this latter subject could be a source of tension after sarkozy 's frequent attacks on the european central bank , which he holds responsible for boosting the value of the euro .
the euro hit fresh record highs against the dollar and yen on thursday , which penalizes european exporters by making their products more expensive in international markets .
merkel said tuesday that she was against orchestrating a fall in the euro and defended the independence of the european central bank .
merkel is also against opening up the shareholders pact to other investors , which sarkozy favors in order " to finance the launch of new planes and counteract the strong euro , " said his spokesman .
a final source of tension on monday could be demonstrations by disgruntled airbus workers protesting against the company 's restructuring plan , which foresees 10,000 job cuts in the next four years .
the hard-left trade union cgt has called for workers to challenge the plans , dubbed " power8 " by the company . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel meets french president nicolas sarkozy in toulouse monday to find a solution to the ongoing malaise at the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and its airbus subsidiary . when german chancellor angela merkel meets french president nicolas sarkozy in toulouse , the hometown of european plane maker airbus , on monday the discussions will include talks on improving the management of its politically-charged parent company , eads .
it is widely expected that merkel and sarkozy will agree to scrap the company 's dual management system which sees a french and german executive share the functions of the eads chief executive and chairman positions .
many , including the current heads of the company themselves , have blamed this complicated structure , as well as the difficulty of balancing other national interests at the heart of the company , for numerous problems afflicting airbus .
" eads has to become a normal company , " president sarkozy said at the paris air show last month , underlining complications caused by the group 's unusual management and shareholder structure .
" we agree with the view that a company like eads can only exist if it has efficient structures , " said merkel at the end of may after a meeting with the french prime minister francois fillon .
airbus losses blamed on management structure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co-ceo enders is expected to have the position to himself airbus posted a massive loss last year despite delivering a record number of planes , and the company is eager to push through a radical restructuring plan to correct some of the organizational and commercial problems blamed for the poor performance .
the spectacular fall into the red was caused mainly by delays and production problems with the airbus a380 superjumbo , which is set to enter service later this year , with some of the difficulties blamed on dysfunctional management .
although a consensus has formed for scrapping the dual management system , neither side is believed to have settled on who would take up which job to preserve the franco-german balance in the company .
the most likely scenario is that the current french co-chairman of the group , arnaud lagardere , would assume the eads chairmanship on his own , while german co-chief executive tom enders would become sole chief executive .
enders fellow chief executive louis gallois , who is also chief executive of airbus , would remain head of the plane maker and focus entirely on its restructuring plan .
shareholders also attending summit the main controlling shareholders in eads , the german automaker daimlerchrysler and the french media and defense company lagardere , will also both attend the meeting on monday .

1 , 2002 .
instead of using a cut-off date , the council recommended establishing an independent panel to evaluate scientists ' plans on a case-by-case basis . " if the current rules remain , german science will be hopelessly sidelined , " said horst dreier , speaking for the 14 members who favor changing the law , adding that the new law should explicitly state that new embryonic stem cell lines should come from widely available sources , not from manufacturers looking to profit from their production . expansion to permitted uses recommended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists could be arrested for conducting some forms of stem cell research the 2002 law also prevented germans from using the 20 stem cell lines they were allowed to access for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes , limiting their work to basic research .
stem cell advocates say research in the field could eventually lead to treatments for diabetes and parkinson 's disease . stem cell research remains a sensitive issue in germany due to country 's nazi past , and nine nec members voted against recommending amendments to the current regulations , saying in a statement that it would " hollow out the stem cell law . " no therapies on the horizon the minority group also said there was no reason to reevaluate the issue because therapies based on embryonic stem cell research are not likely to be developed in the foreseeable future .
the group also criticized the decision to allow researchers to make use of embryonic stem cells in their research but not allow them to create the cells themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists have said they are " miles away " from treatments based on stem cell research the german bishop 's conference said no changes should be made to the current law . " the demands of even important research interests can not under any circumstances lead to human embryos being created , " the catholic group said in a statement .
" we must not subordinate the protection of life to the freedom of research . " the german research society , however , welcomed the nec 's recommendations . " this will provide a positive impulse for stem cell research in germany , " society vice-president jörg hinrich hacker said . political decision in autumn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is divided on the issue of stem cell research politicians said they would raise the issue of embryonic stem cell research in the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , this autumn .

" that is enough for the most versatile studies . " whether germany actually changes the law is certain to be subject to debate , as it was in 2002 .

erasmus mundus hopes to become the eu 's answer to the prestigious us fulbright program . erasmus mundus , started in 2004 , is designed to help european students who want to spend a year at foreign universities outside the european union and also helps bring foreign students and scholars to the eu . from 2004 to 2008 , the initial program had a budget of 230 million euros -lrb- $ 318 million -rrb- , and more than 2,300 students have participated in the exchanges .
both the funding and number of grants available will jump in 2009 as the eu has approved a five-year budget of 950 million euros . widened scope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mundus goes beyond the erasmus program eu education commissioner jan figel said the second phase of the program , which will begin with the new funding boost in 2009 , will widen erasmus mundus ' scope to include more students from india , iran and china .
there will also be more grants for doctoral students and an increase in the amount of financial aid .
erasmus mundus will become " the trademark for eu cooperation with third countries in the field of higher education , " figel said . taking on the fulbright brand erasmus mundus is seen as the european answer to the us fulbright program , which started in 1946 .
the fulbright program promotes international study by giving out approximately 6,000 competitive grants to students and scholars each year and has an annual budget of around $ 180 million . " i think that fulbright studies are really a brand name in europe and the friendships , the cooperation and the way of experience that this has brought about , this is exactly what we would like to create , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to raise its profile as a destination for elite scholars ferrero-waldner said the eu is sensitive to concerns about brain drain that such programs cause in developing countries , where there 's always a fear top students will leave for an education abroad and never return .
erasmus mundus diplomas awarded during the program 's second phase would only become valid once a student returns home , ferrero-waldner said .
the erasmus mundus program evolved from the erasmus exchange program , which promotes student exchanges within europe .
approximately 155,000 european students participated in the erasmus program during the 2005-2006 school year . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel meets french president nicolas sarkozy in toulouse monday to find a solution to the ongoing malaise at the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and its airbus subsidiary . when german chancellor angela merkel meets french president nicolas sarkozy in toulouse , the hometown of european plane maker airbus , on monday the discussions will include talks on improving the management of its politically-charged parent company , eads .
it is widely expected that merkel and sarkozy will agree to scrap the company 's dual management system which sees a french and german executive share the functions of the eads chief executive and chairman positions .
many , including the current heads of the company themselves , have blamed this complicated structure , as well as the difficulty of balancing other national interests at the heart of the company , for numerous problems afflicting airbus .
" eads has to become a normal company , " president sarkozy said at the paris air show last month , underlining complications caused by the group 's unusual management and shareholder structure .
" we agree with the view that a company like eads can only exist if it has efficient structures , " said merkel at the end of may after a meeting with the french prime minister francois fillon .
airbus losses blamed on management structure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co-ceo enders is expected to have the position to himself airbus posted a massive loss last year despite delivering a record number of planes , and the company is eager to push through a radical restructuring plan to correct some of the organizational and commercial problems blamed for the poor performance .
the spectacular fall into the red was caused mainly by delays and production problems with the airbus a380 superjumbo , which is set to enter service later this year , with some of the difficulties blamed on dysfunctional management .
although a consensus has formed for scrapping the dual management system , neither side is believed to have settled on who would take up which job to preserve the franco-german balance in the company .
the most likely scenario is that the current french co-chairman of the group , arnaud lagardere , would assume the eads chairmanship on his own , while german co-chief executive tom enders would become sole chief executive .
enders fellow chief executive louis gallois , who is also chief executive of airbus , would remain head of the plane maker and focus entirely on its restructuring plan .
shareholders also attending summit the main controlling shareholders in eads , the german automaker daimlerchrysler and the french media and defense company lagardere , will also both attend the meeting on monday .
the two companies dominate a pact of controlling shareholders that also includes the french state , the spanish state and a consortium of public and private german investors .
as well as discussing eads and airbus , the two leaders will also discuss the troubled european project to produce a rival to the us-owned global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- as well as " the means to improve the economic governance of europe , " said a spokesman for the french presidency .
sarkonomics likely to feature on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has put his financial cat among the eu pigeons this latter subject could be a source of tension after sarkozy 's frequent attacks on the european central bank , which he holds responsible for boosting the value of the euro .
the euro hit fresh record highs against the dollar and yen on thursday , which penalizes european exporters by making their products more expensive in international markets .
merkel said tuesday that she was against orchestrating a fall in the euro and defended the independence of the european central bank .
merkel is also against opening up the shareholders pact to other investors , which sarkozy favors in order " to finance the launch of new planes and counteract the strong euro , " said his spokesman .
a final source of tension on monday could be demonstrations by disgruntled airbus workers protesting against the company 's restructuring plan , which foresees 10,000 job cuts in the next four years .
the hard-left trade union cgt has called for workers to challenge the plans , dubbed " power8 " by the company . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that included speedy approval in the british parliament for agreements on eu guidelines for a new treaty hammered out recently at a brussels summit provided they were implemented in a new treaty text under portugal 's eu presidency .
experts say brown , who has met merkel before at a summit in berlin when he was chancellor of the exchequer , may find merkel to be a leader he can work with .
" she is " a conciliator and somebody who manages power in a non-triumphalist way , " said hugo brady , a researcher at the centre for european reform in london .
" the problem will be if brown , under pressure at home , demands more , " brady said .
ahead of brown 's visit , the german government had praised his decision to make berlin his first stop during his european trip .
merkel had said she hoped to continue the close relations with britain she had enjoyed with brown 's predecessor , tony blair , adding it was particularly important for the well-being of europe and transatlantic ties .
meeting clouded by russian expulsions the meeting , which touched on security issues as well as climate and aid to africa , was overshadowed by an earlier decision by britain to expel four russian diplomats from london over the poisoning of former agent alexander litvinenko .
" i have no apologies for the action we have taken , " brown said in berlin . " i hope it 's understood in other parts of the world that we are not prepared to allow a situation of lawlessness to develop in london as a result of a failure to act . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between london and moscow are at a low british foreign secretary david miliband announced the decision to parliament earlier monday due to russia 's refusal to extradite the chief suspect in the case , former kgb agent andrei lugovoi .
lugovoi is accused of administering a highly radioactive poison to litvinenko when they met for tea in a central london hotel last november .
litvinenko , an outspoken kremlin critic , died three weeks later in hospital .
" we want the best possible relationships with russia .
we want to work together with russia , constructively on all the major international issues that we face , on iraq , on the middle east , " brown added .
a strong signal to europe much has been made both in britain and in germany of brown 's decision to travel to europe rather than flying to washington on his first trip abroad since taking office .
analysts have speculated whether it marks a new shift in britain 's foreign policy and gives a clear signal to european leaders that brown is serious about his country 's ties with the eu .
germany 's süddeutsche zeitung said it was a positive sign that brown had arranged to visit berlin without even scheduling a date for his washington trip .
the prime minister appeared to prefer " a certain distance to the us more out of inner conviction than populist need , " the paper said .
but miliband on sunday contradicted speculation of a cooling of relations with washington after the change of government in britain , saying the us remained the country 's " single most important bilateral partner . " a new european axis ? brown met the german chancellor just hours after a summit between merkel and nicolas sarkozy in which the new french president spoke of a " great day for the franco-german axis " after agreeing on a shake-up at ailing european plane-maker airbus .
brown is to meet with sarkozy on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's big three - merkel , sarkozy and brown experts believe it marks the establishment of a new axis between the leaders of europe 's three most powerful countries .
" it really has become obvious that blair had a terrible set of partners -lsb- in chirac and schröder -rsb- , " said brady .
" brown is much luckier ; he inherits a dynamic french leader and a chancellor who shares a lot of his basic instincts . "
while traditionally , france and germany have been considered closer to each other than to britain , merkel is capable as being as close to brown as any french leader , argued brady .
" if the pair forms a strong working relationship , they may even serve as a useful foil for sarkozy , " he said .
roderick parkes , a research associate at the german institute for international and security affairs parkes was less optimistic , believing that positive associations with merkel and sarkozy are expedient for brown at a time when the leadership of britain 's traditional ally - the united states - is led by a president whose own political days are numbered .
the prime minister " encourages talk of a ' european trio ' of sarkozy , merkel and brown , associating himself with two politicians who are perceived as forward looking and are seen to have brought a new momentum to a stagnant european political landscape , " parkes said . emma wynne -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia followed suit on saturday by announcing that it would suspend its obligations under the conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty .
if the trend continues , the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty could be next .
and then europe , freshly liberated from the cold-war threat of instant extinction , will be bristling with missiles . " in spain , conservative daily abc commented that russia 's decision to suspend the cfe treaty was bad news , but not necessarily because it meant that this could revive old military threats .
" the move shows that moscow 's political leaders , starting with putin himself , still think in terms of the long-gone categories of the cold war . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is putin telling europeans to look across the atlantic for a solution ?
vienna 's liberal paper der standard meanwhile said that the russians were acting out of principle to avoid any meddling in their sphere of influence and a strategic disadvantage .
" the planned us missile defense system is part of that .
the bush administration has talked poland and the czech republic into it and duped the other nato states that wanted to slow things down and negotiate with russia rather than have washington make all the decisions alone .
putin has given the west 150 days to fulfill his demands regarding a reform of the cfe treaty .
europe can thank bush for that . " poland 's conservative rzeczpospolita wrote that putin acted as he had promised .
" it 's important to keep a cool head now , " the daily commented , adding that the announcement came as polish president lech kaczynski was on his way to the us to discuss the missile defense system with george w. bush .
" it also happened at a point , when russia is conducting military exercises on a large scale ... putin 's saber-rattling also affects europe .
in all conversations with eu politicians , one has to say : see for yourself what the kremlin is doing and draw your own conclusions . " the handelsblatt newspaper from düsseldorf in germany on the other hand commented that putin had a solid argument on his side .
" a majority of nato states did n't ratify the 1999 version of this arms control agreement .
but the russian president still has to tolerate questions regarding the motivation behind his act of defiance .
does he want to build new tanks , new fighter planes ?
if so , what does he want to do with them ?
is he dreaming of a renaissance of the gloried soviet empire ?
putin should know where his real interests lie : in a pacific europe that offers a giant market for russia 's rich energy treasures . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 16.07.2007 ethics council urges relaxing german stem cell rules in a move welcomed by german researchers , the national ethics council on monday recommended easing legal restrictions intended to limit german scientists ' ability to conduct stem cell research . as germany 's top body when it comes to medical ethical issues , 14 of the national ethics council 's 24 members recommended a series of amendments to a 2002 stem cell law banning the production of embryonic cells that scientists have said hinders them from conducting research on par with international institutes . the council also said lawmakers should lift a ban placed on german scientists , both in and outside the country , on using cell lines created after jan .
1 , 2002 .
instead of using a cut-off date , the council recommended establishing an independent panel to evaluate scientists ' plans on a case-by-case basis . " if the current rules remain , german science will be hopelessly sidelined , " said horst dreier , speaking for the 14 members who favor changing the law , adding that the new law should explicitly state that new embryonic stem cell lines should come from widely available sources , not from manufacturers looking to profit from their production . expansion to permitted uses recommended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists could be arrested for conducting some forms of stem cell research the 2002 law also prevented germans from using the 20 stem cell lines they were allowed to access for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes , limiting their work to basic research .
stem cell advocates say research in the field could eventually lead to treatments for diabetes and parkinson 's disease . stem cell research remains a sensitive issue in germany due to country 's nazi past , and nine nec members voted against recommending amendments to the current regulations , saying in a statement that it would " hollow out the stem cell law . " no therapies on the horizon the minority group also said there was no reason to reevaluate the issue because therapies based on embryonic stem cell research are not likely to be developed in the foreseeable future .
the group also criticized the decision to allow researchers to make use of embryonic stem cells in their research but not allow them to create the cells themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists have said they are " miles away " from treatments based on stem cell research the german bishop 's conference said no changes should be made to the current law . " the demands of even important research interests can not under any circumstances lead to human embryos being created , " the catholic group said in a statement .

" this is the very first time that the german government will be asked to take responsibility and to care for those of the second generation in israel and indeed , worldwide , " said gideon fisher , an attorney representing the plaintiffs , before filing the suit at tel aviv district court on monday .
some 4,000 people have joined the lawsuit so far .
but baruch mazor , who heads the fisher fund , a charity that looks after so-called second-generation holocaust survivors , said that 4 to 5 percent of the 400,000 children of holocaust survivors in israel require psychotherapy as they suffer from an irrational fear of starvation and incapacitating bouts of depression .
stocking bread , hiding pain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : death camp inmates received almost no food " i have an obsession about food , especially bread , " a 58-year-old woman who was not named said on israeli radio on sunday , according to ap .
she added that she was obsessed about stocking bread as her parents fought for bread crumbs at auschwitz death camp .
" it was forbidden in our house to show pain or say that you 're sad , " she added .
" my father taught us not to express our feelings and hide our hurt .
that was very , very hard . "
a first step towards recognition mazor said that many of the people involved in the suit can not work because of their ailments and are therefore not able to pay for any treatment .
he called the lawsuit a first step towards recognizing the fate of the children of holocaust survivors .
ap reported that it 's not clear whether a ruling by an israeli court would be binding for a foreign defendant - in this case , germany .
mazor reportedly wants to use the israeli verdict for a later lawsuit filed with a german or international court .
the german embassy in israel declined to comment on the case . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" many things are changing for the good -lrb- in cycling -rrb- , " he said .
" we are on the right path . " that was music to prudhomme 's ears . " it 's the fresh air we were hoping for , with a team that has taken exemplary measures , " he said . the german press agreed as the mass-market bild am sonntag went to lengths to congratulate the 24-year-old . " he 's blond , young and he 's the new star of the tour de france , " the paper wrote on sunday . purging the ' old school ' bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a wide-spread doping scandal has hung over this year 's tour de france gerdemann 's t-mobile team - formerly called telekom - has been damaged more than most teams by doping news and was therefore forced to clean up its act . cycling heavyweights jan ullrich and bjarne riis both won the tour while wearing the telekom jersey .
while ullrich has only been seriously implicated in a doping scandal , riis has confessed to taking performance-enhancing drugs . as if addressing his disgraced generation , gerdemann said that " we must show people that cycling can be a sport without doping .
but it is certainly not with the old school that we will evolve . " spectator in critical condition but a series of mishaps sunday could make it difficult for t-mobile to evolve as a team at this year 's tour . in addition to gerdemann losing the yellow jersey to denmark 's michael rasmussen , patrik sinkewitz crashed into an elderly person , who was not identified , when sinkewitz was riding his bike to his hotel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sinkewitz was to return to germany for treatment on monday the spectator was hospitalized in a coma , and sinkewitz , who fractured his cheekbone and damaged his shoulders and knees , was also taken to hospital and announced he will drop out of the tour . the team 's leader , aussie michael rogers , also injured his shoulder in a crash during a high-speed descent and abandoned the race , as did british teammate mark cavendish , who crashed twice earlier in the race around france . monday off to rest and plan racers will use a day off on monday to rest up for their third alps stage and start making plans for the rest of the tour as little has been heard from the 94th tour de france favorites , and even rasmussen has admitted he does n't expect to ride up the champs elyseees in the yellow jersey . " i 'm a climber , and a pure climber , " rasmussen said .
" if i have to go all the way , and take the yellow jersey all the way to paris , i will have to climb faster than i have ever done in my life . " there 's still two more weeks of racing and i still have 110 kilometers of time-trialing to negotiate , " he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de press review -pipe- 16.07.2007 european press review : putin 's saber-rattling großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " mother russia " is unlikely to prepare for an attack europe 's editorials monday commented on russian president putin 's decision to suspend a key arms control treaty , but some were hopeful that moscow 's leader would rethink the move before it takes effect later this year . britain 's the guardian wrote that " the current fad of tearing up vital arms-control agreements was started by america when it abrogated the anti-ballistic missile treaty in order to build its missile shield .
russia followed suit on saturday by announcing that it would suspend its obligations under the conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty .
if the trend continues , the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty could be next .
and then europe , freshly liberated from the cold-war threat of instant extinction , will be bristling with missiles . " in spain , conservative daily abc commented that russia 's decision to suspend the cfe treaty was bad news , but not necessarily because it meant that this could revive old military threats .
" the move shows that moscow 's political leaders , starting with putin himself , still think in terms of the long-gone categories of the cold war . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is putin telling europeans to look across the atlantic for a solution ?
vienna 's liberal paper der standard meanwhile said that the russians were acting out of principle to avoid any meddling in their sphere of influence and a strategic disadvantage .
" the planned us missile defense system is part of that .
the bush administration has talked poland and the czech republic into it and duped the other nato states that wanted to slow things down and negotiate with russia rather than have washington make all the decisions alone .
putin has given the west 150 days to fulfill his demands regarding a reform of the cfe treaty .
europe can thank bush for that . " poland 's conservative rzeczpospolita wrote that putin acted as he had promised .
" it 's important to keep a cool head now , " the daily commented , adding that the announcement came as polish president lech kaczynski was on his way to the us to discuss the missile defense system with george w. bush .
" it also happened at a point , when russia is conducting military exercises on a large scale ... putin 's saber-rattling also affects europe .
in all conversations with eu politicians , one has to say : see for yourself what the kremlin is doing and draw your own conclusions . " the handelsblatt newspaper from düsseldorf in germany on the other hand commented that putin had a solid argument on his side .
" a majority of nato states did n't ratify the 1999 version of this arms control agreement .
but the russian president still has to tolerate questions regarding the motivation behind his act of defiance .
does he want to build new tanks , new fighter planes ?
if so , what does he want to do with them ?
is he dreaming of a renaissance of the gloried soviet empire ?
putin should know where his real interests lie : in a pacific europe that offers a giant market for russia 's rich energy treasures . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" when this thing is running , we do n't need any gas or oil in the building , " said chief technician marco nauerz in the furnace room of the foundation 's main site at meckenbeuren near lake constance .
the 11-meter-high -lrb- 36-feet-high -rrb- plant can consume 8 million diapers annually .

liebenau has already signed up 40 rest homes , some of which it owns and others run by other operators , as suppliers , and it expects to double the number by the end of the year .

" when this thing is running , we do n't need any gas or oil in the building , " said chief technician marco nauerz in the furnace room of the foundation 's main site at meckenbeuren near lake constance .
the 11-meter-high -lrb- 36-feet-high -rrb- plant can consume 8 million diapers annually .
by nauerz ' calculation , that means it can continuously eliminate the waste from 12,000 incontinent patients .
there is no risk the supply will dry up .
liebenau has already signed up 40 rest homes , some of which it owns and others run by other operators , as suppliers , and it expects to double the number by the end of the year .
the diapers are packed in plastic sacks and arrive in airtight garbage trucks .
" you ca n't smell anything here , can you ? " said nauerz , showing the " fuel " shed , where extractor fans suck out any odors .

the foundation uses the energy to heat water in bathrooms and in its laundry to clean towels and sheets .
the total cost of the plant , the " fuel " depot and new pipes came to 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- , nauerz estimates .
best of all , liebenau expects to make a profit from diapers , as it charges rest-home operators to get rid of the waste .
the fees are lower than those at land-fills or commercial incinerators .
to date , the foundation has had to pay 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 481,880 -rrb- annually in land-fill fees for its own 2.1 million used diapers per year .

" this is the very first time that the german government will be asked to take responsibility and to care for those of the second generation in israel and indeed , worldwide , " said gideon fisher , an attorney representing the plaintiffs , before filing the suit at tel aviv district court on monday .
some 4,000 people have joined the lawsuit so far .
but baruch mazor , who heads the fisher fund , a charity that looks after so-called second-generation holocaust survivors , said that 4 to 5 percent of the 400,000 children of holocaust survivors in israel require psychotherapy as they suffer from an irrational fear of starvation and incapacitating bouts of depression .

" it was forbidden in our house to show pain or say that you 're sad , " she added .
" my father taught us not to express our feelings and hide our hurt .
that was very , very hard . "
a first step towards recognition mazor said that many of the people involved in the suit can not work because of their ailments and are therefore not able to pay for any treatment .
he called the lawsuit a first step towards recognizing the fate of the children of holocaust survivors .
ap reported that it 's not clear whether a ruling by an israeli court would be binding for a foreign defendant - in this case , germany .

" this is the very first time that the german government will be asked to take responsibility and to care for those of the second generation in israel and indeed , worldwide , " said gideon fisher , an attorney representing the plaintiffs , before filing the suit at tel aviv district court on monday .
some 4,000 people have joined the lawsuit so far .
but baruch mazor , who heads the fisher fund , a charity that looks after so-called second-generation holocaust survivors , said that 4 to 5 percent of the 400,000 children of holocaust survivors in israel require psychotherapy as they suffer from an irrational fear of starvation and incapacitating bouts of depression .
stocking bread , hiding pain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : death camp inmates received almost no food " i have an obsession about food , especially bread , " a 58-year-old woman who was not named said on israeli radio on sunday , according to ap .
she added that she was obsessed about stocking bread as her parents fought for bread crumbs at auschwitz death camp .
" it was forbidden in our house to show pain or say that you 're sad , " she added .
" my father taught us not to express our feelings and hide our hurt .
that was very , very hard . "
a first step towards recognition mazor said that many of the people involved in the suit can not work because of their ailments and are therefore not able to pay for any treatment .
he called the lawsuit a first step towards recognizing the fate of the children of holocaust survivors .
ap reported that it 's not clear whether a ruling by an israeli court would be binding for a foreign defendant - in this case , germany .
mazor reportedly wants to use the israeli verdict for a later lawsuit filed with a german or international court .

" this is the very first time that the german government will be asked to take responsibility and to care for those of the second generation in israel and indeed , worldwide , " said gideon fisher , an attorney representing the plaintiffs , before filing the suit at tel aviv district court on monday .
some 4,000 people have joined the lawsuit so far .
but baruch mazor , who heads the fisher fund , a charity that looks after so-called second-generation holocaust survivors , said that 4 to 5 percent of the 400,000 children of holocaust survivors in israel require psychotherapy as they suffer from an irrational fear of starvation and incapacitating bouts of depression .
stocking bread , hiding pain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : death camp inmates received almost no food " i have an obsession about food , especially bread , " a 58-year-old woman who was not named said on israeli radio on sunday , according to ap .
she added that she was obsessed about stocking bread as her parents fought for bread crumbs at auschwitz death camp .
" it was forbidden in our house to show pain or say that you 're sad , " she added .
" my father taught us not to express our feelings and hide our hurt .
that was very , very hard . "
a first step towards recognition mazor said that many of the people involved in the suit can not work because of their ailments and are therefore not able to pay for any treatment .
he called the lawsuit a first step towards recognizing the fate of the children of holocaust survivors .
ap reported that it 's not clear whether a ruling by an israeli court would be binding for a foreign defendant - in this case , germany .
mazor reportedly wants to use the israeli verdict for a later lawsuit filed with a german or international court .

the organizations said the transaction would make a mockery of the eu arms and trade restrictions that were imposed on burma , also known as myanmar , for its human rights abuses .
" the eu embargo explicitly states that no military equipment should be supplied , either directly or indirectly , for use in myanmar , " said roy isbister from saferworld , one of the report 's compilers .
" what 's the point in having an arms embargo if it is not going to be implemented or enforced ? "

erasmus mundus hopes to become the eu 's answer to the prestigious us fulbright program . erasmus mundus , started in 2004 , is designed to help european students who want to spend a year at foreign universities outside the european union and also helps bring foreign students and scholars to the eu . from 2004 to 2008 , the initial program had a budget of 230 million euros -lrb- $ 318 million -rrb- , and more than 2,300 students have participated in the exchanges .
both the funding and number of grants available will jump in 2009 as the eu has approved a five-year budget of 950 million euros . widened scope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mundus goes beyond the erasmus program eu education commissioner jan figel said the second phase of the program , which will begin with the new funding boost in 2009 , will widen erasmus mundus ' scope to include more students from india , iran and china .
there will also be more grants for doctoral students and an increase in the amount of financial aid .
erasmus mundus will become " the trademark for eu cooperation with third countries in the field of higher education , " figel said . taking on the fulbright brand erasmus mundus is seen as the european answer to the us fulbright program , which started in 1946 .
the fulbright program promotes international study by giving out approximately 6,000 competitive grants to students and scholars each year and has an annual budget of around $ 180 million . " i think that fulbright studies are really a brand name in europe and the friendships , the cooperation and the way of experience that this has brought about , this is exactly what we would like to create , " said eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe wants to raise its profile as a destination for elite scholars ferrero-waldner said the eu is sensitive to concerns about brain drain that such programs cause in developing countries , where there 's always a fear top students will leave for an education abroad and never return .
erasmus mundus diplomas awarded during the program 's second phase would only become valid once a student returns home , ferrero-waldner said .
the erasmus mundus program evolved from the erasmus exchange program , which promotes student exchanges within europe .
approximately 155,000 european students participated in the erasmus program during the 2005-2006 school year . dw staff -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" when this thing is running , we do n't need any gas or oil in the building , " said chief technician marco nauerz in the furnace room of the foundation 's main site at meckenbeuren near lake constance .
the 11-meter-high -lrb- 36-feet-high -rrb- plant can consume 8 million diapers annually .
by nauerz ' calculation , that means it can continuously eliminate the waste from 12,000 incontinent patients .
there is no risk the supply will dry up .
liebenau has already signed up 40 rest homes , some of which it owns and others run by other operators , as suppliers , and it expects to double the number by the end of the year .
the diapers are packed in plastic sacks and arrive in airtight garbage trucks .
" you ca n't smell anything here , can you ? " said nauerz , showing the " fuel " shed , where extractor fans suck out any odors .
nauerz , 55 , and no stranger to diapers as a father of three , has gained new respect for the soiled nappy through his work .

at 910 degrees celsius , they burn in seconds .
the foundation uses the energy to heat water in bathrooms and in its laundry to clean towels and sheets .
the total cost of the plant , the " fuel " depot and new pipes came to 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- , nauerz estimates .
best of all , liebenau expects to make a profit from diapers , as it charges rest-home operators to get rid of the waste .
the fees are lower than those at land-fills or commercial incinerators .
to date , the foundation has had to pay 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 481,880 -rrb- annually in land-fill fees for its own 2.1 million used diapers per year .
the furnace was jointly developed by liebenau staff and an engineering company in bregenz , austria .

the plant had to have flue-gas treatment like regular commercial incinerators , although the engineers say diapers are mainly organic : just cellulose , biodegradable plastic film and the contents .
as a non-profit charity , liebenau is also concerned about being kind to the environment , so it insists that all the diapers be " local produce " and rejects long-distance transport of the new fuel .

german chancellor angela merkel meets french president nicolas sarkozy in toulouse monday to find a solution to the ongoing malaise at the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and its airbus subsidiary . when german chancellor angela merkel meets french president nicolas sarkozy in toulouse , the hometown of european plane maker airbus , on monday the discussions will include talks on improving the management of its politically-charged parent company , eads .
it is widely expected that merkel and sarkozy will agree to scrap the company 's dual management system which sees a french and german executive share the functions of the eads chief executive and chairman positions .
many , including the current heads of the company themselves , have blamed this complicated structure , as well as the difficulty of balancing other national interests at the heart of the company , for numerous problems afflicting airbus .
" eads has to become a normal company , " president sarkozy said at the paris air show last month , underlining complications caused by the group 's unusual management and shareholder structure .
" we agree with the view that a company like eads can only exist if it has efficient structures , " said merkel at the end of may after a meeting with the french prime minister francois fillon .
airbus losses blamed on management structure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co-ceo enders is expected to have the position to himself airbus posted a massive loss last year despite delivering a record number of planes , and the company is eager to push through a radical restructuring plan to correct some of the organizational and commercial problems blamed for the poor performance .
the spectacular fall into the red was caused mainly by delays and production problems with the airbus a380 superjumbo , which is set to enter service later this year , with some of the difficulties blamed on dysfunctional management .
although a consensus has formed for scrapping the dual management system , neither side is believed to have settled on who would take up which job to preserve the franco-german balance in the company .
the most likely scenario is that the current french co-chairman of the group , arnaud lagardere , would assume the eads chairmanship on his own , while german co-chief executive tom enders would become sole chief executive .
enders fellow chief executive louis gallois , who is also chief executive of airbus , would remain head of the plane maker and focus entirely on its restructuring plan .
shareholders also attending summit the main controlling shareholders in eads , the german automaker daimlerchrysler and the french media and defense company lagardere , will also both attend the meeting on monday .
the two companies dominate a pact of controlling shareholders that also includes the french state , the spanish state and a consortium of public and private german investors .
as well as discussing eads and airbus , the two leaders will also discuss the troubled european project to produce a rival to the us-owned global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- as well as " the means to improve the economic governance of europe , " said a spokesman for the french presidency .

the euro hit fresh record highs against the dollar and yen on thursday , which penalizes european exporters by making their products more expensive in international markets .
merkel said tuesday that she was against orchestrating a fall in the euro and defended the independence of the european central bank .
merkel is also against opening up the shareholders pact to other investors , which sarkozy favors in order " to finance the launch of new planes and counteract the strong euro , " said his spokesman .

the organizations said the transaction would make a mockery of the eu arms and trade restrictions that were imposed on burma , also known as myanmar , for its human rights abuses .
" the eu embargo explicitly states that no military equipment should be supplied , either directly or indirectly , for use in myanmar , " said roy isbister from saferworld , one of the report 's compilers .
" what 's the point in having an arms embargo if it is not going to be implemented or enforced ? "
the united nations has described human rights violations in burma , which is led by a military junta , as " widespread and systematic , " including summary executions , torture and the recruitment of child soldiers .
stricter regulation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : pro-democracy leader aung san suu kyi , here in 2003 , has been in detention for over four years the groups said their information came from credible sources and highlighted the urgent need for stricter arms controls .
the advanced light helicopter was developed in association with eurocopter deutschland and is built by hindustan aeronautics limited .
according to the report , it would not be operational without vital components from eu member states , including rocket launchers from belgium , rockets , guns and engines from france , brake systems from italy ; fuel tanks and gearboxes from britain and protective equipment from sweden .
german companies , meanwhile , are described as having been " crucial " to the development of the aircraft 's design , while also manufacturing controls for the alh 's engine .
ban violation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the karen minority has been brutally suppressed by the burmese military if the sale goes ahead , these six countries would be undermining an eu arms embargo on burma in place since 1988 .
amnesty international 's arms control researcher helen hughes says that the alh case shows the need for tightening international arms controls .
" greater attention has to be given to the end-use agreements and the re-export of components from eu member states , " she said .
" otherwise , these states could find themselves indirectly propping up a brutal regime which they themselves have condemned and whose violations have amounted to crimes against humanity . "
while india itself is not subject to any such arms ban , the report calls on the eu to begin immediate talks with delhi in order to try to prevent any sales of the alh to burma . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

instead of using a cut-off date , the council recommended establishing an independent panel to evaluate scientists ' plans on a case-by-case basis . " if the current rules remain , german science will be hopelessly sidelined , " said horst dreier , speaking for the 14 members who favor changing the law , adding that the new law should explicitly state that new embryonic stem cell lines should come from widely available sources , not from manufacturers looking to profit from their production . expansion to permitted uses recommended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists could be arrested for conducting some forms of stem cell research the 2002 law also prevented germans from using the 20 stem cell lines they were allowed to access for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes , limiting their work to basic research .

1 , 2002 .
instead of using a cut-off date , the council recommended establishing an independent panel to evaluate scientists ' plans on a case-by-case basis . " if the current rules remain , german science will be hopelessly sidelined , " said horst dreier , speaking for the 14 members who favor changing the law , adding that the new law should explicitly state that new embryonic stem cell lines should come from widely available sources , not from manufacturers looking to profit from their production . expansion to permitted uses recommended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists could be arrested for conducting some forms of stem cell research the 2002 law also prevented germans from using the 20 stem cell lines they were allowed to access for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes , limiting their work to basic research .
stem cell advocates say research in the field could eventually lead to treatments for diabetes and parkinson 's disease . stem cell research remains a sensitive issue in germany due to country 's nazi past , and nine nec members voted against recommending amendments to the current regulations , saying in a statement that it would " hollow out the stem cell law . " no therapies on the horizon the minority group also said there was no reason to reevaluate the issue because therapies based on embryonic stem cell research are not likely to be developed in the foreseeable future .
the group also criticized the decision to allow researchers to make use of embryonic stem cells in their research but not allow them to create the cells themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists have said they are " miles away " from treatments based on stem cell research the german bishop 's conference said no changes should be made to the current law . " the demands of even important research interests can not under any circumstances lead to human embryos being created , " the catholic group said in a statement .
" we must not subordinate the protection of life to the freedom of research . " the german research society , however , welcomed the nec 's recommendations . " this will provide a positive impulse for stem cell research in germany , " society vice-president jörg hinrich hacker said . political decision in autumn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is divided on the issue of stem cell research politicians said they would raise the issue of embryonic stem cell research in the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , this autumn . " we will suggest moving the cut-off date to may 1 , 2007 , " rene röspel , the social democratic party 's research expert , told the berliner zeitung in an interview appearing tuesday .
" that is enough for the most versatile studies . " whether germany actually changes the law is certain to be subject to debate , as it was in 2002 . " the non-unanimous vote in the ethics council reflect the divides that this question also creates in the parliament , " ilse aigner , the research policy expert for germany 's two christian conservative parties , told tuesday 's handelsblatt newspaper . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that included speedy approval in the british parliament for agreements on eu guidelines for a new treaty hammered out recently at a brussels summit provided they were implemented in a new treaty text under portugal 's eu presidency .
experts say brown , who has met merkel before at a summit in berlin when he was chancellor of the exchequer , may find merkel to be a leader he can work with .
" she is " a conciliator and somebody who manages power in a non-triumphalist way , " said hugo brady , a researcher at the centre for european reform in london .
" the problem will be if brown , under pressure at home , demands more , " brady said .
ahead of brown 's visit , the german government had praised his decision to make berlin his first stop during his european trip .
merkel had said she hoped to continue the close relations with britain she had enjoyed with brown 's predecessor , tony blair , adding it was particularly important for the well-being of europe and transatlantic ties .
meeting clouded by russian expulsions the meeting , which touched on security issues as well as climate and aid to africa , was overshadowed by an earlier decision by britain to expel four russian diplomats from london over the poisoning of former agent alexander litvinenko .
" i have no apologies for the action we have taken , " brown said in berlin . " i hope it 's understood in other parts of the world that we are not prepared to allow a situation of lawlessness to develop in london as a result of a failure to act . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between london and moscow are at a low british foreign secretary david miliband announced the decision to parliament earlier monday due to russia 's refusal to extradite the chief suspect in the case , former kgb agent andrei lugovoi .
lugovoi is accused of administering a highly radioactive poison to litvinenko when they met for tea in a central london hotel last november .
litvinenko , an outspoken kremlin critic , died three weeks later in hospital .
" we want the best possible relationships with russia .
we want to work together with russia , constructively on all the major international issues that we face , on iraq , on the middle east , " brown added .
a strong signal to europe much has been made both in britain and in germany of brown 's decision to travel to europe rather than flying to washington on his first trip abroad since taking office .
analysts have speculated whether it marks a new shift in britain 's foreign policy and gives a clear signal to european leaders that brown is serious about his country 's ties with the eu .
germany 's süddeutsche zeitung said it was a positive sign that brown had arranged to visit berlin without even scheduling a date for his washington trip .
the prime minister appeared to prefer " a certain distance to the us more out of inner conviction than populist need , " the paper said .
but miliband on sunday contradicted speculation of a cooling of relations with washington after the change of government in britain , saying the us remained the country 's " single most important bilateral partner . " a new european axis ? brown met the german chancellor just hours after a summit between merkel and nicolas sarkozy in which the new french president spoke of a " great day for the franco-german axis " after agreeing on a shake-up at ailing european plane-maker airbus .
brown is to meet with sarkozy on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's big three - merkel , sarkozy and brown experts believe it marks the establishment of a new axis between the leaders of europe 's three most powerful countries .
" it really has become obvious that blair had a terrible set of partners -lsb- in chirac and schröder -rsb- , " said brady .
" brown is much luckier ; he inherits a dynamic french leader and a chancellor who shares a lot of his basic instincts . "
while traditionally , france and germany have been considered closer to each other than to britain , merkel is capable as being as close to brown as any french leader , argued brady .
" if the pair forms a strong working relationship , they may even serve as a useful foil for sarkozy , " he said .
roderick parkes , a research associate at the german institute for international and security affairs parkes was less optimistic , believing that positive associations with merkel and sarkozy are expedient for brown at a time when the leadership of britain 's traditional ally - the united states - is led by a president whose own political days are numbered .

the organizations said the transaction would make a mockery of the eu arms and trade restrictions that were imposed on burma , also known as myanmar , for its human rights abuses .
" the eu embargo explicitly states that no military equipment should be supplied , either directly or indirectly , for use in myanmar , " said roy isbister from saferworld , one of the report 's compilers .
" what 's the point in having an arms embargo if it is not going to be implemented or enforced ? "

the advanced light helicopter was developed in association with eurocopter deutschland and is built by hindustan aeronautics limited .
according to the report , it would not be operational without vital components from eu member states , including rocket launchers from belgium , rockets , guns and engines from france , brake systems from italy ; fuel tanks and gearboxes from britain and protective equipment from sweden .

" greater attention has to be given to the end-use agreements and the re-export of components from eu member states , " she said .
" otherwise , these states could find themselves indirectly propping up a brutal regime which they themselves have condemned and whose violations have amounted to crimes against humanity . "

the european aeronautic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and airbus had an awkward managament structure with two co-chairmen and two co-chief executives from france and germany . the twin-headed management structure had been widely blamed for slow decision-making and inefficiency .
under the deal , france 's louis gallois will be the sole head of eads , while germany 's tom enders will become chief executive of airbus , which is struggling with losses amid lengthy production delays for its superjumbo a380 .
positive step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel are meeting in toulouse to talk about eads and airbus " i am convinced we have come up with a good solution for the future of eads and of airbus , " said merkel during a tour of the airbus factory in toulouse in southwest france .
" this is a great day for this company , a great decision has been taken .
it is a great day for the franco-german axis , " said sarkozy .
" eads , airbus , these are companies that have to be managed like companies and not like international organizations , " he added . under the new structure , rüdiger grube of daimler is also set to become sole chairman .
daimlerchrysler is the biggest private german shareholder of eads .

but sarkozy 's comments that he could take over as chairman of the board under a rotating system every five years indicates that the sensitive question of the franco-german balance could remain a problem .
eads is controlled by a group of french and german shareholders which are either public or politically-linked private investors .
squabbles over control and influence have blighted its seven-year history .
airbus posted a massive loss last year despite delivering a record number of planes , and the company is being left far behind its main rival us plane maker boeing .
the success of boeing 's recently unveiled dreamliner has put the european venture under further pressure .
radical restructuring plans that foresee the loss of 10,000 jobs have also been the source of considerable franco-german tension with each side trying to keep job cuts in the respective country to a minimum . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel meets french president nicolas sarkozy in toulouse monday to find a solution to the ongoing malaise at the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and its airbus subsidiary . when german chancellor angela merkel meets french president nicolas sarkozy in toulouse , the hometown of european plane maker airbus , on monday the discussions will include talks on improving the management of its politically-charged parent company , eads .
it is widely expected that merkel and sarkozy will agree to scrap the company 's dual management system which sees a french and german executive share the functions of the eads chief executive and chairman positions .
many , including the current heads of the company themselves , have blamed this complicated structure , as well as the difficulty of balancing other national interests at the heart of the company , for numerous problems afflicting airbus .
" eads has to become a normal company , " president sarkozy said at the paris air show last month , underlining complications caused by the group 's unusual management and shareholder structure .
" we agree with the view that a company like eads can only exist if it has efficient structures , " said merkel at the end of may after a meeting with the french prime minister francois fillon .
airbus losses blamed on management structure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co-ceo enders is expected to have the position to himself airbus posted a massive loss last year despite delivering a record number of planes , and the company is eager to push through a radical restructuring plan to correct some of the organizational and commercial problems blamed for the poor performance .
the spectacular fall into the red was caused mainly by delays and production problems with the airbus a380 superjumbo , which is set to enter service later this year , with some of the difficulties blamed on dysfunctional management .
although a consensus has formed for scrapping the dual management system , neither side is believed to have settled on who would take up which job to preserve the franco-german balance in the company .
the most likely scenario is that the current french co-chairman of the group , arnaud lagardere , would assume the eads chairmanship on his own , while german co-chief executive tom enders would become sole chief executive .
enders fellow chief executive louis gallois , who is also chief executive of airbus , would remain head of the plane maker and focus entirely on its restructuring plan .
shareholders also attending summit the main controlling shareholders in eads , the german automaker daimlerchrysler and the french media and defense company lagardere , will also both attend the meeting on monday .
the two companies dominate a pact of controlling shareholders that also includes the french state , the spanish state and a consortium of public and private german investors .
as well as discussing eads and airbus , the two leaders will also discuss the troubled european project to produce a rival to the us-owned global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- as well as " the means to improve the economic governance of europe , " said a spokesman for the french presidency .
sarkonomics likely to feature on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has put his financial cat among the eu pigeons this latter subject could be a source of tension after sarkozy 's frequent attacks on the european central bank , which he holds responsible for boosting the value of the euro .
the euro hit fresh record highs against the dollar and yen on thursday , which penalizes european exporters by making their products more expensive in international markets .
merkel said tuesday that she was against orchestrating a fall in the euro and defended the independence of the european central bank .
merkel is also against opening up the shareholders pact to other investors , which sarkozy favors in order " to finance the launch of new planes and counteract the strong euro , " said his spokesman .
a final source of tension on monday could be demonstrations by disgruntled airbus workers protesting against the company 's restructuring plan , which foresees 10,000 job cuts in the next four years .

german chancellor angela merkel meets french president nicolas sarkozy in toulouse monday to find a solution to the ongoing malaise at the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and its airbus subsidiary . when german chancellor angela merkel meets french president nicolas sarkozy in toulouse , the hometown of european plane maker airbus , on monday the discussions will include talks on improving the management of its politically-charged parent company , eads .
it is widely expected that merkel and sarkozy will agree to scrap the company 's dual management system which sees a french and german executive share the functions of the eads chief executive and chairman positions .
many , including the current heads of the company themselves , have blamed this complicated structure , as well as the difficulty of balancing other national interests at the heart of the company , for numerous problems afflicting airbus .
" eads has to become a normal company , " president sarkozy said at the paris air show last month , underlining complications caused by the group 's unusual management and shareholder structure .
" we agree with the view that a company like eads can only exist if it has efficient structures , " said merkel at the end of may after a meeting with the french prime minister francois fillon .
airbus losses blamed on management structure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co-ceo enders is expected to have the position to himself airbus posted a massive loss last year despite delivering a record number of planes , and the company is eager to push through a radical restructuring plan to correct some of the organizational and commercial problems blamed for the poor performance .
the spectacular fall into the red was caused mainly by delays and production problems with the airbus a380 superjumbo , which is set to enter service later this year , with some of the difficulties blamed on dysfunctional management .
although a consensus has formed for scrapping the dual management system , neither side is believed to have settled on who would take up which job to preserve the franco-german balance in the company .
the most likely scenario is that the current french co-chairman of the group , arnaud lagardere , would assume the eads chairmanship on his own , while german co-chief executive tom enders would become sole chief executive .
enders fellow chief executive louis gallois , who is also chief executive of airbus , would remain head of the plane maker and focus entirely on its restructuring plan .
shareholders also attending summit the main controlling shareholders in eads , the german automaker daimlerchrysler and the french media and defense company lagardere , will also both attend the meeting on monday .
the two companies dominate a pact of controlling shareholders that also includes the french state , the spanish state and a consortium of public and private german investors .
as well as discussing eads and airbus , the two leaders will also discuss the troubled european project to produce a rival to the us-owned global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- as well as " the means to improve the economic governance of europe , " said a spokesman for the french presidency .

the euro hit fresh record highs against the dollar and yen on thursday , which penalizes european exporters by making their products more expensive in international markets .
merkel said tuesday that she was against orchestrating a fall in the euro and defended the independence of the european central bank .
merkel is also against opening up the shareholders pact to other investors , which sarkozy favors in order " to finance the launch of new planes and counteract the strong euro , " said his spokesman .
a final source of tension on monday could be demonstrations by disgruntled airbus workers protesting against the company 's restructuring plan , which foresees 10,000 job cuts in the next four years .

" this is the very first time that the german government will be asked to take responsibility and to care for those of the second generation in israel and indeed , worldwide , " said gideon fisher , an attorney representing the plaintiffs , before filing the suit at tel aviv district court on monday .
some 4,000 people have joined the lawsuit so far .

that included speedy approval in the british parliament for agreements on eu guidelines for a new treaty hammered out recently at a brussels summit provided they were implemented in a new treaty text under portugal 's eu presidency .
experts say brown , who has met merkel before at a summit in berlin when he was chancellor of the exchequer , may find merkel to be a leader he can work with .
" she is " a conciliator and somebody who manages power in a non-triumphalist way , " said hugo brady , a researcher at the centre for european reform in london .
" the problem will be if brown , under pressure at home , demands more , " brady said .
ahead of brown 's visit , the german government had praised his decision to make berlin his first stop during his european trip .
merkel had said she hoped to continue the close relations with britain she had enjoyed with brown 's predecessor , tony blair , adding it was particularly important for the well-being of europe and transatlantic ties .
meeting clouded by russian expulsions the meeting , which touched on security issues as well as climate and aid to africa , was overshadowed by an earlier decision by britain to expel four russian diplomats from london over the poisoning of former agent alexander litvinenko .
" i have no apologies for the action we have taken , " brown said in berlin . " i hope it 's understood in other parts of the world that we are not prepared to allow a situation of lawlessness to develop in london as a result of a failure to act . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between london and moscow are at a low british foreign secretary david miliband announced the decision to parliament earlier monday due to russia 's refusal to extradite the chief suspect in the case , former kgb agent andrei lugovoi .
lugovoi is accused of administering a highly radioactive poison to litvinenko when they met for tea in a central london hotel last november .
litvinenko , an outspoken kremlin critic , died three weeks later in hospital .
" we want the best possible relationships with russia .
we want to work together with russia , constructively on all the major international issues that we face , on iraq , on the middle east , " brown added .
a strong signal to europe much has been made both in britain and in germany of brown 's decision to travel to europe rather than flying to washington on his first trip abroad since taking office .
analysts have speculated whether it marks a new shift in britain 's foreign policy and gives a clear signal to european leaders that brown is serious about his country 's ties with the eu .
germany 's süddeutsche zeitung said it was a positive sign that brown had arranged to visit berlin without even scheduling a date for his washington trip .
the prime minister appeared to prefer " a certain distance to the us more out of inner conviction than populist need , " the paper said .
but miliband on sunday contradicted speculation of a cooling of relations with washington after the change of government in britain , saying the us remained the country 's " single most important bilateral partner . " a new european axis ? brown met the german chancellor just hours after a summit between merkel and nicolas sarkozy in which the new french president spoke of a " great day for the franco-german axis " after agreeing on a shake-up at ailing european plane-maker airbus .
brown is to meet with sarkozy on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's big three - merkel , sarkozy and brown experts believe it marks the establishment of a new axis between the leaders of europe 's three most powerful countries .
" it really has become obvious that blair had a terrible set of partners -lsb- in chirac and schröder -rsb- , " said brady .
" brown is much luckier ; he inherits a dynamic french leader and a chancellor who shares a lot of his basic instincts . "
while traditionally , france and germany have been considered closer to each other than to britain , merkel is capable as being as close to brown as any french leader , argued brady .
" if the pair forms a strong working relationship , they may even serve as a useful foil for sarkozy , " he said .
roderick parkes , a research associate at the german institute for international and security affairs parkes was less optimistic , believing that positive associations with merkel and sarkozy are expedient for brown at a time when the leadership of britain 's traditional ally - the united states - is led by a president whose own political days are numbered .
the prime minister " encourages talk of a ' european trio ' of sarkozy , merkel and brown , associating himself with two politicians who are perceived as forward looking and are seen to have brought a new momentum to a stagnant european political landscape , " parkes said . emma wynne -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european aeronautic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and airbus had an awkward managament structure with two co-chairmen and two co-chief executives from france and germany . the twin-headed management structure had been widely blamed for slow decision-making and inefficiency .

" this is a great day for this company , a great decision has been taken .

eads is controlled by a group of french and german shareholders which are either public or politically-linked private investors .
squabbles over control and influence have blighted its seven-year history .
airbus posted a massive loss last year despite delivering a record number of planes , and the company is being left far behind its main rival us plane maker boeing .
the success of boeing 's recently unveiled dreamliner has put the european venture under further pressure .

normally it 's the drunk and unruly passengers who end up getting kicked to the curb , but , after getting an eye-full , an easily distracted driver in germany shouted at a woman for wearing a low-cut blouse on his bus . emboldened by right said fred 's " i 'm too sexy , " thousands of would-be models and make-believe beauties have vainly - and publicly - strutted their stuff , convinced they really were too gorgeous for their shirts , cars , hats and cats . and while the innocent bystanders that these public displays are too often forced upon can been seen quietly shaking their heads murmuring , " no , honey , you 're not really good looking at all , " one german woman proved the 1992-hit does apply to some . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the bus company said the driver acted correctly after boarding a bus in the southern german city of landau , debora c. took her seat and waited to get to work , not realizing that the bus driver was making use of his mirror to stare into her cleavage - to the point where he stopped concentrating on the road . " suddenly he stopped the bus , opened the door and snorted , ' your cleavage is distracting me when i look in the mirror .
i ca n't concentrate on the road .
if you do n't sit somewhere else , i 'm going to have to throw you off the bus , " ' debora told germany 's bild newspaper on monday . instead of giving him the slap in the face - and sexual harassment suit - he deserved , the 20-year-old saleswoman switched seats and continued her journey . " he humiliated me in front of the whole bus and made me look like a slut , " debora told the paper . a spokesman for the bus company , however , said the driver acted correctly . " the bus driver is allowed to do that and he did the right thing , " the spokesman said .
" a bus driver can not be distracted , because it 's a danger to the safety of all the passengers . " dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that included speedy approval in the british parliament for agreements on eu guidelines for a new treaty hammered out recently at a brussels summit provided they were implemented in a new treaty text under portugal 's eu presidency .
experts say brown , who has met merkel before at a summit in berlin when he was chancellor of the exchequer , may find merkel to be a leader he can work with .
" she is " a conciliator and somebody who manages power in a non-triumphalist way , " said hugo brady , a researcher at the centre for european reform in london .
" the problem will be if brown , under pressure at home , demands more , " brady said .
ahead of brown 's visit , the german government had praised his decision to make berlin his first stop during his european trip .
merkel had said she hoped to continue the close relations with britain she had enjoyed with brown 's predecessor , tony blair , adding it was particularly important for the well-being of europe and transatlantic ties .
meeting clouded by russian expulsions the meeting , which touched on security issues as well as climate and aid to africa , was overshadowed by an earlier decision by britain to expel four russian diplomats from london over the poisoning of former agent alexander litvinenko .
" i have no apologies for the action we have taken , " brown said in berlin . " i hope it 's understood in other parts of the world that we are not prepared to allow a situation of lawlessness to develop in london as a result of a failure to act . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between london and moscow are at a low british foreign secretary david miliband announced the decision to parliament earlier monday due to russia 's refusal to extradite the chief suspect in the case , former kgb agent andrei lugovoi .
lugovoi is accused of administering a highly radioactive poison to litvinenko when they met for tea in a central london hotel last november .
litvinenko , an outspoken kremlin critic , died three weeks later in hospital .
" we want the best possible relationships with russia .
we want to work together with russia , constructively on all the major international issues that we face , on iraq , on the middle east , " brown added .
a strong signal to europe much has been made both in britain and in germany of brown 's decision to travel to europe rather than flying to washington on his first trip abroad since taking office .
analysts have speculated whether it marks a new shift in britain 's foreign policy and gives a clear signal to european leaders that brown is serious about his country 's ties with the eu .
germany 's süddeutsche zeitung said it was a positive sign that brown had arranged to visit berlin without even scheduling a date for his washington trip .
the prime minister appeared to prefer " a certain distance to the us more out of inner conviction than populist need , " the paper said .
but miliband on sunday contradicted speculation of a cooling of relations with washington after the change of government in britain , saying the us remained the country 's " single most important bilateral partner . " a new european axis ? brown met the german chancellor just hours after a summit between merkel and nicolas sarkozy in which the new french president spoke of a " great day for the franco-german axis " after agreeing on a shake-up at ailing european plane-maker airbus .
brown is to meet with sarkozy on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's big three - merkel , sarkozy and brown experts believe it marks the establishment of a new axis between the leaders of europe 's three most powerful countries .
" it really has become obvious that blair had a terrible set of partners -lsb- in chirac and schröder -rsb- , " said brady .
" brown is much luckier ; he inherits a dynamic french leader and a chancellor who shares a lot of his basic instincts . "
while traditionally , france and germany have been considered closer to each other than to britain , merkel is capable as being as close to brown as any french leader , argued brady .
" if the pair forms a strong working relationship , they may even serve as a useful foil for sarkozy , " he said .
roderick parkes , a research associate at the german institute for international and security affairs parkes was less optimistic , believing that positive associations with merkel and sarkozy are expedient for brown at a time when the leadership of britain 's traditional ally - the united states - is led by a president whose own political days are numbered .

that included speedy approval in the british parliament for agreements on eu guidelines for a new treaty hammered out recently at a brussels summit provided they were implemented in a new treaty text under portugal 's eu presidency .
experts say brown , who has met merkel before at a summit in berlin when he was chancellor of the exchequer , may find merkel to be a leader he can work with .
" she is " a conciliator and somebody who manages power in a non-triumphalist way , " said hugo brady , a researcher at the centre for european reform in london .
" the problem will be if brown , under pressure at home , demands more , " brady said .
ahead of brown 's visit , the german government had praised his decision to make berlin his first stop during his european trip .
merkel had said she hoped to continue the close relations with britain she had enjoyed with brown 's predecessor , tony blair , adding it was particularly important for the well-being of europe and transatlantic ties .
meeting clouded by russian expulsions the meeting , which touched on security issues as well as climate and aid to africa , was overshadowed by an earlier decision by britain to expel four russian diplomats from london over the poisoning of former agent alexander litvinenko .
" i have no apologies for the action we have taken , " brown said in berlin . " i hope it 's understood in other parts of the world that we are not prepared to allow a situation of lawlessness to develop in london as a result of a failure to act . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between london and moscow are at a low british foreign secretary david miliband announced the decision to parliament earlier monday due to russia 's refusal to extradite the chief suspect in the case , former kgb agent andrei lugovoi .
lugovoi is accused of administering a highly radioactive poison to litvinenko when they met for tea in a central london hotel last november .
litvinenko , an outspoken kremlin critic , died three weeks later in hospital .
" we want the best possible relationships with russia .
we want to work together with russia , constructively on all the major international issues that we face , on iraq , on the middle east , " brown added .
a strong signal to europe much has been made both in britain and in germany of brown 's decision to travel to europe rather than flying to washington on his first trip abroad since taking office .
analysts have speculated whether it marks a new shift in britain 's foreign policy and gives a clear signal to european leaders that brown is serious about his country 's ties with the eu .
germany 's süddeutsche zeitung said it was a positive sign that brown had arranged to visit berlin without even scheduling a date for his washington trip .
the prime minister appeared to prefer " a certain distance to the us more out of inner conviction than populist need , " the paper said .
but miliband on sunday contradicted speculation of a cooling of relations with washington after the change of government in britain , saying the us remained the country 's " single most important bilateral partner . " a new european axis ? brown met the german chancellor just hours after a summit between merkel and nicolas sarkozy in which the new french president spoke of a " great day for the franco-german axis " after agreeing on a shake-up at ailing european plane-maker airbus .
brown is to meet with sarkozy on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's big three - merkel , sarkozy and brown experts believe it marks the establishment of a new axis between the leaders of europe 's three most powerful countries .
" it really has become obvious that blair had a terrible set of partners -lsb- in chirac and schröder -rsb- , " said brady .
" brown is much luckier ; he inherits a dynamic french leader and a chancellor who shares a lot of his basic instincts . "
while traditionally , france and germany have been considered closer to each other than to britain , merkel is capable as being as close to brown as any french leader , argued brady .
" if the pair forms a strong working relationship , they may even serve as a useful foil for sarkozy , " he said .
roderick parkes , a research associate at the german institute for international and security affairs parkes was less optimistic , believing that positive associations with merkel and sarkozy are expedient for brown at a time when the leadership of britain 's traditional ally - the united states - is led by a president whose own political days are numbered .
the prime minister " encourages talk of a ' european trio ' of sarkozy , merkel and brown , associating himself with two politicians who are perceived as forward looking and are seen to have brought a new momentum to a stagnant european political landscape , " parkes said . emma wynne -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" when this thing is running , we do n't need any gas or oil in the building , " said chief technician marco nauerz in the furnace room of the foundation 's main site at meckenbeuren near lake constance .
the 11-meter-high -lrb- 36-feet-high -rrb- plant can consume 8 million diapers annually .
by nauerz ' calculation , that means it can continuously eliminate the waste from 12,000 incontinent patients .
there is no risk the supply will dry up .
liebenau has already signed up 40 rest homes , some of which it owns and others run by other operators , as suppliers , and it expects to double the number by the end of the year .
the diapers are packed in plastic sacks and arrive in airtight garbage trucks .
" you ca n't smell anything here , can you ? " said nauerz , showing the " fuel " shed , where extractor fans suck out any odors .

best of all , liebenau expects to make a profit from diapers , as it charges rest-home operators to get rid of the waste .
the fees are lower than those at land-fills or commercial incinerators .
to date , the foundation has had to pay 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 481,880 -rrb- annually in land-fill fees for its own 2.1 million used diapers per year .

" when this thing is running , we do n't need any gas or oil in the building , " said chief technician marco nauerz in the furnace room of the foundation 's main site at meckenbeuren near lake constance .
the 11-meter-high -lrb- 36-feet-high -rrb- plant can consume 8 million diapers annually .
by nauerz ' calculation , that means it can continuously eliminate the waste from 12,000 incontinent patients .
there is no risk the supply will dry up .
liebenau has already signed up 40 rest homes , some of which it owns and others run by other operators , as suppliers , and it expects to double the number by the end of the year .
the diapers are packed in plastic sacks and arrive in airtight garbage trucks .
" you ca n't smell anything here , can you ? " said nauerz , showing the " fuel " shed , where extractor fans suck out any odors .
nauerz , 55 , and no stranger to diapers as a father of three , has gained new respect for the soiled nappy through his work .
as much stored energy as wet chopped wood bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : youngsters can provide their own energy source too engineers say they have an average moisture content of 58 percent and can release as much energy as wet chopped wood .
at 910 degrees celsius , they burn in seconds .
the foundation uses the energy to heat water in bathrooms and in its laundry to clean towels and sheets .
the total cost of the plant , the " fuel " depot and new pipes came to 3 million euros -lrb- $ 4 million -rrb- , nauerz estimates .
best of all , liebenau expects to make a profit from diapers , as it charges rest-home operators to get rid of the waste .
the fees are lower than those at land-fills or commercial incinerators .
to date , the foundation has had to pay 350,000 euros -lrb- $ 481,880 -rrb- annually in land-fill fees for its own 2.1 million used diapers per year .
the furnace was jointly developed by liebenau staff and an engineering company in bregenz , austria .
an automatic conveyer from the hopper to the furnace was also specially made for the job .
german law does not recognize diapers as fuel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chuck another nappy on the fire ... or maybe not the partners were surprised to run into legal difficulties , seeing as german law makes no provision for diapers as fuel .
the plant had to have flue-gas treatment like regular commercial incinerators , although the engineers say diapers are mainly organic : just cellulose , biodegradable plastic film and the contents .
as a non-profit charity , liebenau is also concerned about being kind to the environment , so it insists that all the diapers be " local produce " and rejects long-distance transport of the new fuel .
instead , it hopes to sell the furnaces elsewhere in europe .

i ca n't concentrate on the road .
if you do n't sit somewhere else , i 'm going to have to throw you off the bus , " ' debora told germany 's bild newspaper on monday . instead of giving him the slap in the face - and sexual harassment suit - he deserved , the 20-year-old saleswoman switched seats and continued her journey .

" this is the very first time that the german government will be asked to take responsibility and to care for those of the second generation in israel and indeed , worldwide , " said gideon fisher , an attorney representing the plaintiffs , before filing the suit at tel aviv district court on monday .
some 4,000 people have joined the lawsuit so far .
but baruch mazor , who heads the fisher fund , a charity that looks after so-called second-generation holocaust survivors , said that 4 to 5 percent of the 400,000 children of holocaust survivors in israel require psychotherapy as they suffer from an irrational fear of starvation and incapacitating bouts of depression .
stocking bread , hiding pain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : death camp inmates received almost no food " i have an obsession about food , especially bread , " a 58-year-old woman who was not named said on israeli radio on sunday , according to ap .
she added that she was obsessed about stocking bread as her parents fought for bread crumbs at auschwitz death camp .
" it was forbidden in our house to show pain or say that you 're sad , " she added .
" my father taught us not to express our feelings and hide our hurt .
that was very , very hard . "
a first step towards recognition mazor said that many of the people involved in the suit can not work because of their ailments and are therefore not able to pay for any treatment .
he called the lawsuit a first step towards recognizing the fate of the children of holocaust survivors .
ap reported that it 's not clear whether a ruling by an israeli court would be binding for a foreign defendant - in this case , germany .
mazor reportedly wants to use the israeli verdict for a later lawsuit filed with a german or international court .
the german embassy in israel declined to comment on the case . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that included speedy approval in the british parliament for agreements on eu guidelines for a new treaty hammered out recently at a brussels summit provided they were implemented in a new treaty text under portugal 's eu presidency .
experts say brown , who has met merkel before at a summit in berlin when he was chancellor of the exchequer , may find merkel to be a leader he can work with .
" she is " a conciliator and somebody who manages power in a non-triumphalist way , " said hugo brady , a researcher at the centre for european reform in london .
" the problem will be if brown , under pressure at home , demands more , " brady said .
ahead of brown 's visit , the german government had praised his decision to make berlin his first stop during his european trip .
merkel had said she hoped to continue the close relations with britain she had enjoyed with brown 's predecessor , tony blair , adding it was particularly important for the well-being of europe and transatlantic ties .
meeting clouded by russian expulsions the meeting , which touched on security issues as well as climate and aid to africa , was overshadowed by an earlier decision by britain to expel four russian diplomats from london over the poisoning of former agent alexander litvinenko .
" i have no apologies for the action we have taken , " brown said in berlin . " i hope it 's understood in other parts of the world that we are not prepared to allow a situation of lawlessness to develop in london as a result of a failure to act . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between london and moscow are at a low british foreign secretary david miliband announced the decision to parliament earlier monday due to russia 's refusal to extradite the chief suspect in the case , former kgb agent andrei lugovoi .
lugovoi is accused of administering a highly radioactive poison to litvinenko when they met for tea in a central london hotel last november .
litvinenko , an outspoken kremlin critic , died three weeks later in hospital .
" we want the best possible relationships with russia .
we want to work together with russia , constructively on all the major international issues that we face , on iraq , on the middle east , " brown added .
a strong signal to europe much has been made both in britain and in germany of brown 's decision to travel to europe rather than flying to washington on his first trip abroad since taking office .
analysts have speculated whether it marks a new shift in britain 's foreign policy and gives a clear signal to european leaders that brown is serious about his country 's ties with the eu .
germany 's süddeutsche zeitung said it was a positive sign that brown had arranged to visit berlin without even scheduling a date for his washington trip .
the prime minister appeared to prefer " a certain distance to the us more out of inner conviction than populist need , " the paper said .
but miliband on sunday contradicted speculation of a cooling of relations with washington after the change of government in britain , saying the us remained the country 's " single most important bilateral partner . " a new european axis ? brown met the german chancellor just hours after a summit between merkel and nicolas sarkozy in which the new french president spoke of a " great day for the franco-german axis " after agreeing on a shake-up at ailing european plane-maker airbus .
brown is to meet with sarkozy on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's big three - merkel , sarkozy and brown experts believe it marks the establishment of a new axis between the leaders of europe 's three most powerful countries .
" it really has become obvious that blair had a terrible set of partners -lsb- in chirac and schröder -rsb- , " said brady .
" brown is much luckier ; he inherits a dynamic french leader and a chancellor who shares a lot of his basic instincts . "
while traditionally , france and germany have been considered closer to each other than to britain , merkel is capable as being as close to brown as any french leader , argued brady .
" if the pair forms a strong working relationship , they may even serve as a useful foil for sarkozy , " he said .
roderick parkes , a research associate at the german institute for international and security affairs parkes was less optimistic , believing that positive associations with merkel and sarkozy are expedient for brown at a time when the leadership of britain 's traditional ally - the united states - is led by a president whose own political days are numbered .
the prime minister " encourages talk of a ' european trio ' of sarkozy , merkel and brown , associating himself with two politicians who are perceived as forward looking and are seen to have brought a new momentum to a stagnant european political landscape , " parkes said . emma wynne -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the european aeronautic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and airbus had an awkward managament structure with two co-chairmen and two co-chief executives from france and germany . the twin-headed management structure had been widely blamed for slow decision-making and inefficiency .
under the deal , france 's louis gallois will be the sole head of eads , while germany 's tom enders will become chief executive of airbus , which is struggling with losses amid lengthy production delays for its superjumbo a380 .
positive step bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy and merkel are meeting in toulouse to talk about eads and airbus " i am convinced we have come up with a good solution for the future of eads and of airbus , " said merkel during a tour of the airbus factory in toulouse in southwest france .
" this is a great day for this company , a great decision has been taken .
it is a great day for the franco-german axis , " said sarkozy .
" eads , airbus , these are companies that have to be managed like companies and not like international organizations , " he added . under the new structure , rüdiger grube of daimler is also set to become sole chairman .
daimlerchrysler is the biggest private german shareholder of eads .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : workers have been protesting about plans to cut 10,000 jobs this means the french co-chairman arnaud lagardere will be removed .
but sarkozy 's comments that he could take over as chairman of the board under a rotating system every five years indicates that the sensitive question of the franco-german balance could remain a problem .
eads is controlled by a group of french and german shareholders which are either public or politically-linked private investors .
squabbles over control and influence have blighted its seven-year history .
airbus posted a massive loss last year despite delivering a record number of planes , and the company is being left far behind its main rival us plane maker boeing .
the success of boeing 's recently unveiled dreamliner has put the european venture under further pressure .
radical restructuring plans that foresee the loss of 10,000 jobs have also been the source of considerable franco-german tension with each side trying to keep job cuts in the respective country to a minimum . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" this is the very first time that the german government will be asked to take responsibility and to care for those of the second generation in israel and indeed , worldwide , " said gideon fisher , an attorney representing the plaintiffs , before filing the suit at tel aviv district court on monday .
some 4,000 people have joined the lawsuit so far .
but baruch mazor , who heads the fisher fund , a charity that looks after so-called second-generation holocaust survivors , said that 4 to 5 percent of the 400,000 children of holocaust survivors in israel require psychotherapy as they suffer from an irrational fear of starvation and incapacitating bouts of depression .
stocking bread , hiding pain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : death camp inmates received almost no food " i have an obsession about food , especially bread , " a 58-year-old woman who was not named said on israeli radio on sunday , according to ap .
she added that she was obsessed about stocking bread as her parents fought for bread crumbs at auschwitz death camp .
" it was forbidden in our house to show pain or say that you 're sad , " she added .
" my father taught us not to express our feelings and hide our hurt .
that was very , very hard . "
a first step towards recognition mazor said that many of the people involved in the suit can not work because of their ailments and are therefore not able to pay for any treatment .
he called the lawsuit a first step towards recognizing the fate of the children of holocaust survivors .
ap reported that it 's not clear whether a ruling by an israeli court would be binding for a foreign defendant - in this case , germany .
mazor reportedly wants to use the israeli verdict for a later lawsuit filed with a german or international court .
the german embassy in israel declined to comment on the case . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

1 , 2002 .
instead of using a cut-off date , the council recommended establishing an independent panel to evaluate scientists ' plans on a case-by-case basis . " if the current rules remain , german science will be hopelessly sidelined , " said horst dreier , speaking for the 14 members who favor changing the law , adding that the new law should explicitly state that new embryonic stem cell lines should come from widely available sources , not from manufacturers looking to profit from their production . expansion to permitted uses recommended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists could be arrested for conducting some forms of stem cell research the 2002 law also prevented germans from using the 20 stem cell lines they were allowed to access for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes , limiting their work to basic research .

" this is the very first time that the german government will be asked to take responsibility and to care for those of the second generation in israel and indeed , worldwide , " said gideon fisher , an attorney representing the plaintiffs , before filing the suit at tel aviv district court on monday .
some 4,000 people have joined the lawsuit so far .
but baruch mazor , who heads the fisher fund , a charity that looks after so-called second-generation holocaust survivors , said that 4 to 5 percent of the 400,000 children of holocaust survivors in israel require psychotherapy as they suffer from an irrational fear of starvation and incapacitating bouts of depression .
stocking bread , hiding pain bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : death camp inmates received almost no food " i have an obsession about food , especially bread , " a 58-year-old woman who was not named said on israeli radio on sunday , according to ap .
she added that she was obsessed about stocking bread as her parents fought for bread crumbs at auschwitz death camp .
" it was forbidden in our house to show pain or say that you 're sad , " she added .
" my father taught us not to express our feelings and hide our hurt .
that was very , very hard . "
a first step towards recognition mazor said that many of the people involved in the suit can not work because of their ailments and are therefore not able to pay for any treatment .
he called the lawsuit a first step towards recognizing the fate of the children of holocaust survivors .
ap reported that it 's not clear whether a ruling by an israeli court would be binding for a foreign defendant - in this case , germany .
mazor reportedly wants to use the israeli verdict for a later lawsuit filed with a german or international court .
the german embassy in israel declined to comment on the case . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that included speedy approval in the british parliament for agreements on eu guidelines for a new treaty hammered out recently at a brussels summit provided they were implemented in a new treaty text under portugal 's eu presidency .
experts say brown , who has met merkel before at a summit in berlin when he was chancellor of the exchequer , may find merkel to be a leader he can work with .
" she is " a conciliator and somebody who manages power in a non-triumphalist way , " said hugo brady , a researcher at the centre for european reform in london .
" the problem will be if brown , under pressure at home , demands more , " brady said .
ahead of brown 's visit , the german government had praised his decision to make berlin his first stop during his european trip .
merkel had said she hoped to continue the close relations with britain she had enjoyed with brown 's predecessor , tony blair , adding it was particularly important for the well-being of europe and transatlantic ties .
meeting clouded by russian expulsions the meeting , which touched on security issues as well as climate and aid to africa , was overshadowed by an earlier decision by britain to expel four russian diplomats from london over the poisoning of former agent alexander litvinenko .
" i have no apologies for the action we have taken , " brown said in berlin . " i hope it 's understood in other parts of the world that we are not prepared to allow a situation of lawlessness to develop in london as a result of a failure to act . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : relations between london and moscow are at a low british foreign secretary david miliband announced the decision to parliament earlier monday due to russia 's refusal to extradite the chief suspect in the case , former kgb agent andrei lugovoi .
lugovoi is accused of administering a highly radioactive poison to litvinenko when they met for tea in a central london hotel last november .
litvinenko , an outspoken kremlin critic , died three weeks later in hospital .
" we want the best possible relationships with russia .
we want to work together with russia , constructively on all the major international issues that we face , on iraq , on the middle east , " brown added .
a strong signal to europe much has been made both in britain and in germany of brown 's decision to travel to europe rather than flying to washington on his first trip abroad since taking office .
analysts have speculated whether it marks a new shift in britain 's foreign policy and gives a clear signal to european leaders that brown is serious about his country 's ties with the eu .
germany 's süddeutsche zeitung said it was a positive sign that brown had arranged to visit berlin without even scheduling a date for his washington trip .
the prime minister appeared to prefer " a certain distance to the us more out of inner conviction than populist need , " the paper said .
but miliband on sunday contradicted speculation of a cooling of relations with washington after the change of government in britain , saying the us remained the country 's " single most important bilateral partner . " a new european axis ? brown met the german chancellor just hours after a summit between merkel and nicolas sarkozy in which the new french president spoke of a " great day for the franco-german axis " after agreeing on a shake-up at ailing european plane-maker airbus .
brown is to meet with sarkozy on friday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : europe 's big three - merkel , sarkozy and brown experts believe it marks the establishment of a new axis between the leaders of europe 's three most powerful countries .
" it really has become obvious that blair had a terrible set of partners -lsb- in chirac and schröder -rsb- , " said brady .
" brown is much luckier ; he inherits a dynamic french leader and a chancellor who shares a lot of his basic instincts . "
while traditionally , france and germany have been considered closer to each other than to britain , merkel is capable as being as close to brown as any french leader , argued brady .
" if the pair forms a strong working relationship , they may even serve as a useful foil for sarkozy , " he said .
roderick parkes , a research associate at the german institute for international and security affairs parkes was less optimistic , believing that positive associations with merkel and sarkozy are expedient for brown at a time when the leadership of britain 's traditional ally - the united states - is led by a president whose own political days are numbered .
the prime minister " encourages talk of a ' european trio ' of sarkozy , merkel and brown , associating himself with two politicians who are perceived as forward looking and are seen to have brought a new momentum to a stagnant european political landscape , " parkes said . emma wynne -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that included speedy approval in the british parliament for agreements on eu guidelines for a new treaty hammered out recently at a brussels summit provided they were implemented in a new treaty text under portugal 's eu presidency .
experts say brown , who has met merkel before at a summit in berlin when he was chancellor of the exchequer , may find merkel to be a leader he can work with .
" she is " a conciliator and somebody who manages power in a non-triumphalist way , " said hugo brady , a researcher at the centre for european reform in london .
" the problem will be if brown , under pressure at home , demands more , " brady said .
ahead of brown 's visit , the german government had praised his decision to make berlin his first stop during his european trip .
merkel had said she hoped to continue the close relations with britain she had enjoyed with brown 's predecessor , tony blair , adding it was particularly important for the well-being of europe and transatlantic ties .
meeting clouded by russian expulsions the meeting , which touched on security issues as well as climate and aid to africa , was overshadowed by an earlier decision by britain to expel four russian diplomats from london over the poisoning of former agent alexander litvinenko .

the european aeronautic defence and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and airbus had an awkward managament structure with two co-chairmen and two co-chief executives from france and germany . the twin-headed management structure had been widely blamed for slow decision-making and inefficiency .
under the deal , france 's louis gallois will be the sole head of eads , while germany 's tom enders will become chief executive of airbus , which is struggling with losses amid lengthy production delays for its superjumbo a380 .

" this is a great day for this company , a great decision has been taken .
it is a great day for the franco-german axis , " said sarkozy .
" eads , airbus , these are companies that have to be managed like companies and not like international organizations , " he added . under the new structure , rüdiger grube of daimler is also set to become sole chairman .

but sarkozy 's comments that he could take over as chairman of the board under a rotating system every five years indicates that the sensitive question of the franco-german balance could remain a problem .
eads is controlled by a group of french and german shareholders which are either public or politically-linked private investors .
squabbles over control and influence have blighted its seven-year history .
airbus posted a massive loss last year despite delivering a record number of planes , and the company is being left far behind its main rival us plane maker boeing .
the success of boeing 's recently unveiled dreamliner has put the european venture under further pressure .
radical restructuring plans that foresee the loss of 10,000 jobs have also been the source of considerable franco-german tension with each side trying to keep job cuts in the respective country to a minimum . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- jg -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de science -pipe- 16.07.2007 ethics council urges relaxing german stem cell rules in a move welcomed by german researchers , the national ethics council on monday recommended easing legal restrictions intended to limit german scientists ' ability to conduct stem cell research . as germany 's top body when it comes to medical ethical issues , 14 of the national ethics council 's 24 members recommended a series of amendments to a 2002 stem cell law banning the production of embryonic cells that scientists have said hinders them from conducting research on par with international institutes . the council also said lawmakers should lift a ban placed on german scientists , both in and outside the country , on using cell lines created after jan .
1 , 2002 .
instead of using a cut-off date , the council recommended establishing an independent panel to evaluate scientists ' plans on a case-by-case basis . " if the current rules remain , german science will be hopelessly sidelined , " said horst dreier , speaking for the 14 members who favor changing the law , adding that the new law should explicitly state that new embryonic stem cell lines should come from widely available sources , not from manufacturers looking to profit from their production . expansion to permitted uses recommended bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german scientists could be arrested for conducting some forms of stem cell research the 2002 law also prevented germans from using the 20 stem cell lines they were allowed to access for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes , limiting their work to basic research .
stem cell advocates say research in the field could eventually lead to treatments for diabetes and parkinson 's disease . stem cell research remains a sensitive issue in germany due to country 's nazi past , and nine nec members voted against recommending amendments to the current regulations , saying in a statement that it would " hollow out the stem cell law . " no therapies on the horizon the minority group also said there was no reason to reevaluate the issue because therapies based on embryonic stem cell research are not likely to be developed in the foreseeable future .
the group also criticized the decision to allow researchers to make use of embryonic stem cells in their research but not allow them to create the cells themselves . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : scientists have said they are " miles away " from treatments based on stem cell research the german bishop 's conference said no changes should be made to the current law . " the demands of even important research interests can not under any circumstances lead to human embryos being created , " the catholic group said in a statement .
" we must not subordinate the protection of life to the freedom of research . " the german research society , however , welcomed the nec 's recommendations . " this will provide a positive impulse for stem cell research in germany , " society vice-president jörg hinrich hacker said . political decision in autumn bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is divided on the issue of stem cell research politicians said they would raise the issue of embryonic stem cell research in the bundestag , germany 's lower house of parliament , this autumn . " we will suggest moving the cut-off date to may 1 , 2007 , " rene röspel , the social democratic party 's research expert , told the berliner zeitung in an interview appearing tuesday .
" that is enough for the most versatile studies . " whether germany actually changes the law is certain to be subject to debate , as it was in 2002 . " the non-unanimous vote in the ethics council reflect the divides that this question also creates in the parliament , " ilse aigner , the research policy expert for germany 's two christian conservative parties , told tuesday 's handelsblatt newspaper . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia followed suit on saturday by announcing that it would suspend its obligations under the conventional forces in europe -lrb- cfe -rrb- treaty .
if the trend continues , the intermediate-range nuclear forces treaty could be next .
and then europe , freshly liberated from the cold-war threat of instant extinction , will be bristling with missiles . " in spain , conservative daily abc commented that russia 's decision to suspend the cfe treaty was bad news , but not necessarily because it meant that this could revive old military threats .
" the move shows that moscow 's political leaders , starting with putin himself , still think in terms of the long-gone categories of the cold war . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is putin telling europeans to look across the atlantic for a solution ?
vienna 's liberal paper der standard meanwhile said that the russians were acting out of principle to avoid any meddling in their sphere of influence and a strategic disadvantage .
" the planned us missile defense system is part of that .
the bush administration has talked poland and the czech republic into it and duped the other nato states that wanted to slow things down and negotiate with russia rather than have washington make all the decisions alone .
putin has given the west 150 days to fulfill his demands regarding a reform of the cfe treaty .
europe can thank bush for that . " poland 's conservative rzeczpospolita wrote that putin acted as he had promised .
" it 's important to keep a cool head now , " the daily commented , adding that the announcement came as polish president lech kaczynski was on his way to the us to discuss the missile defense system with george w. bush .
" it also happened at a point , when russia is conducting military exercises on a large scale ... putin 's saber-rattling also affects europe .
in all conversations with eu politicians , one has to say : see for yourself what the kremlin is doing and draw your own conclusions . " the handelsblatt newspaper from düsseldorf in germany on the other hand commented that putin had a solid argument on his side .
" a majority of nato states did n't ratify the 1999 version of this arms control agreement .
but the russian president still has to tolerate questions regarding the motivation behind his act of defiance .
does he want to build new tanks , new fighter planes ?
if so , what does he want to do with them ?
is he dreaming of a renaissance of the gloried soviet empire ?
putin should know where his real interests lie : in a pacific europe that offers a giant market for russia 's rich energy treasures . " dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german chancellor angela merkel meets french president nicolas sarkozy in toulouse monday to find a solution to the ongoing malaise at the european aeronautic defense and space company -lrb- eads -rrb- and its airbus subsidiary . when german chancellor angela merkel meets french president nicolas sarkozy in toulouse , the hometown of european plane maker airbus , on monday the discussions will include talks on improving the management of its politically-charged parent company , eads .
it is widely expected that merkel and sarkozy will agree to scrap the company 's dual management system which sees a french and german executive share the functions of the eads chief executive and chairman positions .
many , including the current heads of the company themselves , have blamed this complicated structure , as well as the difficulty of balancing other national interests at the heart of the company , for numerous problems afflicting airbus .
" eads has to become a normal company , " president sarkozy said at the paris air show last month , underlining complications caused by the group 's unusual management and shareholder structure .
" we agree with the view that a company like eads can only exist if it has efficient structures , " said merkel at the end of may after a meeting with the french prime minister francois fillon .
airbus losses blamed on management structure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : co-ceo enders is expected to have the position to himself airbus posted a massive loss last year despite delivering a record number of planes , and the company is eager to push through a radical restructuring plan to correct some of the organizational and commercial problems blamed for the poor performance .
the spectacular fall into the red was caused mainly by delays and production problems with the airbus a380 superjumbo , which is set to enter service later this year , with some of the difficulties blamed on dysfunctional management .
although a consensus has formed for scrapping the dual management system , neither side is believed to have settled on who would take up which job to preserve the franco-german balance in the company .
the most likely scenario is that the current french co-chairman of the group , arnaud lagardere , would assume the eads chairmanship on his own , while german co-chief executive tom enders would become sole chief executive .
enders fellow chief executive louis gallois , who is also chief executive of airbus , would remain head of the plane maker and focus entirely on its restructuring plan .
shareholders also attending summit the main controlling shareholders in eads , the german automaker daimlerchrysler and the french media and defense company lagardere , will also both attend the meeting on monday .
the two companies dominate a pact of controlling shareholders that also includes the french state , the spanish state and a consortium of public and private german investors .
as well as discussing eads and airbus , the two leaders will also discuss the troubled european project to produce a rival to the us-owned global positioning system -lrb- gps -rrb- as well as " the means to improve the economic governance of europe , " said a spokesman for the french presidency .
sarkonomics likely to feature on agenda bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has put his financial cat among the eu pigeons this latter subject could be a source of tension after sarkozy 's frequent attacks on the european central bank , which he holds responsible for boosting the value of the euro .
the euro hit fresh record highs against the dollar and yen on thursday , which penalizes european exporters by making their products more expensive in international markets .
merkel said tuesday that she was against orchestrating a fall in the euro and defended the independence of the european central bank .
merkel is also against opening up the shareholders pact to other investors , which sarkozy favors in order " to finance the launch of new planes and counteract the strong euro , " said his spokesman .
a final source of tension on monday could be demonstrations by disgruntled airbus workers protesting against the company 's restructuring plan , which foresees 10,000 job cuts in the next four years .
the hard-left trade union cgt has called for workers to challenge the plans , dubbed " power8 " by the company . article compiled based on wire reports -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" we are not arguing for some kind of guantanamo nonsense for the uk , " said ken jones , head of the association of chief police officers -lrb- acpo -rrb- .
mr jones said the police needed more flexibility over the current limit of 28 days without charge .
shami chakrabarti , of campaign group liberty , attacked the police proposal .
" we elect politicians to determine legislation and we expect chief constables to uphold the rule of law , not campaign for internment , " said ms chakrabarti , director of liberty .
' against the buffers ' the head of the senior police officers ' organisation had warned in a newspaper interview that terror investigations were " up against the buffers on the 28-day limit " - and that suspects should be held for " as long as it takes " .
since the 28-day limit was introduced neither the police or security services have produced one shred of evidence to demonstrate the need for extension david davis , shadow home secretary but facing criticism over such an open-ended form of detention , mr jones sought to clarify what flexibility the police needed in such cases .
" we do not want internment .
that would be crazy . "
" it needs to be as long as is proportionate and necessary , subjected to sufficient judicial checks and balances , " mr jones told the bbc .
" but i can tell you now , acpo is not calling for indeterminate detention . "
the metropolitan police distanced themselves from any calls for indefinite detention .
" any such proposal would not have the support of the metropolitan police service . "
the government 's independent reviewer of terrorism legislation , lord carlile said the issue was not simply about the number of days someone should be detained .
" my view is that people should not be detained a day longer than necessary or a day shorter than necessary in the interests of justice , " he said .
" the cases should be considered by senior judges on an evidence basis .
it would strengthen the rights of those detained with a higher level of judges and subject to appeal . "
and extending the detention period without trial was rejected by the shadow home secretary , david davis .

" since the 28-day limit was introduced neither the police or security services have produced one shred of evidence to demonstrate the need for extension , either in public or in confidential briefings , " said mr davis .
liberal democrat mp , evan harris , also condemned the calls for such an extension .
" the police have not provided evidence from their experience of recent investigations that the current 28-day limit - already one of the longest for a democracy - is not sufficient to collect evidence to bring charges , " said dr harris .
the government has tried to raise the limit a suspect can be held without charge to 90 days .
but mps have consistently rejected that proposal - handing former prime minister tony blair his first defeat in the commons , in 2005 .

" we are not arguing for some kind of guantanamo nonsense for the uk , " said ken jones , head of the association of chief police officers -lrb- acpo -rrb- .
mr jones said the police needed more flexibility over the current limit of 28 days without charge .
shami chakrabarti , of campaign group liberty , attacked the police proposal .
" we elect politicians to determine legislation and we expect chief constables to uphold the rule of law , not campaign for internment , " said ms chakrabarti , director of liberty .
' against the buffers ' the head of the senior police officers ' organisation had warned in a newspaper interview that terror investigations were " up against the buffers on the 28-day limit " - and that suspects should be held for " as long as it takes " .
since the 28-day limit was introduced neither the police or security services have produced one shred of evidence to demonstrate the need for extension david davis , shadow home secretary but facing criticism over such an open-ended form of detention , mr jones sought to clarify what flexibility the police needed in such cases .
" we do not want internment .
that would be crazy . "
" it needs to be as long as is proportionate and necessary , subjected to sufficient judicial checks and balances , " mr jones told the bbc .
" but i can tell you now , acpo is not calling for indeterminate detention . "
the metropolitan police distanced themselves from any calls for indefinite detention .
" any such proposal would not have the support of the metropolitan police service . "
the government 's independent reviewer of terrorism legislation , lord carlile said the issue was not simply about the number of days someone should be detained .
" my view is that people should not be detained a day longer than necessary or a day shorter than necessary in the interests of justice , " he said .
" the cases should be considered by senior judges on an evidence basis .
it would strengthen the rights of those detained with a higher level of judges and subject to appeal . "
and extending the detention period without trial was rejected by the shadow home secretary , david davis .
have your say we will set a dangerous presipice if we let the government detain its citizens , without charge , for as long as it wishes neil , preston , uk send us your comments " all the evidence shows that when the police tried to claim the need for 90-day detention without charge they were wrong and parliament 's decision on 28 days was right , " said mr davis .
" since the 28-day limit was introduced neither the police or security services have produced one shred of evidence to demonstrate the need for extension , either in public or in confidential briefings , " said mr davis .
liberal democrat mp , evan harris , also condemned the calls for such an extension .
" the police have not provided evidence from their experience of recent investigations that the current 28-day limit - already one of the longest for a democracy - is not sufficient to collect evidence to bring charges , " said dr harris .
the government has tried to raise the limit a suspect can be held without charge to 90 days .
but mps have consistently rejected that proposal - handing former prime minister tony blair his first defeat in the commons , in 2005 .

" we are not arguing for some kind of guantanamo nonsense for the uk , " said ken jones , head of the association of chief police officers -lrb- acpo -rrb- .
mr jones said the police needed more flexibility over the current limit of 28 days without charge .
shami chakrabarti , of campaign group liberty , attacked the police proposal .
" we elect politicians to determine legislation and we expect chief constables to uphold the rule of law , not campaign for internment , " said ms chakrabarti , director of liberty .
' against the buffers ' the head of the senior police officers ' organisation had warned in a newspaper interview that terror investigations were " up against the buffers on the 28-day limit " - and that suspects should be held for " as long as it takes " .
since the 28-day limit was introduced neither the police or security services have produced one shred of evidence to demonstrate the need for extension david davis , shadow home secretary but facing criticism over such an open-ended form of detention , mr jones sought to clarify what flexibility the police needed in such cases .
" we do not want internment .
that would be crazy . "
" it needs to be as long as is proportionate and necessary , subjected to sufficient judicial checks and balances , " mr jones told the bbc .
" but i can tell you now , acpo is not calling for indeterminate detention . "
the metropolitan police distanced themselves from any calls for indefinite detention .
" any such proposal would not have the support of the metropolitan police service . "
the government 's independent reviewer of terrorism legislation , lord carlile said the issue was not simply about the number of days someone should be detained .
" my view is that people should not be detained a day longer than necessary or a day shorter than necessary in the interests of justice , " he said .
" the cases should be considered by senior judges on an evidence basis .
it would strengthen the rights of those detained with a higher level of judges and subject to appeal . "
and extending the detention period without trial was rejected by the shadow home secretary , david davis .
have your say we will set a dangerous presipice if we let the government detain its citizens , without charge , for as long as it wishes neil , preston , uk send us your comments " all the evidence shows that when the police tried to claim the need for 90-day detention without charge they were wrong and parliament 's decision on 28 days was right , " said mr davis .
" since the 28-day limit was introduced neither the police or security services have produced one shred of evidence to demonstrate the need for extension , either in public or in confidential briefings , " said mr davis .
liberal democrat mp , evan harris , also condemned the calls for such an extension .
" the police have not provided evidence from their experience of recent investigations that the current 28-day limit - already one of the longest for a democracy - is not sufficient to collect evidence to bring charges , " said dr harris .
the government has tried to raise the limit a suspect can be held without charge to 90 days .
but mps have consistently rejected that proposal - handing former prime minister tony blair his first defeat in the commons , in 2005 .

the retailers ' comments came after a guardian investigation claimed that workers making clothes were paid as little as four pence an hour .
tesco said it had done all it could to ensure " high standards and good conditions " in the country .
asda said any abuse was " unacceptable " and it may audit its factories .
difficult conditions in its report , the guardian claims that garment workers are regularly forced to work 80 hours a week in factories where conditions are often violent , and where staff do not have access to trade unions .
allegations of abuse of workers in south asia 's textile industry are nothing new .
we have done all we can to ensure that high standards and good conditions are maintained tesco charities such as war on want have campaigned for years to improve the pay and conditions for garment workers in bangladesh and last year wrote a report based on interviews with 60 workers from six garment factories .
the group claimed that retailers could only sell their clothes at very low prices by pressuring suppliers in developing economies to keep costs down .
as a result , suppliers in countries such as bangladesh have had to drive down wages and extend working hours , as there is stiff competition for the retailers ' business from other developing nations such as china . .
outsourcing problems asda told the guardian that : " we find abuse of any kind unacceptable . "
the retailer blamed the problem on the fact that one of their approved suppliers was outsourcing its work to another factory without its knowledge and against its wishes .
tesco said it had taken steps to improve working conditions .
" we have stuck by bangladesh , continued to invest in modern factories and done all we can to ensure that high standards and good conditions are maintained , " the uk 's largest supermarket firm said in a statement .
the company added that in many ways it would be easier for them to stop sourcing garments " in countries that have economic and social problems which are beyond the capabilities of any organisation working alone to fix " .

tesco said it had done all it could to ensure " high standards and good conditions " in the country .
asda said any abuse was " unacceptable " and it may audit its factories .
difficult conditions in its report , the guardian claims that garment workers are regularly forced to work 80 hours a week in factories where conditions are often violent , and where staff do not have access to trade unions .

a convoy of cars snakes its way through a wheat field .
crammed inside are hundreds of mourners heading for the wake of the latest person to die in more than 20 years of conflict .
pro-kurdish politicians are launching a new peaceful offensive at the end of the dusty track , a group of wailing women greet the cars .
some wave photographs of the dead girl .
she is dressed in military fatigues .
rojda died fighting for the kurdish separatist group pkk .
to the turkish state she was a terrorist .
but the turkish kurds at her wake hailed her as a martyr .
" she went to fight against the enemy and against oppression , " rojda 's sister says .
" she could n't take it any more . "
turkey has been fighting the separatist pkk in the south-east since 1984 .
the fighting subsided when its founder abdullah ocalan was captured 15 years later but has flared-up again recently with renewed force .
revenge more than 60 soldiers have died so far this year and turkey insists it will carry on fighting until the last separatist is killed .
there seems little sign of that happening soon .
the military says there are still around 2,000 pkk fighters in turkey alone , and as many as 3,000 more based across the border in northern iraq .
" after so many years of conflict , every kurd here knows someone who has died or is up fighting in the mountains , " one local man told me , observing the wake from the sidelines .
gunduz aktan said kurdish candidates are just a front " every time one pkk fighter is killed , another takes up a gun and goes to fight .
the families of turkish soldiers want revenge too .
it ca n't go on like this . "
so pro-kurdish politicians are launching a peaceful offensive .
they are out coaxing people to look to them for answers , not to the gun .
in the next town of idil , a group of men crowd around hasip kaplan on a cobble-stoned side-street .
he is one of several dozen pro-kurdish candidates campaigning for seat in the next parliament .
they are demanding recognition and rights as ethnic kurds , but want to prove that this does not make them separatists .
for many years even the term " kurd " was banned here .
there have been unprecedented reforms and improvement in recent years - but that mentality still lingers .
regular clashes at the last election hasip kaplan 's party won almost 50 % of the vote in the south-east where ethnic kurds are in the majority .
but the party could never attract enough support nationally to pass the high threshold to enter parliament .
so this time kaplan and his colleagues will stand as independents - a strategic move they hope could win them as many as 30 seats .
hasip kaplan 's party is unlikely to enter parliament " the kurdish problem has always been treated as a security issue and handed to the military , " hasip kaplan says , fiddling with a string of worry-beads .
" the kurds are still discriminated against here because of their language and their race .
the problem is social , political and psychological .
it has to be addressed in parliament . "
but that view finds little support outside the region .
since spring there have been regular clashes between the pkk and turkish troops in the mountains close to idil .
earlier this year 10 people were killed in ankara in a suicide bomb attack blamed on the pkk .
frustrated , the military is now calling for a major operation into northern iraq to target the kurdish fighters it says are based there .
unitary state it is hardly an atmosphere conducive to dialogue .
instead , it is handing votes to turkish nationalists , who have made security a major campaign issue .
have your say the only promise of opposition parties seems to be staunchly secular politics ipek ruacan , ankara , turkey send us your comments more than 1,000km -lrb- 621 miles -rrb- from idil , a local istanbul office of the nationalist mhp is draped in red and white national flags .
supporters of the party are deeply suspicious of anyone who insists upon an individual kurdish identity , and talks of kurdish rights .
" turkey was founded as a unitary state and you can not change that .
we have invested in this state materially and emotionally , " says gunduz aktan , former ambassador turned mhp candidate for parliament .
" the kurdish candidates are just a front organisation .
the pkk murdered many innocent civilians .
i do n't want to sit under the roof of parliament with those who support terror . "
but that is what he may soon have to get used to .
pro-kurdish politicians will not condemn the pkk , and with support from the south-east , they are likely to make it into parliament .
it may be an opportunity to talk peace .
but it will not be easy .

so pro-kurdish politicians are launching a peaceful offensive .
they are out coaxing people to look to them for answers , not to the gun .
in the next town of idil , a group of men crowd around hasip kaplan on a cobble-stoned side-street .
he is one of several dozen pro-kurdish candidates campaigning for seat in the next parliament .
they are demanding recognition and rights as ethnic kurds , but want to prove that this does not make them separatists .
for many years even the term " kurd " was banned here .
there have been unprecedented reforms and improvement in recent years - but that mentality still lingers .
regular clashes at the last election hasip kaplan 's party won almost 50 % of the vote in the south-east where ethnic kurds are in the majority .
but the party could never attract enough support nationally to pass the high threshold to enter parliament .
so this time kaplan and his colleagues will stand as independents - a strategic move they hope could win them as many as 30 seats .
hasip kaplan 's party is unlikely to enter parliament " the kurdish problem has always been treated as a security issue and handed to the military , " hasip kaplan says , fiddling with a string of worry-beads .
" the kurds are still discriminated against here because of their language and their race .
the problem is social , political and psychological .
it has to be addressed in parliament . "
but that view finds little support outside the region .
since spring there have been regular clashes between the pkk and turkish troops in the mountains close to idil .
earlier this year 10 people were killed in ankara in a suicide bomb attack blamed on the pkk .
frustrated , the military is now calling for a major operation into northern iraq to target the kurdish fighters it says are based there .
unitary state it is hardly an atmosphere conducive to dialogue .
instead , it is handing votes to turkish nationalists , who have made security a major campaign issue .
have your say the only promise of opposition parties seems to be staunchly secular politics ipek ruacan , ankara , turkey send us your comments more than 1,000km -lrb- 621 miles -rrb- from idil , a local istanbul office of the nationalist mhp is draped in red and white national flags .
supporters of the party are deeply suspicious of anyone who insists upon an individual kurdish identity , and talks of kurdish rights .
" turkey was founded as a unitary state and you can not change that .
we have invested in this state materially and emotionally , " says gunduz aktan , former ambassador turned mhp candidate for parliament .
" the kurdish candidates are just a front organisation .
the pkk murdered many innocent civilians .
i do n't want to sit under the roof of parliament with those who support terror . "
but that is what he may soon have to get used to .
pro-kurdish politicians will not condemn the pkk , and with support from the south-east , they are likely to make it into parliament .
it may be an opportunity to talk peace .
but it will not be easy .

she said : ' oh , there is this great book called harry potter , ' but i said i did n't want to read about a boy with glasses ...
i just thought it sounded silly .

she read me a chapter when i was in bed , and i took it from her because i loved it so much .
tintin went on the bottom shelf .
i love harry potter because it 's fantasy .

i was eight and stuck in a phase of reading tintin books , but my mam wanted me to read something else that did n't have pictures .
she said : ' oh , there is this great book called harry potter , ' but i said i did n't want to read about a boy with glasses ...
i just thought it sounded silly .
but she forced me to read the philosopher 's stone .
she read me a chapter when i was in bed , and i took it from her because i loved it so much .
tintin went on the bottom shelf .
i love harry potter because it 's fantasy .
it 's like in our world but somewhere else , so you can escape from all the boring stuff of this world that you do n't want to know about .
but also harry is very normal , as are all of the characters .
they are just people who have talents .
i 've read each of the books loads of times evanna lynch i 'm dreading deathly hallows being the last book .
i do wish it could go on .
but then again this makes it special .
i like it that we are having a very special period with the harry potter era .
i 've read each of the books loads of times .
i like going back to them if feel like i want to read a certain chapter .
my favourite book has to be order of the phoenix , not because i 'm in the film - but i suppose that helps !
it 's the spirit of fighting back and getting ready for voldemort that i like .
in the sixth one , everything changes - and i love that one too - but it feels like everyone is dying all of the time , while in order of the phoenix everyone is confident they are going to win .
when book six came out , i queued up from 12 midday to midnight , which is not very long by most harry potter fans .
i was there by myself and i had stuff written all over my face and arms like ' i love harry potter ' .
it was great .
helpline come to a bookshop on the 21 july and you will see another side of me .
i will be jumping about !
it is the most exciting thing that will happen all year .
the film premiere will be great too , but this is the end of the series , it is the end of harry , it is the end of a lot of people 's lives .
there will be tears , waterstone 's are setting up a helpline for addicts !

it occupies all his business and personal time and keeps him so busy that he struggles to keep up with the constant messages , blog posts and photos .
so busy , in fact , that he now pays someone to be him online .
meet thomas power .
i knew he existed after a friend told me about a man who employed an " online presence " but i did not know his name .
but then mr power got in touch - via facebook - and confirmed that it was he who had hired what he called a " ghost blogger " .
he and his wife started an early social network for business people , ecademy , and he now spends all of his time networking , online and in the real world .
" people expect me to have a profile on all the social networks - facebook , myspace , linkedin , " he explains .
" i 've got 12,000 connections on linkedin , 8,000 on ecademy and now 500 on facebook .
" i get up to 500 messages a day on the networks - and that 's before my e-mail .
it is very time-consuming , so i have to outsource it . "
" it 's no different from a chief executive having a pr person writing their speeches " thomas power so who is doing the work ?
several people , including david petherick .
he 's employed by thomas power , and others willing to pay for him to maintain their online presence .
he may well be the first of a new profession - a cyberspace concierge , perhaps , or a blog butler ?
" i prefer to call myself a digital biographer , " says mr petherick .
much of his work involves refining his clients ' profiles on the various networks .
" everyone has a story to tell , but most ca n't view themselves objectively , " he explains .
his clients are realising that social networking is valuable to their businesses , and that projecting their own personalities can help .
mr petherick says : " if they 're running a small firm , they think everyone will be interested in the details of that - but it 's the personal stuff that matters .
people are interested in people . "
but surely the whole point of networks like facebook is having a connection with a real person - not their " digital biographer " or " ghost blogger " ? "
i 'll get a text message in the morning saying ' blog this " ' digital biographer david petherick thomas power says much of his online presence is the real him - but his helpers know how he thinks .
he says : " they know who i am , they are me .
in any case , it 's no different from a chief executive having a pr person writing their speeches . "
david petherick charges £ 369 just to carry out what he calls a " profile makeover " but there is no shortage of demand .
he also has clients who ask him to blog for them on a regular basis .
" i 'll get a text message in the morning saying " blog this " , then i 'll do some research and craft some words for them . "
so what sort of skills does a digital biographer need ?
" you need to be able to write and also do the technical stuff , " says mr petherick .
" i can craft a sentence but i also understand html and flash . "
social networking is spreading out of schools and colleges into companies , big and small , and as that happens the boundary between the personal and the professional is being blurred .
as a result , there could be plenty of work servicing the needs of people who want to be a face on facebook but just do not have the time .

it occupies all his business and personal time and keeps him so busy that he struggles to keep up with the constant messages , blog posts and photos .
so busy , in fact , that he now pays someone to be him online .
meet thomas power .
i knew he existed after a friend told me about a man who employed an " online presence " but i did not know his name .
but then mr power got in touch - via facebook - and confirmed that it was he who had hired what he called a " ghost blogger " .
he and his wife started an early social network for business people , ecademy , and he now spends all of his time networking , online and in the real world .
" people expect me to have a profile on all the social networks - facebook , myspace , linkedin , " he explains .
" i 've got 12,000 connections on linkedin , 8,000 on ecademy and now 500 on facebook .
" i get up to 500 messages a day on the networks - and that 's before my e-mail .
it is very time-consuming , so i have to outsource it . "
it 's no different from a chief executive having a pr person writing their speeches thomas power so who is doing the work ?
several people , including david petherick .
he 's employed by thomas power , and others willing to pay for him to maintain their online presence .
he may well be the first of a new profession - a cyberspace concierge , perhaps , or a blog butler ?
" i prefer to call myself a digital biographer , " says mr petherick .
much of his work involves refining his clients ' profiles on the various networks .
" everyone has a story to tell , but most ca n't view themselves objectively , " he explains .
his clients are realising that social networking is valuable to their businesses , and that projecting their own personalities can help .
mr petherick says : " if they 're running a small firm , they think everyone will be interested in the details of that - but it 's the personal stuff that matters .
people are interested in people . "
but surely the whole point of networks like facebook is having a connection with a real person - not their " digital biographer " or " ghost blogger " ?
i 'll get a text message in the morning saying ' blog this ' digital biographer david petherick thomas power says much of his online presence is the real him - but his helpers know how he thinks .
he says : " they know who i am , they are me .
in any case , it 's no different from a chief executive having a pr person writing their speeches . "
david petherick charges £ 369 just to carry out what he calls a " profile makeover " but there is no shortage of demand .
he also has clients who ask him to blog for them on a regular basis .
" i 'll get a text message in the morning saying " blog this " , then i 'll do some research and craft some words for them . "
so what sort of skills does a digital biographer need ?
" you need to be able to write and also do the technical stuff , " says mr petherick .
" i can craft a sentence but i also understand html and flash . "
social networking is spreading out of schools and colleges into companies , big and small , and as that happens the boundary between the personal and the professional is being blurred .
