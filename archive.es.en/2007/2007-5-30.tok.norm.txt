laurens dillich , the head of public service broadcaster bnn , told public radio : " the chances of the candidates obtaining a kidney are 33 percent , far better than for those on organ waiting lists .
you would imagine that -lrb- waiting times -rrb- have improved , but they are getting longer . "
bnn , a channel aimed at young people , is screening the show on the fifth anniversary of the death of its founder , bart de graaff .
he died after waiting seven years for a kidney donation .
international criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bart de graaff , in 1999 the project has prompted condemnation across the netherlands and beyond .
in brussels , a spokesman for the european commission - which on wednesday presented an action plan to reduce organ donor waiting lists - said it was in " pretty bad taste . "
the dutch kidney foundation welcomed the attention bnn had brought on the subject , but noted that " their way of doing it is not ours , and it will bring no practical solution . "
" i 'm afraid it 's primarily about the shock effect which has characterized the channel bnn since … the mid-90s , " media analyst jo groebel told dw-radio .
" i 'm afraid that … the whole debate is just increasing the market value and the market success of such a program , and this is what makes it extremely cynical - that the discussion itself adds to the program .
this is not the first time bnn has courted controversy .
previous broadcasts include " sex , a user 's guide , " a series of no-holds-barred education programs , and " shoot up and swallow , " a series dedicated to sex and drugs .
" the big donorshow " was dreamt up by endemol , the dutch production company behind " big brother " and other reality television shows .
it focuses on lisa , a 37-year-old woman dying of a brain tumor .
she must decide which of three patients selected by the producers should receive her kidney .
viewers can offer their opinions by sms text message .
lawmakers want ban on tuesday , the show was brought up in dutch parliament , where lawmakers agreed on the need to highlight the shortage of organ donors but were divided on whether reality television was the best way to do it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's organ donor card some lawmakers called on the ministers for health and media to take the program off air .
the two cabinet members had already made clear they did not have the authority to ban the program .
in the netherlands , organ transplants are subject to strict laws , which prohibit donors from choosing who will receive their organs after their death .
however , an exemption is made in the case of kidney transplants , which can be carried out while the donor is still alive , allowing the donor to choose the beneficiary if there is some link between the two people .
after an eu-wide survey showed that while 81 percent of european citizens support the use of organ donor cards , only 12 percent have one , the european commission proposed its action plan , which includes introducing an eu-wide donor card and creating organ transplant coordinators in hospitals .
the eu executive arm is hopeful that european legislation on common standards for the quality and safety of organ donation will be introduced next year when its proposals are developed . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " there is no cohesion of tv writing staff in germany " german tv networks are taking their cues state-side in a bid to create better drama series .

" that means not only informing the members of these organizations about one 's own plans but also entertaining a willingness to abandon them if necessary , " he wrote .
beck pointed out that the plans to station the defense system in poland and the czech republic had inflicted " great harm " on relations between russia and the united states and europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck he also called for a new round of global disarmament : " disarmament policy must ... be urgently re-established as a key regulatory principle in international relations , " he wrote .
" major international disarmament regimes are already in shreds or have been completely destroyed . "
money better spent elsewhere ?
beck stressed the importance of close ties between the us and germany , but also used the opportunity to point out that washington had already sunk more than $ 100 billion in developing the shield , which may not even work .
that money could have been spent differently and " achieved more for the security of the united states , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to install part of the defense system in bohemia as head of the spd , which is part of christian democrat angela merkel 's government coalition , beck is the party 's most likely candidate for chancellor in 2009 .
in the past , he has been openly critical of us plans for the defense system meant to block attacks from hostile countries , warning in march that it could spark a new arms race .
those comments led to tensions within germany 's governing coalition as his column on tuesday was also likely to do .
chancellor merkel has been muted about the defense shield plans , only saying there should be a debate on the missile shield within nato and that the eu should " present a common front " on it . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin lashes out at us , eu as russia tests missile russian president putin warned tuesday that a planned us missile defense shield would make europe a " powder keg " and lashed out at his eu critics .

the number of officers , which include the some 40 german representatives already there , is to be expanded to around 160 over the course of the mission .
a burgeoning drug trade , widespread corruption and insurgent violence are among the challenges the local police are preparing for .
mission includes southern regions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currently over 40 german police officers are working with 3,500 afghan trainees the mission 's main objective is " to improve cohesion and coordination -lrb- of afghan police -rrb- through mentoring , monitoring , advising and training , " said brigadier general friedrich eichele , the german mission commander who will head the eu task force .
police trainers would be armed for purposes of self-defence , but would have to rely on the nato-led isaf peacekeeping force for protection , said eichele , who added that the running costs for the first year would amount to 43.6 million euros -lrb- $ 58.8 million -rrb- .
dubbed eupol , the german-run mission will be headquartered in the capital city of kabul but will encompass regions throughout afghanistan including southern provinces where insurgent fighting has been most intense , said eu special representative for afghanistan francesc vendrell tuesday from brussels .
recent civilian deaths in the region have sparked concerns that the local population has lost faith in the international peacekeeping force . a minimum contribution for vendrell , the project does n't go far enough .
" i think that the eu has decided to play as big a role as possible , unfortunately not as big as i would have liked , " added vendrell , who said he would have like to have seen it at the same size as the mission in kosovo .
the eu is planning to send 1,500 police trainers if the breakaway serb province wins independence .
drugs and corruption fuelling insurgency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un estimated that poppy cultivation in 2006 increased by 59 percent over 2005 late last year , nato requested that the eu take charge of building up the police training project .
analysts have said that rampant drug trade and corruption are fuelling the insurgency .
according to un estimates , some 300 illegal armed groups exist in the country .
the us has also put pressure on the eu to speed up progress .
until now , germany has been the main european country involved in police training in afghanistan and has trained some 17,000 local law enforcement officers since 2002 .
an existing us police mission in afghanistan involves 500 trainers , including members of private security companies .
eupol is meant to complement the american force .
the war-torn country currently has a police force of 60,000 , which is ill-equipped and riddled by corruption .
according to international estimates , some 82,000 officers are needed .
the number of afghan officers trained by the european team would depend on the security situation , said officials . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans divided on how to honor fallen soldiers less than a week after three german soldiers were killed in afghanistan , debate is heating up over a monument to honor the country 's post-world war ii armed forces members who died while on duty at home and abroad .

us secretary of state condoleezza rice , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and russian foreign minister sergei lavrov will attend the meeting of the quartet , which comprises the united states , the un , the eu and russia .
the potsdam meeting was aimed at preparing the summit of leaders of the group of eight most industrialized nations in heiligendamm , northeast germany , june 6-8 .
the ministers were tackling a range of international crises including the iranian and north korean nuclear programs , afghanistan and kosovo .
but japan poured cold water on one of the issues germany had placed at the top of its priority list for the summit - a binding agreement on reducing greenhouse gases .
divisions over climate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state rice -lrb- l -rrb- was also in potsdam foreign ministry spokesman mitsuo sakaba said german proposals to complete negotiations on a successor to the kyoto protocol on greenhouse gases by 2009 were " premature . "
japan has been leading efforts among asian nations to limit global warming .
it said it believed major emitters of greenhouse gases such as the united states , china and india should agree to join the process before any timetable was put in place .
" until we know if they will join us , it is premature , " sakaba said .
germany took advantage of the presence of rice and lavrov to hastily convene the middle east quartet , the body which drew up the stalled roadmap for peace .
however , faced with the bloodiest internal clashes in lebanon for decades and the firing of palestinian rockets into israel and israeli airstrikes in gaza , expectations for the meeting were low .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive security at the g8 heiligendamm location in potsdam , the minister said they were troubled by the situation in the region and called on the palestinian government to put an end to internal strife and missile attacks against israel , a german delegation source said .
" the spiral of violence must be stopped , " steinmeier told his fellow ministers , the source said .
there was broad agreement that the international community needed to encourage talks between israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmoud abbas .
they urged the palestinian authority to fulfill the demands of the middle east quartet including renouncing violence , recognizing israel and respecting previous agreements with the jewish state .
and they called on israel to unfreeze palestinian tax revenue and customs duties .
kosovo on the agenda the future status of kosovo , an issue that bitterly divides russia and the west , was also on the table in potsdam .
russia rejects proposals by chief un negotiator martti ahtisaari to grant kosovo internationally supervised independence from serbia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some criticize the world 's poorest get lost in the g8 shuffle steinmeier said he expected a clash over the province at the meeting .
" we are going to have a discussion on kosovo that will not be easy , " he said .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner , the un representative for kosovo from 1999-2001 , said the issue was " very difficult . "
russian foreign foreign minister sergei lavrov told reporters he wanted " justice " for kosovo .
the ministers also addressed the situation in strife-torn afghanistan .
afghan foreign minister rangeen dadfar spanta and his pakistani counterpart khurshid kasuri were attending the potsdam talks as part of a german-brokered initiative to resolve a dispute about their joint border .
afghanistan and pakistan have been trading recriminations about growing violence linked to taliban extremists on either side of the border .
steinmeier said cooperation between the neighbors was crucial to regional stability .

us secretary of state condoleezza rice , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and russian foreign minister sergei lavrov will attend the meeting of the quartet , which comprises the united states , the un , the eu and russia .
the potsdam meeting was aimed at preparing the summit of leaders of the group of eight most industrialized nations in heiligendamm , northeast germany , june 6-8 .
the ministers were tackling a range of international crises including the iranian and north korean nuclear programs , afghanistan and kosovo .
but japan poured cold water on one of the issues germany had placed at the top of its priority list for the summit - a binding agreement on reducing greenhouse gases .
divisions over climate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state rice -lrb- l -rrb- was also in potsdam foreign ministry spokesman mitsuo sakaba said german proposals to complete negotiations on a successor to the kyoto protocol on greenhouse gases by 2009 were " premature . "
japan has been leading efforts among asian nations to limit global warming .
it said it believed major emitters of greenhouse gases such as the united states , china and india should agree to join the process before any timetable was put in place .
" until we know if they will join us , it is premature , " sakaba said .
germany took advantage of the presence of rice and lavrov to hastily convene the middle east quartet , the body which drew up the stalled roadmap for peace .
however , faced with the bloodiest internal clashes in lebanon for decades and the firing of palestinian rockets into israel and israeli airstrikes in gaza , expectations for the meeting were low .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive security at the g8 heiligendamm location in potsdam , the minister said they were troubled by the situation in the region and called on the palestinian government to put an end to internal strife and missile attacks against israel , a german delegation source said .
" the spiral of violence must be stopped , " steinmeier told his fellow ministers , the source said .
there was broad agreement that the international community needed to encourage talks between israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmoud abbas .
they urged the palestinian authority to fulfill the demands of the middle east quartet including renouncing violence , recognizing israel and respecting previous agreements with the jewish state .
and they called on israel to unfreeze palestinian tax revenue and customs duties .
kosovo on the agenda the future status of kosovo , an issue that bitterly divides russia and the west , was also on the table in potsdam .
russia rejects proposals by chief un negotiator martti ahtisaari to grant kosovo internationally supervised independence from serbia .

" we are going to have a discussion on kosovo that will not be easy , " he said .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner , the un representative for kosovo from 1999-2001 , said the issue was " very difficult . "
russian foreign foreign minister sergei lavrov told reporters he wanted " justice " for kosovo .
the ministers also addressed the situation in strife-torn afghanistan .
afghan foreign minister rangeen dadfar spanta and his pakistani counterpart khurshid kasuri were attending the potsdam talks as part of a german-brokered initiative to resolve a dispute about their joint border .
afghanistan and pakistan have been trading recriminations about growing violence linked to taliban extremists on either side of the border .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 30.05.2007 " the possibility of an eu-iran agreement is small " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is iran asking for too much in return for reducing its support of insurgents in iraq ?
iran expert alex bigham spoke with dw-world.de about thursday 's meeting between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iranian nuclear negotiator ali larijani .
iran wants proliferation and recognition , he said . dw-world.de : mr. bigham , what is your assessment of monday 's meeting in baghdad between the us and iranian ambassadors to iraq ?
alex bigham : i certainly think the talks are a positive sign , and this may be a tentative start of a period of cooling off in relations .
there has been an indication from the iranians of a willingness to meet in a month 's time , which is a welcome sign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana -lrb- left -rrb- and larijani at a meeting in berlin last september the talks are limited of course , really to one issue : iraq .
there are obvious reasons why america would want to seek iranian help in iraq - in order to improve stability in the country and to reduce the flow of funds and arms to insurgents who are attacking coalition forces .
the difficult question is why iran would want to assist coalition forces .
there will no doubt be elements in iran who want the americans to remain bogged down in iraq because they see that as a buffer to a possible attack on iran .
but it seems that those advocating dialogue both in washington and tehran are winning the argument for the moment .
they want to see stability on iran 's border with iraq , an area which has suffered from terrorist acts against the iranian government .
it 's certainly in iran 's long term self-interest to improve security and stability in iraq . iran 's nuclear program had not been on the agenda .
are you nevertheless surprised that the issue did not arise ? i am not surprised it was n't discussed .
neither side wants to be seen to be compromising on the nuclear issue at this stage , given domestic pressures in both iran and america .
the us does n't want to replicate or divert attention from the iaea , un and eu structures .

although the baghdad talks may help as a confidence-building measure , which is welcome , necessary , and frankly overdue , both the eu and iran are seeing the discussions on iran 's nuclear program as a separate issue from the future of iraq . what approach do you expect solana to take ? solana 's approach is not to engage in a negotiation directly about the nuclear issue , but to try to get an agreement to have a negotiation which would involve the p5 + 1 -lrb- editor 's note : the five per manent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the us - plus germany -rrb- .
however , the sticking point is the precondition the us has set that iran suspends uranium enrichment before negotiations .
the iranians have repeatedly ruled out the possibility of talks with any preconditions . what do you expect to come out of the talks ? there does n't seem to have been a fundamental shift in either side 's position , so the possibility of an agreement is small .
the difficulty in separating the issues of iraq and the nuclear program is that iran seems to want two things in return for reducing its support for insurgents in iraq : proliferation and recognition of its regional role .

the main barriers to progress are the relative intransigency of both the iranian and the american position on the nuclear issue .
another problem is the internal divisions within iran .
larijani is clearly a growing political player in tehran for the moment , but it is the supreme leader , khamenei who will make the final decision on iran 's security and foreign policy .
ayatollah khamenei is reluctant to make a final decision on the nuclear issues for fear of alienating one of the factions in iranian politics and undermining his own position .

iran expert alex bigham spoke with dw-world.de about thursday 's meeting between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iranian nuclear negotiator ali larijani .
iran wants proliferation and recognition , he said . dw-world.de : mr. bigham , what is your assessment of monday 's meeting in baghdad between the us and iranian ambassadors to iraq ?
alex bigham : i certainly think the talks are a positive sign , and this may be a tentative start of a period of cooling off in relations .
there has been an indication from the iranians of a willingness to meet in a month 's time , which is a welcome sign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana -lrb- left -rrb- and larijani at a meeting in berlin last september the talks are limited of course , really to one issue : iraq .
there are obvious reasons why america would want to seek iranian help in iraq - in order to improve stability in the country and to reduce the flow of funds and arms to insurgents who are attacking coalition forces .
the difficult question is why iran would want to assist coalition forces .
there will no doubt be elements in iran who want the americans to remain bogged down in iraq because they see that as a buffer to a possible attack on iran .
but it seems that those advocating dialogue both in washington and tehran are winning the argument for the moment .
they want to see stability on iran 's border with iraq , an area which has suffered from terrorist acts against the iranian government .
it 's certainly in iran 's long term self-interest to improve security and stability in iraq . iran 's nuclear program had not been on the agenda .

iran expert alex bigham spoke with dw-world.de about thursday 's meeting between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iranian nuclear negotiator ali larijani .
iran wants proliferation and recognition , he said . dw-world.de : mr. bigham , what is your assessment of monday 's meeting in baghdad between the us and iranian ambassadors to iraq ?
alex bigham : i certainly think the talks are a positive sign , and this may be a tentative start of a period of cooling off in relations .
there has been an indication from the iranians of a willingness to meet in a month 's time , which is a welcome sign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana -lrb- left -rrb- and larijani at a meeting in berlin last september the talks are limited of course , really to one issue : iraq .
there are obvious reasons why america would want to seek iranian help in iraq - in order to improve stability in the country and to reduce the flow of funds and arms to insurgents who are attacking coalition forces .
the difficult question is why iran would want to assist coalition forces .
there will no doubt be elements in iran who want the americans to remain bogged down in iraq because they see that as a buffer to a possible attack on iran .
but it seems that those advocating dialogue both in washington and tehran are winning the argument for the moment .
they want to see stability on iran 's border with iraq , an area which has suffered from terrorist acts against the iranian government .
it 's certainly in iran 's long term self-interest to improve security and stability in iraq . iran 's nuclear program had not been on the agenda .
are you nevertheless surprised that the issue did not arise ? i am not surprised it was n't discussed .
neither side wants to be seen to be compromising on the nuclear issue at this stage , given domestic pressures in both iran and america .
the us does n't want to replicate or divert attention from the iaea , un and eu structures .
they deliberately want this to be seen as a disagreement between iran and the international community , not between iran and america . will monday 's talks have an impact on javier solana 's meeting with the iranian nuclear negotiator ali larijani on thursday ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intransigency on both sides blocks europe 's negotiations , said bigham the baghdad talks may offer some kind of reassurance to the iranian government in terms of the likelihood of military action , but there will need to be concrete results in order for the americans to be convinced of progress .
although the baghdad talks may help as a confidence-building measure , which is welcome , necessary , and frankly overdue , both the eu and iran are seeing the discussions on iran 's nuclear program as a separate issue from the future of iraq . what approach do you expect solana to take ? solana 's approach is not to engage in a negotiation directly about the nuclear issue , but to try to get an agreement to have a negotiation which would involve the p5 + 1 -lrb- editor 's note : the five per manent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the us - plus germany -rrb- .
however , the sticking point is the precondition the us has set that iran suspends uranium enrichment before negotiations .
the iranians have repeatedly ruled out the possibility of talks with any preconditions . what do you expect to come out of the talks ? there does n't seem to have been a fundamental shift in either side 's position , so the possibility of an agreement is small .
the difficulty in separating the issues of iraq and the nuclear program is that iran seems to want two things in return for reducing its support for insurgents in iraq : proliferation and recognition of its regional role .
these are effectively red lines for the americans , which make overcoming the stalemate a difficult , long term process . do you agree with the eu 's policy towards iran ?
what should the eu be doing differently ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayatollah khamenei is the main decision-maker on iran 's foreign and security policies the eu has made a great deal of effort to negotiate to iran .
the main barriers to progress are the relative intransigency of both the iranian and the american position on the nuclear issue .
another problem is the internal divisions within iran .
larijani is clearly a growing political player in tehran for the moment , but it is the supreme leader , khamenei who will make the final decision on iran 's security and foreign policy .
ayatollah khamenei is reluctant to make a final decision on the nuclear issues for fear of alienating one of the factions in iranian politics and undermining his own position .
one option that needs renewed consideration is el baradei 's proposal of a mutual " time-out " - iran suspending enrichment while the un suspends sanctions .
that is one option that should at least be put on the table .

forgeard , former joint chief executive at eads which owns airbus , told the magazine le point : " airbus did not report any unrecoverable delay before the middle of april 2006 , and at that time the financial consequences were very limited . "
he repeated that he had " respected all of the rules -lrb- at eads -rrb- which are among the most restrictive among companies quoted on the cac 40 index . "
the controversy and criticism of a big severance payment to forgeard are hot issues in france particularly , where the new government under president nicolas sarkozy has signaled it will act to curb so-called " golden handshakes . "
insider trading ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's forgeard was co-chair of eads from june 2005 - june 2006 forgeard and many other senior managers sold stock options in march last year , three months before the european aeronautics defence and space company and airbus announced serious delays in production of the a380 superjumbo airliner .
two big shareholders in eads , daimlerchrysler in germany and lagardere group in france each decided on march 20 to sell stakes of 7.5 percent .
the group had said in 2005 that there were some problems with production and that it was investigating the extent of these .
but the announcement in june 2006 of deep problems came as a shock to the stock market and the price of shares in eads fell heavily .
the problems rapidly developed into a long crisis with changes in top management and a rescue plan involving the loss of 10,000 jobs , although this remains clouded in some uncertainty .
there is also a prospect that eads will have to raise new capital .
forgeard is the target of suspicions , renewed in allegations in a press report on tuesday , that he was aware of the impact of production problems on the group when he decided to exercise stock options .
blames german managers the use of such privileged information , which has not been communicated publicly to market authorities , is known as insider trading and is illegal because it privileges one investor over another , distorts the equitable availability of information and therefore undermines confidence in a stock market .
stock market rules require managers to inform the market quickly if they become aware of a sudden and significant change in their company 's prospects .
forgeard also argued that during his period in various top positions at airbus , the company had become " a world leader , " and that despite the planned loss of 10,000 jobs , " the balance over eight years is positive to the extent of tens of thousands of jobs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delays have plagued the a380 superjumbo he also blamed a large part of the production problems on the attitude of top managers in germany where much of the work on airbus airliners is carried out , saying they wanted to continue doing things their way while he wanted to a single , overall method of working .
this was a reference to revelations that software used for installing cabling systems in hamburg , germany , was not compatible with design software at airbus headquarters in toulouse , france .
problems in adapting complex cabling to the requirements of individual airlines were at the center of the delays to production .
forgeard also launched a personal attack on his co-chair at the time , germany 's thomas enders .
" i ask myself whether he had n't been commissioned by daimler boss jürgen schrempp to neutralize or even get rid of me , " the former manager said .
qatar stays loyal the head of lagardere group , and joint co-chairman of eads , arnaud lagardere was questioned at length on tuesday by stock market regulators probing suspicions that there had been insider trading in eads stock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus planes are european co-productions both forgeard and lagardere have insisted that they did nothing wrong .
on wednesday , the persian gulf state of qatar signed an order for 80 airbus a350 aircraft worth $ 16 billion , the largest contract to date for the model .
since it was founded in 1994 , qatar airways has only bought airbus planes , including the delay-plagued a380 . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says public funding needed to rescue galileo from delays the european commission said on wednesday that the eu should inject huge amounts of public money into the prestigious galileo satellite navigation system to rescue it from bickering among private-sector investors .

the number of officers , which include the some 40 german representatives already there , is to be expanded to around 160 over the course of the mission .
a burgeoning drug trade , widespread corruption and insurgent violence are among the challenges the local police are preparing for .
mission includes southern regions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currently over 40 german police officers are working with 3,500 afghan trainees the mission 's main objective is " to improve cohesion and coordination -lrb- of afghan police -rrb- through mentoring , monitoring , advising and training , " said brigadier general friedrich eichele , the german mission commander who will head the eu task force .
police trainers would be armed for purposes of self-defence , but would have to rely on the nato-led isaf peacekeeping force for protection , said eichele , who added that the running costs for the first year would amount to 43.6 million euros -lrb- $ 58.8 million -rrb- .
dubbed eupol , the german-run mission will be headquartered in the capital city of kabul but will encompass regions throughout afghanistan including southern provinces where insurgent fighting has been most intense , said eu special representative for afghanistan francesc vendrell tuesday from brussels .
recent civilian deaths in the region have sparked concerns that the local population has lost faith in the international peacekeeping force . a minimum contribution for vendrell , the project does n't go far enough .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 30.05.2007 young stars shone brightest in 2006-7 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league was dominated by players in their early twenties in an unusual season , stuttgart took the title with a team of youngsters .
so it 's no coincidence dw-world.de 's top eleven has an average age of just under 25 .
we pay tribute to the players who came up big in the clutch . up front no one player was more important to his team than bochum 's theofanis gekas .
the greek forward went on a tear in the second half of the season , lifting his side from the relegation zone to eighth place in the standings and topping the league with 20 goals .
gekas is moving to leverkusen , where he 'll have to show that 2006-7 was no fluke .
until then , he can take pride in a breakthrough season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gekas provided a lot of greek tragedy for defenses mario gomez had 14 goals and eight assists , fewer than bremen 's miroslav klose , but that was due to injury .
and unlike klose , gomez finished the season strongly , scoring a crucial equalizer in the second-to-last game to keep stuttgart 's title drive on track .
at the tender age of 21 , he 's poised to become a regular in the german national squad . on the bench : klose -lrb- bremen -rrb- , kuranyi -lrb- schalke -rrb- , zidan -lrb- mainz -rrb- , frei -lrb- dortmund -rrb- the midfield the players themselves voted bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego the season 's mvp , and they get no argument here .
thirteen goals and 14 assists in his first season in the bundesliga speak volumes , and the truly scary thing is : he 's only 22 ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's dribbling skills stymied opposing midfielders diego is joined by two rising young stars from stuttgart who had a huge impact this spring .
thomas hitzls per ger , nicknamed the " hammer , " has the hardest shot in the german game , and he scored in each of stuttgart 's final two come-from-behind wins . like hitzlsperger , roberto hilbert finished the season with seven goals , four of which came during the streak of eight straight wins that sealed the title for stuttgart .
he deservedly won his first cap for the german national side during that stretch , and it 's easy to picture him , at only 22 , getting better and better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzlsperger scored some of the season 's most spectacular goals completing our dream midfield is leverkusen 's bernd schneider .
one of the league 's most consistent and technically proficient players , the 33-year-old veteran had six goals and 11 eleven assists .
more importantly , he held things together on a team that was n't clicking early , leading leverkusen to fifth place and a spot in the uefa cup . on the bench : frings -lrb- bremen -rrb- , pardo -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- , marcelinho -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- , misimovic -lrb- bochum -rrb- at the back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : led by bordon , schalke only conceded 32 goals nuremberg and schalke had the league 's stingiest defenses , so they 're the place we start building our back four .
at left back , the honors go to nuremberg 's javier pinola .
the spaniard with the league 's worst hairstyle really performed in nuremberg 's german cup triumph , scoring twice in penalty shoot-outs to keep his side alive in the tournament and adding a clutch assist in the final . in the middle , no defender was more intimidating than schalke 's marcelo bordon .
a devout catholic he may be , but his christian charity certainly does not extend to opposing strikers in the box .
bordon also scored three goals as schalke , once again , came up tragically short . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delpierre completely shut down bayern in a key match in april he 's paired with stuttgart 's unsung hero , matthieu delpierre .
the frenchman made very few mistakes this season despite playing in all but one of the team 's league and cup matches .
what 's more he was able to stay in front of his man without fouling , picking up only four yellow cards over that long stretch . schalke 's rafinha fills out the back line .
he ended the season with a respectable two goals and three assists , but what does n't show up in the statistics is the amount of pressure the speedy brazilian created on the right-hand flank .
at only 22 he played with a maturity and acumen way beyond his years . on the bench : naldo -lrb- bremen -rrb- , mertesecker -lrb- bremen -rrb- , wolf -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- , madlung -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- between the posts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuer 's colleagues in the bundesliga also voted him the season 's best keeper and what 's true of rafinha goes double for schalke keeper manuel neuer .
the 21-year-old deposed one of the league 's most seasoned number ones , frank rost , in the tenth week , and for the rest of the season he never conceded more than two goals in a match .
and he did that in the high-pressure atmosphere of schalke , which was gunning for its first german league title in 49 years .
if his teammates up front had n't frozen up against dortmund , neuer could have capped off a remarkable rookie season with the bundesliga 's ultimate prize . on the bench : schäfer -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuremberg claim german cup with late scorcher danish midfielder jan kristiansen was the star on saturday night with a 30-meter blast in extra-time .
that goal gave nuremberg a 3-2 win over 10-man stuttgart and ended the bavarians ' 45-year wait for the german cup .
-lrb- 29.05.2007 -rrb- rough ride to the bundesliga title for champions stuttgart although vfb stuttgart were crowned bundesliga champions on saturday , it was not a smooth ride for armin veh 's men whose early-season form showed little title-winning potential .

forgeard , former joint chief executive at eads which owns airbus , told the magazine le point : " airbus did not report any unrecoverable delay before the middle of april 2006 , and at that time the financial consequences were very limited . "
he repeated that he had " respected all of the rules -lrb- at eads -rrb- which are among the most restrictive among companies quoted on the cac 40 index . "
the controversy and criticism of a big severance payment to forgeard are hot issues in france particularly , where the new government under president nicolas sarkozy has signaled it will act to curb so-called " golden handshakes . "

two big shareholders in eads , daimlerchrysler in germany and lagardere group in france each decided on march 20 to sell stakes of 7.5 percent .
the group had said in 2005 that there were some problems with production and that it was investigating the extent of these .
but the announcement in june 2006 of deep problems came as a shock to the stock market and the price of shares in eads fell heavily .
the problems rapidly developed into a long crisis with changes in top management and a rescue plan involving the loss of 10,000 jobs , although this remains clouded in some uncertainty .
there is also a prospect that eads will have to raise new capital .
forgeard is the target of suspicions , renewed in allegations in a press report on tuesday , that he was aware of the impact of production problems on the group when he decided to exercise stock options .
blames german managers the use of such privileged information , which has not been communicated publicly to market authorities , is known as insider trading and is illegal because it privileges one investor over another , distorts the equitable availability of information and therefore undermines confidence in a stock market .
stock market rules require managers to inform the market quickly if they become aware of a sudden and significant change in their company 's prospects .
forgeard also argued that during his period in various top positions at airbus , the company had become " a world leader , " and that despite the planned loss of 10,000 jobs , " the balance over eight years is positive to the extent of tens of thousands of jobs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delays have plagued the a380 superjumbo he also blamed a large part of the production problems on the attitude of top managers in germany where much of the work on airbus airliners is carried out , saying they wanted to continue doing things their way while he wanted to a single , overall method of working .
this was a reference to revelations that software used for installing cabling systems in hamburg , germany , was not compatible with design software at airbus headquarters in toulouse , france .
problems in adapting complex cabling to the requirements of individual airlines were at the center of the delays to production .
forgeard also launched a personal attack on his co-chair at the time , germany 's thomas enders .

two big shareholders in eads , daimlerchrysler in germany and lagardere group in france each decided on march 20 to sell stakes of 7.5 percent .
the group had said in 2005 that there were some problems with production and that it was investigating the extent of these .
but the announcement in june 2006 of deep problems came as a shock to the stock market and the price of shares in eads fell heavily .
the problems rapidly developed into a long crisis with changes in top management and a rescue plan involving the loss of 10,000 jobs , although this remains clouded in some uncertainty .
there is also a prospect that eads will have to raise new capital .
forgeard is the target of suspicions , renewed in allegations in a press report on tuesday , that he was aware of the impact of production problems on the group when he decided to exercise stock options .
blames german managers the use of such privileged information , which has not been communicated publicly to market authorities , is known as insider trading and is illegal because it privileges one investor over another , distorts the equitable availability of information and therefore undermines confidence in a stock market .
stock market rules require managers to inform the market quickly if they become aware of a sudden and significant change in their company 's prospects .
forgeard also argued that during his period in various top positions at airbus , the company had become " a world leader , " and that despite the planned loss of 10,000 jobs , " the balance over eight years is positive to the extent of tens of thousands of jobs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delays have plagued the a380 superjumbo he also blamed a large part of the production problems on the attitude of top managers in germany where much of the work on airbus airliners is carried out , saying they wanted to continue doing things their way while he wanted to a single , overall method of working .
this was a reference to revelations that software used for installing cabling systems in hamburg , germany , was not compatible with design software at airbus headquarters in toulouse , france .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 30.05.2007 german government probes doping scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a flurry of doping confessions has rocked the world of professional cycling the german government is to examine whether taxpayers ' money was misused in a cycling doping scandal involving riders and doctors from the country 's leading cycling team . interior minister wolfgang schäuble told the cabinet on wednesday he was launching a " task force " to investigate the possible misuse of taxpayers ' money in doping .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble wants to see a new anti-doping law passed in the bundestag " doping destroys the value of sport , " schäuble said .
" its credibility , its function as a provider of role models and its approval by the public are being put on the test . "
schäuble is meanwhile pressing for a rapid passage through parliament of a new anti-doping law , which among other things would permit lenient treatment for people who come forward to testify .
the government is also examining proposals to ban imports of medicines intended for doping offences .
german chancellor angela merkel has urged cyclists who used performance-enhancing drugs to come clean and break a " cartel of silence . "
" there has evidently been systematic and continued manipulation of unimaginable proportions in professional cycling , " the chancellor said in a statement .
" the confessions and investigations undertaken so far are n't sufficient to clean the sport up . "
new confessions the government 's moves follow doping confessions from riders from the telekom team , now known as t-mobile .
on friday , retired danish cyclist bjarne riis admitted using doping during his 1996 tour de france victory while riding for telekom .
the admission came a day after former teammates erik zabel and rolf aldag confessed they used performance-enhancing drugs while riding for telekom in the 1990s .
four other riders from the team have also admitted doping , but germany 's 1997 tour winner jan ullrich has remained silent .
no comment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich ended his career amidst speculations that he , too , used illegal substances ullrich 's manager wolfgang strohband has said his client would not speak about a claim made by former telekom team masseur jef d 'hont , who told the newspaper bild this week he had injected the cyclist with the erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- blood booster on one occasion .
freiburg university on thursday dismissed its doctors andreas schmid and lothar heinrich after they admitted giving athletes doping substances .
the university promised a full investigation into the past 20 years of its sports medicine .
nationwide scope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the image of cycling has been tarnished public prosecutors in freiburg meanwhile said they had handed an investigation into schmid and heinrich over to the federal criminal police department -lrb- bka -rrb- in view of the nationwide scope of the probe .
heinrich and schmid admitted that as team doctors they were involved in epo blood doping in the mid-1990s at the telekom team .
the german cycling federation bdr on saturday also suspended olympics doctor georg huber after former cyclists jörg müller and christian henn claimed they were given doping substances in the 1980s .
however huber will not face a criminal investigation because any alleged offences were now lapsed under german law , prosecutors said .
it 's all history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik zabel has been allowed to keep competing zabel , a six-time tour de france sprint champion , on wednesday started the bavarian tour race for the milram team .
milram said they were retaining the 36-year-old rider despite his admission he took epo - a synthetic hormone that stimulates the production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells - in the 1990s .
zabel was applauded by hundreds of spectators at the start of the first stage of the race in garmisch-partenkirchen .
zabel , who has a three-year contract with milram until the end of 2008 , will be allowed to continue his contract for the rest of this year at least , the german-italian team said on tuesday .
zabel has admitted using epo before the tour de france in 1996 , saying he stopped after a week because of side-effects .
in another development , germany 's public broadcasters ard and zdf said they would not initially renew options to cover the tour de france after next year .
zdf chief editor nikolaus brender said the contract would not be renewed " until we can be sure that doping has no more chance at the tour de france .

schäuble is meanwhile pressing for a rapid passage through parliament of a new anti-doping law , which among other things would permit lenient treatment for people who come forward to testify .
the government is also examining proposals to ban imports of medicines intended for doping offences .
german chancellor angela merkel has urged cyclists who used performance-enhancing drugs to come clean and break a " cartel of silence . "
" there has evidently been systematic and continued manipulation of unimaginable proportions in professional cycling , " the chancellor said in a statement .

the government is also examining proposals to ban imports of medicines intended for doping offences .
german chancellor angela merkel has urged cyclists who used performance-enhancing drugs to come clean and break a " cartel of silence . "
" there has evidently been systematic and continued manipulation of unimaginable proportions in professional cycling , " the chancellor said in a statement .
" the confessions and investigations undertaken so far are n't sufficient to clean the sport up . "
new confessions the government 's moves follow doping confessions from riders from the telekom team , now known as t-mobile .
on friday , retired danish cyclist bjarne riis admitted using doping during his 1996 tour de france victory while riding for telekom .
the admission came a day after former teammates erik zabel and rolf aldag confessed they used performance-enhancing drugs while riding for telekom in the 1990s .
four other riders from the team have also admitted doping , but germany 's 1997 tour winner jan ullrich has remained silent .
no comment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich ended his career amidst speculations that he , too , used illegal substances ullrich 's manager wolfgang strohband has said his client would not speak about a claim made by former telekom team masseur jef d 'hont , who told the newspaper bild this week he had injected the cyclist with the erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- blood booster on one occasion .
freiburg university on thursday dismissed its doctors andreas schmid and lothar heinrich after they admitted giving athletes doping substances .
the university promised a full investigation into the past 20 years of its sports medicine .
nationwide scope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the image of cycling has been tarnished public prosecutors in freiburg meanwhile said they had handed an investigation into schmid and heinrich over to the federal criminal police department -lrb- bka -rrb- in view of the nationwide scope of the probe .
heinrich and schmid admitted that as team doctors they were involved in epo blood doping in the mid-1990s at the telekom team .
the german cycling federation bdr on saturday also suspended olympics doctor georg huber after former cyclists jörg müller and christian henn claimed they were given doping substances in the 1980s .
however huber will not face a criminal investigation because any alleged offences were now lapsed under german law , prosecutors said .
it 's all history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik zabel has been allowed to keep competing zabel , a six-time tour de france sprint champion , on wednesday started the bavarian tour race for the milram team .
milram said they were retaining the 36-year-old rider despite his admission he took epo - a synthetic hormone that stimulates the production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells - in the 1990s .
zabel was applauded by hundreds of spectators at the start of the first stage of the race in garmisch-partenkirchen .
zabel , who has a three-year contract with milram until the end of 2008 , will be allowed to continue his contract for the rest of this year at least , the german-italian team said on tuesday .
zabel has admitted using epo before the tour de france in 1996 , saying he stopped after a week because of side-effects .
in another development , germany 's public broadcasters ard and zdf said they would not initially renew options to cover the tour de france after next year .
zdf chief editor nikolaus brender said the contract would not be renewed " until we can be sure that doping has no more chance at the tour de france .

german public libraries began issuing audio books and e-books for loan via the internet on wednesday in a pilot scheme which they described as a first for europe . initially , nearly 10,000 titles will be available for download from the public-library systems in the port city of hamburg and the southern city of würzburg to subscribers ' personal computers .
users can check them out online at any time of the day and night .
after five days , the items expire and become unusable .
the audio and video files employ microsoft 's wma encoding and can be played on computers and other devices using windows software .
" it 's the libraries ' answer to the digital revolution , " said holger behrens , chief executive of divibib , the company based in wiesbaden , germany which devised the system .
competing with amazon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online libraries will appeal to younger , internet-savvy readers hella schwemer-martienssen , director of the hamburg public library system , said that public libraries in germany lend out around 350 million items annually and that libraries needed to compete with online retailer amazon , offering loans to customers who did not want to buy .
borrowing materials online is expected to appeal in particular to a younger , internet-savvy audience .
in würzburg , one of the cities chosen for the pilot project , 70 percent of library patrons are younger than 40 years .
" young users use web 2.0 , " said hannelore vogt , manager of the würzburg city library , referring to the popular term which describes an ecosystem of user-centered online communities .
" and they rightly expect from us library 2.0 , " she said .

so it 's no coincidence dw-world.de 's top eleven has an average age of just under 25 .
we pay tribute to the players who came up big in the clutch . up front no one player was more important to his team than bochum 's theofanis gekas .
the greek forward went on a tear in the second half of the season , lifting his side from the relegation zone to eighth place in the standings and topping the league with 20 goals .
gekas is moving to leverkusen , where he 'll have to show that 2006-7 was no fluke .
until then , he can take pride in a breakthrough season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gekas provided a lot of greek tragedy for defenses mario gomez had 14 goals and eight assists , fewer than bremen 's miroslav klose , but that was due to injury .
and unlike klose , gomez finished the season strongly , scoring a crucial equalizer in the second-to-last game to keep stuttgart 's title drive on track .

the spaniard with the league 's worst hairstyle really performed in nuremberg 's german cup triumph , scoring twice in penalty shoot-outs to keep his side alive in the tournament and adding a clutch assist in the final . in the middle , no defender was more intimidating than schalke 's marcelo bordon .
a devout catholic he may be , but his christian charity certainly does not extend to opposing strikers in the box .

the frenchman made very few mistakes this season despite playing in all but one of the team 's league and cup matches .
what 's more he was able to stay in front of his man without fouling , picking up only four yellow cards over that long stretch . schalke 's rafinha fills out the back line .
he ended the season with a respectable two goals and three assists , but what does n't show up in the statistics is the amount of pressure the speedy brazilian created on the right-hand flank .
at only 22 he played with a maturity and acumen way beyond his years . on the bench : naldo -lrb- bremen -rrb- , mertesecker -lrb- bremen -rrb- , wolf -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- , madlung -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- between the posts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuer 's colleagues in the bundesliga also voted him the season 's best keeper and what 's true of rafinha goes double for schalke keeper manuel neuer .

so it 's no coincidence dw-world.de 's top eleven has an average age of just under 25 .
we pay tribute to the players who came up big in the clutch . up front no one player was more important to his team than bochum 's theofanis gekas .
the greek forward went on a tear in the second half of the season , lifting his side from the relegation zone to eighth place in the standings and topping the league with 20 goals .
gekas is moving to leverkusen , where he 'll have to show that 2006-7 was no fluke .
until then , he can take pride in a breakthrough season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gekas provided a lot of greek tragedy for defenses mario gomez had 14 goals and eight assists , fewer than bremen 's miroslav klose , but that was due to injury .
and unlike klose , gomez finished the season strongly , scoring a crucial equalizer in the second-to-last game to keep stuttgart 's title drive on track .
at the tender age of 21 , he 's poised to become a regular in the german national squad . on the bench : klose -lrb- bremen -rrb- , kuranyi -lrb- schalke -rrb- , zidan -lrb- mainz -rrb- , frei -lrb- dortmund -rrb- the midfield the players themselves voted bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego the season 's mvp , and they get no argument here .
thirteen goals and 14 assists in his first season in the bundesliga speak volumes , and the truly scary thing is : he 's only 22 ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's dribbling skills stymied opposing midfielders diego is joined by two rising young stars from stuttgart who had a huge impact this spring .
thomas hitzls per ger , nicknamed the " hammer , " has the hardest shot in the german game , and he scored in each of stuttgart 's final two come-from-behind wins . like hitzlsperger , roberto hilbert finished the season with seven goals , four of which came during the streak of eight straight wins that sealed the title for stuttgart .
he deservedly won his first cap for the german national side during that stretch , and it 's easy to picture him , at only 22 , getting better and better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzlsperger scored some of the season 's most spectacular goals completing our dream midfield is leverkusen 's bernd schneider .
one of the league 's most consistent and technically proficient players , the 33-year-old veteran had six goals and 11 eleven assists .
more importantly , he held things together on a team that was n't clicking early , leading leverkusen to fifth place and a spot in the uefa cup . on the bench : frings -lrb- bremen -rrb- , pardo -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- , marcelinho -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- , misimovic -lrb- bochum -rrb- at the back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : led by bordon , schalke only conceded 32 goals nuremberg and schalke had the league 's stingiest defenses , so they 're the place we start building our back four .
at left back , the honors go to nuremberg 's javier pinola .
the spaniard with the league 's worst hairstyle really performed in nuremberg 's german cup triumph , scoring twice in penalty shoot-outs to keep his side alive in the tournament and adding a clutch assist in the final . in the middle , no defender was more intimidating than schalke 's marcelo bordon .
a devout catholic he may be , but his christian charity certainly does not extend to opposing strikers in the box .
bordon also scored three goals as schalke , once again , came up tragically short . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delpierre completely shut down bayern in a key match in april he 's paired with stuttgart 's unsung hero , matthieu delpierre .
the frenchman made very few mistakes this season despite playing in all but one of the team 's league and cup matches .
what 's more he was able to stay in front of his man without fouling , picking up only four yellow cards over that long stretch . schalke 's rafinha fills out the back line .
he ended the season with a respectable two goals and three assists , but what does n't show up in the statistics is the amount of pressure the speedy brazilian created on the right-hand flank .
at only 22 he played with a maturity and acumen way beyond his years . on the bench : naldo -lrb- bremen -rrb- , mertesecker -lrb- bremen -rrb- , wolf -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- , madlung -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- between the posts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuer 's colleagues in the bundesliga also voted him the season 's best keeper and what 's true of rafinha goes double for schalke keeper manuel neuer .
the 21-year-old deposed one of the league 's most seasoned number ones , frank rost , in the tenth week , and for the rest of the season he never conceded more than two goals in a match .
and he did that in the high-pressure atmosphere of schalke , which was gunning for its first german league title in 49 years .
if his teammates up front had n't frozen up against dortmund , neuer could have capped off a remarkable rookie season with the bundesliga 's ultimate prize . on the bench : schäfer -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuremberg claim german cup with late scorcher danish midfielder jan kristiansen was the star on saturday night with a 30-meter blast in extra-time .
that goal gave nuremberg a 3-2 win over 10-man stuttgart and ended the bavarians ' 45-year wait for the german cup .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 30.05.2007 controversial dutch organ donor reality tv show to go ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the big donorshow " is getting masses of advance publicity the dutch channel behind a reality tv show in which an organ donor must choose one of three candidates to receive her kidney has promised to broadcast it friday despite the ruckus it has caused . lawmakers in the dutch parliament have called for " the big donorshow " to be scrapped on ethical grounds , but the channel insists it will press ahead with the scheduled broadcast to highlight the serious lack of organ donors .
laurens dillich , the head of public service broadcaster bnn , told public radio : " the chances of the candidates obtaining a kidney are 33 percent , far better than for those on organ waiting lists .
you would imagine that -lrb- waiting times -rrb- have improved , but they are getting longer . "
bnn , a channel aimed at young people , is screening the show on the fifth anniversary of the death of its founder , bart de graaff .
he died after waiting seven years for a kidney donation .
international criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bart de graaff , in 1999 the project has prompted condemnation across the netherlands and beyond .
in brussels , a spokesman for the european commission - which on wednesday presented an action plan to reduce organ donor waiting lists - said it was in " pretty bad taste . "
the dutch kidney foundation welcomed the attention bnn had brought on the subject , but noted that " their way of doing it is not ours , and it will bring no practical solution . "
" i 'm afraid it 's primarily about the shock effect which has characterized the channel bnn since … the mid-90s , " media analyst jo groebel told dw-radio .
" i 'm afraid that … the whole debate is just increasing the market value and the market success of such a program , and this is what makes it extremely cynical - that the discussion itself adds to the program .
this is not the first time bnn has courted controversy .
previous broadcasts include " sex , a user 's guide , " a series of no-holds-barred education programs , and " shoot up and swallow , " a series dedicated to sex and drugs .
" the big donorshow " was dreamt up by endemol , the dutch production company behind " big brother " and other reality television shows .
it focuses on lisa , a 37-year-old woman dying of a brain tumor .
she must decide which of three patients selected by the producers should receive her kidney .
viewers can offer their opinions by sms text message .
lawmakers want ban on tuesday , the show was brought up in dutch parliament , where lawmakers agreed on the need to highlight the shortage of organ donors but were divided on whether reality television was the best way to do it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's organ donor card some lawmakers called on the ministers for health and media to take the program off air .
the two cabinet members had already made clear they did not have the authority to ban the program .
in the netherlands , organ transplants are subject to strict laws , which prohibit donors from choosing who will receive their organs after their death .
however , an exemption is made in the case of kidney transplants , which can be carried out while the donor is still alive , allowing the donor to choose the beneficiary if there is some link between the two people .
after an eu-wide survey showed that while 81 percent of european citizens support the use of organ donor cards , only 12 percent have one , the european commission proposed its action plan , which includes introducing an eu-wide donor card and creating organ transplant coordinators in hospitals .
the eu executive arm is hopeful that european legislation on common standards for the quality and safety of organ donation will be introduced next year when its proposals are developed . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " there is no cohesion of tv writing staff in germany " german tv networks are taking their cues state-side in a bid to create better drama series .

the well-preserved passport , issued in 1948 by an italian delegation of the international committee of the red cross , was presented on tuesday at the buenos aires holocaust museum .
it also bears the stamp and the signature of the argentine vice-counsel in genova , italy at that time , pedro solari capurro .
a factory worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eichmann was sentenced to death by an israeli court federal judge maria servini de cubria recently opened the eichmann file and found the well-preserved passport , graciela jinich , the director of the buenos aires holocaust museum , told dpa news service .
eichmann 's wife had presented the passport to authorities in 1960 after he had been abducted by israeli secret service agents from the buenos aires suburb where he lived a normal life working at the mercedes benz factory .
he was taken to israel , tried for crimes against humanity and hanged in 1962 .
" this document leaves no room for doubts on how easy it was for not only eichmann , but also other war criminals , to attain fake identification documents , change their names and enter our country , " jinich said .
suppressed information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eichmann was one of the leaders of the mass deportation of jews to extermination camps the united states released documents last year which showed that the cia learned about eichmann 's location and alias two years before israel captured him but kept the information secret as part of its efforts to combat communism in post-war west germany .
they also showed that the united states used a large network of spies recruited among former nazis and that the cia had virtually no interest in arresting war criminals , focusing instead on cold war issues .
" the american policy of the time was not to pursue nazi war criminals , " said historian timothy naftali , who reviewed thousands of documents on cia ties to nazis from the us national archives .
" they thought that was the responsibility of the germans . "
according to the cia papers , west germany knew from 1952 that eichmann was hiding in argentina under an assumed identity , but kept quiet about it fearing the fugitive might talk about hans globke , a former nazi who was a top national security advisor to konrad adenauer , the chancellor at the time . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " this is a german story " in an interview with dw-world.de , us historian timothy naftali says germans should pressure their own government to receive more information on the role of nazis in german government after 1945 .

" that means not only informing the members of these organizations about one 's own plans but also entertaining a willingness to abandon them if necessary , " he wrote .
beck pointed out that the plans to station the defense system in poland and the czech republic had inflicted " great harm " on relations between russia and the united states and europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck he also called for a new round of global disarmament : " disarmament policy must ... be urgently re-established as a key regulatory principle in international relations , " he wrote .
" major international disarmament regimes are already in shreds or have been completely destroyed . "
money better spent elsewhere ?
beck stressed the importance of close ties between the us and germany , but also used the opportunity to point out that washington had already sunk more than $ 100 billion in developing the shield , which may not even work .
that money could have been spent differently and " achieved more for the security of the united states , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to install part of the defense system in bohemia as head of the spd , which is part of christian democrat angela merkel 's government coalition , beck is the party 's most likely candidate for chancellor in 2009 .
in the past , he has been openly critical of us plans for the defense system meant to block attacks from hostile countries , warning in march that it could spark a new arms race .
those comments led to tensions within germany 's governing coalition as his column on tuesday was also likely to do .
chancellor merkel has been muted about the defense shield plans , only saying there should be a debate on the missile shield within nato and that the eu should " present a common front " on it . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin lashes out at us , eu as russia tests missile russian president putin warned tuesday that a planned us missile defense shield would make europe a " powder keg " and lashed out at his eu critics .

" that means not only informing the members of these organizations about one 's own plans but also entertaining a willingness to abandon them if necessary , " he wrote .
beck pointed out that the plans to station the defense system in poland and the czech republic had inflicted " great harm " on relations between russia and the united states and europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck he also called for a new round of global disarmament : " disarmament policy must ... be urgently re-established as a key regulatory principle in international relations , " he wrote .
" major international disarmament regimes are already in shreds or have been completely destroyed . "
money better spent elsewhere ?
beck stressed the importance of close ties between the us and germany , but also used the opportunity to point out that washington had already sunk more than $ 100 billion in developing the shield , which may not even work .
that money could have been spent differently and " achieved more for the security of the united states , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to install part of the defense system in bohemia as head of the spd , which is part of christian democrat angela merkel 's government coalition , beck is the party 's most likely candidate for chancellor in 2009 .
in the past , he has been openly critical of us plans for the defense system meant to block attacks from hostile countries , warning in march that it could spark a new arms race .
those comments led to tensions within germany 's governing coalition as his column on tuesday was also likely to do .
chancellor merkel has been muted about the defense shield plans , only saying there should be a debate on the missile shield within nato and that the eu should " present a common front " on it . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin lashes out at us , eu as russia tests missile russian president putin warned tuesday that a planned us missile defense shield would make europe a " powder keg " and lashed out at his eu critics .

according to the cia papers , west germany knew from 1952 that eichmann was hiding in argentina under an assumed identity , but kept quiet about it fearing the fugitive might talk about hans globke , a former nazi who was a top national security advisor to konrad adenauer , the chancellor at the time . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " this is a german story " in an interview with dw-world.de , us historian timothy naftali says germans should pressure their own government to receive more information on the role of nazis in german government after 1945 .

laurens dillich , the head of public service broadcaster bnn , told public radio : " the chances of the candidates obtaining a kidney are 33 percent , far better than for those on organ waiting lists .
you would imagine that -lrb- waiting times -rrb- have improved , but they are getting longer . "
bnn , a channel aimed at young people , is screening the show on the fifth anniversary of the death of its founder , bart de graaff .
he died after waiting seven years for a kidney donation .
international criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bart de graaff , in 1999 the project has prompted condemnation across the netherlands and beyond .
in brussels , a spokesman for the european commission - which on wednesday presented an action plan to reduce organ donor waiting lists - said it was in " pretty bad taste . "
the dutch kidney foundation welcomed the attention bnn had brought on the subject , but noted that " their way of doing it is not ours , and it will bring no practical solution . "
" i 'm afraid it 's primarily about the shock effect which has characterized the channel bnn since … the mid-90s , " media analyst jo groebel told dw-radio .
" i 'm afraid that … the whole debate is just increasing the market value and the market success of such a program , and this is what makes it extremely cynical - that the discussion itself adds to the program .

the two cabinet members had already made clear they did not have the authority to ban the program .
in the netherlands , organ transplants are subject to strict laws , which prohibit donors from choosing who will receive their organs after their death .
however , an exemption is made in the case of kidney transplants , which can be carried out while the donor is still alive , allowing the donor to choose the beneficiary if there is some link between the two people .
after an eu-wide survey showed that while 81 percent of european citizens support the use of organ donor cards , only 12 percent have one , the european commission proposed its action plan , which includes introducing an eu-wide donor card and creating organ transplant coordinators in hospitals .
the eu executive arm is hopeful that european legislation on common standards for the quality and safety of organ donation will be introduced next year when its proposals are developed . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " there is no cohesion of tv writing staff in germany " german tv networks are taking their cues state-side in a bid to create better drama series .

the well-preserved passport , issued in 1948 by an italian delegation of the international committee of the red cross , was presented on tuesday at the buenos aires holocaust museum .
it also bears the stamp and the signature of the argentine vice-counsel in genova , italy at that time , pedro solari capurro .

eichmann 's wife had presented the passport to authorities in 1960 after he had been abducted by israeli secret service agents from the buenos aires suburb where he lived a normal life working at the mercedes benz factory .
he was taken to israel , tried for crimes against humanity and hanged in 1962 .
" this document leaves no room for doubts on how easy it was for not only eichmann , but also other war criminals , to attain fake identification documents , change their names and enter our country , " jinich said .

they also showed that the united states used a large network of spies recruited among former nazis and that the cia had virtually no interest in arresting war criminals , focusing instead on cold war issues .
" the american policy of the time was not to pursue nazi war criminals , " said historian timothy naftali , who reviewed thousands of documents on cia ties to nazis from the us national archives .
" they thought that was the responsibility of the germans . "
according to the cia papers , west germany knew from 1952 that eichmann was hiding in argentina under an assumed identity , but kept quiet about it fearing the fugitive might talk about hans globke , a former nazi who was a top national security advisor to konrad adenauer , the chancellor at the time . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " this is a german story " in an interview with dw-world.de , us historian timothy naftali says germans should pressure their own government to receive more information on the role of nazis in german government after 1945 .

the well-preserved passport , issued in 1948 by an italian delegation of the international committee of the red cross , was presented on tuesday at the buenos aires holocaust museum .
it also bears the stamp and the signature of the argentine vice-counsel in genova , italy at that time , pedro solari capurro .
a factory worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eichmann was sentenced to death by an israeli court federal judge maria servini de cubria recently opened the eichmann file and found the well-preserved passport , graciela jinich , the director of the buenos aires holocaust museum , told dpa news service .
eichmann 's wife had presented the passport to authorities in 1960 after he had been abducted by israeli secret service agents from the buenos aires suburb where he lived a normal life working at the mercedes benz factory .
he was taken to israel , tried for crimes against humanity and hanged in 1962 .
" this document leaves no room for doubts on how easy it was for not only eichmann , but also other war criminals , to attain fake identification documents , change their names and enter our country , " jinich said .
suppressed information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eichmann was one of the leaders of the mass deportation of jews to extermination camps the united states released documents last year which showed that the cia learned about eichmann 's location and alias two years before israel captured him but kept the information secret as part of its efforts to combat communism in post-war west germany .
they also showed that the united states used a large network of spies recruited among former nazis and that the cia had virtually no interest in arresting war criminals , focusing instead on cold war issues .
" the american policy of the time was not to pursue nazi war criminals , " said historian timothy naftali , who reviewed thousands of documents on cia ties to nazis from the us national archives .
" they thought that was the responsibility of the germans . "
according to the cia papers , west germany knew from 1952 that eichmann was hiding in argentina under an assumed identity , but kept quiet about it fearing the fugitive might talk about hans globke , a former nazi who was a top national security advisor to konrad adenauer , the chancellor at the time . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " this is a german story " in an interview with dw-world.de , us historian timothy naftali says germans should pressure their own government to receive more information on the role of nazis in german government after 1945 .

us secretary of state condoleezza rice , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and russian foreign minister sergei lavrov will attend the meeting of the quartet , which comprises the united states , the un , the eu and russia .
the potsdam meeting was aimed at preparing the summit of leaders of the group of eight most industrialized nations in heiligendamm , northeast germany , june 6-8 .
the ministers were tackling a range of international crises including the iranian and north korean nuclear programs , afghanistan and kosovo .
but japan poured cold water on one of the issues germany had placed at the top of its priority list for the summit - a binding agreement on reducing greenhouse gases .
divisions over climate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state rice -lrb- l -rrb- was also in potsdam foreign ministry spokesman mitsuo sakaba said german proposals to complete negotiations on a successor to the kyoto protocol on greenhouse gases by 2009 were " premature . "
japan has been leading efforts among asian nations to limit global warming .
it said it believed major emitters of greenhouse gases such as the united states , china and india should agree to join the process before any timetable was put in place .
" until we know if they will join us , it is premature , " sakaba said .
germany took advantage of the presence of rice and lavrov to hastily convene the middle east quartet , the body which drew up the stalled roadmap for peace .
however , faced with the bloodiest internal clashes in lebanon for decades and the firing of palestinian rockets into israel and israeli airstrikes in gaza , expectations for the meeting were low .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive security at the g8 heiligendamm location in potsdam , the minister said they were troubled by the situation in the region and called on the palestinian government to put an end to internal strife and missile attacks against israel , a german delegation source said .
" the spiral of violence must be stopped , " steinmeier told his fellow ministers , the source said .
there was broad agreement that the international community needed to encourage talks between israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmoud abbas .
they urged the palestinian authority to fulfill the demands of the middle east quartet including renouncing violence , recognizing israel and respecting previous agreements with the jewish state .
and they called on israel to unfreeze palestinian tax revenue and customs duties .
kosovo on the agenda the future status of kosovo , an issue that bitterly divides russia and the west , was also on the table in potsdam .
russia rejects proposals by chief un negotiator martti ahtisaari to grant kosovo internationally supervised independence from serbia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some criticize the world 's poorest get lost in the g8 shuffle steinmeier said he expected a clash over the province at the meeting .
" we are going to have a discussion on kosovo that will not be easy , " he said .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner , the un representative for kosovo from 1999-2001 , said the issue was " very difficult . "
russian foreign foreign minister sergei lavrov told reporters he wanted " justice " for kosovo .
the ministers also addressed the situation in strife-torn afghanistan .
afghan foreign minister rangeen dadfar spanta and his pakistani counterpart khurshid kasuri were attending the potsdam talks as part of a german-brokered initiative to resolve a dispute about their joint border .
afghanistan and pakistan have been trading recriminations about growing violence linked to taliban extremists on either side of the border .

iran expert alex bigham spoke with dw-world.de about thursday 's meeting between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iranian nuclear negotiator ali larijani .
iran wants proliferation and recognition , he said . dw-world.de : mr. bigham , what is your assessment of monday 's meeting in baghdad between the us and iranian ambassadors to iraq ?
alex bigham : i certainly think the talks are a positive sign , and this may be a tentative start of a period of cooling off in relations .
there has been an indication from the iranians of a willingness to meet in a month 's time , which is a welcome sign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana -lrb- left -rrb- and larijani at a meeting in berlin last september the talks are limited of course , really to one issue : iraq .
there are obvious reasons why america would want to seek iranian help in iraq - in order to improve stability in the country and to reduce the flow of funds and arms to insurgents who are attacking coalition forces .
the difficult question is why iran would want to assist coalition forces .
there will no doubt be elements in iran who want the americans to remain bogged down in iraq because they see that as a buffer to a possible attack on iran .
but it seems that those advocating dialogue both in washington and tehran are winning the argument for the moment .
they want to see stability on iran 's border with iraq , an area which has suffered from terrorist acts against the iranian government .
it 's certainly in iran 's long term self-interest to improve security and stability in iraq . iran 's nuclear program had not been on the agenda .
are you nevertheless surprised that the issue did not arise ? i am not surprised it was n't discussed .
neither side wants to be seen to be compromising on the nuclear issue at this stage , given domestic pressures in both iran and america .
the us does n't want to replicate or divert attention from the iaea , un and eu structures .
they deliberately want this to be seen as a disagreement between iran and the international community , not between iran and america . will monday 's talks have an impact on javier solana 's meeting with the iranian nuclear negotiator ali larijani on thursday ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intransigency on both sides blocks europe 's negotiations , said bigham the baghdad talks may offer some kind of reassurance to the iranian government in terms of the likelihood of military action , but there will need to be concrete results in order for the americans to be convinced of progress .
although the baghdad talks may help as a confidence-building measure , which is welcome , necessary , and frankly overdue , both the eu and iran are seeing the discussions on iran 's nuclear program as a separate issue from the future of iraq . what approach do you expect solana to take ? solana 's approach is not to engage in a negotiation directly about the nuclear issue , but to try to get an agreement to have a negotiation which would involve the p5 + 1 -lrb- editor 's note : the five per manent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the us - plus germany -rrb- .
however , the sticking point is the precondition the us has set that iran suspends uranium enrichment before negotiations .
the iranians have repeatedly ruled out the possibility of talks with any preconditions . what do you expect to come out of the talks ? there does n't seem to have been a fundamental shift in either side 's position , so the possibility of an agreement is small .
the difficulty in separating the issues of iraq and the nuclear program is that iran seems to want two things in return for reducing its support for insurgents in iraq : proliferation and recognition of its regional role .
these are effectively red lines for the americans , which make overcoming the stalemate a difficult , long term process . do you agree with the eu 's policy towards iran ?
what should the eu be doing differently ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayatollah khamenei is the main decision-maker on iran 's foreign and security policies the eu has made a great deal of effort to negotiate to iran .
the main barriers to progress are the relative intransigency of both the iranian and the american position on the nuclear issue .
another problem is the internal divisions within iran .
larijani is clearly a growing political player in tehran for the moment , but it is the supreme leader , khamenei who will make the final decision on iran 's security and foreign policy .
ayatollah khamenei is reluctant to make a final decision on the nuclear issues for fear of alienating one of the factions in iranian politics and undermining his own position .
one option that needs renewed consideration is el baradei 's proposal of a mutual " time-out " - iran suspending enrichment while the un suspends sanctions .
that is one option that should at least be put on the table .

they deliberately want this to be seen as a disagreement between iran and the international community , not between iran and america . will monday 's talks have an impact on javier solana 's meeting with the iranian nuclear negotiator ali larijani on thursday ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intransigency on both sides blocks europe 's negotiations , said bigham the baghdad talks may offer some kind of reassurance to the iranian government in terms of the likelihood of military action , but there will need to be concrete results in order for the americans to be convinced of progress .
although the baghdad talks may help as a confidence-building measure , which is welcome , necessary , and frankly overdue , both the eu and iran are seeing the discussions on iran 's nuclear program as a separate issue from the future of iraq . what approach do you expect solana to take ? solana 's approach is not to engage in a negotiation directly about the nuclear issue , but to try to get an agreement to have a negotiation which would involve the p5 + 1 -lrb- editor 's note : the five per manent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the us - plus germany -rrb- .
however , the sticking point is the precondition the us has set that iran suspends uranium enrichment before negotiations .
the iranians have repeatedly ruled out the possibility of talks with any preconditions . what do you expect to come out of the talks ? there does n't seem to have been a fundamental shift in either side 's position , so the possibility of an agreement is small .
the difficulty in separating the issues of iraq and the nuclear program is that iran seems to want two things in return for reducing its support for insurgents in iraq : proliferation and recognition of its regional role .
these are effectively red lines for the americans , which make overcoming the stalemate a difficult , long term process . do you agree with the eu 's policy towards iran ?
what should the eu be doing differently ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayatollah khamenei is the main decision-maker on iran 's foreign and security policies the eu has made a great deal of effort to negotiate to iran .
the main barriers to progress are the relative intransigency of both the iranian and the american position on the nuclear issue .
another problem is the internal divisions within iran .
larijani is clearly a growing political player in tehran for the moment , but it is the supreme leader , khamenei who will make the final decision on iran 's security and foreign policy .
ayatollah khamenei is reluctant to make a final decision on the nuclear issues for fear of alienating one of the factions in iranian politics and undermining his own position .
one option that needs renewed consideration is el baradei 's proposal of a mutual " time-out " - iran suspending enrichment while the un suspends sanctions .
that is one option that should at least be put on the table .

iran expert alex bigham spoke with dw-world.de about thursday 's meeting between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iranian nuclear negotiator ali larijani .
iran wants proliferation and recognition , he said . dw-world.de : mr. bigham , what is your assessment of monday 's meeting in baghdad between the us and iranian ambassadors to iraq ?
alex bigham : i certainly think the talks are a positive sign , and this may be a tentative start of a period of cooling off in relations .
there has been an indication from the iranians of a willingness to meet in a month 's time , which is a welcome sign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana -lrb- left -rrb- and larijani at a meeting in berlin last september the talks are limited of course , really to one issue : iraq .
there are obvious reasons why america would want to seek iranian help in iraq - in order to improve stability in the country and to reduce the flow of funds and arms to insurgents who are attacking coalition forces .
the difficult question is why iran would want to assist coalition forces .
there will no doubt be elements in iran who want the americans to remain bogged down in iraq because they see that as a buffer to a possible attack on iran .
but it seems that those advocating dialogue both in washington and tehran are winning the argument for the moment .
they want to see stability on iran 's border with iraq , an area which has suffered from terrorist acts against the iranian government .
it 's certainly in iran 's long term self-interest to improve security and stability in iraq . iran 's nuclear program had not been on the agenda .
are you nevertheless surprised that the issue did not arise ? i am not surprised it was n't discussed .
neither side wants to be seen to be compromising on the nuclear issue at this stage , given domestic pressures in both iran and america .
the us does n't want to replicate or divert attention from the iaea , un and eu structures .
they deliberately want this to be seen as a disagreement between iran and the international community , not between iran and america . will monday 's talks have an impact on javier solana 's meeting with the iranian nuclear negotiator ali larijani on thursday ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intransigency on both sides blocks europe 's negotiations , said bigham the baghdad talks may offer some kind of reassurance to the iranian government in terms of the likelihood of military action , but there will need to be concrete results in order for the americans to be convinced of progress .

" that means not only informing the members of these organizations about one 's own plans but also entertaining a willingness to abandon them if necessary , " he wrote .
beck pointed out that the plans to station the defense system in poland and the czech republic had inflicted " great harm " on relations between russia and the united states and europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck he also called for a new round of global disarmament : " disarmament policy must ... be urgently re-established as a key regulatory principle in international relations , " he wrote .
" major international disarmament regimes are already in shreds or have been completely destroyed . "
money better spent elsewhere ?
beck stressed the importance of close ties between the us and germany , but also used the opportunity to point out that washington had already sunk more than $ 100 billion in developing the shield , which may not even work .
that money could have been spent differently and " achieved more for the security of the united states , " he added .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 30.05.2007 controversial dutch organ donor reality tv show to go ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the big donorshow " is getting masses of advance publicity the dutch channel behind a reality tv show in which an organ donor must choose one of three candidates to receive her kidney has promised to broadcast it friday despite the ruckus it has caused . lawmakers in the dutch parliament have called for " the big donorshow " to be scrapped on ethical grounds , but the channel insists it will press ahead with the scheduled broadcast to highlight the serious lack of organ donors .
laurens dillich , the head of public service broadcaster bnn , told public radio : " the chances of the candidates obtaining a kidney are 33 percent , far better than for those on organ waiting lists .
you would imagine that -lrb- waiting times -rrb- have improved , but they are getting longer . "
bnn , a channel aimed at young people , is screening the show on the fifth anniversary of the death of its founder , bart de graaff .
he died after waiting seven years for a kidney donation .
international criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bart de graaff , in 1999 the project has prompted condemnation across the netherlands and beyond .
in brussels , a spokesman for the european commission - which on wednesday presented an action plan to reduce organ donor waiting lists - said it was in " pretty bad taste . "
the dutch kidney foundation welcomed the attention bnn had brought on the subject , but noted that " their way of doing it is not ours , and it will bring no practical solution . "
" i 'm afraid it 's primarily about the shock effect which has characterized the channel bnn since … the mid-90s , " media analyst jo groebel told dw-radio .
" i 'm afraid that … the whole debate is just increasing the market value and the market success of such a program , and this is what makes it extremely cynical - that the discussion itself adds to the program .
this is not the first time bnn has courted controversy .
previous broadcasts include " sex , a user 's guide , " a series of no-holds-barred education programs , and " shoot up and swallow , " a series dedicated to sex and drugs .
" the big donorshow " was dreamt up by endemol , the dutch production company behind " big brother " and other reality television shows .
it focuses on lisa , a 37-year-old woman dying of a brain tumor .
she must decide which of three patients selected by the producers should receive her kidney .
viewers can offer their opinions by sms text message .
lawmakers want ban on tuesday , the show was brought up in dutch parliament , where lawmakers agreed on the need to highlight the shortage of organ donors but were divided on whether reality television was the best way to do it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's organ donor card some lawmakers called on the ministers for health and media to take the program off air .
the two cabinet members had already made clear they did not have the authority to ban the program .
in the netherlands , organ transplants are subject to strict laws , which prohibit donors from choosing who will receive their organs after their death .
however , an exemption is made in the case of kidney transplants , which can be carried out while the donor is still alive , allowing the donor to choose the beneficiary if there is some link between the two people .
after an eu-wide survey showed that while 81 percent of european citizens support the use of organ donor cards , only 12 percent have one , the european commission proposed its action plan , which includes introducing an eu-wide donor card and creating organ transplant coordinators in hospitals .
the eu executive arm is hopeful that european legislation on common standards for the quality and safety of organ donation will be introduced next year when its proposals are developed . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " there is no cohesion of tv writing staff in germany " german tv networks are taking their cues state-side in a bid to create better drama series .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 30.05.2007 young stars shone brightest in 2006-7 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league was dominated by players in their early twenties in an unusual season , stuttgart took the title with a team of youngsters .
so it 's no coincidence dw-world.de 's top eleven has an average age of just under 25 .
we pay tribute to the players who came up big in the clutch . up front no one player was more important to his team than bochum 's theofanis gekas .
the greek forward went on a tear in the second half of the season , lifting his side from the relegation zone to eighth place in the standings and topping the league with 20 goals .
gekas is moving to leverkusen , where he 'll have to show that 2006-7 was no fluke .
until then , he can take pride in a breakthrough season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gekas provided a lot of greek tragedy for defenses mario gomez had 14 goals and eight assists , fewer than bremen 's miroslav klose , but that was due to injury .
and unlike klose , gomez finished the season strongly , scoring a crucial equalizer in the second-to-last game to keep stuttgart 's title drive on track .
at the tender age of 21 , he 's poised to become a regular in the german national squad . on the bench : klose -lrb- bremen -rrb- , kuranyi -lrb- schalke -rrb- , zidan -lrb- mainz -rrb- , frei -lrb- dortmund -rrb- the midfield the players themselves voted bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego the season 's mvp , and they get no argument here .
thirteen goals and 14 assists in his first season in the bundesliga speak volumes , and the truly scary thing is : he 's only 22 ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's dribbling skills stymied opposing midfielders diego is joined by two rising young stars from stuttgart who had a huge impact this spring .
thomas hitzls per ger , nicknamed the " hammer , " has the hardest shot in the german game , and he scored in each of stuttgart 's final two come-from-behind wins . like hitzlsperger , roberto hilbert finished the season with seven goals , four of which came during the streak of eight straight wins that sealed the title for stuttgart .
he deservedly won his first cap for the german national side during that stretch , and it 's easy to picture him , at only 22 , getting better and better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzlsperger scored some of the season 's most spectacular goals completing our dream midfield is leverkusen 's bernd schneider .
one of the league 's most consistent and technically proficient players , the 33-year-old veteran had six goals and 11 eleven assists .
more importantly , he held things together on a team that was n't clicking early , leading leverkusen to fifth place and a spot in the uefa cup . on the bench : frings -lrb- bremen -rrb- , pardo -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- , marcelinho -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- , misimovic -lrb- bochum -rrb- at the back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : led by bordon , schalke only conceded 32 goals nuremberg and schalke had the league 's stingiest defenses , so they 're the place we start building our back four .
at left back , the honors go to nuremberg 's javier pinola .
the spaniard with the league 's worst hairstyle really performed in nuremberg 's german cup triumph , scoring twice in penalty shoot-outs to keep his side alive in the tournament and adding a clutch assist in the final . in the middle , no defender was more intimidating than schalke 's marcelo bordon .
a devout catholic he may be , but his christian charity certainly does not extend to opposing strikers in the box .
bordon also scored three goals as schalke , once again , came up tragically short . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delpierre completely shut down bayern in a key match in april he 's paired with stuttgart 's unsung hero , matthieu delpierre .
the frenchman made very few mistakes this season despite playing in all but one of the team 's league and cup matches .
what 's more he was able to stay in front of his man without fouling , picking up only four yellow cards over that long stretch . schalke 's rafinha fills out the back line .
he ended the season with a respectable two goals and three assists , but what does n't show up in the statistics is the amount of pressure the speedy brazilian created on the right-hand flank .
at only 22 he played with a maturity and acumen way beyond his years . on the bench : naldo -lrb- bremen -rrb- , mertesecker -lrb- bremen -rrb- , wolf -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- , madlung -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- between the posts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuer 's colleagues in the bundesliga also voted him the season 's best keeper and what 's true of rafinha goes double for schalke keeper manuel neuer .
the 21-year-old deposed one of the league 's most seasoned number ones , frank rost , in the tenth week , and for the rest of the season he never conceded more than two goals in a match .
and he did that in the high-pressure atmosphere of schalke , which was gunning for its first german league title in 49 years .
if his teammates up front had n't frozen up against dortmund , neuer could have capped off a remarkable rookie season with the bundesliga 's ultimate prize . on the bench : schäfer -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuremberg claim german cup with late scorcher danish midfielder jan kristiansen was the star on saturday night with a 30-meter blast in extra-time .

forgeard , former joint chief executive at eads which owns airbus , told the magazine le point : " airbus did not report any unrecoverable delay before the middle of april 2006 , and at that time the financial consequences were very limited . "
he repeated that he had " respected all of the rules -lrb- at eads -rrb- which are among the most restrictive among companies quoted on the cac 40 index . "
the controversy and criticism of a big severance payment to forgeard are hot issues in france particularly , where the new government under president nicolas sarkozy has signaled it will act to curb so-called " golden handshakes . "
insider trading ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's forgeard was co-chair of eads from june 2005 - june 2006 forgeard and many other senior managers sold stock options in march last year , three months before the european aeronautics defence and space company and airbus announced serious delays in production of the a380 superjumbo airliner .
two big shareholders in eads , daimlerchrysler in germany and lagardere group in france each decided on march 20 to sell stakes of 7.5 percent .
the group had said in 2005 that there were some problems with production and that it was investigating the extent of these .
but the announcement in june 2006 of deep problems came as a shock to the stock market and the price of shares in eads fell heavily .
the problems rapidly developed into a long crisis with changes in top management and a rescue plan involving the loss of 10,000 jobs , although this remains clouded in some uncertainty .
there is also a prospect that eads will have to raise new capital .
forgeard is the target of suspicions , renewed in allegations in a press report on tuesday , that he was aware of the impact of production problems on the group when he decided to exercise stock options .
blames german managers the use of such privileged information , which has not been communicated publicly to market authorities , is known as insider trading and is illegal because it privileges one investor over another , distorts the equitable availability of information and therefore undermines confidence in a stock market .
stock market rules require managers to inform the market quickly if they become aware of a sudden and significant change in their company 's prospects .
forgeard also argued that during his period in various top positions at airbus , the company had become " a world leader , " and that despite the planned loss of 10,000 jobs , " the balance over eight years is positive to the extent of tens of thousands of jobs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delays have plagued the a380 superjumbo he also blamed a large part of the production problems on the attitude of top managers in germany where much of the work on airbus airliners is carried out , saying they wanted to continue doing things their way while he wanted to a single , overall method of working .
this was a reference to revelations that software used for installing cabling systems in hamburg , germany , was not compatible with design software at airbus headquarters in toulouse , france .
problems in adapting complex cabling to the requirements of individual airlines were at the center of the delays to production .
forgeard also launched a personal attack on his co-chair at the time , germany 's thomas enders .
" i ask myself whether he had n't been commissioned by daimler boss jürgen schrempp to neutralize or even get rid of me , " the former manager said .

on wednesday , the persian gulf state of qatar signed an order for 80 airbus a350 aircraft worth $ 16 billion , the largest contract to date for the model .

forgeard , former joint chief executive at eads which owns airbus , told the magazine le point : " airbus did not report any unrecoverable delay before the middle of april 2006 , and at that time the financial consequences were very limited . "
he repeated that he had " respected all of the rules -lrb- at eads -rrb- which are among the most restrictive among companies quoted on the cac 40 index . "
the controversy and criticism of a big severance payment to forgeard are hot issues in france particularly , where the new government under president nicolas sarkozy has signaled it will act to curb so-called " golden handshakes . "
insider trading ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's forgeard was co-chair of eads from june 2005 - june 2006 forgeard and many other senior managers sold stock options in march last year , three months before the european aeronautics defence and space company and airbus announced serious delays in production of the a380 superjumbo airliner .
two big shareholders in eads , daimlerchrysler in germany and lagardere group in france each decided on march 20 to sell stakes of 7.5 percent .
the group had said in 2005 that there were some problems with production and that it was investigating the extent of these .
but the announcement in june 2006 of deep problems came as a shock to the stock market and the price of shares in eads fell heavily .
the problems rapidly developed into a long crisis with changes in top management and a rescue plan involving the loss of 10,000 jobs , although this remains clouded in some uncertainty .
there is also a prospect that eads will have to raise new capital .
forgeard is the target of suspicions , renewed in allegations in a press report on tuesday , that he was aware of the impact of production problems on the group when he decided to exercise stock options .
blames german managers the use of such privileged information , which has not been communicated publicly to market authorities , is known as insider trading and is illegal because it privileges one investor over another , distorts the equitable availability of information and therefore undermines confidence in a stock market .
stock market rules require managers to inform the market quickly if they become aware of a sudden and significant change in their company 's prospects .
forgeard also argued that during his period in various top positions at airbus , the company had become " a world leader , " and that despite the planned loss of 10,000 jobs , " the balance over eight years is positive to the extent of tens of thousands of jobs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delays have plagued the a380 superjumbo he also blamed a large part of the production problems on the attitude of top managers in germany where much of the work on airbus airliners is carried out , saying they wanted to continue doing things their way while he wanted to a single , overall method of working .
this was a reference to revelations that software used for installing cabling systems in hamburg , germany , was not compatible with design software at airbus headquarters in toulouse , france .
problems in adapting complex cabling to the requirements of individual airlines were at the center of the delays to production .
forgeard also launched a personal attack on his co-chair at the time , germany 's thomas enders .
" i ask myself whether he had n't been commissioned by daimler boss jürgen schrempp to neutralize or even get rid of me , " the former manager said .
qatar stays loyal the head of lagardere group , and joint co-chairman of eads , arnaud lagardere was questioned at length on tuesday by stock market regulators probing suspicions that there had been insider trading in eads stock .

users can check them out online at any time of the day and night .
after five days , the items expire and become unusable .
the audio and video files employ microsoft 's wma encoding and can be played on computers and other devices using windows software .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble wants to see a new anti-doping law passed in the bundestag " doping destroys the value of sport , " schäuble said .
" its credibility , its function as a provider of role models and its approval by the public are being put on the test . "
schäuble is meanwhile pressing for a rapid passage through parliament of a new anti-doping law , which among other things would permit lenient treatment for people who come forward to testify .
the government is also examining proposals to ban imports of medicines intended for doping offences .
german chancellor angela merkel has urged cyclists who used performance-enhancing drugs to come clean and break a " cartel of silence . "
" there has evidently been systematic and continued manipulation of unimaginable proportions in professional cycling , " the chancellor said in a statement .
" the confessions and investigations undertaken so far are n't sufficient to clean the sport up . "
new confessions the government 's moves follow doping confessions from riders from the telekom team , now known as t-mobile .
on friday , retired danish cyclist bjarne riis admitted using doping during his 1996 tour de france victory while riding for telekom .
the admission came a day after former teammates erik zabel and rolf aldag confessed they used performance-enhancing drugs while riding for telekom in the 1990s .
four other riders from the team have also admitted doping , but germany 's 1997 tour winner jan ullrich has remained silent .

the university promised a full investigation into the past 20 years of its sports medicine .

heinrich and schmid admitted that as team doctors they were involved in epo blood doping in the mid-1990s at the telekom team .
the german cycling federation bdr on saturday also suspended olympics doctor georg huber after former cyclists jörg müller and christian henn claimed they were given doping substances in the 1980s .
however huber will not face a criminal investigation because any alleged offences were now lapsed under german law , prosecutors said .

milram said they were retaining the 36-year-old rider despite his admission he took epo - a synthetic hormone that stimulates the production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells - in the 1990s .
zabel was applauded by hundreds of spectators at the start of the first stage of the race in garmisch-partenkirchen .
zabel , who has a three-year contract with milram until the end of 2008 , will be allowed to continue his contract for the rest of this year at least , the german-italian team said on tuesday .
zabel has admitted using epo before the tour de france in 1996 , saying he stopped after a week because of side-effects .
in another development , germany 's public broadcasters ard and zdf said they would not initially renew options to cover the tour de france after next year .

us secretary of state condoleezza rice , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and russian foreign minister sergei lavrov will attend the meeting of the quartet , which comprises the united states , the un , the eu and russia .
the potsdam meeting was aimed at preparing the summit of leaders of the group of eight most industrialized nations in heiligendamm , northeast germany , june 6-8 .
the ministers were tackling a range of international crises including the iranian and north korean nuclear programs , afghanistan and kosovo .
but japan poured cold water on one of the issues germany had placed at the top of its priority list for the summit - a binding agreement on reducing greenhouse gases .
divisions over climate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state rice -lrb- l -rrb- was also in potsdam foreign ministry spokesman mitsuo sakaba said german proposals to complete negotiations on a successor to the kyoto protocol on greenhouse gases by 2009 were " premature . "
japan has been leading efforts among asian nations to limit global warming .
it said it believed major emitters of greenhouse gases such as the united states , china and india should agree to join the process before any timetable was put in place .
" until we know if they will join us , it is premature , " sakaba said .
germany took advantage of the presence of rice and lavrov to hastily convene the middle east quartet , the body which drew up the stalled roadmap for peace .
however , faced with the bloodiest internal clashes in lebanon for decades and the firing of palestinian rockets into israel and israeli airstrikes in gaza , expectations for the meeting were low .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive security at the g8 heiligendamm location in potsdam , the minister said they were troubled by the situation in the region and called on the palestinian government to put an end to internal strife and missile attacks against israel , a german delegation source said .
" the spiral of violence must be stopped , " steinmeier told his fellow ministers , the source said .
there was broad agreement that the international community needed to encourage talks between israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmoud abbas .
they urged the palestinian authority to fulfill the demands of the middle east quartet including renouncing violence , recognizing israel and respecting previous agreements with the jewish state .
and they called on israel to unfreeze palestinian tax revenue and customs duties .
kosovo on the agenda the future status of kosovo , an issue that bitterly divides russia and the west , was also on the table in potsdam .
russia rejects proposals by chief un negotiator martti ahtisaari to grant kosovo internationally supervised independence from serbia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some criticize the world 's poorest get lost in the g8 shuffle steinmeier said he expected a clash over the province at the meeting .
" we are going to have a discussion on kosovo that will not be easy , " he said .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner , the un representative for kosovo from 1999-2001 , said the issue was " very difficult . "
russian foreign foreign minister sergei lavrov told reporters he wanted " justice " for kosovo .
the ministers also addressed the situation in strife-torn afghanistan .
afghan foreign minister rangeen dadfar spanta and his pakistani counterpart khurshid kasuri were attending the potsdam talks as part of a german-brokered initiative to resolve a dispute about their joint border .
afghanistan and pakistan have been trading recriminations about growing violence linked to taliban extremists on either side of the border .

forgeard , former joint chief executive at eads which owns airbus , told the magazine le point : " airbus did not report any unrecoverable delay before the middle of april 2006 , and at that time the financial consequences were very limited . "
he repeated that he had " respected all of the rules -lrb- at eads -rrb- which are among the most restrictive among companies quoted on the cac 40 index . "
the controversy and criticism of a big severance payment to forgeard are hot issues in france particularly , where the new government under president nicolas sarkozy has signaled it will act to curb so-called " golden handshakes . "
insider trading ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's forgeard was co-chair of eads from june 2005 - june 2006 forgeard and many other senior managers sold stock options in march last year , three months before the european aeronautics defence and space company and airbus announced serious delays in production of the a380 superjumbo airliner .
two big shareholders in eads , daimlerchrysler in germany and lagardere group in france each decided on march 20 to sell stakes of 7.5 percent .
the group had said in 2005 that there were some problems with production and that it was investigating the extent of these .
but the announcement in june 2006 of deep problems came as a shock to the stock market and the price of shares in eads fell heavily .
the problems rapidly developed into a long crisis with changes in top management and a rescue plan involving the loss of 10,000 jobs , although this remains clouded in some uncertainty .
there is also a prospect that eads will have to raise new capital .
forgeard is the target of suspicions , renewed in allegations in a press report on tuesday , that he was aware of the impact of production problems on the group when he decided to exercise stock options .
blames german managers the use of such privileged information , which has not been communicated publicly to market authorities , is known as insider trading and is illegal because it privileges one investor over another , distorts the equitable availability of information and therefore undermines confidence in a stock market .
stock market rules require managers to inform the market quickly if they become aware of a sudden and significant change in their company 's prospects .
forgeard also argued that during his period in various top positions at airbus , the company had become " a world leader , " and that despite the planned loss of 10,000 jobs , " the balance over eight years is positive to the extent of tens of thousands of jobs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delays have plagued the a380 superjumbo he also blamed a large part of the production problems on the attitude of top managers in germany where much of the work on airbus airliners is carried out , saying they wanted to continue doing things their way while he wanted to a single , overall method of working .
this was a reference to revelations that software used for installing cabling systems in hamburg , germany , was not compatible with design software at airbus headquarters in toulouse , france .
problems in adapting complex cabling to the requirements of individual airlines were at the center of the delays to production .
forgeard also launched a personal attack on his co-chair at the time , germany 's thomas enders .
" i ask myself whether he had n't been commissioned by daimler boss jürgen schrempp to neutralize or even get rid of me , " the former manager said .
qatar stays loyal the head of lagardere group , and joint co-chairman of eads , arnaud lagardere was questioned at length on tuesday by stock market regulators probing suspicions that there had been insider trading in eads stock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus planes are european co-productions both forgeard and lagardere have insisted that they did nothing wrong .
on wednesday , the persian gulf state of qatar signed an order for 80 airbus a350 aircraft worth $ 16 billion , the largest contract to date for the model .
since it was founded in 1994 , qatar airways has only bought airbus planes , including the delay-plagued a380 . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says public funding needed to rescue galileo from delays the european commission said on wednesday that the eu should inject huge amounts of public money into the prestigious galileo satellite navigation system to rescue it from bickering among private-sector investors .

so it 's no coincidence dw-world.de 's top eleven has an average age of just under 25 .
we pay tribute to the players who came up big in the clutch . up front no one player was more important to his team than bochum 's theofanis gekas .
the greek forward went on a tear in the second half of the season , lifting his side from the relegation zone to eighth place in the standings and topping the league with 20 goals .
gekas is moving to leverkusen , where he 'll have to show that 2006-7 was no fluke .
until then , he can take pride in a breakthrough season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gekas provided a lot of greek tragedy for defenses mario gomez had 14 goals and eight assists , fewer than bremen 's miroslav klose , but that was due to injury .
and unlike klose , gomez finished the season strongly , scoring a crucial equalizer in the second-to-last game to keep stuttgart 's title drive on track .
at the tender age of 21 , he 's poised to become a regular in the german national squad . on the bench : klose -lrb- bremen -rrb- , kuranyi -lrb- schalke -rrb- , zidan -lrb- mainz -rrb- , frei -lrb- dortmund -rrb- the midfield the players themselves voted bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego the season 's mvp , and they get no argument here .
thirteen goals and 14 assists in his first season in the bundesliga speak volumes , and the truly scary thing is : he 's only 22 ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's dribbling skills stymied opposing midfielders diego is joined by two rising young stars from stuttgart who had a huge impact this spring .
thomas hitzls per ger , nicknamed the " hammer , " has the hardest shot in the german game , and he scored in each of stuttgart 's final two come-from-behind wins . like hitzlsperger , roberto hilbert finished the season with seven goals , four of which came during the streak of eight straight wins that sealed the title for stuttgart .
he deservedly won his first cap for the german national side during that stretch , and it 's easy to picture him , at only 22 , getting better and better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzlsperger scored some of the season 's most spectacular goals completing our dream midfield is leverkusen 's bernd schneider .
one of the league 's most consistent and technically proficient players , the 33-year-old veteran had six goals and 11 eleven assists .
more importantly , he held things together on a team that was n't clicking early , leading leverkusen to fifth place and a spot in the uefa cup . on the bench : frings -lrb- bremen -rrb- , pardo -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- , marcelinho -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- , misimovic -lrb- bochum -rrb- at the back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : led by bordon , schalke only conceded 32 goals nuremberg and schalke had the league 's stingiest defenses , so they 're the place we start building our back four .
at left back , the honors go to nuremberg 's javier pinola .
the spaniard with the league 's worst hairstyle really performed in nuremberg 's german cup triumph , scoring twice in penalty shoot-outs to keep his side alive in the tournament and adding a clutch assist in the final . in the middle , no defender was more intimidating than schalke 's marcelo bordon .
a devout catholic he may be , but his christian charity certainly does not extend to opposing strikers in the box .
bordon also scored three goals as schalke , once again , came up tragically short . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delpierre completely shut down bayern in a key match in april he 's paired with stuttgart 's unsung hero , matthieu delpierre .
the frenchman made very few mistakes this season despite playing in all but one of the team 's league and cup matches .
what 's more he was able to stay in front of his man without fouling , picking up only four yellow cards over that long stretch . schalke 's rafinha fills out the back line .
he ended the season with a respectable two goals and three assists , but what does n't show up in the statistics is the amount of pressure the speedy brazilian created on the right-hand flank .
at only 22 he played with a maturity and acumen way beyond his years . on the bench : naldo -lrb- bremen -rrb- , mertesecker -lrb- bremen -rrb- , wolf -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- , madlung -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- between the posts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuer 's colleagues in the bundesliga also voted him the season 's best keeper and what 's true of rafinha goes double for schalke keeper manuel neuer .
the 21-year-old deposed one of the league 's most seasoned number ones , frank rost , in the tenth week , and for the rest of the season he never conceded more than two goals in a match .
and he did that in the high-pressure atmosphere of schalke , which was gunning for its first german league title in 49 years .
if his teammates up front had n't frozen up against dortmund , neuer could have capped off a remarkable rookie season with the bundesliga 's ultimate prize . on the bench : schäfer -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuremberg claim german cup with late scorcher danish midfielder jan kristiansen was the star on saturday night with a 30-meter blast in extra-time .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble wants to see a new anti-doping law passed in the bundestag " doping destroys the value of sport , " schäuble said .
" its credibility , its function as a provider of role models and its approval by the public are being put on the test . "
schäuble is meanwhile pressing for a rapid passage through parliament of a new anti-doping law , which among other things would permit lenient treatment for people who come forward to testify .
the government is also examining proposals to ban imports of medicines intended for doping offences .
german chancellor angela merkel has urged cyclists who used performance-enhancing drugs to come clean and break a " cartel of silence . "
" there has evidently been systematic and continued manipulation of unimaginable proportions in professional cycling , " the chancellor said in a statement .
" the confessions and investigations undertaken so far are n't sufficient to clean the sport up . "
new confessions the government 's moves follow doping confessions from riders from the telekom team , now known as t-mobile .
on friday , retired danish cyclist bjarne riis admitted using doping during his 1996 tour de france victory while riding for telekom .
the admission came a day after former teammates erik zabel and rolf aldag confessed they used performance-enhancing drugs while riding for telekom in the 1990s .
four other riders from the team have also admitted doping , but germany 's 1997 tour winner jan ullrich has remained silent .
no comment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich ended his career amidst speculations that he , too , used illegal substances ullrich 's manager wolfgang strohband has said his client would not speak about a claim made by former telekom team masseur jef d 'hont , who told the newspaper bild this week he had injected the cyclist with the erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- blood booster on one occasion .
freiburg university on thursday dismissed its doctors andreas schmid and lothar heinrich after they admitted giving athletes doping substances .
the university promised a full investigation into the past 20 years of its sports medicine .
nationwide scope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the image of cycling has been tarnished public prosecutors in freiburg meanwhile said they had handed an investigation into schmid and heinrich over to the federal criminal police department -lrb- bka -rrb- in view of the nationwide scope of the probe .
heinrich and schmid admitted that as team doctors they were involved in epo blood doping in the mid-1990s at the telekom team .
the german cycling federation bdr on saturday also suspended olympics doctor georg huber after former cyclists jörg müller and christian henn claimed they were given doping substances in the 1980s .
however huber will not face a criminal investigation because any alleged offences were now lapsed under german law , prosecutors said .
it 's all history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik zabel has been allowed to keep competing zabel , a six-time tour de france sprint champion , on wednesday started the bavarian tour race for the milram team .
milram said they were retaining the 36-year-old rider despite his admission he took epo - a synthetic hormone that stimulates the production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells - in the 1990s .
zabel was applauded by hundreds of spectators at the start of the first stage of the race in garmisch-partenkirchen .
zabel , who has a three-year contract with milram until the end of 2008 , will be allowed to continue his contract for the rest of this year at least , the german-italian team said on tuesday .
zabel has admitted using epo before the tour de france in 1996 , saying he stopped after a week because of side-effects .
in another development , germany 's public broadcasters ard and zdf said they would not initially renew options to cover the tour de france after next year .
zdf chief editor nikolaus brender said the contract would not be renewed " until we can be sure that doping has no more chance at the tour de france .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble wants to see a new anti-doping law passed in the bundestag " doping destroys the value of sport , " schäuble said .
" its credibility , its function as a provider of role models and its approval by the public are being put on the test . "
schäuble is meanwhile pressing for a rapid passage through parliament of a new anti-doping law , which among other things would permit lenient treatment for people who come forward to testify .
the government is also examining proposals to ban imports of medicines intended for doping offences .
german chancellor angela merkel has urged cyclists who used performance-enhancing drugs to come clean and break a " cartel of silence . "
" there has evidently been systematic and continued manipulation of unimaginable proportions in professional cycling , " the chancellor said in a statement .
" the confessions and investigations undertaken so far are n't sufficient to clean the sport up . "
new confessions the government 's moves follow doping confessions from riders from the telekom team , now known as t-mobile .
on friday , retired danish cyclist bjarne riis admitted using doping during his 1996 tour de france victory while riding for telekom .
the admission came a day after former teammates erik zabel and rolf aldag confessed they used performance-enhancing drugs while riding for telekom in the 1990s .
four other riders from the team have also admitted doping , but germany 's 1997 tour winner jan ullrich has remained silent .

heinrich and schmid admitted that as team doctors they were involved in epo blood doping in the mid-1990s at the telekom team .
the german cycling federation bdr on saturday also suspended olympics doctor georg huber after former cyclists jörg müller and christian henn claimed they were given doping substances in the 1980s .
however huber will not face a criminal investigation because any alleged offences were now lapsed under german law , prosecutors said .

zabel was applauded by hundreds of spectators at the start of the first stage of the race in garmisch-partenkirchen .
zabel , who has a three-year contract with milram until the end of 2008 , will be allowed to continue his contract for the rest of this year at least , the german-italian team said on tuesday .
zabel has admitted using epo before the tour de france in 1996 , saying he stopped after a week because of side-effects .

it 's just one of a series of tight , yet controversial security measures . german television pictures showed shots of the 2.5-meter -lrb- 2.7 yard -rrb- metal fence , topped with barbed wire , that runs 11.6 kilometers -lrb- 7.2 miles -rrb- around the town .
early wednesday morning , authorities closed off the two access points leading to the resort in heiligendamm .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations have been going on for weeks across germany with the fence being a general security precaution , the controversial measures are also designed to keep anti-globalization demonstrators well away from the world leaders attending the summit .
protestors , however , have called the security steps excessive .
pricey security about 16,000 members of the security forces , more than five percent of germany 's total , will be on duty in the town to deal with what could be as many as 100,000 protestors .
the security operation has been the focus of heated debate , not least because of its 12.5 million-euro -lrb- $ 16.8 million -rrb- price tag .
most normal traffic will be banned from the zone until june 9 , a day after the summit 's end .
only local residents , delivery vehicles and the hotel staff looking after the high-powered delegations will be allowed through the two checkpoints in the 2.5 meter -lrb- 8 foot -rrb- -tall metal and concrete fence that creates the the security zone .
around 1,000 people will be issued with special badges .

the german government had wanted to keep protestors out of sight of the fence .

it 's just one of a series of tight , yet controversial security measures . german television pictures showed shots of the 2.5-meter -lrb- 2.7 yard -rrb- metal fence , topped with barbed wire , that runs 11.6 kilometers -lrb- 7.2 miles -rrb- around the town .
early wednesday morning , authorities closed off the two access points leading to the resort in heiligendamm .
the closure also affects a railway line and a road through the resort ; boats are banned from the area near the shore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations have been going on for weeks across germany with the fence being a general security precaution , the controversial measures are also designed to keep anti-globalization demonstrators well away from the world leaders attending the summit .
protestors , however , have called the security steps excessive .
pricey security about 16,000 members of the security forces , more than five percent of germany 's total , will be on duty in the town to deal with what could be as many as 100,000 protestors .
the security operation has been the focus of heated debate , not least because of its 12.5 million-euro -lrb- $ 16.8 million -rrb- price tag .
most normal traffic will be banned from the zone until june 9 , a day after the summit 's end .
only local residents , delivery vehicles and the hotel staff looking after the high-powered delegations will be allowed through the two checkpoints in the 2.5 meter -lrb- 8 foot -rrb- -tall metal and concrete fence that creates the the security zone .
around 1,000 people will be issued with special badges .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators broke through a police line in gleneagles in 2005 on friday , a german court partially overruled a ban on demonstrations within a radius of five kilometres -lrb- three miles -rrb- of the baltic sea resort .
the court in schwerin in northeastern germany said protests should be allowed on the other side of a security fence encircling the hotel where leaders of the group of eight most-industrialized nations will gather .
the german government had wanted to keep protestors out of sight of the fence .

the well-preserved passport , issued in 1948 by an italian delegation of the international committee of the red cross , was presented on tuesday at the buenos aires holocaust museum .
it also bears the stamp and the signature of the argentine vice-counsel in genova , italy at that time , pedro solari capurro .
a factory worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eichmann was sentenced to death by an israeli court federal judge maria servini de cubria recently opened the eichmann file and found the well-preserved passport , graciela jinich , the director of the buenos aires holocaust museum , told dpa news service .
eichmann 's wife had presented the passport to authorities in 1960 after he had been abducted by israeli secret service agents from the buenos aires suburb where he lived a normal life working at the mercedes benz factory .
he was taken to israel , tried for crimes against humanity and hanged in 1962 .
" this document leaves no room for doubts on how easy it was for not only eichmann , but also other war criminals , to attain fake identification documents , change their names and enter our country , " jinich said .
suppressed information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eichmann was one of the leaders of the mass deportation of jews to extermination camps the united states released documents last year which showed that the cia learned about eichmann 's location and alias two years before israel captured him but kept the information secret as part of its efforts to combat communism in post-war west germany .
they also showed that the united states used a large network of spies recruited among former nazis and that the cia had virtually no interest in arresting war criminals , focusing instead on cold war issues .
" the american policy of the time was not to pursue nazi war criminals , " said historian timothy naftali , who reviewed thousands of documents on cia ties to nazis from the us national archives .
" they thought that was the responsibility of the germans . "
according to the cia papers , west germany knew from 1952 that eichmann was hiding in argentina under an assumed identity , but kept quiet about it fearing the fugitive might talk about hans globke , a former nazi who was a top national security advisor to konrad adenauer , the chancellor at the time . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " this is a german story " in an interview with dw-world.de , us historian timothy naftali says germans should pressure their own government to receive more information on the role of nazis in german government after 1945 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 30.05.2007 " the possibility of an eu-iran agreement is small " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is iran asking for too much in return for reducing its support of insurgents in iraq ?
iran expert alex bigham spoke with dw-world.de about thursday 's meeting between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iranian nuclear negotiator ali larijani .
iran wants proliferation and recognition , he said . dw-world.de : mr. bigham , what is your assessment of monday 's meeting in baghdad between the us and iranian ambassadors to iraq ?
alex bigham : i certainly think the talks are a positive sign , and this may be a tentative start of a period of cooling off in relations .
there has been an indication from the iranians of a willingness to meet in a month 's time , which is a welcome sign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana -lrb- left -rrb- and larijani at a meeting in berlin last september the talks are limited of course , really to one issue : iraq .
there are obvious reasons why america would want to seek iranian help in iraq - in order to improve stability in the country and to reduce the flow of funds and arms to insurgents who are attacking coalition forces .
the difficult question is why iran would want to assist coalition forces .
there will no doubt be elements in iran who want the americans to remain bogged down in iraq because they see that as a buffer to a possible attack on iran .
but it seems that those advocating dialogue both in washington and tehran are winning the argument for the moment .
they want to see stability on iran 's border with iraq , an area which has suffered from terrorist acts against the iranian government .
it 's certainly in iran 's long term self-interest to improve security and stability in iraq . iran 's nuclear program had not been on the agenda .
are you nevertheless surprised that the issue did not arise ? i am not surprised it was n't discussed .
neither side wants to be seen to be compromising on the nuclear issue at this stage , given domestic pressures in both iran and america .
the us does n't want to replicate or divert attention from the iaea , un and eu structures .
they deliberately want this to be seen as a disagreement between iran and the international community , not between iran and america . will monday 's talks have an impact on javier solana 's meeting with the iranian nuclear negotiator ali larijani on thursday ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intransigency on both sides blocks europe 's negotiations , said bigham the baghdad talks may offer some kind of reassurance to the iranian government in terms of the likelihood of military action , but there will need to be concrete results in order for the americans to be convinced of progress .
although the baghdad talks may help as a confidence-building measure , which is welcome , necessary , and frankly overdue , both the eu and iran are seeing the discussions on iran 's nuclear program as a separate issue from the future of iraq . what approach do you expect solana to take ? solana 's approach is not to engage in a negotiation directly about the nuclear issue , but to try to get an agreement to have a negotiation which would involve the p5 + 1 -lrb- editor 's note : the five per manent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the us - plus germany -rrb- .
however , the sticking point is the precondition the us has set that iran suspends uranium enrichment before negotiations .
the iranians have repeatedly ruled out the possibility of talks with any preconditions . what do you expect to come out of the talks ? there does n't seem to have been a fundamental shift in either side 's position , so the possibility of an agreement is small .
the difficulty in separating the issues of iraq and the nuclear program is that iran seems to want two things in return for reducing its support for insurgents in iraq : proliferation and recognition of its regional role .
these are effectively red lines for the americans , which make overcoming the stalemate a difficult , long term process . do you agree with the eu 's policy towards iran ?
what should the eu be doing differently ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayatollah khamenei is the main decision-maker on iran 's foreign and security policies the eu has made a great deal of effort to negotiate to iran .
the main barriers to progress are the relative intransigency of both the iranian and the american position on the nuclear issue .
another problem is the internal divisions within iran .
larijani is clearly a growing political player in tehran for the moment , but it is the supreme leader , khamenei who will make the final decision on iran 's security and foreign policy .
ayatollah khamenei is reluctant to make a final decision on the nuclear issues for fear of alienating one of the factions in iranian politics and undermining his own position .
one option that needs renewed consideration is el baradei 's proposal of a mutual " time-out " - iran suspending enrichment while the un suspends sanctions .
that is one option that should at least be put on the table .

the number of officers , which include the some 40 german representatives already there , is to be expanded to around 160 over the course of the mission .
a burgeoning drug trade , widespread corruption and insurgent violence are among the challenges the local police are preparing for .
mission includes southern regions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currently over 40 german police officers are working with 3,500 afghan trainees the mission 's main objective is " to improve cohesion and coordination -lrb- of afghan police -rrb- through mentoring , monitoring , advising and training , " said brigadier general friedrich eichele , the german mission commander who will head the eu task force .
police trainers would be armed for purposes of self-defence , but would have to rely on the nato-led isaf peacekeeping force for protection , said eichele , who added that the running costs for the first year would amount to 43.6 million euros -lrb- $ 58.8 million -rrb- .
dubbed eupol , the german-run mission will be headquartered in the capital city of kabul but will encompass regions throughout afghanistan including southern provinces where insurgent fighting has been most intense , said eu special representative for afghanistan francesc vendrell tuesday from brussels .
recent civilian deaths in the region have sparked concerns that the local population has lost faith in the international peacekeeping force . a minimum contribution for vendrell , the project does n't go far enough .
" i think that the eu has decided to play as big a role as possible , unfortunately not as big as i would have liked , " added vendrell , who said he would have like to have seen it at the same size as the mission in kosovo .
the eu is planning to send 1,500 police trainers if the breakaway serb province wins independence .

analysts have said that rampant drug trade and corruption are fuelling the insurgency .
according to un estimates , some 300 illegal armed groups exist in the country .
the us has also put pressure on the eu to speed up progress .
until now , germany has been the main european country involved in police training in afghanistan and has trained some 17,000 local law enforcement officers since 2002 .
an existing us police mission in afghanistan involves 500 trainers , including members of private security companies .
eupol is meant to complement the american force .
the war-torn country currently has a police force of 60,000 , which is ill-equipped and riddled by corruption .
according to international estimates , some 82,000 officers are needed .

pricey security about 16,000 members of the security forces , more than five percent of germany 's total , will be on duty in the town to deal with what could be as many as 100,000 protestors .
the security operation has been the focus of heated debate , not least because of its 12.5 million-euro -lrb- $ 16.8 million -rrb- price tag .
most normal traffic will be banned from the zone until june 9 , a day after the summit 's end .
only local residents , delivery vehicles and the hotel staff looking after the high-powered delegations will be allowed through the two checkpoints in the 2.5 meter -lrb- 8 foot -rrb- -tall metal and concrete fence that creates the the security zone .

us secretary of state condoleezza rice , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and russian foreign minister sergei lavrov will attend the meeting of the quartet , which comprises the united states , the un , the eu and russia .
the potsdam meeting was aimed at preparing the summit of leaders of the group of eight most industrialized nations in heiligendamm , northeast germany , june 6-8 .
the ministers were tackling a range of international crises including the iranian and north korean nuclear programs , afghanistan and kosovo .
but japan poured cold water on one of the issues germany had placed at the top of its priority list for the summit - a binding agreement on reducing greenhouse gases .
divisions over climate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state rice -lrb- l -rrb- was also in potsdam foreign ministry spokesman mitsuo sakaba said german proposals to complete negotiations on a successor to the kyoto protocol on greenhouse gases by 2009 were " premature . "
japan has been leading efforts among asian nations to limit global warming .
it said it believed major emitters of greenhouse gases such as the united states , china and india should agree to join the process before any timetable was put in place .
" until we know if they will join us , it is premature , " sakaba said .
germany took advantage of the presence of rice and lavrov to hastily convene the middle east quartet , the body which drew up the stalled roadmap for peace .
however , faced with the bloodiest internal clashes in lebanon for decades and the firing of palestinian rockets into israel and israeli airstrikes in gaza , expectations for the meeting were low .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive security at the g8 heiligendamm location in potsdam , the minister said they were troubled by the situation in the region and called on the palestinian government to put an end to internal strife and missile attacks against israel , a german delegation source said .
" the spiral of violence must be stopped , " steinmeier told his fellow ministers , the source said .
there was broad agreement that the international community needed to encourage talks between israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmoud abbas .
they urged the palestinian authority to fulfill the demands of the middle east quartet including renouncing violence , recognizing israel and respecting previous agreements with the jewish state .
and they called on israel to unfreeze palestinian tax revenue and customs duties .
kosovo on the agenda the future status of kosovo , an issue that bitterly divides russia and the west , was also on the table in potsdam .
russia rejects proposals by chief un negotiator martti ahtisaari to grant kosovo internationally supervised independence from serbia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some criticize the world 's poorest get lost in the g8 shuffle steinmeier said he expected a clash over the province at the meeting .
" we are going to have a discussion on kosovo that will not be easy , " he said .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner , the un representative for kosovo from 1999-2001 , said the issue was " very difficult . "
russian foreign foreign minister sergei lavrov told reporters he wanted " justice " for kosovo .
the ministers also addressed the situation in strife-torn afghanistan .
afghan foreign minister rangeen dadfar spanta and his pakistani counterpart khurshid kasuri were attending the potsdam talks as part of a german-brokered initiative to resolve a dispute about their joint border .

so it 's no coincidence dw-world.de 's top eleven has an average age of just under 25 .
we pay tribute to the players who came up big in the clutch . up front no one player was more important to his team than bochum 's theofanis gekas .
the greek forward went on a tear in the second half of the season , lifting his side from the relegation zone to eighth place in the standings and topping the league with 20 goals .
gekas is moving to leverkusen , where he 'll have to show that 2006-7 was no fluke .
until then , he can take pride in a breakthrough season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gekas provided a lot of greek tragedy for defenses mario gomez had 14 goals and eight assists , fewer than bremen 's miroslav klose , but that was due to injury .
and unlike klose , gomez finished the season strongly , scoring a crucial equalizer in the second-to-last game to keep stuttgart 's title drive on track .
at the tender age of 21 , he 's poised to become a regular in the german national squad . on the bench : klose -lrb- bremen -rrb- , kuranyi -lrb- schalke -rrb- , zidan -lrb- mainz -rrb- , frei -lrb- dortmund -rrb- the midfield the players themselves voted bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego the season 's mvp , and they get no argument here .
thirteen goals and 14 assists in his first season in the bundesliga speak volumes , and the truly scary thing is : he 's only 22 ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's dribbling skills stymied opposing midfielders diego is joined by two rising young stars from stuttgart who had a huge impact this spring .
thomas hitzls per ger , nicknamed the " hammer , " has the hardest shot in the german game , and he scored in each of stuttgart 's final two come-from-behind wins . like hitzlsperger , roberto hilbert finished the season with seven goals , four of which came during the streak of eight straight wins that sealed the title for stuttgart .
he deservedly won his first cap for the german national side during that stretch , and it 's easy to picture him , at only 22 , getting better and better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzlsperger scored some of the season 's most spectacular goals completing our dream midfield is leverkusen 's bernd schneider .
one of the league 's most consistent and technically proficient players , the 33-year-old veteran had six goals and 11 eleven assists .
more importantly , he held things together on a team that was n't clicking early , leading leverkusen to fifth place and a spot in the uefa cup . on the bench : frings -lrb- bremen -rrb- , pardo -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- , marcelinho -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- , misimovic -lrb- bochum -rrb- at the back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : led by bordon , schalke only conceded 32 goals nuremberg and schalke had the league 's stingiest defenses , so they 're the place we start building our back four .
at left back , the honors go to nuremberg 's javier pinola .
the spaniard with the league 's worst hairstyle really performed in nuremberg 's german cup triumph , scoring twice in penalty shoot-outs to keep his side alive in the tournament and adding a clutch assist in the final . in the middle , no defender was more intimidating than schalke 's marcelo bordon .
a devout catholic he may be , but his christian charity certainly does not extend to opposing strikers in the box .
bordon also scored three goals as schalke , once again , came up tragically short . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delpierre completely shut down bayern in a key match in april he 's paired with stuttgart 's unsung hero , matthieu delpierre .
the frenchman made very few mistakes this season despite playing in all but one of the team 's league and cup matches .
what 's more he was able to stay in front of his man without fouling , picking up only four yellow cards over that long stretch . schalke 's rafinha fills out the back line .
he ended the season with a respectable two goals and three assists , but what does n't show up in the statistics is the amount of pressure the speedy brazilian created on the right-hand flank .
at only 22 he played with a maturity and acumen way beyond his years . on the bench : naldo -lrb- bremen -rrb- , mertesecker -lrb- bremen -rrb- , wolf -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- , madlung -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- between the posts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuer 's colleagues in the bundesliga also voted him the season 's best keeper and what 's true of rafinha goes double for schalke keeper manuel neuer .
the 21-year-old deposed one of the league 's most seasoned number ones , frank rost , in the tenth week , and for the rest of the season he never conceded more than two goals in a match .
and he did that in the high-pressure atmosphere of schalke , which was gunning for its first german league title in 49 years .
if his teammates up front had n't frozen up against dortmund , neuer could have capped off a remarkable rookie season with the bundesliga 's ultimate prize . on the bench : schäfer -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuremberg claim german cup with late scorcher danish midfielder jan kristiansen was the star on saturday night with a 30-meter blast in extra-time .

it 's just one of a series of tight , yet controversial security measures . german television pictures showed shots of the 2.5-meter -lrb- 2.7 yard -rrb- metal fence , topped with barbed wire , that runs 11.6 kilometers -lrb- 7.2 miles -rrb- around the town .
early wednesday morning , authorities closed off the two access points leading to the resort in heiligendamm .
the closure also affects a railway line and a road through the resort ; boats are banned from the area near the shore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations have been going on for weeks across germany with the fence being a general security precaution , the controversial measures are also designed to keep anti-globalization demonstrators well away from the world leaders attending the summit .
protestors , however , have called the security steps excessive .
pricey security about 16,000 members of the security forces , more than five percent of germany 's total , will be on duty in the town to deal with what could be as many as 100,000 protestors .
the security operation has been the focus of heated debate , not least because of its 12.5 million-euro -lrb- $ 16.8 million -rrb- price tag .
most normal traffic will be banned from the zone until june 9 , a day after the summit 's end .
only local residents , delivery vehicles and the hotel staff looking after the high-powered delegations will be allowed through the two checkpoints in the 2.5 meter -lrb- 8 foot -rrb- -tall metal and concrete fence that creates the the security zone .
around 1,000 people will be issued with special badges .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 30.05.2007 " the possibility of an eu-iran agreement is small " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is iran asking for too much in return for reducing its support of insurgents in iraq ?
iran expert alex bigham spoke with dw-world.de about thursday 's meeting between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iranian nuclear negotiator ali larijani .
iran wants proliferation and recognition , he said . dw-world.de : mr. bigham , what is your assessment of monday 's meeting in baghdad between the us and iranian ambassadors to iraq ?
alex bigham : i certainly think the talks are a positive sign , and this may be a tentative start of a period of cooling off in relations .
there has been an indication from the iranians of a willingness to meet in a month 's time , which is a welcome sign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana -lrb- left -rrb- and larijani at a meeting in berlin last september the talks are limited of course , really to one issue : iraq .
there are obvious reasons why america would want to seek iranian help in iraq - in order to improve stability in the country and to reduce the flow of funds and arms to insurgents who are attacking coalition forces .
the difficult question is why iran would want to assist coalition forces .
there will no doubt be elements in iran who want the americans to remain bogged down in iraq because they see that as a buffer to a possible attack on iran .
but it seems that those advocating dialogue both in washington and tehran are winning the argument for the moment .
they want to see stability on iran 's border with iraq , an area which has suffered from terrorist acts against the iranian government .
it 's certainly in iran 's long term self-interest to improve security and stability in iraq . iran 's nuclear program had not been on the agenda .
are you nevertheless surprised that the issue did not arise ? i am not surprised it was n't discussed .
neither side wants to be seen to be compromising on the nuclear issue at this stage , given domestic pressures in both iran and america .
the us does n't want to replicate or divert attention from the iaea , un and eu structures .
they deliberately want this to be seen as a disagreement between iran and the international community , not between iran and america . will monday 's talks have an impact on javier solana 's meeting with the iranian nuclear negotiator ali larijani on thursday ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intransigency on both sides blocks europe 's negotiations , said bigham the baghdad talks may offer some kind of reassurance to the iranian government in terms of the likelihood of military action , but there will need to be concrete results in order for the americans to be convinced of progress .
although the baghdad talks may help as a confidence-building measure , which is welcome , necessary , and frankly overdue , both the eu and iran are seeing the discussions on iran 's nuclear program as a separate issue from the future of iraq . what approach do you expect solana to take ? solana 's approach is not to engage in a negotiation directly about the nuclear issue , but to try to get an agreement to have a negotiation which would involve the p5 + 1 -lrb- editor 's note : the five per manent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the us - plus germany -rrb- .
however , the sticking point is the precondition the us has set that iran suspends uranium enrichment before negotiations .
the iranians have repeatedly ruled out the possibility of talks with any preconditions . what do you expect to come out of the talks ? there does n't seem to have been a fundamental shift in either side 's position , so the possibility of an agreement is small .
the difficulty in separating the issues of iraq and the nuclear program is that iran seems to want two things in return for reducing its support for insurgents in iraq : proliferation and recognition of its regional role .
these are effectively red lines for the americans , which make overcoming the stalemate a difficult , long term process . do you agree with the eu 's policy towards iran ?
what should the eu be doing differently ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayatollah khamenei is the main decision-maker on iran 's foreign and security policies the eu has made a great deal of effort to negotiate to iran .
the main barriers to progress are the relative intransigency of both the iranian and the american position on the nuclear issue .
another problem is the internal divisions within iran .
larijani is clearly a growing political player in tehran for the moment , but it is the supreme leader , khamenei who will make the final decision on iran 's security and foreign policy .
ayatollah khamenei is reluctant to make a final decision on the nuclear issues for fear of alienating one of the factions in iranian politics and undermining his own position .
one option that needs renewed consideration is el baradei 's proposal of a mutual " time-out " - iran suspending enrichment while the un suspends sanctions .
that is one option that should at least be put on the table .

the number of officers , which include the some 40 german representatives already there , is to be expanded to around 160 over the course of the mission .
a burgeoning drug trade , widespread corruption and insurgent violence are among the challenges the local police are preparing for .
mission includes southern regions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currently over 40 german police officers are working with 3,500 afghan trainees the mission 's main objective is " to improve cohesion and coordination -lrb- of afghan police -rrb- through mentoring , monitoring , advising and training , " said brigadier general friedrich eichele , the german mission commander who will head the eu task force .
police trainers would be armed for purposes of self-defence , but would have to rely on the nato-led isaf peacekeeping force for protection , said eichele , who added that the running costs for the first year would amount to 43.6 million euros -lrb- $ 58.8 million -rrb- .
dubbed eupol , the german-run mission will be headquartered in the capital city of kabul but will encompass regions throughout afghanistan including southern provinces where insurgent fighting has been most intense , said eu special representative for afghanistan francesc vendrell tuesday from brussels .
recent civilian deaths in the region have sparked concerns that the local population has lost faith in the international peacekeeping force . a minimum contribution for vendrell , the project does n't go far enough .
" i think that the eu has decided to play as big a role as possible , unfortunately not as big as i would have liked , " added vendrell , who said he would have like to have seen it at the same size as the mission in kosovo .
the eu is planning to send 1,500 police trainers if the breakaway serb province wins independence .
drugs and corruption fuelling insurgency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un estimated that poppy cultivation in 2006 increased by 59 percent over 2005 late last year , nato requested that the eu take charge of building up the police training project .
analysts have said that rampant drug trade and corruption are fuelling the insurgency .
according to un estimates , some 300 illegal armed groups exist in the country .
the us has also put pressure on the eu to speed up progress .
until now , germany has been the main european country involved in police training in afghanistan and has trained some 17,000 local law enforcement officers since 2002 .
an existing us police mission in afghanistan involves 500 trainers , including members of private security companies .
eupol is meant to complement the american force .
the war-torn country currently has a police force of 60,000 , which is ill-equipped and riddled by corruption .
according to international estimates , some 82,000 officers are needed .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 30.05.2007 young stars shone brightest in 2006-7 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league was dominated by players in their early twenties in an unusual season , stuttgart took the title with a team of youngsters .
so it 's no coincidence dw-world.de 's top eleven has an average age of just under 25 .
we pay tribute to the players who came up big in the clutch . up front no one player was more important to his team than bochum 's theofanis gekas .
the greek forward went on a tear in the second half of the season , lifting his side from the relegation zone to eighth place in the standings and topping the league with 20 goals .
gekas is moving to leverkusen , where he 'll have to show that 2006-7 was no fluke .
until then , he can take pride in a breakthrough season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gekas provided a lot of greek tragedy for defenses mario gomez had 14 goals and eight assists , fewer than bremen 's miroslav klose , but that was due to injury .
and unlike klose , gomez finished the season strongly , scoring a crucial equalizer in the second-to-last game to keep stuttgart 's title drive on track .
at the tender age of 21 , he 's poised to become a regular in the german national squad . on the bench : klose -lrb- bremen -rrb- , kuranyi -lrb- schalke -rrb- , zidan -lrb- mainz -rrb- , frei -lrb- dortmund -rrb- the midfield the players themselves voted bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego the season 's mvp , and they get no argument here .
thirteen goals and 14 assists in his first season in the bundesliga speak volumes , and the truly scary thing is : he 's only 22 ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's dribbling skills stymied opposing midfielders diego is joined by two rising young stars from stuttgart who had a huge impact this spring .
thomas hitzls per ger , nicknamed the " hammer , " has the hardest shot in the german game , and he scored in each of stuttgart 's final two come-from-behind wins . like hitzlsperger , roberto hilbert finished the season with seven goals , four of which came during the streak of eight straight wins that sealed the title for stuttgart .
he deservedly won his first cap for the german national side during that stretch , and it 's easy to picture him , at only 22 , getting better and better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzlsperger scored some of the season 's most spectacular goals completing our dream midfield is leverkusen 's bernd schneider .
one of the league 's most consistent and technically proficient players , the 33-year-old veteran had six goals and 11 eleven assists .
more importantly , he held things together on a team that was n't clicking early , leading leverkusen to fifth place and a spot in the uefa cup . on the bench : frings -lrb- bremen -rrb- , pardo -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- , marcelinho -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- , misimovic -lrb- bochum -rrb- at the back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : led by bordon , schalke only conceded 32 goals nuremberg and schalke had the league 's stingiest defenses , so they 're the place we start building our back four .
at left back , the honors go to nuremberg 's javier pinola .
the spaniard with the league 's worst hairstyle really performed in nuremberg 's german cup triumph , scoring twice in penalty shoot-outs to keep his side alive in the tournament and adding a clutch assist in the final . in the middle , no defender was more intimidating than schalke 's marcelo bordon .
a devout catholic he may be , but his christian charity certainly does not extend to opposing strikers in the box .
bordon also scored three goals as schalke , once again , came up tragically short . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delpierre completely shut down bayern in a key match in april he 's paired with stuttgart 's unsung hero , matthieu delpierre .
the frenchman made very few mistakes this season despite playing in all but one of the team 's league and cup matches .
what 's more he was able to stay in front of his man without fouling , picking up only four yellow cards over that long stretch . schalke 's rafinha fills out the back line .
he ended the season with a respectable two goals and three assists , but what does n't show up in the statistics is the amount of pressure the speedy brazilian created on the right-hand flank .
at only 22 he played with a maturity and acumen way beyond his years . on the bench : naldo -lrb- bremen -rrb- , mertesecker -lrb- bremen -rrb- , wolf -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- , madlung -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- between the posts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuer 's colleagues in the bundesliga also voted him the season 's best keeper and what 's true of rafinha goes double for schalke keeper manuel neuer .
the 21-year-old deposed one of the league 's most seasoned number ones , frank rost , in the tenth week , and for the rest of the season he never conceded more than two goals in a match .
and he did that in the high-pressure atmosphere of schalke , which was gunning for its first german league title in 49 years .
if his teammates up front had n't frozen up against dortmund , neuer could have capped off a remarkable rookie season with the bundesliga 's ultimate prize . on the bench : schäfer -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuremberg claim german cup with late scorcher danish midfielder jan kristiansen was the star on saturday night with a 30-meter blast in extra-time .

thirteen goals and 14 assists in his first season in the bundesliga speak volumes , and the truly scary thing is : he 's only 22 ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's dribbling skills stymied opposing midfielders diego is joined by two rising young stars from stuttgart who had a huge impact this spring .
thomas hitzls per ger , nicknamed the " hammer , " has the hardest shot in the german game , and he scored in each of stuttgart 's final two come-from-behind wins . like hitzlsperger , roberto hilbert finished the season with seven goals , four of which came during the streak of eight straight wins that sealed the title for stuttgart .
he deservedly won his first cap for the german national side during that stretch , and it 's easy to picture him , at only 22 , getting better and better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzlsperger scored some of the season 's most spectacular goals completing our dream midfield is leverkusen 's bernd schneider .
one of the league 's most consistent and technically proficient players , the 33-year-old veteran had six goals and 11 eleven assists .
more importantly , he held things together on a team that was n't clicking early , leading leverkusen to fifth place and a spot in the uefa cup . on the bench : frings -lrb- bremen -rrb- , pardo -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- , marcelinho -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- , misimovic -lrb- bochum -rrb- at the back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : led by bordon , schalke only conceded 32 goals nuremberg and schalke had the league 's stingiest defenses , so they 're the place we start building our back four .
at left back , the honors go to nuremberg 's javier pinola .
the spaniard with the league 's worst hairstyle really performed in nuremberg 's german cup triumph , scoring twice in penalty shoot-outs to keep his side alive in the tournament and adding a clutch assist in the final . in the middle , no defender was more intimidating than schalke 's marcelo bordon .
a devout catholic he may be , but his christian charity certainly does not extend to opposing strikers in the box .
bordon also scored three goals as schalke , once again , came up tragically short . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delpierre completely shut down bayern in a key match in april he 's paired with stuttgart 's unsung hero , matthieu delpierre .
the frenchman made very few mistakes this season despite playing in all but one of the team 's league and cup matches .
what 's more he was able to stay in front of his man without fouling , picking up only four yellow cards over that long stretch . schalke 's rafinha fills out the back line .
he ended the season with a respectable two goals and three assists , but what does n't show up in the statistics is the amount of pressure the speedy brazilian created on the right-hand flank .
at only 22 he played with a maturity and acumen way beyond his years . on the bench : naldo -lrb- bremen -rrb- , mertesecker -lrb- bremen -rrb- , wolf -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- , madlung -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- between the posts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuer 's colleagues in the bundesliga also voted him the season 's best keeper and what 's true of rafinha goes double for schalke keeper manuel neuer .
the 21-year-old deposed one of the league 's most seasoned number ones , frank rost , in the tenth week , and for the rest of the season he never conceded more than two goals in a match .
and he did that in the high-pressure atmosphere of schalke , which was gunning for its first german league title in 49 years .
if his teammates up front had n't frozen up against dortmund , neuer could have capped off a remarkable rookie season with the bundesliga 's ultimate prize . on the bench : schäfer -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuremberg claim german cup with late scorcher danish midfielder jan kristiansen was the star on saturday night with a 30-meter blast in extra-time .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble wants to see a new anti-doping law passed in the bundestag " doping destroys the value of sport , " schäuble said .
" its credibility , its function as a provider of role models and its approval by the public are being put on the test . "
schäuble is meanwhile pressing for a rapid passage through parliament of a new anti-doping law , which among other things would permit lenient treatment for people who come forward to testify .
the government is also examining proposals to ban imports of medicines intended for doping offences .
german chancellor angela merkel has urged cyclists who used performance-enhancing drugs to come clean and break a " cartel of silence . "
" there has evidently been systematic and continued manipulation of unimaginable proportions in professional cycling , " the chancellor said in a statement .
" the confessions and investigations undertaken so far are n't sufficient to clean the sport up . "
new confessions the government 's moves follow doping confessions from riders from the telekom team , now known as t-mobile .
on friday , retired danish cyclist bjarne riis admitted using doping during his 1996 tour de france victory while riding for telekom .
the admission came a day after former teammates erik zabel and rolf aldag confessed they used performance-enhancing drugs while riding for telekom in the 1990s .
four other riders from the team have also admitted doping , but germany 's 1997 tour winner jan ullrich has remained silent .
no comment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich ended his career amidst speculations that he , too , used illegal substances ullrich 's manager wolfgang strohband has said his client would not speak about a claim made by former telekom team masseur jef d 'hont , who told the newspaper bild this week he had injected the cyclist with the erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- blood booster on one occasion .
freiburg university on thursday dismissed its doctors andreas schmid and lothar heinrich after they admitted giving athletes doping substances .
the university promised a full investigation into the past 20 years of its sports medicine .
nationwide scope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the image of cycling has been tarnished public prosecutors in freiburg meanwhile said they had handed an investigation into schmid and heinrich over to the federal criminal police department -lrb- bka -rrb- in view of the nationwide scope of the probe .
heinrich and schmid admitted that as team doctors they were involved in epo blood doping in the mid-1990s at the telekom team .
the german cycling federation bdr on saturday also suspended olympics doctor georg huber after former cyclists jörg müller and christian henn claimed they were given doping substances in the 1980s .
however huber will not face a criminal investigation because any alleged offences were now lapsed under german law , prosecutors said .
it 's all history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik zabel has been allowed to keep competing zabel , a six-time tour de france sprint champion , on wednesday started the bavarian tour race for the milram team .
milram said they were retaining the 36-year-old rider despite his admission he took epo - a synthetic hormone that stimulates the production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells - in the 1990s .
zabel was applauded by hundreds of spectators at the start of the first stage of the race in garmisch-partenkirchen .
zabel , who has a three-year contract with milram until the end of 2008 , will be allowed to continue his contract for the rest of this year at least , the german-italian team said on tuesday .
zabel has admitted using epo before the tour de france in 1996 , saying he stopped after a week because of side-effects .
in another development , germany 's public broadcasters ard and zdf said they would not initially renew options to cover the tour de france after next year .
zdf chief editor nikolaus brender said the contract would not be renewed " until we can be sure that doping has no more chance at the tour de france .

us secretary of state condoleezza rice , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and russian foreign minister sergei lavrov will attend the meeting of the quartet , which comprises the united states , the un , the eu and russia .
the potsdam meeting was aimed at preparing the summit of leaders of the group of eight most industrialized nations in heiligendamm , northeast germany , june 6-8 .
the ministers were tackling a range of international crises including the iranian and north korean nuclear programs , afghanistan and kosovo .
but japan poured cold water on one of the issues germany had placed at the top of its priority list for the summit - a binding agreement on reducing greenhouse gases .
divisions over climate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state rice -lrb- l -rrb- was also in potsdam foreign ministry spokesman mitsuo sakaba said german proposals to complete negotiations on a successor to the kyoto protocol on greenhouse gases by 2009 were " premature . "
japan has been leading efforts among asian nations to limit global warming .
it said it believed major emitters of greenhouse gases such as the united states , china and india should agree to join the process before any timetable was put in place .
" until we know if they will join us , it is premature , " sakaba said .
germany took advantage of the presence of rice and lavrov to hastily convene the middle east quartet , the body which drew up the stalled roadmap for peace .
however , faced with the bloodiest internal clashes in lebanon for decades and the firing of palestinian rockets into israel and israeli airstrikes in gaza , expectations for the meeting were low .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive security at the g8 heiligendamm location in potsdam , the minister said they were troubled by the situation in the region and called on the palestinian government to put an end to internal strife and missile attacks against israel , a german delegation source said .
" the spiral of violence must be stopped , " steinmeier told his fellow ministers , the source said .
there was broad agreement that the international community needed to encourage talks between israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmoud abbas .
they urged the palestinian authority to fulfill the demands of the middle east quartet including renouncing violence , recognizing israel and respecting previous agreements with the jewish state .
and they called on israel to unfreeze palestinian tax revenue and customs duties .
kosovo on the agenda the future status of kosovo , an issue that bitterly divides russia and the west , was also on the table in potsdam .
russia rejects proposals by chief un negotiator martti ahtisaari to grant kosovo internationally supervised independence from serbia .

us secretary of state condoleezza rice , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and russian foreign minister sergei lavrov will attend the meeting of the quartet , which comprises the united states , the un , the eu and russia .
the potsdam meeting was aimed at preparing the summit of leaders of the group of eight most industrialized nations in heiligendamm , northeast germany , june 6-8 .
the ministers were tackling a range of international crises including the iranian and north korean nuclear programs , afghanistan and kosovo .
but japan poured cold water on one of the issues germany had placed at the top of its priority list for the summit - a binding agreement on reducing greenhouse gases .
divisions over climate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state rice -lrb- l -rrb- was also in potsdam foreign ministry spokesman mitsuo sakaba said german proposals to complete negotiations on a successor to the kyoto protocol on greenhouse gases by 2009 were " premature . "
japan has been leading efforts among asian nations to limit global warming .
it said it believed major emitters of greenhouse gases such as the united states , china and india should agree to join the process before any timetable was put in place .
" until we know if they will join us , it is premature , " sakaba said .
germany took advantage of the presence of rice and lavrov to hastily convene the middle east quartet , the body which drew up the stalled roadmap for peace .
however , faced with the bloodiest internal clashes in lebanon for decades and the firing of palestinian rockets into israel and israeli airstrikes in gaza , expectations for the meeting were low .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive security at the g8 heiligendamm location in potsdam , the minister said they were troubled by the situation in the region and called on the palestinian government to put an end to internal strife and missile attacks against israel , a german delegation source said .
" the spiral of violence must be stopped , " steinmeier told his fellow ministers , the source said .
there was broad agreement that the international community needed to encourage talks between israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmoud abbas .
they urged the palestinian authority to fulfill the demands of the middle east quartet including renouncing violence , recognizing israel and respecting previous agreements with the jewish state .
and they called on israel to unfreeze palestinian tax revenue and customs duties .
kosovo on the agenda the future status of kosovo , an issue that bitterly divides russia and the west , was also on the table in potsdam .
russia rejects proposals by chief un negotiator martti ahtisaari to grant kosovo internationally supervised independence from serbia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some criticize the world 's poorest get lost in the g8 shuffle steinmeier said he expected a clash over the province at the meeting .

the well-preserved passport , issued in 1948 by an italian delegation of the international committee of the red cross , was presented on tuesday at the buenos aires holocaust museum .
it also bears the stamp and the signature of the argentine vice-counsel in genova , italy at that time , pedro solari capurro .
a factory worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eichmann was sentenced to death by an israeli court federal judge maria servini de cubria recently opened the eichmann file and found the well-preserved passport , graciela jinich , the director of the buenos aires holocaust museum , told dpa news service .
eichmann 's wife had presented the passport to authorities in 1960 after he had been abducted by israeli secret service agents from the buenos aires suburb where he lived a normal life working at the mercedes benz factory .
he was taken to israel , tried for crimes against humanity and hanged in 1962 .
" this document leaves no room for doubts on how easy it was for not only eichmann , but also other war criminals , to attain fake identification documents , change their names and enter our country , " jinich said .
suppressed information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eichmann was one of the leaders of the mass deportation of jews to extermination camps the united states released documents last year which showed that the cia learned about eichmann 's location and alias two years before israel captured him but kept the information secret as part of its efforts to combat communism in post-war west germany .
they also showed that the united states used a large network of spies recruited among former nazis and that the cia had virtually no interest in arresting war criminals , focusing instead on cold war issues .
" the american policy of the time was not to pursue nazi war criminals , " said historian timothy naftali , who reviewed thousands of documents on cia ties to nazis from the us national archives .
" they thought that was the responsibility of the germans . "
according to the cia papers , west germany knew from 1952 that eichmann was hiding in argentina under an assumed identity , but kept quiet about it fearing the fugitive might talk about hans globke , a former nazi who was a top national security advisor to konrad adenauer , the chancellor at the time . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " this is a german story " in an interview with dw-world.de , us historian timothy naftali says germans should pressure their own government to receive more information on the role of nazis in german government after 1945 .

the well-preserved passport , issued in 1948 by an italian delegation of the international committee of the red cross , was presented on tuesday at the buenos aires holocaust museum .
it also bears the stamp and the signature of the argentine vice-counsel in genova , italy at that time , pedro solari capurro .
a factory worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eichmann was sentenced to death by an israeli court federal judge maria servini de cubria recently opened the eichmann file and found the well-preserved passport , graciela jinich , the director of the buenos aires holocaust museum , told dpa news service .
eichmann 's wife had presented the passport to authorities in 1960 after he had been abducted by israeli secret service agents from the buenos aires suburb where he lived a normal life working at the mercedes benz factory .
he was taken to israel , tried for crimes against humanity and hanged in 1962 .
" this document leaves no room for doubts on how easy it was for not only eichmann , but also other war criminals , to attain fake identification documents , change their names and enter our country , " jinich said .
suppressed information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eichmann was one of the leaders of the mass deportation of jews to extermination camps the united states released documents last year which showed that the cia learned about eichmann 's location and alias two years before israel captured him but kept the information secret as part of its efforts to combat communism in post-war west germany .
they also showed that the united states used a large network of spies recruited among former nazis and that the cia had virtually no interest in arresting war criminals , focusing instead on cold war issues .
" the american policy of the time was not to pursue nazi war criminals , " said historian timothy naftali , who reviewed thousands of documents on cia ties to nazis from the us national archives .
" they thought that was the responsibility of the germans . "
according to the cia papers , west germany knew from 1952 that eichmann was hiding in argentina under an assumed identity , but kept quiet about it fearing the fugitive might talk about hans globke , a former nazi who was a top national security advisor to konrad adenauer , the chancellor at the time . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " this is a german story " in an interview with dw-world.de , us historian timothy naftali says germans should pressure their own government to receive more information on the role of nazis in german government after 1945 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 30.05.2007 young stars shone brightest in 2006-7 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league was dominated by players in their early twenties in an unusual season , stuttgart took the title with a team of youngsters .
so it 's no coincidence dw-world.de 's top eleven has an average age of just under 25 .
we pay tribute to the players who came up big in the clutch . up front no one player was more important to his team than bochum 's theofanis gekas .
the greek forward went on a tear in the second half of the season , lifting his side from the relegation zone to eighth place in the standings and topping the league with 20 goals .
gekas is moving to leverkusen , where he 'll have to show that 2006-7 was no fluke .
until then , he can take pride in a breakthrough season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gekas provided a lot of greek tragedy for defenses mario gomez had 14 goals and eight assists , fewer than bremen 's miroslav klose , but that was due to injury .
and unlike klose , gomez finished the season strongly , scoring a crucial equalizer in the second-to-last game to keep stuttgart 's title drive on track .
at the tender age of 21 , he 's poised to become a regular in the german national squad . on the bench : klose -lrb- bremen -rrb- , kuranyi -lrb- schalke -rrb- , zidan -lrb- mainz -rrb- , frei -lrb- dortmund -rrb- the midfield the players themselves voted bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego the season 's mvp , and they get no argument here .
thirteen goals and 14 assists in his first season in the bundesliga speak volumes , and the truly scary thing is : he 's only 22 ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's dribbling skills stymied opposing midfielders diego is joined by two rising young stars from stuttgart who had a huge impact this spring .
thomas hitzls per ger , nicknamed the " hammer , " has the hardest shot in the german game , and he scored in each of stuttgart 's final two come-from-behind wins . like hitzlsperger , roberto hilbert finished the season with seven goals , four of which came during the streak of eight straight wins that sealed the title for stuttgart .
he deservedly won his first cap for the german national side during that stretch , and it 's easy to picture him , at only 22 , getting better and better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzlsperger scored some of the season 's most spectacular goals completing our dream midfield is leverkusen 's bernd schneider .
one of the league 's most consistent and technically proficient players , the 33-year-old veteran had six goals and 11 eleven assists .
more importantly , he held things together on a team that was n't clicking early , leading leverkusen to fifth place and a spot in the uefa cup . on the bench : frings -lrb- bremen -rrb- , pardo -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- , marcelinho -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- , misimovic -lrb- bochum -rrb- at the back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : led by bordon , schalke only conceded 32 goals nuremberg and schalke had the league 's stingiest defenses , so they 're the place we start building our back four .
at left back , the honors go to nuremberg 's javier pinola .
the spaniard with the league 's worst hairstyle really performed in nuremberg 's german cup triumph , scoring twice in penalty shoot-outs to keep his side alive in the tournament and adding a clutch assist in the final . in the middle , no defender was more intimidating than schalke 's marcelo bordon .
a devout catholic he may be , but his christian charity certainly does not extend to opposing strikers in the box .
bordon also scored three goals as schalke , once again , came up tragically short . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delpierre completely shut down bayern in a key match in april he 's paired with stuttgart 's unsung hero , matthieu delpierre .
the frenchman made very few mistakes this season despite playing in all but one of the team 's league and cup matches .
what 's more he was able to stay in front of his man without fouling , picking up only four yellow cards over that long stretch . schalke 's rafinha fills out the back line .
he ended the season with a respectable two goals and three assists , but what does n't show up in the statistics is the amount of pressure the speedy brazilian created on the right-hand flank .
at only 22 he played with a maturity and acumen way beyond his years . on the bench : naldo -lrb- bremen -rrb- , mertesecker -lrb- bremen -rrb- , wolf -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- , madlung -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- between the posts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuer 's colleagues in the bundesliga also voted him the season 's best keeper and what 's true of rafinha goes double for schalke keeper manuel neuer .
the 21-year-old deposed one of the league 's most seasoned number ones , frank rost , in the tenth week , and for the rest of the season he never conceded more than two goals in a match .
and he did that in the high-pressure atmosphere of schalke , which was gunning for its first german league title in 49 years .
if his teammates up front had n't frozen up against dortmund , neuer could have capped off a remarkable rookie season with the bundesliga 's ultimate prize . on the bench : schäfer -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuremberg claim german cup with late scorcher danish midfielder jan kristiansen was the star on saturday night with a 30-meter blast in extra-time .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble wants to see a new anti-doping law passed in the bundestag " doping destroys the value of sport , " schäuble said .
" its credibility , its function as a provider of role models and its approval by the public are being put on the test . "
schäuble is meanwhile pressing for a rapid passage through parliament of a new anti-doping law , which among other things would permit lenient treatment for people who come forward to testify .
the government is also examining proposals to ban imports of medicines intended for doping offences .
german chancellor angela merkel has urged cyclists who used performance-enhancing drugs to come clean and break a " cartel of silence . "
" there has evidently been systematic and continued manipulation of unimaginable proportions in professional cycling , " the chancellor said in a statement .
" the confessions and investigations undertaken so far are n't sufficient to clean the sport up . "
new confessions the government 's moves follow doping confessions from riders from the telekom team , now known as t-mobile .
on friday , retired danish cyclist bjarne riis admitted using doping during his 1996 tour de france victory while riding for telekom .
the admission came a day after former teammates erik zabel and rolf aldag confessed they used performance-enhancing drugs while riding for telekom in the 1990s .
four other riders from the team have also admitted doping , but germany 's 1997 tour winner jan ullrich has remained silent .
no comment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich ended his career amidst speculations that he , too , used illegal substances ullrich 's manager wolfgang strohband has said his client would not speak about a claim made by former telekom team masseur jef d 'hont , who told the newspaper bild this week he had injected the cyclist with the erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- blood booster on one occasion .
freiburg university on thursday dismissed its doctors andreas schmid and lothar heinrich after they admitted giving athletes doping substances .
the university promised a full investigation into the past 20 years of its sports medicine .
nationwide scope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the image of cycling has been tarnished public prosecutors in freiburg meanwhile said they had handed an investigation into schmid and heinrich over to the federal criminal police department -lrb- bka -rrb- in view of the nationwide scope of the probe .
heinrich and schmid admitted that as team doctors they were involved in epo blood doping in the mid-1990s at the telekom team .
the german cycling federation bdr on saturday also suspended olympics doctor georg huber after former cyclists jörg müller and christian henn claimed they were given doping substances in the 1980s .
however huber will not face a criminal investigation because any alleged offences were now lapsed under german law , prosecutors said .
it 's all history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik zabel has been allowed to keep competing zabel , a six-time tour de france sprint champion , on wednesday started the bavarian tour race for the milram team .
milram said they were retaining the 36-year-old rider despite his admission he took epo - a synthetic hormone that stimulates the production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells - in the 1990s .
zabel was applauded by hundreds of spectators at the start of the first stage of the race in garmisch-partenkirchen .
zabel , who has a three-year contract with milram until the end of 2008 , will be allowed to continue his contract for the rest of this year at least , the german-italian team said on tuesday .
zabel has admitted using epo before the tour de france in 1996 , saying he stopped after a week because of side-effects .
in another development , germany 's public broadcasters ard and zdf said they would not initially renew options to cover the tour de france after next year .
zdf chief editor nikolaus brender said the contract would not be renewed " until we can be sure that doping has no more chance at the tour de france .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de media -pipe- 30.05.2007 controversial dutch organ donor reality tv show to go ahead großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : " the big donorshow " is getting masses of advance publicity the dutch channel behind a reality tv show in which an organ donor must choose one of three candidates to receive her kidney has promised to broadcast it friday despite the ruckus it has caused . lawmakers in the dutch parliament have called for " the big donorshow " to be scrapped on ethical grounds , but the channel insists it will press ahead with the scheduled broadcast to highlight the serious lack of organ donors .
laurens dillich , the head of public service broadcaster bnn , told public radio : " the chances of the candidates obtaining a kidney are 33 percent , far better than for those on organ waiting lists .
you would imagine that -lrb- waiting times -rrb- have improved , but they are getting longer . "
bnn , a channel aimed at young people , is screening the show on the fifth anniversary of the death of its founder , bart de graaff .
he died after waiting seven years for a kidney donation .
international criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bart de graaff , in 1999 the project has prompted condemnation across the netherlands and beyond .
in brussels , a spokesman for the european commission - which on wednesday presented an action plan to reduce organ donor waiting lists - said it was in " pretty bad taste . "
the dutch kidney foundation welcomed the attention bnn had brought on the subject , but noted that " their way of doing it is not ours , and it will bring no practical solution . "
" i 'm afraid it 's primarily about the shock effect which has characterized the channel bnn since … the mid-90s , " media analyst jo groebel told dw-radio .
" i 'm afraid that … the whole debate is just increasing the market value and the market success of such a program , and this is what makes it extremely cynical - that the discussion itself adds to the program .
this is not the first time bnn has courted controversy .
previous broadcasts include " sex , a user 's guide , " a series of no-holds-barred education programs , and " shoot up and swallow , " a series dedicated to sex and drugs .
" the big donorshow " was dreamt up by endemol , the dutch production company behind " big brother " and other reality television shows .
it focuses on lisa , a 37-year-old woman dying of a brain tumor .
she must decide which of three patients selected by the producers should receive her kidney .
viewers can offer their opinions by sms text message .
lawmakers want ban on tuesday , the show was brought up in dutch parliament , where lawmakers agreed on the need to highlight the shortage of organ donors but were divided on whether reality television was the best way to do it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's organ donor card some lawmakers called on the ministers for health and media to take the program off air .
the two cabinet members had already made clear they did not have the authority to ban the program .
in the netherlands , organ transplants are subject to strict laws , which prohibit donors from choosing who will receive their organs after their death .
however , an exemption is made in the case of kidney transplants , which can be carried out while the donor is still alive , allowing the donor to choose the beneficiary if there is some link between the two people .
after an eu-wide survey showed that while 81 percent of european citizens support the use of organ donor cards , only 12 percent have one , the european commission proposed its action plan , which includes introducing an eu-wide donor card and creating organ transplant coordinators in hospitals .
the eu executive arm is hopeful that european legislation on common standards for the quality and safety of organ donation will be introduced next year when its proposals are developed . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " there is no cohesion of tv writing staff in germany " german tv networks are taking their cues state-side in a bid to create better drama series .

forgeard , former joint chief executive at eads which owns airbus , told the magazine le point : " airbus did not report any unrecoverable delay before the middle of april 2006 , and at that time the financial consequences were very limited . "
he repeated that he had " respected all of the rules -lrb- at eads -rrb- which are among the most restrictive among companies quoted on the cac 40 index . "
the controversy and criticism of a big severance payment to forgeard are hot issues in france particularly , where the new government under president nicolas sarkozy has signaled it will act to curb so-called " golden handshakes . "
insider trading ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's forgeard was co-chair of eads from june 2005 - june 2006 forgeard and many other senior managers sold stock options in march last year , three months before the european aeronautics defence and space company and airbus announced serious delays in production of the a380 superjumbo airliner .
two big shareholders in eads , daimlerchrysler in germany and lagardere group in france each decided on march 20 to sell stakes of 7.5 percent .
the group had said in 2005 that there were some problems with production and that it was investigating the extent of these .
but the announcement in june 2006 of deep problems came as a shock to the stock market and the price of shares in eads fell heavily .
the problems rapidly developed into a long crisis with changes in top management and a rescue plan involving the loss of 10,000 jobs , although this remains clouded in some uncertainty .
there is also a prospect that eads will have to raise new capital .
forgeard is the target of suspicions , renewed in allegations in a press report on tuesday , that he was aware of the impact of production problems on the group when he decided to exercise stock options .
blames german managers the use of such privileged information , which has not been communicated publicly to market authorities , is known as insider trading and is illegal because it privileges one investor over another , distorts the equitable availability of information and therefore undermines confidence in a stock market .
stock market rules require managers to inform the market quickly if they become aware of a sudden and significant change in their company 's prospects .
forgeard also argued that during his period in various top positions at airbus , the company had become " a world leader , " and that despite the planned loss of 10,000 jobs , " the balance over eight years is positive to the extent of tens of thousands of jobs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delays have plagued the a380 superjumbo he also blamed a large part of the production problems on the attitude of top managers in germany where much of the work on airbus airliners is carried out , saying they wanted to continue doing things their way while he wanted to a single , overall method of working .
this was a reference to revelations that software used for installing cabling systems in hamburg , germany , was not compatible with design software at airbus headquarters in toulouse , france .
problems in adapting complex cabling to the requirements of individual airlines were at the center of the delays to production .
forgeard also launched a personal attack on his co-chair at the time , germany 's thomas enders .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 30.05.2007 " the possibility of an eu-iran agreement is small " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is iran asking for too much in return for reducing its support of insurgents in iraq ?
iran expert alex bigham spoke with dw-world.de about thursday 's meeting between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iranian nuclear negotiator ali larijani .
iran wants proliferation and recognition , he said . dw-world.de : mr. bigham , what is your assessment of monday 's meeting in baghdad between the us and iranian ambassadors to iraq ?
alex bigham : i certainly think the talks are a positive sign , and this may be a tentative start of a period of cooling off in relations .
there has been an indication from the iranians of a willingness to meet in a month 's time , which is a welcome sign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana -lrb- left -rrb- and larijani at a meeting in berlin last september the talks are limited of course , really to one issue : iraq .
there are obvious reasons why america would want to seek iranian help in iraq - in order to improve stability in the country and to reduce the flow of funds and arms to insurgents who are attacking coalition forces .
the difficult question is why iran would want to assist coalition forces .
there will no doubt be elements in iran who want the americans to remain bogged down in iraq because they see that as a buffer to a possible attack on iran .
but it seems that those advocating dialogue both in washington and tehran are winning the argument for the moment .
they want to see stability on iran 's border with iraq , an area which has suffered from terrorist acts against the iranian government .
it 's certainly in iran 's long term self-interest to improve security and stability in iraq . iran 's nuclear program had not been on the agenda .
are you nevertheless surprised that the issue did not arise ? i am not surprised it was n't discussed .
neither side wants to be seen to be compromising on the nuclear issue at this stage , given domestic pressures in both iran and america .
the us does n't want to replicate or divert attention from the iaea , un and eu structures .
they deliberately want this to be seen as a disagreement between iran and the international community , not between iran and america . will monday 's talks have an impact on javier solana 's meeting with the iranian nuclear negotiator ali larijani on thursday ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intransigency on both sides blocks europe 's negotiations , said bigham the baghdad talks may offer some kind of reassurance to the iranian government in terms of the likelihood of military action , but there will need to be concrete results in order for the americans to be convinced of progress .
although the baghdad talks may help as a confidence-building measure , which is welcome , necessary , and frankly overdue , both the eu and iran are seeing the discussions on iran 's nuclear program as a separate issue from the future of iraq . what approach do you expect solana to take ? solana 's approach is not to engage in a negotiation directly about the nuclear issue , but to try to get an agreement to have a negotiation which would involve the p5 + 1 -lrb- editor 's note : the five per manent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the us - plus germany -rrb- .
however , the sticking point is the precondition the us has set that iran suspends uranium enrichment before negotiations .
the iranians have repeatedly ruled out the possibility of talks with any preconditions . what do you expect to come out of the talks ? there does n't seem to have been a fundamental shift in either side 's position , so the possibility of an agreement is small .
the difficulty in separating the issues of iraq and the nuclear program is that iran seems to want two things in return for reducing its support for insurgents in iraq : proliferation and recognition of its regional role .
these are effectively red lines for the americans , which make overcoming the stalemate a difficult , long term process . do you agree with the eu 's policy towards iran ?
what should the eu be doing differently ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayatollah khamenei is the main decision-maker on iran 's foreign and security policies the eu has made a great deal of effort to negotiate to iran .
the main barriers to progress are the relative intransigency of both the iranian and the american position on the nuclear issue .
another problem is the internal divisions within iran .
larijani is clearly a growing political player in tehran for the moment , but it is the supreme leader , khamenei who will make the final decision on iran 's security and foreign policy .
ayatollah khamenei is reluctant to make a final decision on the nuclear issues for fear of alienating one of the factions in iranian politics and undermining his own position .
one option that needs renewed consideration is el baradei 's proposal of a mutual " time-out " - iran suspending enrichment while the un suspends sanctions .
that is one option that should at least be put on the table .

iran expert alex bigham spoke with dw-world.de about thursday 's meeting between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iranian nuclear negotiator ali larijani .
iran wants proliferation and recognition , he said . dw-world.de : mr. bigham , what is your assessment of monday 's meeting in baghdad between the us and iranian ambassadors to iraq ?
alex bigham : i certainly think the talks are a positive sign , and this may be a tentative start of a period of cooling off in relations .
there has been an indication from the iranians of a willingness to meet in a month 's time , which is a welcome sign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana -lrb- left -rrb- and larijani at a meeting in berlin last september the talks are limited of course , really to one issue : iraq .
there are obvious reasons why america would want to seek iranian help in iraq - in order to improve stability in the country and to reduce the flow of funds and arms to insurgents who are attacking coalition forces .
the difficult question is why iran would want to assist coalition forces .
there will no doubt be elements in iran who want the americans to remain bogged down in iraq because they see that as a buffer to a possible attack on iran .
but it seems that those advocating dialogue both in washington and tehran are winning the argument for the moment .
they want to see stability on iran 's border with iraq , an area which has suffered from terrorist acts against the iranian government .
it 's certainly in iran 's long term self-interest to improve security and stability in iraq . iran 's nuclear program had not been on the agenda .
are you nevertheless surprised that the issue did not arise ? i am not surprised it was n't discussed .
neither side wants to be seen to be compromising on the nuclear issue at this stage , given domestic pressures in both iran and america .
the us does n't want to replicate or divert attention from the iaea , un and eu structures .
they deliberately want this to be seen as a disagreement between iran and the international community , not between iran and america . will monday 's talks have an impact on javier solana 's meeting with the iranian nuclear negotiator ali larijani on thursday ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intransigency on both sides blocks europe 's negotiations , said bigham the baghdad talks may offer some kind of reassurance to the iranian government in terms of the likelihood of military action , but there will need to be concrete results in order for the americans to be convinced of progress .
although the baghdad talks may help as a confidence-building measure , which is welcome , necessary , and frankly overdue , both the eu and iran are seeing the discussions on iran 's nuclear program as a separate issue from the future of iraq . what approach do you expect solana to take ? solana 's approach is not to engage in a negotiation directly about the nuclear issue , but to try to get an agreement to have a negotiation which would involve the p5 + 1 -lrb- editor 's note : the five per manent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the us - plus germany -rrb- .
however , the sticking point is the precondition the us has set that iran suspends uranium enrichment before negotiations .
the iranians have repeatedly ruled out the possibility of talks with any preconditions . what do you expect to come out of the talks ? there does n't seem to have been a fundamental shift in either side 's position , so the possibility of an agreement is small .
the difficulty in separating the issues of iraq and the nuclear program is that iran seems to want two things in return for reducing its support for insurgents in iraq : proliferation and recognition of its regional role .
these are effectively red lines for the americans , which make overcoming the stalemate a difficult , long term process . do you agree with the eu 's policy towards iran ?
what should the eu be doing differently ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayatollah khamenei is the main decision-maker on iran 's foreign and security policies the eu has made a great deal of effort to negotiate to iran .
the main barriers to progress are the relative intransigency of both the iranian and the american position on the nuclear issue .
another problem is the internal divisions within iran .
larijani is clearly a growing political player in tehran for the moment , but it is the supreme leader , khamenei who will make the final decision on iran 's security and foreign policy .
ayatollah khamenei is reluctant to make a final decision on the nuclear issues for fear of alienating one of the factions in iranian politics and undermining his own position .
one option that needs renewed consideration is el baradei 's proposal of a mutual " time-out " - iran suspending enrichment while the un suspends sanctions .
that is one option that should at least be put on the table .

you would imagine that -lrb- waiting times -rrb- have improved , but they are getting longer . "
bnn , a channel aimed at young people , is screening the show on the fifth anniversary of the death of its founder , bart de graaff .

after an eu-wide survey showed that while 81 percent of european citizens support the use of organ donor cards , only 12 percent have one , the european commission proposed its action plan , which includes introducing an eu-wide donor card and creating organ transplant coordinators in hospitals .

laurens dillich , the head of public service broadcaster bnn , told public radio : " the chances of the candidates obtaining a kidney are 33 percent , far better than for those on organ waiting lists .
you would imagine that -lrb- waiting times -rrb- have improved , but they are getting longer . "
bnn , a channel aimed at young people , is screening the show on the fifth anniversary of the death of its founder , bart de graaff .
he died after waiting seven years for a kidney donation .
international criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bart de graaff , in 1999 the project has prompted condemnation across the netherlands and beyond .
in brussels , a spokesman for the european commission - which on wednesday presented an action plan to reduce organ donor waiting lists - said it was in " pretty bad taste . "
the dutch kidney foundation welcomed the attention bnn had brought on the subject , but noted that " their way of doing it is not ours , and it will bring no practical solution . "
" i 'm afraid it 's primarily about the shock effect which has characterized the channel bnn since … the mid-90s , " media analyst jo groebel told dw-radio .
" i 'm afraid that … the whole debate is just increasing the market value and the market success of such a program , and this is what makes it extremely cynical - that the discussion itself adds to the program .
this is not the first time bnn has courted controversy .
previous broadcasts include " sex , a user 's guide , " a series of no-holds-barred education programs , and " shoot up and swallow , " a series dedicated to sex and drugs .
" the big donorshow " was dreamt up by endemol , the dutch production company behind " big brother " and other reality television shows .
it focuses on lisa , a 37-year-old woman dying of a brain tumor .
she must decide which of three patients selected by the producers should receive her kidney .
viewers can offer their opinions by sms text message .
lawmakers want ban on tuesday , the show was brought up in dutch parliament , where lawmakers agreed on the need to highlight the shortage of organ donors but were divided on whether reality television was the best way to do it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's organ donor card some lawmakers called on the ministers for health and media to take the program off air .
the two cabinet members had already made clear they did not have the authority to ban the program .
in the netherlands , organ transplants are subject to strict laws , which prohibit donors from choosing who will receive their organs after their death .
however , an exemption is made in the case of kidney transplants , which can be carried out while the donor is still alive , allowing the donor to choose the beneficiary if there is some link between the two people .
after an eu-wide survey showed that while 81 percent of european citizens support the use of organ donor cards , only 12 percent have one , the european commission proposed its action plan , which includes introducing an eu-wide donor card and creating organ transplant coordinators in hospitals .
the eu executive arm is hopeful that european legislation on common standards for the quality and safety of organ donation will be introduced next year when its proposals are developed . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " there is no cohesion of tv writing staff in germany " german tv networks are taking their cues state-side in a bid to create better drama series .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de iran -pipe- 30.05.2007 " the possibility of an eu-iran agreement is small " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is iran asking for too much in return for reducing its support of insurgents in iraq ?
iran expert alex bigham spoke with dw-world.de about thursday 's meeting between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iranian nuclear negotiator ali larijani .
iran wants proliferation and recognition , he said . dw-world.de : mr. bigham , what is your assessment of monday 's meeting in baghdad between the us and iranian ambassadors to iraq ?
alex bigham : i certainly think the talks are a positive sign , and this may be a tentative start of a period of cooling off in relations .
there has been an indication from the iranians of a willingness to meet in a month 's time , which is a welcome sign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana -lrb- left -rrb- and larijani at a meeting in berlin last september the talks are limited of course , really to one issue : iraq .
there are obvious reasons why america would want to seek iranian help in iraq - in order to improve stability in the country and to reduce the flow of funds and arms to insurgents who are attacking coalition forces .
the difficult question is why iran would want to assist coalition forces .
there will no doubt be elements in iran who want the americans to remain bogged down in iraq because they see that as a buffer to a possible attack on iran .
but it seems that those advocating dialogue both in washington and tehran are winning the argument for the moment .
they want to see stability on iran 's border with iraq , an area which has suffered from terrorist acts against the iranian government .
it 's certainly in iran 's long term self-interest to improve security and stability in iraq . iran 's nuclear program had not been on the agenda .
are you nevertheless surprised that the issue did not arise ? i am not surprised it was n't discussed .
neither side wants to be seen to be compromising on the nuclear issue at this stage , given domestic pressures in both iran and america .
the us does n't want to replicate or divert attention from the iaea , un and eu structures .
they deliberately want this to be seen as a disagreement between iran and the international community , not between iran and america . will monday 's talks have an impact on javier solana 's meeting with the iranian nuclear negotiator ali larijani on thursday ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intransigency on both sides blocks europe 's negotiations , said bigham the baghdad talks may offer some kind of reassurance to the iranian government in terms of the likelihood of military action , but there will need to be concrete results in order for the americans to be convinced of progress .
although the baghdad talks may help as a confidence-building measure , which is welcome , necessary , and frankly overdue , both the eu and iran are seeing the discussions on iran 's nuclear program as a separate issue from the future of iraq . what approach do you expect solana to take ? solana 's approach is not to engage in a negotiation directly about the nuclear issue , but to try to get an agreement to have a negotiation which would involve the p5 + 1 -lrb- editor 's note : the five per manent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the us - plus germany -rrb- .
however , the sticking point is the precondition the us has set that iran suspends uranium enrichment before negotiations .
the iranians have repeatedly ruled out the possibility of talks with any preconditions . what do you expect to come out of the talks ? there does n't seem to have been a fundamental shift in either side 's position , so the possibility of an agreement is small .
the difficulty in separating the issues of iraq and the nuclear program is that iran seems to want two things in return for reducing its support for insurgents in iraq : proliferation and recognition of its regional role .
these are effectively red lines for the americans , which make overcoming the stalemate a difficult , long term process . do you agree with the eu 's policy towards iran ?
what should the eu be doing differently ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayatollah khamenei is the main decision-maker on iran 's foreign and security policies the eu has made a great deal of effort to negotiate to iran .
the main barriers to progress are the relative intransigency of both the iranian and the american position on the nuclear issue .
another problem is the internal divisions within iran .
larijani is clearly a growing political player in tehran for the moment , but it is the supreme leader , khamenei who will make the final decision on iran 's security and foreign policy .
ayatollah khamenei is reluctant to make a final decision on the nuclear issues for fear of alienating one of the factions in iranian politics and undermining his own position .
one option that needs renewed consideration is el baradei 's proposal of a mutual " time-out " - iran suspending enrichment while the un suspends sanctions .
that is one option that should at least be put on the table .

" that means not only informing the members of these organizations about one 's own plans but also entertaining a willingness to abandon them if necessary , " he wrote .
beck pointed out that the plans to station the defense system in poland and the czech republic had inflicted " great harm " on relations between russia and the united states and europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck he also called for a new round of global disarmament : " disarmament policy must ... be urgently re-established as a key regulatory principle in international relations , " he wrote .
" major international disarmament regimes are already in shreds or have been completely destroyed . "
money better spent elsewhere ?
beck stressed the importance of close ties between the us and germany , but also used the opportunity to point out that washington had already sunk more than $ 100 billion in developing the shield , which may not even work .
that money could have been spent differently and " achieved more for the security of the united states , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to install part of the defense system in bohemia as head of the spd , which is part of christian democrat angela merkel 's government coalition , beck is the party 's most likely candidate for chancellor in 2009 .
in the past , he has been openly critical of us plans for the defense system meant to block attacks from hostile countries , warning in march that it could spark a new arms race .
those comments led to tensions within germany 's governing coalition as his column on tuesday was also likely to do .
chancellor merkel has been muted about the defense shield plans , only saying there should be a debate on the missile shield within nato and that the eu should " present a common front " on it . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin lashes out at us , eu as russia tests missile russian president putin warned tuesday that a planned us missile defense shield would make europe a " powder keg " and lashed out at his eu critics .

forgeard , former joint chief executive at eads which owns airbus , told the magazine le point : " airbus did not report any unrecoverable delay before the middle of april 2006 , and at that time the financial consequences were very limited . "
he repeated that he had " respected all of the rules -lrb- at eads -rrb- which are among the most restrictive among companies quoted on the cac 40 index . "
the controversy and criticism of a big severance payment to forgeard are hot issues in france particularly , where the new government under president nicolas sarkozy has signaled it will act to curb so-called " golden handshakes . "
insider trading ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's forgeard was co-chair of eads from june 2005 - june 2006 forgeard and many other senior managers sold stock options in march last year , three months before the european aeronautics defence and space company and airbus announced serious delays in production of the a380 superjumbo airliner .
two big shareholders in eads , daimlerchrysler in germany and lagardere group in france each decided on march 20 to sell stakes of 7.5 percent .
the group had said in 2005 that there were some problems with production and that it was investigating the extent of these .
but the announcement in june 2006 of deep problems came as a shock to the stock market and the price of shares in eads fell heavily .
the problems rapidly developed into a long crisis with changes in top management and a rescue plan involving the loss of 10,000 jobs , although this remains clouded in some uncertainty .
there is also a prospect that eads will have to raise new capital .
forgeard is the target of suspicions , renewed in allegations in a press report on tuesday , that he was aware of the impact of production problems on the group when he decided to exercise stock options .
blames german managers the use of such privileged information , which has not been communicated publicly to market authorities , is known as insider trading and is illegal because it privileges one investor over another , distorts the equitable availability of information and therefore undermines confidence in a stock market .
stock market rules require managers to inform the market quickly if they become aware of a sudden and significant change in their company 's prospects .
forgeard also argued that during his period in various top positions at airbus , the company had become " a world leader , " and that despite the planned loss of 10,000 jobs , " the balance over eight years is positive to the extent of tens of thousands of jobs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delays have plagued the a380 superjumbo he also blamed a large part of the production problems on the attitude of top managers in germany where much of the work on airbus airliners is carried out , saying they wanted to continue doing things their way while he wanted to a single , overall method of working .
this was a reference to revelations that software used for installing cabling systems in hamburg , germany , was not compatible with design software at airbus headquarters in toulouse , france .
problems in adapting complex cabling to the requirements of individual airlines were at the center of the delays to production .
forgeard also launched a personal attack on his co-chair at the time , germany 's thomas enders .
" i ask myself whether he had n't been commissioned by daimler boss jürgen schrempp to neutralize or even get rid of me , " the former manager said .

" that means not only informing the members of these organizations about one 's own plans but also entertaining a willingness to abandon them if necessary , " he wrote .

beck stressed the importance of close ties between the us and germany , but also used the opportunity to point out that washington had already sunk more than $ 100 billion in developing the shield , which may not even work .

forgeard , former joint chief executive at eads which owns airbus , told the magazine le point : " airbus did not report any unrecoverable delay before the middle of april 2006 , and at that time the financial consequences were very limited . "
he repeated that he had " respected all of the rules -lrb- at eads -rrb- which are among the most restrictive among companies quoted on the cac 40 index . "
the controversy and criticism of a big severance payment to forgeard are hot issues in france particularly , where the new government under president nicolas sarkozy has signaled it will act to curb so-called " golden handshakes . "
insider trading ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's forgeard was co-chair of eads from june 2005 - june 2006 forgeard and many other senior managers sold stock options in march last year , three months before the european aeronautics defence and space company and airbus announced serious delays in production of the a380 superjumbo airliner .
two big shareholders in eads , daimlerchrysler in germany and lagardere group in france each decided on march 20 to sell stakes of 7.5 percent .
the group had said in 2005 that there were some problems with production and that it was investigating the extent of these .
but the announcement in june 2006 of deep problems came as a shock to the stock market and the price of shares in eads fell heavily .
the problems rapidly developed into a long crisis with changes in top management and a rescue plan involving the loss of 10,000 jobs , although this remains clouded in some uncertainty .
there is also a prospect that eads will have to raise new capital .
forgeard is the target of suspicions , renewed in allegations in a press report on tuesday , that he was aware of the impact of production problems on the group when he decided to exercise stock options .
blames german managers the use of such privileged information , which has not been communicated publicly to market authorities , is known as insider trading and is illegal because it privileges one investor over another , distorts the equitable availability of information and therefore undermines confidence in a stock market .
stock market rules require managers to inform the market quickly if they become aware of a sudden and significant change in their company 's prospects .
forgeard also argued that during his period in various top positions at airbus , the company had become " a world leader , " and that despite the planned loss of 10,000 jobs , " the balance over eight years is positive to the extent of tens of thousands of jobs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delays have plagued the a380 superjumbo he also blamed a large part of the production problems on the attitude of top managers in germany where much of the work on airbus airliners is carried out , saying they wanted to continue doing things their way while he wanted to a single , overall method of working .
this was a reference to revelations that software used for installing cabling systems in hamburg , germany , was not compatible with design software at airbus headquarters in toulouse , france .
problems in adapting complex cabling to the requirements of individual airlines were at the center of the delays to production .
forgeard also launched a personal attack on his co-chair at the time , germany 's thomas enders .
" i ask myself whether he had n't been commissioned by daimler boss jürgen schrempp to neutralize or even get rid of me , " the former manager said .
qatar stays loyal the head of lagardere group , and joint co-chairman of eads , arnaud lagardere was questioned at length on tuesday by stock market regulators probing suspicions that there had been insider trading in eads stock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus planes are european co-productions both forgeard and lagardere have insisted that they did nothing wrong .
on wednesday , the persian gulf state of qatar signed an order for 80 airbus a350 aircraft worth $ 16 billion , the largest contract to date for the model .

laurens dillich , the head of public service broadcaster bnn , told public radio : " the chances of the candidates obtaining a kidney are 33 percent , far better than for those on organ waiting lists .
you would imagine that -lrb- waiting times -rrb- have improved , but they are getting longer . "
bnn , a channel aimed at young people , is screening the show on the fifth anniversary of the death of its founder , bart de graaff .
he died after waiting seven years for a kidney donation .
international criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bart de graaff , in 1999 the project has prompted condemnation across the netherlands and beyond .
in brussels , a spokesman for the european commission - which on wednesday presented an action plan to reduce organ donor waiting lists - said it was in " pretty bad taste . "
the dutch kidney foundation welcomed the attention bnn had brought on the subject , but noted that " their way of doing it is not ours , and it will bring no practical solution . "
" i 'm afraid it 's primarily about the shock effect which has characterized the channel bnn since … the mid-90s , " media analyst jo groebel told dw-radio .
" i 'm afraid that … the whole debate is just increasing the market value and the market success of such a program , and this is what makes it extremely cynical - that the discussion itself adds to the program .
this is not the first time bnn has courted controversy .
previous broadcasts include " sex , a user 's guide , " a series of no-holds-barred education programs , and " shoot up and swallow , " a series dedicated to sex and drugs .
" the big donorshow " was dreamt up by endemol , the dutch production company behind " big brother " and other reality television shows .
it focuses on lisa , a 37-year-old woman dying of a brain tumor .
she must decide which of three patients selected by the producers should receive her kidney .
viewers can offer their opinions by sms text message .
lawmakers want ban on tuesday , the show was brought up in dutch parliament , where lawmakers agreed on the need to highlight the shortage of organ donors but were divided on whether reality television was the best way to do it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's organ donor card some lawmakers called on the ministers for health and media to take the program off air .
the two cabinet members had already made clear they did not have the authority to ban the program .
in the netherlands , organ transplants are subject to strict laws , which prohibit donors from choosing who will receive their organs after their death .
however , an exemption is made in the case of kidney transplants , which can be carried out while the donor is still alive , allowing the donor to choose the beneficiary if there is some link between the two people .
after an eu-wide survey showed that while 81 percent of european citizens support the use of organ donor cards , only 12 percent have one , the european commission proposed its action plan , which includes introducing an eu-wide donor card and creating organ transplant coordinators in hospitals .
the eu executive arm is hopeful that european legislation on common standards for the quality and safety of organ donation will be introduced next year when its proposals are developed . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " there is no cohesion of tv writing staff in germany " german tv networks are taking their cues state-side in a bid to create better drama series .

us secretary of state condoleezza rice , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and russian foreign minister sergei lavrov will attend the meeting of the quartet , which comprises the united states , the un , the eu and russia .
the potsdam meeting was aimed at preparing the summit of leaders of the group of eight most industrialized nations in heiligendamm , northeast germany , june 6-8 .
the ministers were tackling a range of international crises including the iranian and north korean nuclear programs , afghanistan and kosovo .
but japan poured cold water on one of the issues germany had placed at the top of its priority list for the summit - a binding agreement on reducing greenhouse gases .
divisions over climate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state rice -lrb- l -rrb- was also in potsdam foreign ministry spokesman mitsuo sakaba said german proposals to complete negotiations on a successor to the kyoto protocol on greenhouse gases by 2009 were " premature . "
japan has been leading efforts among asian nations to limit global warming .
it said it believed major emitters of greenhouse gases such as the united states , china and india should agree to join the process before any timetable was put in place .
" until we know if they will join us , it is premature , " sakaba said .
germany took advantage of the presence of rice and lavrov to hastily convene the middle east quartet , the body which drew up the stalled roadmap for peace .
however , faced with the bloodiest internal clashes in lebanon for decades and the firing of palestinian rockets into israel and israeli airstrikes in gaza , expectations for the meeting were low .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive security at the g8 heiligendamm location in potsdam , the minister said they were troubled by the situation in the region and called on the palestinian government to put an end to internal strife and missile attacks against israel , a german delegation source said .
" the spiral of violence must be stopped , " steinmeier told his fellow ministers , the source said .
there was broad agreement that the international community needed to encourage talks between israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmoud abbas .
they urged the palestinian authority to fulfill the demands of the middle east quartet including renouncing violence , recognizing israel and respecting previous agreements with the jewish state .
and they called on israel to unfreeze palestinian tax revenue and customs duties .
kosovo on the agenda the future status of kosovo , an issue that bitterly divides russia and the west , was also on the table in potsdam .
russia rejects proposals by chief un negotiator martti ahtisaari to grant kosovo internationally supervised independence from serbia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some criticize the world 's poorest get lost in the g8 shuffle steinmeier said he expected a clash over the province at the meeting .
" we are going to have a discussion on kosovo that will not be easy , " he said .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner , the un representative for kosovo from 1999-2001 , said the issue was " very difficult . "
russian foreign foreign minister sergei lavrov told reporters he wanted " justice " for kosovo .
the ministers also addressed the situation in strife-torn afghanistan .
afghan foreign minister rangeen dadfar spanta and his pakistani counterpart khurshid kasuri were attending the potsdam talks as part of a german-brokered initiative to resolve a dispute about their joint border .
afghanistan and pakistan have been trading recriminations about growing violence linked to taliban extremists on either side of the border .
steinmeier said cooperation between the neighbors was crucial to regional stability .
" bringing the two sides together is essential if we want to improve security , " he said . dw staff / afp -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de climate change divides foreign ministers at eu-asia meeting foreign ministers from asia and europe disagreed on tuesday in the german city of hamburg on how to respond to climate change , with china telling the eu that nations had " common but differing responsibilities .

laurens dillich , the head of public service broadcaster bnn , told public radio : " the chances of the candidates obtaining a kidney are 33 percent , far better than for those on organ waiting lists .
you would imagine that -lrb- waiting times -rrb- have improved , but they are getting longer . "
bnn , a channel aimed at young people , is screening the show on the fifth anniversary of the death of its founder , bart de graaff .
he died after waiting seven years for a kidney donation .
international criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bart de graaff , in 1999 the project has prompted condemnation across the netherlands and beyond .
in brussels , a spokesman for the european commission - which on wednesday presented an action plan to reduce organ donor waiting lists - said it was in " pretty bad taste . "
the dutch kidney foundation welcomed the attention bnn had brought on the subject , but noted that " their way of doing it is not ours , and it will bring no practical solution . "
" i 'm afraid it 's primarily about the shock effect which has characterized the channel bnn since … the mid-90s , " media analyst jo groebel told dw-radio .
" i 'm afraid that … the whole debate is just increasing the market value and the market success of such a program , and this is what makes it extremely cynical - that the discussion itself adds to the program .
this is not the first time bnn has courted controversy .

" the big donorshow " was dreamt up by endemol , the dutch production company behind " big brother " and other reality television shows .

us secretary of state condoleezza rice , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and russian foreign minister sergei lavrov will attend the meeting of the quartet , which comprises the united states , the un , the eu and russia .
the potsdam meeting was aimed at preparing the summit of leaders of the group of eight most industrialized nations in heiligendamm , northeast germany , june 6-8 .
the ministers were tackling a range of international crises including the iranian and north korean nuclear programs , afghanistan and kosovo .
but japan poured cold water on one of the issues germany had placed at the top of its priority list for the summit - a binding agreement on reducing greenhouse gases .

japan has been leading efforts among asian nations to limit global warming .
it said it believed major emitters of greenhouse gases such as the united states , china and india should agree to join the process before any timetable was put in place .
" until we know if they will join us , it is premature , " sakaba said .
germany took advantage of the presence of rice and lavrov to hastily convene the middle east quartet , the body which drew up the stalled roadmap for peace .
however , faced with the bloodiest internal clashes in lebanon for decades and the firing of palestinian rockets into israel and israeli airstrikes in gaza , expectations for the meeting were low .

there was broad agreement that the international community needed to encourage talks between israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmoud abbas .
they urged the palestinian authority to fulfill the demands of the middle east quartet including renouncing violence , recognizing israel and respecting previous agreements with the jewish state .
and they called on israel to unfreeze palestinian tax revenue and customs duties .

french foreign minister bernard kouchner , the un representative for kosovo from 1999-2001 , said the issue was " very difficult . "
russian foreign foreign minister sergei lavrov told reporters he wanted " justice " for kosovo .
the ministers also addressed the situation in strife-torn afghanistan .
afghan foreign minister rangeen dadfar spanta and his pakistani counterpart khurshid kasuri were attending the potsdam talks as part of a german-brokered initiative to resolve a dispute about their joint border .
afghanistan and pakistan have been trading recriminations about growing violence linked to taliban extremists on either side of the border .

it 's just one of a series of tight , yet controversial security measures . german television pictures showed shots of the 2.5-meter -lrb- 2.7 yard -rrb- metal fence , topped with barbed wire , that runs 11.6 kilometers -lrb- 7.2 miles -rrb- around the town .
early wednesday morning , authorities closed off the two access points leading to the resort in heiligendamm .
the closure also affects a railway line and a road through the resort ; boats are banned from the area near the shore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations have been going on for weeks across germany with the fence being a general security precaution , the controversial measures are also designed to keep anti-globalization demonstrators well away from the world leaders attending the summit .
protestors , however , have called the security steps excessive .
pricey security about 16,000 members of the security forces , more than five percent of germany 's total , will be on duty in the town to deal with what could be as many as 100,000 protestors .
the security operation has been the focus of heated debate , not least because of its 12.5 million-euro -lrb- $ 16.8 million -rrb- price tag .
most normal traffic will be banned from the zone until june 9 , a day after the summit 's end .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 30.05.2007 german government probes doping scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a flurry of doping confessions has rocked the world of professional cycling the german government is to examine whether taxpayers ' money was misused in a cycling doping scandal involving riders and doctors from the country 's leading cycling team . interior minister wolfgang schäuble told the cabinet on wednesday he was launching a " task force " to investigate the possible misuse of taxpayers ' money in doping .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble wants to see a new anti-doping law passed in the bundestag " doping destroys the value of sport , " schäuble said .
" its credibility , its function as a provider of role models and its approval by the public are being put on the test . "
schäuble is meanwhile pressing for a rapid passage through parliament of a new anti-doping law , which among other things would permit lenient treatment for people who come forward to testify .
the government is also examining proposals to ban imports of medicines intended for doping offences .
german chancellor angela merkel has urged cyclists who used performance-enhancing drugs to come clean and break a " cartel of silence . "
" there has evidently been systematic and continued manipulation of unimaginable proportions in professional cycling , " the chancellor said in a statement .
" the confessions and investigations undertaken so far are n't sufficient to clean the sport up . "
new confessions the government 's moves follow doping confessions from riders from the telekom team , now known as t-mobile .
on friday , retired danish cyclist bjarne riis admitted using doping during his 1996 tour de france victory while riding for telekom .
the admission came a day after former teammates erik zabel and rolf aldag confessed they used performance-enhancing drugs while riding for telekom in the 1990s .
four other riders from the team have also admitted doping , but germany 's 1997 tour winner jan ullrich has remained silent .
no comment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich ended his career amidst speculations that he , too , used illegal substances ullrich 's manager wolfgang strohband has said his client would not speak about a claim made by former telekom team masseur jef d 'hont , who told the newspaper bild this week he had injected the cyclist with the erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- blood booster on one occasion .
freiburg university on thursday dismissed its doctors andreas schmid and lothar heinrich after they admitted giving athletes doping substances .
the university promised a full investigation into the past 20 years of its sports medicine .
nationwide scope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the image of cycling has been tarnished public prosecutors in freiburg meanwhile said they had handed an investigation into schmid and heinrich over to the federal criminal police department -lrb- bka -rrb- in view of the nationwide scope of the probe .
heinrich and schmid admitted that as team doctors they were involved in epo blood doping in the mid-1990s at the telekom team .

the well-preserved passport , issued in 1948 by an italian delegation of the international committee of the red cross , was presented on tuesday at the buenos aires holocaust museum .
it also bears the stamp and the signature of the argentine vice-counsel in genova , italy at that time , pedro solari capurro .

eichmann 's wife had presented the passport to authorities in 1960 after he had been abducted by israeli secret service agents from the buenos aires suburb where he lived a normal life working at the mercedes benz factory .
he was taken to israel , tried for crimes against humanity and hanged in 1962 .
" this document leaves no room for doubts on how easy it was for not only eichmann , but also other war criminals , to attain fake identification documents , change their names and enter our country , " jinich said .

they also showed that the united states used a large network of spies recruited among former nazis and that the cia had virtually no interest in arresting war criminals , focusing instead on cold war issues .
" the american policy of the time was not to pursue nazi war criminals , " said historian timothy naftali , who reviewed thousands of documents on cia ties to nazis from the us national archives .
" they thought that was the responsibility of the germans . "
according to the cia papers , west germany knew from 1952 that eichmann was hiding in argentina under an assumed identity , but kept quiet about it fearing the fugitive might talk about hans globke , a former nazi who was a top national security advisor to konrad adenauer , the chancellor at the time . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " this is a german story " in an interview with dw-world.de , us historian timothy naftali says germans should pressure their own government to receive more information on the role of nazis in german government after 1945 .

forgeard , former joint chief executive at eads which owns airbus , told the magazine le point : " airbus did not report any unrecoverable delay before the middle of april 2006 , and at that time the financial consequences were very limited . "
he repeated that he had " respected all of the rules -lrb- at eads -rrb- which are among the most restrictive among companies quoted on the cac 40 index . "
the controversy and criticism of a big severance payment to forgeard are hot issues in france particularly , where the new government under president nicolas sarkozy has signaled it will act to curb so-called " golden handshakes . "
insider trading ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's forgeard was co-chair of eads from june 2005 - june 2006 forgeard and many other senior managers sold stock options in march last year , three months before the european aeronautics defence and space company and airbus announced serious delays in production of the a380 superjumbo airliner .
two big shareholders in eads , daimlerchrysler in germany and lagardere group in france each decided on march 20 to sell stakes of 7.5 percent .
the group had said in 2005 that there were some problems with production and that it was investigating the extent of these .
but the announcement in june 2006 of deep problems came as a shock to the stock market and the price of shares in eads fell heavily .
the problems rapidly developed into a long crisis with changes in top management and a rescue plan involving the loss of 10,000 jobs , although this remains clouded in some uncertainty .
there is also a prospect that eads will have to raise new capital .
forgeard is the target of suspicions , renewed in allegations in a press report on tuesday , that he was aware of the impact of production problems on the group when he decided to exercise stock options .
blames german managers the use of such privileged information , which has not been communicated publicly to market authorities , is known as insider trading and is illegal because it privileges one investor over another , distorts the equitable availability of information and therefore undermines confidence in a stock market .
stock market rules require managers to inform the market quickly if they become aware of a sudden and significant change in their company 's prospects .
forgeard also argued that during his period in various top positions at airbus , the company had become " a world leader , " and that despite the planned loss of 10,000 jobs , " the balance over eight years is positive to the extent of tens of thousands of jobs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delays have plagued the a380 superjumbo he also blamed a large part of the production problems on the attitude of top managers in germany where much of the work on airbus airliners is carried out , saying they wanted to continue doing things their way while he wanted to a single , overall method of working .
this was a reference to revelations that software used for installing cabling systems in hamburg , germany , was not compatible with design software at airbus headquarters in toulouse , france .
problems in adapting complex cabling to the requirements of individual airlines were at the center of the delays to production .
forgeard also launched a personal attack on his co-chair at the time , germany 's thomas enders .
" i ask myself whether he had n't been commissioned by daimler boss jürgen schrempp to neutralize or even get rid of me , " the former manager said .
qatar stays loyal the head of lagardere group , and joint co-chairman of eads , arnaud lagardere was questioned at length on tuesday by stock market regulators probing suspicions that there had been insider trading in eads stock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus planes are european co-productions both forgeard and lagardere have insisted that they did nothing wrong .
on wednesday , the persian gulf state of qatar signed an order for 80 airbus a350 aircraft worth $ 16 billion , the largest contract to date for the model .
since it was founded in 1994 , qatar airways has only bought airbus planes , including the delay-plagued a380 . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says public funding needed to rescue galileo from delays the european commission said on wednesday that the eu should inject huge amounts of public money into the prestigious galileo satellite navigation system to rescue it from bickering among private-sector investors .

iran expert alex bigham spoke with dw-world.de about thursday 's meeting between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iranian nuclear negotiator ali larijani .
iran wants proliferation and recognition , he said . dw-world.de : mr. bigham , what is your assessment of monday 's meeting in baghdad between the us and iranian ambassadors to iraq ?
alex bigham : i certainly think the talks are a positive sign , and this may be a tentative start of a period of cooling off in relations .
there has been an indication from the iranians of a willingness to meet in a month 's time , which is a welcome sign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana -lrb- left -rrb- and larijani at a meeting in berlin last september the talks are limited of course , really to one issue : iraq .
there are obvious reasons why america would want to seek iranian help in iraq - in order to improve stability in the country and to reduce the flow of funds and arms to insurgents who are attacking coalition forces .
the difficult question is why iran would want to assist coalition forces .
there will no doubt be elements in iran who want the americans to remain bogged down in iraq because they see that as a buffer to a possible attack on iran .
but it seems that those advocating dialogue both in washington and tehran are winning the argument for the moment .
they want to see stability on iran 's border with iraq , an area which has suffered from terrorist acts against the iranian government .
it 's certainly in iran 's long term self-interest to improve security and stability in iraq . iran 's nuclear program had not been on the agenda .
are you nevertheless surprised that the issue did not arise ? i am not surprised it was n't discussed .
neither side wants to be seen to be compromising on the nuclear issue at this stage , given domestic pressures in both iran and america .
the us does n't want to replicate or divert attention from the iaea , un and eu structures .
they deliberately want this to be seen as a disagreement between iran and the international community , not between iran and america . will monday 's talks have an impact on javier solana 's meeting with the iranian nuclear negotiator ali larijani on thursday ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intransigency on both sides blocks europe 's negotiations , said bigham the baghdad talks may offer some kind of reassurance to the iranian government in terms of the likelihood of military action , but there will need to be concrete results in order for the americans to be convinced of progress .
although the baghdad talks may help as a confidence-building measure , which is welcome , necessary , and frankly overdue , both the eu and iran are seeing the discussions on iran 's nuclear program as a separate issue from the future of iraq . what approach do you expect solana to take ? solana 's approach is not to engage in a negotiation directly about the nuclear issue , but to try to get an agreement to have a negotiation which would involve the p5 + 1 -lrb- editor 's note : the five per manent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the us - plus germany -rrb- .
however , the sticking point is the precondition the us has set that iran suspends uranium enrichment before negotiations .
the iranians have repeatedly ruled out the possibility of talks with any preconditions . what do you expect to come out of the talks ? there does n't seem to have been a fundamental shift in either side 's position , so the possibility of an agreement is small .
the difficulty in separating the issues of iraq and the nuclear program is that iran seems to want two things in return for reducing its support for insurgents in iraq : proliferation and recognition of its regional role .
these are effectively red lines for the americans , which make overcoming the stalemate a difficult , long term process . do you agree with the eu 's policy towards iran ?
what should the eu be doing differently ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayatollah khamenei is the main decision-maker on iran 's foreign and security policies the eu has made a great deal of effort to negotiate to iran .
the main barriers to progress are the relative intransigency of both the iranian and the american position on the nuclear issue .
another problem is the internal divisions within iran .
larijani is clearly a growing political player in tehran for the moment , but it is the supreme leader , khamenei who will make the final decision on iran 's security and foreign policy .
ayatollah khamenei is reluctant to make a final decision on the nuclear issues for fear of alienating one of the factions in iranian politics and undermining his own position .
one option that needs renewed consideration is el baradei 's proposal of a mutual " time-out " - iran suspending enrichment while the un suspends sanctions .
that is one option that should at least be put on the table .

iran expert alex bigham spoke with dw-world.de about thursday 's meeting between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iranian nuclear negotiator ali larijani .
iran wants proliferation and recognition , he said . dw-world.de : mr. bigham , what is your assessment of monday 's meeting in baghdad between the us and iranian ambassadors to iraq ?
alex bigham : i certainly think the talks are a positive sign , and this may be a tentative start of a period of cooling off in relations .
there has been an indication from the iranians of a willingness to meet in a month 's time , which is a welcome sign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana -lrb- left -rrb- and larijani at a meeting in berlin last september the talks are limited of course , really to one issue : iraq .
there are obvious reasons why america would want to seek iranian help in iraq - in order to improve stability in the country and to reduce the flow of funds and arms to insurgents who are attacking coalition forces .
the difficult question is why iran would want to assist coalition forces .
there will no doubt be elements in iran who want the americans to remain bogged down in iraq because they see that as a buffer to a possible attack on iran .
but it seems that those advocating dialogue both in washington and tehran are winning the argument for the moment .
they want to see stability on iran 's border with iraq , an area which has suffered from terrorist acts against the iranian government .
it 's certainly in iran 's long term self-interest to improve security and stability in iraq . iran 's nuclear program had not been on the agenda .
are you nevertheless surprised that the issue did not arise ? i am not surprised it was n't discussed .
neither side wants to be seen to be compromising on the nuclear issue at this stage , given domestic pressures in both iran and america .
the us does n't want to replicate or divert attention from the iaea , un and eu structures .
they deliberately want this to be seen as a disagreement between iran and the international community , not between iran and america . will monday 's talks have an impact on javier solana 's meeting with the iranian nuclear negotiator ali larijani on thursday ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intransigency on both sides blocks europe 's negotiations , said bigham the baghdad talks may offer some kind of reassurance to the iranian government in terms of the likelihood of military action , but there will need to be concrete results in order for the americans to be convinced of progress .

the well-preserved passport , issued in 1948 by an italian delegation of the international committee of the red cross , was presented on tuesday at the buenos aires holocaust museum .
it also bears the stamp and the signature of the argentine vice-counsel in genova , italy at that time , pedro solari capurro .
a factory worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eichmann was sentenced to death by an israeli court federal judge maria servini de cubria recently opened the eichmann file and found the well-preserved passport , graciela jinich , the director of the buenos aires holocaust museum , told dpa news service .
eichmann 's wife had presented the passport to authorities in 1960 after he had been abducted by israeli secret service agents from the buenos aires suburb where he lived a normal life working at the mercedes benz factory .
he was taken to israel , tried for crimes against humanity and hanged in 1962 .
" this document leaves no room for doubts on how easy it was for not only eichmann , but also other war criminals , to attain fake identification documents , change their names and enter our country , " jinich said .
suppressed information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eichmann was one of the leaders of the mass deportation of jews to extermination camps the united states released documents last year which showed that the cia learned about eichmann 's location and alias two years before israel captured him but kept the information secret as part of its efforts to combat communism in post-war west germany .
they also showed that the united states used a large network of spies recruited among former nazis and that the cia had virtually no interest in arresting war criminals , focusing instead on cold war issues .
" the american policy of the time was not to pursue nazi war criminals , " said historian timothy naftali , who reviewed thousands of documents on cia ties to nazis from the us national archives .
" they thought that was the responsibility of the germans . "
according to the cia papers , west germany knew from 1952 that eichmann was hiding in argentina under an assumed identity , but kept quiet about it fearing the fugitive might talk about hans globke , a former nazi who was a top national security advisor to konrad adenauer , the chancellor at the time . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " this is a german story " in an interview with dw-world.de , us historian timothy naftali says germans should pressure their own government to receive more information on the role of nazis in german government after 1945 .

the well-preserved passport , issued in 1948 by an italian delegation of the international committee of the red cross , was presented on tuesday at the buenos aires holocaust museum .
it also bears the stamp and the signature of the argentine vice-counsel in genova , italy at that time , pedro solari capurro .
a factory worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eichmann was sentenced to death by an israeli court federal judge maria servini de cubria recently opened the eichmann file and found the well-preserved passport , graciela jinich , the director of the buenos aires holocaust museum , told dpa news service .
eichmann 's wife had presented the passport to authorities in 1960 after he had been abducted by israeli secret service agents from the buenos aires suburb where he lived a normal life working at the mercedes benz factory .
he was taken to israel , tried for crimes against humanity and hanged in 1962 .
" this document leaves no room for doubts on how easy it was for not only eichmann , but also other war criminals , to attain fake identification documents , change their names and enter our country , " jinich said .
suppressed information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eichmann was one of the leaders of the mass deportation of jews to extermination camps the united states released documents last year which showed that the cia learned about eichmann 's location and alias two years before israel captured him but kept the information secret as part of its efforts to combat communism in post-war west germany .
they also showed that the united states used a large network of spies recruited among former nazis and that the cia had virtually no interest in arresting war criminals , focusing instead on cold war issues .
" the american policy of the time was not to pursue nazi war criminals , " said historian timothy naftali , who reviewed thousands of documents on cia ties to nazis from the us national archives .
" they thought that was the responsibility of the germans . "
according to the cia papers , west germany knew from 1952 that eichmann was hiding in argentina under an assumed identity , but kept quiet about it fearing the fugitive might talk about hans globke , a former nazi who was a top national security advisor to konrad adenauer , the chancellor at the time . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " this is a german story " in an interview with dw-world.de , us historian timothy naftali says germans should pressure their own government to receive more information on the role of nazis in german government after 1945 .

forgeard , former joint chief executive at eads which owns airbus , told the magazine le point : " airbus did not report any unrecoverable delay before the middle of april 2006 , and at that time the financial consequences were very limited . "
he repeated that he had " respected all of the rules -lrb- at eads -rrb- which are among the most restrictive among companies quoted on the cac 40 index . "
the controversy and criticism of a big severance payment to forgeard are hot issues in france particularly , where the new government under president nicolas sarkozy has signaled it will act to curb so-called " golden handshakes . "
insider trading ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's forgeard was co-chair of eads from june 2005 - june 2006 forgeard and many other senior managers sold stock options in march last year , three months before the european aeronautics defence and space company and airbus announced serious delays in production of the a380 superjumbo airliner .
two big shareholders in eads , daimlerchrysler in germany and lagardere group in france each decided on march 20 to sell stakes of 7.5 percent .
the group had said in 2005 that there were some problems with production and that it was investigating the extent of these .
but the announcement in june 2006 of deep problems came as a shock to the stock market and the price of shares in eads fell heavily .
the problems rapidly developed into a long crisis with changes in top management and a rescue plan involving the loss of 10,000 jobs , although this remains clouded in some uncertainty .
there is also a prospect that eads will have to raise new capital .
forgeard is the target of suspicions , renewed in allegations in a press report on tuesday , that he was aware of the impact of production problems on the group when he decided to exercise stock options .
blames german managers the use of such privileged information , which has not been communicated publicly to market authorities , is known as insider trading and is illegal because it privileges one investor over another , distorts the equitable availability of information and therefore undermines confidence in a stock market .
stock market rules require managers to inform the market quickly if they become aware of a sudden and significant change in their company 's prospects .
forgeard also argued that during his period in various top positions at airbus , the company had become " a world leader , " and that despite the planned loss of 10,000 jobs , " the balance over eight years is positive to the extent of tens of thousands of jobs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delays have plagued the a380 superjumbo he also blamed a large part of the production problems on the attitude of top managers in germany where much of the work on airbus airliners is carried out , saying they wanted to continue doing things their way while he wanted to a single , overall method of working .
this was a reference to revelations that software used for installing cabling systems in hamburg , germany , was not compatible with design software at airbus headquarters in toulouse , france .
problems in adapting complex cabling to the requirements of individual airlines were at the center of the delays to production .
forgeard also launched a personal attack on his co-chair at the time , germany 's thomas enders .
" i ask myself whether he had n't been commissioned by daimler boss jürgen schrempp to neutralize or even get rid of me , " the former manager said .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's forgeard was co-chair of eads from june 2005 - june 2006 forgeard and many other senior managers sold stock options in march last year , three months before the european aeronautics defence and space company and airbus announced serious delays in production of the a380 superjumbo airliner .
two big shareholders in eads , daimlerchrysler in germany and lagardere group in france each decided on march 20 to sell stakes of 7.5 percent .
the group had said in 2005 that there were some problems with production and that it was investigating the extent of these .
but the announcement in june 2006 of deep problems came as a shock to the stock market and the price of shares in eads fell heavily .
the problems rapidly developed into a long crisis with changes in top management and a rescue plan involving the loss of 10,000 jobs , although this remains clouded in some uncertainty .
there is also a prospect that eads will have to raise new capital .
forgeard is the target of suspicions , renewed in allegations in a press report on tuesday , that he was aware of the impact of production problems on the group when he decided to exercise stock options .
blames german managers the use of such privileged information , which has not been communicated publicly to market authorities , is known as insider trading and is illegal because it privileges one investor over another , distorts the equitable availability of information and therefore undermines confidence in a stock market .
stock market rules require managers to inform the market quickly if they become aware of a sudden and significant change in their company 's prospects .
forgeard also argued that during his period in various top positions at airbus , the company had become " a world leader , " and that despite the planned loss of 10,000 jobs , " the balance over eight years is positive to the extent of tens of thousands of jobs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delays have plagued the a380 superjumbo he also blamed a large part of the production problems on the attitude of top managers in germany where much of the work on airbus airliners is carried out , saying they wanted to continue doing things their way while he wanted to a single , overall method of working .
this was a reference to revelations that software used for installing cabling systems in hamburg , germany , was not compatible with design software at airbus headquarters in toulouse , france .
problems in adapting complex cabling to the requirements of individual airlines were at the center of the delays to production .
forgeard also launched a personal attack on his co-chair at the time , germany 's thomas enders .
" i ask myself whether he had n't been commissioned by daimler boss jürgen schrempp to neutralize or even get rid of me , " the former manager said .
qatar stays loyal the head of lagardere group , and joint co-chairman of eads , arnaud lagardere was questioned at length on tuesday by stock market regulators probing suspicions that there had been insider trading in eads stock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus planes are european co-productions both forgeard and lagardere have insisted that they did nothing wrong .
on wednesday , the persian gulf state of qatar signed an order for 80 airbus a350 aircraft worth $ 16 billion , the largest contract to date for the model .
since it was founded in 1994 , qatar airways has only bought airbus planes , including the delay-plagued a380 . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu says public funding needed to rescue galileo from delays the european commission said on wednesday that the eu should inject huge amounts of public money into the prestigious galileo satellite navigation system to rescue it from bickering among private-sector investors .

so it 's no coincidence dw-world.de 's top eleven has an average age of just under 25 .
we pay tribute to the players who came up big in the clutch . up front no one player was more important to his team than bochum 's theofanis gekas .
the greek forward went on a tear in the second half of the season , lifting his side from the relegation zone to eighth place in the standings and topping the league with 20 goals .
gekas is moving to leverkusen , where he 'll have to show that 2006-7 was no fluke .
until then , he can take pride in a breakthrough season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gekas provided a lot of greek tragedy for defenses mario gomez had 14 goals and eight assists , fewer than bremen 's miroslav klose , but that was due to injury .
and unlike klose , gomez finished the season strongly , scoring a crucial equalizer in the second-to-last game to keep stuttgart 's title drive on track .
at the tender age of 21 , he 's poised to become a regular in the german national squad . on the bench : klose -lrb- bremen -rrb- , kuranyi -lrb- schalke -rrb- , zidan -lrb- mainz -rrb- , frei -lrb- dortmund -rrb- the midfield the players themselves voted bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego the season 's mvp , and they get no argument here .
thirteen goals and 14 assists in his first season in the bundesliga speak volumes , and the truly scary thing is : he 's only 22 ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's dribbling skills stymied opposing midfielders diego is joined by two rising young stars from stuttgart who had a huge impact this spring .
thomas hitzls per ger , nicknamed the " hammer , " has the hardest shot in the german game , and he scored in each of stuttgart 's final two come-from-behind wins . like hitzlsperger , roberto hilbert finished the season with seven goals , four of which came during the streak of eight straight wins that sealed the title for stuttgart .
he deservedly won his first cap for the german national side during that stretch , and it 's easy to picture him , at only 22 , getting better and better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzlsperger scored some of the season 's most spectacular goals completing our dream midfield is leverkusen 's bernd schneider .
one of the league 's most consistent and technically proficient players , the 33-year-old veteran had six goals and 11 eleven assists .
more importantly , he held things together on a team that was n't clicking early , leading leverkusen to fifth place and a spot in the uefa cup . on the bench : frings -lrb- bremen -rrb- , pardo -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- , marcelinho -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- , misimovic -lrb- bochum -rrb- at the back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : led by bordon , schalke only conceded 32 goals nuremberg and schalke had the league 's stingiest defenses , so they 're the place we start building our back four .
at left back , the honors go to nuremberg 's javier pinola .
the spaniard with the league 's worst hairstyle really performed in nuremberg 's german cup triumph , scoring twice in penalty shoot-outs to keep his side alive in the tournament and adding a clutch assist in the final . in the middle , no defender was more intimidating than schalke 's marcelo bordon .
a devout catholic he may be , but his christian charity certainly does not extend to opposing strikers in the box .
bordon also scored three goals as schalke , once again , came up tragically short . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delpierre completely shut down bayern in a key match in april he 's paired with stuttgart 's unsung hero , matthieu delpierre .
the frenchman made very few mistakes this season despite playing in all but one of the team 's league and cup matches .
what 's more he was able to stay in front of his man without fouling , picking up only four yellow cards over that long stretch . schalke 's rafinha fills out the back line .
he ended the season with a respectable two goals and three assists , but what does n't show up in the statistics is the amount of pressure the speedy brazilian created on the right-hand flank .
at only 22 he played with a maturity and acumen way beyond his years . on the bench : naldo -lrb- bremen -rrb- , mertesecker -lrb- bremen -rrb- , wolf -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- , madlung -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- between the posts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuer 's colleagues in the bundesliga also voted him the season 's best keeper and what 's true of rafinha goes double for schalke keeper manuel neuer .
the 21-year-old deposed one of the league 's most seasoned number ones , frank rost , in the tenth week , and for the rest of the season he never conceded more than two goals in a match .
and he did that in the high-pressure atmosphere of schalke , which was gunning for its first german league title in 49 years .
if his teammates up front had n't frozen up against dortmund , neuer could have capped off a remarkable rookie season with the bundesliga 's ultimate prize . on the bench : schäfer -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuremberg claim german cup with late scorcher danish midfielder jan kristiansen was the star on saturday night with a 30-meter blast in extra-time .
that goal gave nuremberg a 3-2 win over 10-man stuttgart and ended the bavarians ' 45-year wait for the german cup .
-lrb- 29.05.2007 -rrb- rough ride to the bundesliga title for champions stuttgart although vfb stuttgart were crowned bundesliga champions on saturday , it was not a smooth ride for armin veh 's men whose early-season form showed little title-winning potential .
-lrb- 20.05.2007 -rrb- khedira the hero as stuttgart win the 2007 bundesliga midfielder sami khedira was the hero as he hit the winning goal which gave vfb stuttgart their first bundesliga title for 15 years on saturday after a 2-1 victory at home to energie cottbus .

the number of officers , which include the some 40 german representatives already there , is to be expanded to around 160 over the course of the mission .

police trainers would be armed for purposes of self-defence , but would have to rely on the nato-led isaf peacekeeping force for protection , said eichele , who added that the running costs for the first year would amount to 43.6 million euros -lrb- $ 58.8 million -rrb- .
dubbed eupol , the german-run mission will be headquartered in the capital city of kabul but will encompass regions throughout afghanistan including southern provinces where insurgent fighting has been most intense , said eu special representative for afghanistan francesc vendrell tuesday from brussels .
recent civilian deaths in the region have sparked concerns that the local population has lost faith in the international peacekeeping force . a minimum contribution for vendrell , the project does n't go far enough .
" i think that the eu has decided to play as big a role as possible , unfortunately not as big as i would have liked , " added vendrell , who said he would have like to have seen it at the same size as the mission in kosovo .

the us has also put pressure on the eu to speed up progress .

an existing us police mission in afghanistan involves 500 trainers , including members of private security companies .
eupol is meant to complement the american force .
the war-torn country currently has a police force of 60,000 , which is ill-equipped and riddled by corruption .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 30.05.2007 young stars shone brightest in 2006-7 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league was dominated by players in their early twenties in an unusual season , stuttgart took the title with a team of youngsters .
so it 's no coincidence dw-world.de 's top eleven has an average age of just under 25 .
we pay tribute to the players who came up big in the clutch . up front no one player was more important to his team than bochum 's theofanis gekas .
the greek forward went on a tear in the second half of the season , lifting his side from the relegation zone to eighth place in the standings and topping the league with 20 goals .
gekas is moving to leverkusen , where he 'll have to show that 2006-7 was no fluke .
until then , he can take pride in a breakthrough season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gekas provided a lot of greek tragedy for defenses mario gomez had 14 goals and eight assists , fewer than bremen 's miroslav klose , but that was due to injury .
and unlike klose , gomez finished the season strongly , scoring a crucial equalizer in the second-to-last game to keep stuttgart 's title drive on track .
at the tender age of 21 , he 's poised to become a regular in the german national squad . on the bench : klose -lrb- bremen -rrb- , kuranyi -lrb- schalke -rrb- , zidan -lrb- mainz -rrb- , frei -lrb- dortmund -rrb- the midfield the players themselves voted bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego the season 's mvp , and they get no argument here .
thirteen goals and 14 assists in his first season in the bundesliga speak volumes , and the truly scary thing is : he 's only 22 ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's dribbling skills stymied opposing midfielders diego is joined by two rising young stars from stuttgart who had a huge impact this spring .
thomas hitzls per ger , nicknamed the " hammer , " has the hardest shot in the german game , and he scored in each of stuttgart 's final two come-from-behind wins . like hitzlsperger , roberto hilbert finished the season with seven goals , four of which came during the streak of eight straight wins that sealed the title for stuttgart .
he deservedly won his first cap for the german national side during that stretch , and it 's easy to picture him , at only 22 , getting better and better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzlsperger scored some of the season 's most spectacular goals completing our dream midfield is leverkusen 's bernd schneider .
one of the league 's most consistent and technically proficient players , the 33-year-old veteran had six goals and 11 eleven assists .
more importantly , he held things together on a team that was n't clicking early , leading leverkusen to fifth place and a spot in the uefa cup . on the bench : frings -lrb- bremen -rrb- , pardo -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- , marcelinho -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- , misimovic -lrb- bochum -rrb- at the back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : led by bordon , schalke only conceded 32 goals nuremberg and schalke had the league 's stingiest defenses , so they 're the place we start building our back four .
at left back , the honors go to nuremberg 's javier pinola .
the spaniard with the league 's worst hairstyle really performed in nuremberg 's german cup triumph , scoring twice in penalty shoot-outs to keep his side alive in the tournament and adding a clutch assist in the final . in the middle , no defender was more intimidating than schalke 's marcelo bordon .
a devout catholic he may be , but his christian charity certainly does not extend to opposing strikers in the box .
bordon also scored three goals as schalke , once again , came up tragically short . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delpierre completely shut down bayern in a key match in april he 's paired with stuttgart 's unsung hero , matthieu delpierre .
the frenchman made very few mistakes this season despite playing in all but one of the team 's league and cup matches .
what 's more he was able to stay in front of his man without fouling , picking up only four yellow cards over that long stretch . schalke 's rafinha fills out the back line .
he ended the season with a respectable two goals and three assists , but what does n't show up in the statistics is the amount of pressure the speedy brazilian created on the right-hand flank .
at only 22 he played with a maturity and acumen way beyond his years . on the bench : naldo -lrb- bremen -rrb- , mertesecker -lrb- bremen -rrb- , wolf -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- , madlung -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- between the posts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuer 's colleagues in the bundesliga also voted him the season 's best keeper and what 's true of rafinha goes double for schalke keeper manuel neuer .
the 21-year-old deposed one of the league 's most seasoned number ones , frank rost , in the tenth week , and for the rest of the season he never conceded more than two goals in a match .
and he did that in the high-pressure atmosphere of schalke , which was gunning for its first german league title in 49 years .
if his teammates up front had n't frozen up against dortmund , neuer could have capped off a remarkable rookie season with the bundesliga 's ultimate prize . on the bench : schäfer -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuremberg claim german cup with late scorcher danish midfielder jan kristiansen was the star on saturday night with a 30-meter blast in extra-time .
that goal gave nuremberg a 3-2 win over 10-man stuttgart and ended the bavarians ' 45-year wait for the german cup .
-lrb- 29.05.2007 -rrb- rough ride to the bundesliga title for champions stuttgart although vfb stuttgart were crowned bundesliga champions on saturday , it was not a smooth ride for armin veh 's men whose early-season form showed little title-winning potential .

the number of officers , which include the some 40 german representatives already there , is to be expanded to around 160 over the course of the mission .
a burgeoning drug trade , widespread corruption and insurgent violence are among the challenges the local police are preparing for .
mission includes southern regions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currently over 40 german police officers are working with 3,500 afghan trainees the mission 's main objective is " to improve cohesion and coordination -lrb- of afghan police -rrb- through mentoring , monitoring , advising and training , " said brigadier general friedrich eichele , the german mission commander who will head the eu task force .
police trainers would be armed for purposes of self-defence , but would have to rely on the nato-led isaf peacekeeping force for protection , said eichele , who added that the running costs for the first year would amount to 43.6 million euros -lrb- $ 58.8 million -rrb- .
dubbed eupol , the german-run mission will be headquartered in the capital city of kabul but will encompass regions throughout afghanistan including southern provinces where insurgent fighting has been most intense , said eu special representative for afghanistan francesc vendrell tuesday from brussels .
recent civilian deaths in the region have sparked concerns that the local population has lost faith in the international peacekeeping force . a minimum contribution for vendrell , the project does n't go far enough .
" i think that the eu has decided to play as big a role as possible , unfortunately not as big as i would have liked , " added vendrell , who said he would have like to have seen it at the same size as the mission in kosovo .
the eu is planning to send 1,500 police trainers if the breakaway serb province wins independence .

iran expert alex bigham spoke with dw-world.de about thursday 's meeting between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iranian nuclear negotiator ali larijani .
iran wants proliferation and recognition , he said . dw-world.de : mr. bigham , what is your assessment of monday 's meeting in baghdad between the us and iranian ambassadors to iraq ?
alex bigham : i certainly think the talks are a positive sign , and this may be a tentative start of a period of cooling off in relations .
there has been an indication from the iranians of a willingness to meet in a month 's time , which is a welcome sign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana -lrb- left -rrb- and larijani at a meeting in berlin last september the talks are limited of course , really to one issue : iraq .
there are obvious reasons why america would want to seek iranian help in iraq - in order to improve stability in the country and to reduce the flow of funds and arms to insurgents who are attacking coalition forces .
the difficult question is why iran would want to assist coalition forces .
there will no doubt be elements in iran who want the americans to remain bogged down in iraq because they see that as a buffer to a possible attack on iran .
but it seems that those advocating dialogue both in washington and tehran are winning the argument for the moment .
they want to see stability on iran 's border with iraq , an area which has suffered from terrorist acts against the iranian government .
it 's certainly in iran 's long term self-interest to improve security and stability in iraq . iran 's nuclear program had not been on the agenda .
are you nevertheless surprised that the issue did not arise ? i am not surprised it was n't discussed .
neither side wants to be seen to be compromising on the nuclear issue at this stage , given domestic pressures in both iran and america .
the us does n't want to replicate or divert attention from the iaea , un and eu structures .
they deliberately want this to be seen as a disagreement between iran and the international community , not between iran and america . will monday 's talks have an impact on javier solana 's meeting with the iranian nuclear negotiator ali larijani on thursday ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intransigency on both sides blocks europe 's negotiations , said bigham the baghdad talks may offer some kind of reassurance to the iranian government in terms of the likelihood of military action , but there will need to be concrete results in order for the americans to be convinced of progress .
although the baghdad talks may help as a confidence-building measure , which is welcome , necessary , and frankly overdue , both the eu and iran are seeing the discussions on iran 's nuclear program as a separate issue from the future of iraq . what approach do you expect solana to take ? solana 's approach is not to engage in a negotiation directly about the nuclear issue , but to try to get an agreement to have a negotiation which would involve the p5 + 1 -lrb- editor 's note : the five per manent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the us - plus germany -rrb- .
however , the sticking point is the precondition the us has set that iran suspends uranium enrichment before negotiations .
the iranians have repeatedly ruled out the possibility of talks with any preconditions . what do you expect to come out of the talks ? there does n't seem to have been a fundamental shift in either side 's position , so the possibility of an agreement is small .
the difficulty in separating the issues of iraq and the nuclear program is that iran seems to want two things in return for reducing its support for insurgents in iraq : proliferation and recognition of its regional role .
these are effectively red lines for the americans , which make overcoming the stalemate a difficult , long term process . do you agree with the eu 's policy towards iran ?
what should the eu be doing differently ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayatollah khamenei is the main decision-maker on iran 's foreign and security policies the eu has made a great deal of effort to negotiate to iran .
the main barriers to progress are the relative intransigency of both the iranian and the american position on the nuclear issue .
another problem is the internal divisions within iran .
larijani is clearly a growing political player in tehran for the moment , but it is the supreme leader , khamenei who will make the final decision on iran 's security and foreign policy .
ayatollah khamenei is reluctant to make a final decision on the nuclear issues for fear of alienating one of the factions in iranian politics and undermining his own position .
one option that needs renewed consideration is el baradei 's proposal of a mutual " time-out " - iran suspending enrichment while the un suspends sanctions .
that is one option that should at least be put on the table .

the well-preserved passport , issued in 1948 by an italian delegation of the international committee of the red cross , was presented on tuesday at the buenos aires holocaust museum .
it also bears the stamp and the signature of the argentine vice-counsel in genova , italy at that time , pedro solari capurro .
a factory worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eichmann was sentenced to death by an israeli court federal judge maria servini de cubria recently opened the eichmann file and found the well-preserved passport , graciela jinich , the director of the buenos aires holocaust museum , told dpa news service .
eichmann 's wife had presented the passport to authorities in 1960 after he had been abducted by israeli secret service agents from the buenos aires suburb where he lived a normal life working at the mercedes benz factory .
he was taken to israel , tried for crimes against humanity and hanged in 1962 .
" this document leaves no room for doubts on how easy it was for not only eichmann , but also other war criminals , to attain fake identification documents , change their names and enter our country , " jinich said .
suppressed information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eichmann was one of the leaders of the mass deportation of jews to extermination camps the united states released documents last year which showed that the cia learned about eichmann 's location and alias two years before israel captured him but kept the information secret as part of its efforts to combat communism in post-war west germany .
they also showed that the united states used a large network of spies recruited among former nazis and that the cia had virtually no interest in arresting war criminals , focusing instead on cold war issues .
" the american policy of the time was not to pursue nazi war criminals , " said historian timothy naftali , who reviewed thousands of documents on cia ties to nazis from the us national archives .
" they thought that was the responsibility of the germans . "
according to the cia papers , west germany knew from 1952 that eichmann was hiding in argentina under an assumed identity , but kept quiet about it fearing the fugitive might talk about hans globke , a former nazi who was a top national security advisor to konrad adenauer , the chancellor at the time . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " this is a german story " in an interview with dw-world.de , us historian timothy naftali says germans should pressure their own government to receive more information on the role of nazis in german government after 1945 .

the well-preserved passport , issued in 1948 by an italian delegation of the international committee of the red cross , was presented on tuesday at the buenos aires holocaust museum .

laurens dillich , the head of public service broadcaster bnn , told public radio : " the chances of the candidates obtaining a kidney are 33 percent , far better than for those on organ waiting lists .
you would imagine that -lrb- waiting times -rrb- have improved , but they are getting longer . "
bnn , a channel aimed at young people , is screening the show on the fifth anniversary of the death of its founder , bart de graaff .
he died after waiting seven years for a kidney donation .
international criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bart de graaff , in 1999 the project has prompted condemnation across the netherlands and beyond .
in brussels , a spokesman for the european commission - which on wednesday presented an action plan to reduce organ donor waiting lists - said it was in " pretty bad taste . "
the dutch kidney foundation welcomed the attention bnn had brought on the subject , but noted that " their way of doing it is not ours , and it will bring no practical solution . "
" i 'm afraid it 's primarily about the shock effect which has characterized the channel bnn since … the mid-90s , " media analyst jo groebel told dw-radio .

in the netherlands , organ transplants are subject to strict laws , which prohibit donors from choosing who will receive their organs after their death .
however , an exemption is made in the case of kidney transplants , which can be carried out while the donor is still alive , allowing the donor to choose the beneficiary if there is some link between the two people .
after an eu-wide survey showed that while 81 percent of european citizens support the use of organ donor cards , only 12 percent have one , the european commission proposed its action plan , which includes introducing an eu-wide donor card and creating organ transplant coordinators in hospitals .

in brussels , a spokesman for the european commission - which on wednesday presented an action plan to reduce organ donor waiting lists - said it was in " pretty bad taste . "
the dutch kidney foundation welcomed the attention bnn had brought on the subject , but noted that " their way of doing it is not ours , and it will bring no practical solution . "
" i 'm afraid it 's primarily about the shock effect which has characterized the channel bnn since … the mid-90s , " media analyst jo groebel told dw-radio .

after an eu-wide survey showed that while 81 percent of european citizens support the use of organ donor cards , only 12 percent have one , the european commission proposed its action plan , which includes introducing an eu-wide donor card and creating organ transplant coordinators in hospitals .

us secretary of state condoleezza rice , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and russian foreign minister sergei lavrov will attend the meeting of the quartet , which comprises the united states , the un , the eu and russia .
the potsdam meeting was aimed at preparing the summit of leaders of the group of eight most industrialized nations in heiligendamm , northeast germany , june 6-8 .
the ministers were tackling a range of international crises including the iranian and north korean nuclear programs , afghanistan and kosovo .
but japan poured cold water on one of the issues germany had placed at the top of its priority list for the summit - a binding agreement on reducing greenhouse gases .

germany took advantage of the presence of rice and lavrov to hastily convene the middle east quartet , the body which drew up the stalled roadmap for peace .

there was broad agreement that the international community needed to encourage talks between israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmoud abbas .
they urged the palestinian authority to fulfill the demands of the middle east quartet including renouncing violence , recognizing israel and respecting previous agreements with the jewish state .

us secretary of state condoleezza rice , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and russian foreign minister sergei lavrov will attend the meeting of the quartet , which comprises the united states , the un , the eu and russia .
the potsdam meeting was aimed at preparing the summit of leaders of the group of eight most industrialized nations in heiligendamm , northeast germany , june 6-8 .
the ministers were tackling a range of international crises including the iranian and north korean nuclear programs , afghanistan and kosovo .
but japan poured cold water on one of the issues germany had placed at the top of its priority list for the summit - a binding agreement on reducing greenhouse gases .
divisions over climate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state rice -lrb- l -rrb- was also in potsdam foreign ministry spokesman mitsuo sakaba said german proposals to complete negotiations on a successor to the kyoto protocol on greenhouse gases by 2009 were " premature . "
japan has been leading efforts among asian nations to limit global warming .
it said it believed major emitters of greenhouse gases such as the united states , china and india should agree to join the process before any timetable was put in place .
" until we know if they will join us , it is premature , " sakaba said .
germany took advantage of the presence of rice and lavrov to hastily convene the middle east quartet , the body which drew up the stalled roadmap for peace .
however , faced with the bloodiest internal clashes in lebanon for decades and the firing of palestinian rockets into israel and israeli airstrikes in gaza , expectations for the meeting were low .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive security at the g8 heiligendamm location in potsdam , the minister said they were troubled by the situation in the region and called on the palestinian government to put an end to internal strife and missile attacks against israel , a german delegation source said .
" the spiral of violence must be stopped , " steinmeier told his fellow ministers , the source said .
there was broad agreement that the international community needed to encourage talks between israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmoud abbas .
they urged the palestinian authority to fulfill the demands of the middle east quartet including renouncing violence , recognizing israel and respecting previous agreements with the jewish state .
and they called on israel to unfreeze palestinian tax revenue and customs duties .
kosovo on the agenda the future status of kosovo , an issue that bitterly divides russia and the west , was also on the table in potsdam .
russia rejects proposals by chief un negotiator martti ahtisaari to grant kosovo internationally supervised independence from serbia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some criticize the world 's poorest get lost in the g8 shuffle steinmeier said he expected a clash over the province at the meeting .
" we are going to have a discussion on kosovo that will not be easy , " he said .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner , the un representative for kosovo from 1999-2001 , said the issue was " very difficult . "
russian foreign foreign minister sergei lavrov told reporters he wanted " justice " for kosovo .
the ministers also addressed the situation in strife-torn afghanistan .
afghan foreign minister rangeen dadfar spanta and his pakistani counterpart khurshid kasuri were attending the potsdam talks as part of a german-brokered initiative to resolve a dispute about their joint border .
afghanistan and pakistan have been trading recriminations about growing violence linked to taliban extremists on either side of the border .

it 's just one of a series of tight , yet controversial security measures . german television pictures showed shots of the 2.5-meter -lrb- 2.7 yard -rrb- metal fence , topped with barbed wire , that runs 11.6 kilometers -lrb- 7.2 miles -rrb- around the town .

pricey security about 16,000 members of the security forces , more than five percent of germany 's total , will be on duty in the town to deal with what could be as many as 100,000 protestors .
the security operation has been the focus of heated debate , not least because of its 12.5 million-euro -lrb- $ 16.8 million -rrb- price tag .
most normal traffic will be banned from the zone until june 9 , a day after the summit 's end .
only local residents , delivery vehicles and the hotel staff looking after the high-powered delegations will be allowed through the two checkpoints in the 2.5 meter -lrb- 8 foot -rrb- -tall metal and concrete fence that creates the the security zone .

iran expert alex bigham spoke with dw-world.de about thursday 's meeting between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iranian nuclear negotiator ali larijani .
iran wants proliferation and recognition , he said . dw-world.de : mr. bigham , what is your assessment of monday 's meeting in baghdad between the us and iranian ambassadors to iraq ?
alex bigham : i certainly think the talks are a positive sign , and this may be a tentative start of a period of cooling off in relations .
there has been an indication from the iranians of a willingness to meet in a month 's time , which is a welcome sign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana -lrb- left -rrb- and larijani at a meeting in berlin last september the talks are limited of course , really to one issue : iraq .
there are obvious reasons why america would want to seek iranian help in iraq - in order to improve stability in the country and to reduce the flow of funds and arms to insurgents who are attacking coalition forces .
the difficult question is why iran would want to assist coalition forces .
there will no doubt be elements in iran who want the americans to remain bogged down in iraq because they see that as a buffer to a possible attack on iran .
but it seems that those advocating dialogue both in washington and tehran are winning the argument for the moment .
they want to see stability on iran 's border with iraq , an area which has suffered from terrorist acts against the iranian government .
it 's certainly in iran 's long term self-interest to improve security and stability in iraq . iran 's nuclear program had not been on the agenda .
are you nevertheless surprised that the issue did not arise ? i am not surprised it was n't discussed .
neither side wants to be seen to be compromising on the nuclear issue at this stage , given domestic pressures in both iran and america .
the us does n't want to replicate or divert attention from the iaea , un and eu structures .
they deliberately want this to be seen as a disagreement between iran and the international community , not between iran and america . will monday 's talks have an impact on javier solana 's meeting with the iranian nuclear negotiator ali larijani on thursday ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intransigency on both sides blocks europe 's negotiations , said bigham the baghdad talks may offer some kind of reassurance to the iranian government in terms of the likelihood of military action , but there will need to be concrete results in order for the americans to be convinced of progress .
although the baghdad talks may help as a confidence-building measure , which is welcome , necessary , and frankly overdue , both the eu and iran are seeing the discussions on iran 's nuclear program as a separate issue from the future of iraq . what approach do you expect solana to take ? solana 's approach is not to engage in a negotiation directly about the nuclear issue , but to try to get an agreement to have a negotiation which would involve the p5 + 1 -lrb- editor 's note : the five per manent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the us - plus germany -rrb- .
however , the sticking point is the precondition the us has set that iran suspends uranium enrichment before negotiations .
the iranians have repeatedly ruled out the possibility of talks with any preconditions . what do you expect to come out of the talks ? there does n't seem to have been a fundamental shift in either side 's position , so the possibility of an agreement is small .
the difficulty in separating the issues of iraq and the nuclear program is that iran seems to want two things in return for reducing its support for insurgents in iraq : proliferation and recognition of its regional role .
these are effectively red lines for the americans , which make overcoming the stalemate a difficult , long term process . do you agree with the eu 's policy towards iran ?
what should the eu be doing differently ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayatollah khamenei is the main decision-maker on iran 's foreign and security policies the eu has made a great deal of effort to negotiate to iran .
the main barriers to progress are the relative intransigency of both the iranian and the american position on the nuclear issue .
another problem is the internal divisions within iran .
larijani is clearly a growing political player in tehran for the moment , but it is the supreme leader , khamenei who will make the final decision on iran 's security and foreign policy .
ayatollah khamenei is reluctant to make a final decision on the nuclear issues for fear of alienating one of the factions in iranian politics and undermining his own position .
one option that needs renewed consideration is el baradei 's proposal of a mutual " time-out " - iran suspending enrichment while the un suspends sanctions .
that is one option that should at least be put on the table .

iran expert alex bigham spoke with dw-world.de about thursday 's meeting between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iranian nuclear negotiator ali larijani .
iran wants proliferation and recognition , he said . dw-world.de : mr. bigham , what is your assessment of monday 's meeting in baghdad between the us and iranian ambassadors to iraq ?
alex bigham : i certainly think the talks are a positive sign , and this may be a tentative start of a period of cooling off in relations .
there has been an indication from the iranians of a willingness to meet in a month 's time , which is a welcome sign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana -lrb- left -rrb- and larijani at a meeting in berlin last september the talks are limited of course , really to one issue : iraq .
there are obvious reasons why america would want to seek iranian help in iraq - in order to improve stability in the country and to reduce the flow of funds and arms to insurgents who are attacking coalition forces .
the difficult question is why iran would want to assist coalition forces .
there will no doubt be elements in iran who want the americans to remain bogged down in iraq because they see that as a buffer to a possible attack on iran .
but it seems that those advocating dialogue both in washington and tehran are winning the argument for the moment .
they want to see stability on iran 's border with iraq , an area which has suffered from terrorist acts against the iranian government .
it 's certainly in iran 's long term self-interest to improve security and stability in iraq . iran 's nuclear program had not been on the agenda .
are you nevertheless surprised that the issue did not arise ? i am not surprised it was n't discussed .
neither side wants to be seen to be compromising on the nuclear issue at this stage , given domestic pressures in both iran and america .

forgeard , former joint chief executive at eads which owns airbus , told the magazine le point : " airbus did not report any unrecoverable delay before the middle of april 2006 , and at that time the financial consequences were very limited . "
he repeated that he had " respected all of the rules -lrb- at eads -rrb- which are among the most restrictive among companies quoted on the cac 40 index . "
the controversy and criticism of a big severance payment to forgeard are hot issues in france particularly , where the new government under president nicolas sarkozy has signaled it will act to curb so-called " golden handshakes . "
insider trading ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's forgeard was co-chair of eads from june 2005 - june 2006 forgeard and many other senior managers sold stock options in march last year , three months before the european aeronautics defence and space company and airbus announced serious delays in production of the a380 superjumbo airliner .
two big shareholders in eads , daimlerchrysler in germany and lagardere group in france each decided on march 20 to sell stakes of 7.5 percent .
the group had said in 2005 that there were some problems with production and that it was investigating the extent of these .
but the announcement in june 2006 of deep problems came as a shock to the stock market and the price of shares in eads fell heavily .
the problems rapidly developed into a long crisis with changes in top management and a rescue plan involving the loss of 10,000 jobs , although this remains clouded in some uncertainty .
there is also a prospect that eads will have to raise new capital .
forgeard is the target of suspicions , renewed in allegations in a press report on tuesday , that he was aware of the impact of production problems on the group when he decided to exercise stock options .
blames german managers the use of such privileged information , which has not been communicated publicly to market authorities , is known as insider trading and is illegal because it privileges one investor over another , distorts the equitable availability of information and therefore undermines confidence in a stock market .
stock market rules require managers to inform the market quickly if they become aware of a sudden and significant change in their company 's prospects .
forgeard also argued that during his period in various top positions at airbus , the company had become " a world leader , " and that despite the planned loss of 10,000 jobs , " the balance over eight years is positive to the extent of tens of thousands of jobs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delays have plagued the a380 superjumbo he also blamed a large part of the production problems on the attitude of top managers in germany where much of the work on airbus airliners is carried out , saying they wanted to continue doing things their way while he wanted to a single , overall method of working .
this was a reference to revelations that software used for installing cabling systems in hamburg , germany , was not compatible with design software at airbus headquarters in toulouse , france .
problems in adapting complex cabling to the requirements of individual airlines were at the center of the delays to production .
forgeard also launched a personal attack on his co-chair at the time , germany 's thomas enders .
" i ask myself whether he had n't been commissioned by daimler boss jürgen schrempp to neutralize or even get rid of me , " the former manager said .

forgeard , former joint chief executive at eads which owns airbus , told the magazine le point : " airbus did not report any unrecoverable delay before the middle of april 2006 , and at that time the financial consequences were very limited . "
he repeated that he had " respected all of the rules -lrb- at eads -rrb- which are among the most restrictive among companies quoted on the cac 40 index . "
the controversy and criticism of a big severance payment to forgeard are hot issues in france particularly , where the new government under president nicolas sarkozy has signaled it will act to curb so-called " golden handshakes . "

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's forgeard was co-chair of eads from june 2005 - june 2006 forgeard and many other senior managers sold stock options in march last year , three months before the european aeronautics defence and space company and airbus announced serious delays in production of the a380 superjumbo airliner .
two big shareholders in eads , daimlerchrysler in germany and lagardere group in france each decided on march 20 to sell stakes of 7.5 percent .
the group had said in 2005 that there were some problems with production and that it was investigating the extent of these .
but the announcement in june 2006 of deep problems came as a shock to the stock market and the price of shares in eads fell heavily .
the problems rapidly developed into a long crisis with changes in top management and a rescue plan involving the loss of 10,000 jobs , although this remains clouded in some uncertainty .
there is also a prospect that eads will have to raise new capital .
forgeard is the target of suspicions , renewed in allegations in a press report on tuesday , that he was aware of the impact of production problems on the group when he decided to exercise stock options .
blames german managers the use of such privileged information , which has not been communicated publicly to market authorities , is known as insider trading and is illegal because it privileges one investor over another , distorts the equitable availability of information and therefore undermines confidence in a stock market .
stock market rules require managers to inform the market quickly if they become aware of a sudden and significant change in their company 's prospects .
forgeard also argued that during his period in various top positions at airbus , the company had become " a world leader , " and that despite the planned loss of 10,000 jobs , " the balance over eight years is positive to the extent of tens of thousands of jobs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delays have plagued the a380 superjumbo he also blamed a large part of the production problems on the attitude of top managers in germany where much of the work on airbus airliners is carried out , saying they wanted to continue doing things their way while he wanted to a single , overall method of working .
this was a reference to revelations that software used for installing cabling systems in hamburg , germany , was not compatible with design software at airbus headquarters in toulouse , france .
problems in adapting complex cabling to the requirements of individual airlines were at the center of the delays to production .
forgeard also launched a personal attack on his co-chair at the time , germany 's thomas enders .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble wants to see a new anti-doping law passed in the bundestag " doping destroys the value of sport , " schäuble said .
" its credibility , its function as a provider of role models and its approval by the public are being put on the test . "
schäuble is meanwhile pressing for a rapid passage through parliament of a new anti-doping law , which among other things would permit lenient treatment for people who come forward to testify .
the government is also examining proposals to ban imports of medicines intended for doping offences .
german chancellor angela merkel has urged cyclists who used performance-enhancing drugs to come clean and break a " cartel of silence . "
" there has evidently been systematic and continued manipulation of unimaginable proportions in professional cycling , " the chancellor said in a statement .
" the confessions and investigations undertaken so far are n't sufficient to clean the sport up . "
new confessions the government 's moves follow doping confessions from riders from the telekom team , now known as t-mobile .
on friday , retired danish cyclist bjarne riis admitted using doping during his 1996 tour de france victory while riding for telekom .
the admission came a day after former teammates erik zabel and rolf aldag confessed they used performance-enhancing drugs while riding for telekom in the 1990s .
four other riders from the team have also admitted doping , but germany 's 1997 tour winner jan ullrich has remained silent .
no comment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich ended his career amidst speculations that he , too , used illegal substances ullrich 's manager wolfgang strohband has said his client would not speak about a claim made by former telekom team masseur jef d 'hont , who told the newspaper bild this week he had injected the cyclist with the erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- blood booster on one occasion .
freiburg university on thursday dismissed its doctors andreas schmid and lothar heinrich after they admitted giving athletes doping substances .
the university promised a full investigation into the past 20 years of its sports medicine .
nationwide scope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the image of cycling has been tarnished public prosecutors in freiburg meanwhile said they had handed an investigation into schmid and heinrich over to the federal criminal police department -lrb- bka -rrb- in view of the nationwide scope of the probe .
heinrich and schmid admitted that as team doctors they were involved in epo blood doping in the mid-1990s at the telekom team .
the german cycling federation bdr on saturday also suspended olympics doctor georg huber after former cyclists jörg müller and christian henn claimed they were given doping substances in the 1980s .
however huber will not face a criminal investigation because any alleged offences were now lapsed under german law , prosecutors said .
it 's all history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik zabel has been allowed to keep competing zabel , a six-time tour de france sprint champion , on wednesday started the bavarian tour race for the milram team .
milram said they were retaining the 36-year-old rider despite his admission he took epo - a synthetic hormone that stimulates the production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells - in the 1990s .
zabel was applauded by hundreds of spectators at the start of the first stage of the race in garmisch-partenkirchen .
zabel , who has a three-year contract with milram until the end of 2008 , will be allowed to continue his contract for the rest of this year at least , the german-italian team said on tuesday .
zabel has admitted using epo before the tour de france in 1996 , saying he stopped after a week because of side-effects .
in another development , germany 's public broadcasters ard and zdf said they would not initially renew options to cover the tour de france after next year .
zdf chief editor nikolaus brender said the contract would not be renewed " until we can be sure that doping has no more chance at the tour de france .

new confessions the government 's moves follow doping confessions from riders from the telekom team , now known as t-mobile .
on friday , retired danish cyclist bjarne riis admitted using doping during his 1996 tour de france victory while riding for telekom .
the admission came a day after former teammates erik zabel and rolf aldag confessed they used performance-enhancing drugs while riding for telekom in the 1990s .
four other riders from the team have also admitted doping , but germany 's 1997 tour winner jan ullrich has remained silent .

the german cycling federation bdr on saturday also suspended olympics doctor georg huber after former cyclists jörg müller and christian henn claimed they were given doping substances in the 1980s .
however huber will not face a criminal investigation because any alleged offences were now lapsed under german law , prosecutors said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 30.05.2007 german government probes doping scandal großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a flurry of doping confessions has rocked the world of professional cycling the german government is to examine whether taxpayers ' money was misused in a cycling doping scandal involving riders and doctors from the country 's leading cycling team . interior minister wolfgang schäuble told the cabinet on wednesday he was launching a " task force " to investigate the possible misuse of taxpayers ' money in doping .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble wants to see a new anti-doping law passed in the bundestag " doping destroys the value of sport , " schäuble said .
" its credibility , its function as a provider of role models and its approval by the public are being put on the test . "
schäuble is meanwhile pressing for a rapid passage through parliament of a new anti-doping law , which among other things would permit lenient treatment for people who come forward to testify .
the government is also examining proposals to ban imports of medicines intended for doping offences .
german chancellor angela merkel has urged cyclists who used performance-enhancing drugs to come clean and break a " cartel of silence . "
" there has evidently been systematic and continued manipulation of unimaginable proportions in professional cycling , " the chancellor said in a statement .
" the confessions and investigations undertaken so far are n't sufficient to clean the sport up . "
new confessions the government 's moves follow doping confessions from riders from the telekom team , now known as t-mobile .
on friday , retired danish cyclist bjarne riis admitted using doping during his 1996 tour de france victory while riding for telekom .
the admission came a day after former teammates erik zabel and rolf aldag confessed they used performance-enhancing drugs while riding for telekom in the 1990s .
four other riders from the team have also admitted doping , but germany 's 1997 tour winner jan ullrich has remained silent .
no comment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jan ullrich ended his career amidst speculations that he , too , used illegal substances ullrich 's manager wolfgang strohband has said his client would not speak about a claim made by former telekom team masseur jef d 'hont , who told the newspaper bild this week he had injected the cyclist with the erythropoietin -lrb- epo -rrb- blood booster on one occasion .
freiburg university on thursday dismissed its doctors andreas schmid and lothar heinrich after they admitted giving athletes doping substances .
the university promised a full investigation into the past 20 years of its sports medicine .
nationwide scope bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the image of cycling has been tarnished public prosecutors in freiburg meanwhile said they had handed an investigation into schmid and heinrich over to the federal criminal police department -lrb- bka -rrb- in view of the nationwide scope of the probe .
heinrich and schmid admitted that as team doctors they were involved in epo blood doping in the mid-1990s at the telekom team .
the german cycling federation bdr on saturday also suspended olympics doctor georg huber after former cyclists jörg müller and christian henn claimed they were given doping substances in the 1980s .
however huber will not face a criminal investigation because any alleged offences were now lapsed under german law , prosecutors said .
it 's all history bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : erik zabel has been allowed to keep competing zabel , a six-time tour de france sprint champion , on wednesday started the bavarian tour race for the milram team .
milram said they were retaining the 36-year-old rider despite his admission he took epo - a synthetic hormone that stimulates the production of oxygen-carrying red blood cells - in the 1990s .
zabel was applauded by hundreds of spectators at the start of the first stage of the race in garmisch-partenkirchen .

so it 's no coincidence dw-world.de 's top eleven has an average age of just under 25 .
we pay tribute to the players who came up big in the clutch . up front no one player was more important to his team than bochum 's theofanis gekas .
the greek forward went on a tear in the second half of the season , lifting his side from the relegation zone to eighth place in the standings and topping the league with 20 goals .
gekas is moving to leverkusen , where he 'll have to show that 2006-7 was no fluke .
until then , he can take pride in a breakthrough season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gekas provided a lot of greek tragedy for defenses mario gomez had 14 goals and eight assists , fewer than bremen 's miroslav klose , but that was due to injury .
and unlike klose , gomez finished the season strongly , scoring a crucial equalizer in the second-to-last game to keep stuttgart 's title drive on track .
at the tender age of 21 , he 's poised to become a regular in the german national squad . on the bench : klose -lrb- bremen -rrb- , kuranyi -lrb- schalke -rrb- , zidan -lrb- mainz -rrb- , frei -lrb- dortmund -rrb- the midfield the players themselves voted bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego the season 's mvp , and they get no argument here .

thomas hitzls per ger , nicknamed the " hammer , " has the hardest shot in the german game , and he scored in each of stuttgart 's final two come-from-behind wins . like hitzlsperger , roberto hilbert finished the season with seven goals , four of which came during the streak of eight straight wins that sealed the title for stuttgart .

one of the league 's most consistent and technically proficient players , the 33-year-old veteran had six goals and 11 eleven assists .
more importantly , he held things together on a team that was n't clicking early , leading leverkusen to fifth place and a spot in the uefa cup . on the bench : frings -lrb- bremen -rrb- , pardo -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- , marcelinho -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- , misimovic -lrb- bochum -rrb- at the back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : led by bordon , schalke only conceded 32 goals nuremberg and schalke had the league 's stingiest defenses , so they 're the place we start building our back four .
at left back , the honors go to nuremberg 's javier pinola .
the spaniard with the league 's worst hairstyle really performed in nuremberg 's german cup triumph , scoring twice in penalty shoot-outs to keep his side alive in the tournament and adding a clutch assist in the final . in the middle , no defender was more intimidating than schalke 's marcelo bordon .
a devout catholic he may be , but his christian charity certainly does not extend to opposing strikers in the box .

the frenchman made very few mistakes this season despite playing in all but one of the team 's league and cup matches .
what 's more he was able to stay in front of his man without fouling , picking up only four yellow cards over that long stretch . schalke 's rafinha fills out the back line .
he ended the season with a respectable two goals and three assists , but what does n't show up in the statistics is the amount of pressure the speedy brazilian created on the right-hand flank .
at only 22 he played with a maturity and acumen way beyond his years . on the bench : naldo -lrb- bremen -rrb- , mertesecker -lrb- bremen -rrb- , wolf -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- , madlung -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- between the posts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuer 's colleagues in the bundesliga also voted him the season 's best keeper and what 's true of rafinha goes double for schalke keeper manuel neuer .
the 21-year-old deposed one of the league 's most seasoned number ones , frank rost , in the tenth week , and for the rest of the season he never conceded more than two goals in a match .
and he did that in the high-pressure atmosphere of schalke , which was gunning for its first german league title in 49 years .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 30.05.2007 young stars shone brightest in 2006-7 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league was dominated by players in their early twenties in an unusual season , stuttgart took the title with a team of youngsters .
so it 's no coincidence dw-world.de 's top eleven has an average age of just under 25 .
we pay tribute to the players who came up big in the clutch . up front no one player was more important to his team than bochum 's theofanis gekas .
the greek forward went on a tear in the second half of the season , lifting his side from the relegation zone to eighth place in the standings and topping the league with 20 goals .
gekas is moving to leverkusen , where he 'll have to show that 2006-7 was no fluke .
until then , he can take pride in a breakthrough season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gekas provided a lot of greek tragedy for defenses mario gomez had 14 goals and eight assists , fewer than bremen 's miroslav klose , but that was due to injury .
and unlike klose , gomez finished the season strongly , scoring a crucial equalizer in the second-to-last game to keep stuttgart 's title drive on track .
at the tender age of 21 , he 's poised to become a regular in the german national squad . on the bench : klose -lrb- bremen -rrb- , kuranyi -lrb- schalke -rrb- , zidan -lrb- mainz -rrb- , frei -lrb- dortmund -rrb- the midfield the players themselves voted bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego the season 's mvp , and they get no argument here .
thirteen goals and 14 assists in his first season in the bundesliga speak volumes , and the truly scary thing is : he 's only 22 ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's dribbling skills stymied opposing midfielders diego is joined by two rising young stars from stuttgart who had a huge impact this spring .
thomas hitzls per ger , nicknamed the " hammer , " has the hardest shot in the german game , and he scored in each of stuttgart 's final two come-from-behind wins . like hitzlsperger , roberto hilbert finished the season with seven goals , four of which came during the streak of eight straight wins that sealed the title for stuttgart .
he deservedly won his first cap for the german national side during that stretch , and it 's easy to picture him , at only 22 , getting better and better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzlsperger scored some of the season 's most spectacular goals completing our dream midfield is leverkusen 's bernd schneider .
one of the league 's most consistent and technically proficient players , the 33-year-old veteran had six goals and 11 eleven assists .
more importantly , he held things together on a team that was n't clicking early , leading leverkusen to fifth place and a spot in the uefa cup . on the bench : frings -lrb- bremen -rrb- , pardo -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- , marcelinho -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- , misimovic -lrb- bochum -rrb- at the back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : led by bordon , schalke only conceded 32 goals nuremberg and schalke had the league 's stingiest defenses , so they 're the place we start building our back four .
at left back , the honors go to nuremberg 's javier pinola .
the spaniard with the league 's worst hairstyle really performed in nuremberg 's german cup triumph , scoring twice in penalty shoot-outs to keep his side alive in the tournament and adding a clutch assist in the final . in the middle , no defender was more intimidating than schalke 's marcelo bordon .
a devout catholic he may be , but his christian charity certainly does not extend to opposing strikers in the box .
bordon also scored three goals as schalke , once again , came up tragically short . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delpierre completely shut down bayern in a key match in april he 's paired with stuttgart 's unsung hero , matthieu delpierre .

" that means not only informing the members of these organizations about one 's own plans but also entertaining a willingness to abandon them if necessary , " he wrote .
beck pointed out that the plans to station the defense system in poland and the czech republic had inflicted " great harm " on relations between russia and the united states and europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck he also called for a new round of global disarmament : " disarmament policy must ... be urgently re-established as a key regulatory principle in international relations , " he wrote .
" major international disarmament regimes are already in shreds or have been completely destroyed . "
money better spent elsewhere ?
beck stressed the importance of close ties between the us and germany , but also used the opportunity to point out that washington had already sunk more than $ 100 billion in developing the shield , which may not even work .
that money could have been spent differently and " achieved more for the security of the united states , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to install part of the defense system in bohemia as head of the spd , which is part of christian democrat angela merkel 's government coalition , beck is the party 's most likely candidate for chancellor in 2009 .
in the past , he has been openly critical of us plans for the defense system meant to block attacks from hostile countries , warning in march that it could spark a new arms race .
those comments led to tensions within germany 's governing coalition as his column on tuesday was also likely to do .
chancellor merkel has been muted about the defense shield plans , only saying there should be a debate on the missile shield within nato and that the eu should " present a common front " on it . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin lashes out at us , eu as russia tests missile russian president putin warned tuesday that a planned us missile defense shield would make europe a " powder keg " and lashed out at his eu critics .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 30.05.2007 ex-eads chief denies having insider info on airbus delays großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads stocks fell heavily after problems at the company became public a former top manager in the airbus aircraft group has rejected renewed suggestions that he made a fortune illegally by selling shares , knowing that the company was in deep trouble . on wednesday , noel forgeard said he had not been informed of the extent of production problems and their potential financial impact on the eads-airbus group when he exercised stock options worth 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.4 million -rrb- on march 7 , 2006 .
forgeard , former joint chief executive at eads which owns airbus , told the magazine le point : " airbus did not report any unrecoverable delay before the middle of april 2006 , and at that time the financial consequences were very limited . "
he repeated that he had " respected all of the rules -lrb- at eads -rrb- which are among the most restrictive among companies quoted on the cac 40 index . "
the controversy and criticism of a big severance payment to forgeard are hot issues in france particularly , where the new government under president nicolas sarkozy has signaled it will act to curb so-called " golden handshakes . "
insider trading ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's forgeard was co-chair of eads from june 2005 - june 2006 forgeard and many other senior managers sold stock options in march last year , three months before the european aeronautics defence and space company and airbus announced serious delays in production of the a380 superjumbo airliner .
two big shareholders in eads , daimlerchrysler in germany and lagardere group in france each decided on march 20 to sell stakes of 7.5 percent .
the group had said in 2005 that there were some problems with production and that it was investigating the extent of these .
but the announcement in june 2006 of deep problems came as a shock to the stock market and the price of shares in eads fell heavily .
the problems rapidly developed into a long crisis with changes in top management and a rescue plan involving the loss of 10,000 jobs , although this remains clouded in some uncertainty .
there is also a prospect that eads will have to raise new capital .
forgeard is the target of suspicions , renewed in allegations in a press report on tuesday , that he was aware of the impact of production problems on the group when he decided to exercise stock options .
blames german managers the use of such privileged information , which has not been communicated publicly to market authorities , is known as insider trading and is illegal because it privileges one investor over another , distorts the equitable availability of information and therefore undermines confidence in a stock market .
stock market rules require managers to inform the market quickly if they become aware of a sudden and significant change in their company 's prospects .
forgeard also argued that during his period in various top positions at airbus , the company had become " a world leader , " and that despite the planned loss of 10,000 jobs , " the balance over eight years is positive to the extent of tens of thousands of jobs . "

iran expert alex bigham spoke with dw-world.de about thursday 's meeting between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iranian nuclear negotiator ali larijani .
iran wants proliferation and recognition , he said . dw-world.de : mr. bigham , what is your assessment of monday 's meeting in baghdad between the us and iranian ambassadors to iraq ?
alex bigham : i certainly think the talks are a positive sign , and this may be a tentative start of a period of cooling off in relations .
there has been an indication from the iranians of a willingness to meet in a month 's time , which is a welcome sign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana -lrb- left -rrb- and larijani at a meeting in berlin last september the talks are limited of course , really to one issue : iraq .
there are obvious reasons why america would want to seek iranian help in iraq - in order to improve stability in the country and to reduce the flow of funds and arms to insurgents who are attacking coalition forces .
the difficult question is why iran would want to assist coalition forces .
there will no doubt be elements in iran who want the americans to remain bogged down in iraq because they see that as a buffer to a possible attack on iran .
but it seems that those advocating dialogue both in washington and tehran are winning the argument for the moment .
they want to see stability on iran 's border with iraq , an area which has suffered from terrorist acts against the iranian government .
it 's certainly in iran 's long term self-interest to improve security and stability in iraq . iran 's nuclear program had not been on the agenda .
are you nevertheless surprised that the issue did not arise ? i am not surprised it was n't discussed .
neither side wants to be seen to be compromising on the nuclear issue at this stage , given domestic pressures in both iran and america .
the us does n't want to replicate or divert attention from the iaea , un and eu structures .
they deliberately want this to be seen as a disagreement between iran and the international community , not between iran and america . will monday 's talks have an impact on javier solana 's meeting with the iranian nuclear negotiator ali larijani on thursday ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intransigency on both sides blocks europe 's negotiations , said bigham the baghdad talks may offer some kind of reassurance to the iranian government in terms of the likelihood of military action , but there will need to be concrete results in order for the americans to be convinced of progress .
although the baghdad talks may help as a confidence-building measure , which is welcome , necessary , and frankly overdue , both the eu and iran are seeing the discussions on iran 's nuclear program as a separate issue from the future of iraq . what approach do you expect solana to take ? solana 's approach is not to engage in a negotiation directly about the nuclear issue , but to try to get an agreement to have a negotiation which would involve the p5 + 1 -lrb- editor 's note : the five per manent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the us - plus germany -rrb- .
however , the sticking point is the precondition the us has set that iran suspends uranium enrichment before negotiations .
the iranians have repeatedly ruled out the possibility of talks with any preconditions . what do you expect to come out of the talks ? there does n't seem to have been a fundamental shift in either side 's position , so the possibility of an agreement is small .
the difficulty in separating the issues of iraq and the nuclear program is that iran seems to want two things in return for reducing its support for insurgents in iraq : proliferation and recognition of its regional role .
these are effectively red lines for the americans , which make overcoming the stalemate a difficult , long term process . do you agree with the eu 's policy towards iran ?
what should the eu be doing differently ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ayatollah khamenei is the main decision-maker on iran 's foreign and security policies the eu has made a great deal of effort to negotiate to iran .
the main barriers to progress are the relative intransigency of both the iranian and the american position on the nuclear issue .
another problem is the internal divisions within iran .
larijani is clearly a growing political player in tehran for the moment , but it is the supreme leader , khamenei who will make the final decision on iran 's security and foreign policy .
ayatollah khamenei is reluctant to make a final decision on the nuclear issues for fear of alienating one of the factions in iranian politics and undermining his own position .
one option that needs renewed consideration is el baradei 's proposal of a mutual " time-out " - iran suspending enrichment while the un suspends sanctions .
that is one option that should at least be put on the table .

although the baghdad talks may help as a confidence-building measure , which is welcome , necessary , and frankly overdue , both the eu and iran are seeing the discussions on iran 's nuclear program as a separate issue from the future of iraq . what approach do you expect solana to take ? solana 's approach is not to engage in a negotiation directly about the nuclear issue , but to try to get an agreement to have a negotiation which would involve the p5 + 1 -lrb- editor 's note : the five per manent members of the un security council - britain , china , france , russia and the us - plus germany -rrb- .
however , the sticking point is the precondition the us has set that iran suspends uranium enrichment before negotiations .

the difficulty in separating the issues of iraq and the nuclear program is that iran seems to want two things in return for reducing its support for insurgents in iraq : proliferation and recognition of its regional role .

the main barriers to progress are the relative intransigency of both the iranian and the american position on the nuclear issue .
another problem is the internal divisions within iran .
larijani is clearly a growing political player in tehran for the moment , but it is the supreme leader , khamenei who will make the final decision on iran 's security and foreign policy .
ayatollah khamenei is reluctant to make a final decision on the nuclear issues for fear of alienating one of the factions in iranian politics and undermining his own position .

iran expert alex bigham spoke with dw-world.de about thursday 's meeting between eu foreign policy chief javier solana and iranian nuclear negotiator ali larijani .
iran wants proliferation and recognition , he said . dw-world.de : mr. bigham , what is your assessment of monday 's meeting in baghdad between the us and iranian ambassadors to iraq ?
alex bigham : i certainly think the talks are a positive sign , and this may be a tentative start of a period of cooling off in relations .
there has been an indication from the iranians of a willingness to meet in a month 's time , which is a welcome sign . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : solana -lrb- left -rrb- and larijani at a meeting in berlin last september the talks are limited of course , really to one issue : iraq .
there are obvious reasons why america would want to seek iranian help in iraq - in order to improve stability in the country and to reduce the flow of funds and arms to insurgents who are attacking coalition forces .
the difficult question is why iran would want to assist coalition forces .
there will no doubt be elements in iran who want the americans to remain bogged down in iraq because they see that as a buffer to a possible attack on iran .
but it seems that those advocating dialogue both in washington and tehran are winning the argument for the moment .
they want to see stability on iran 's border with iraq , an area which has suffered from terrorist acts against the iranian government .
it 's certainly in iran 's long term self-interest to improve security and stability in iraq . iran 's nuclear program had not been on the agenda .
are you nevertheless surprised that the issue did not arise ? i am not surprised it was n't discussed .
neither side wants to be seen to be compromising on the nuclear issue at this stage , given domestic pressures in both iran and america .
the us does n't want to replicate or divert attention from the iaea , un and eu structures .
they deliberately want this to be seen as a disagreement between iran and the international community , not between iran and america . will monday 's talks have an impact on javier solana 's meeting with the iranian nuclear negotiator ali larijani on thursday ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : intransigency on both sides blocks europe 's negotiations , said bigham the baghdad talks may offer some kind of reassurance to the iranian government in terms of the likelihood of military action , but there will need to be concrete results in order for the americans to be convinced of progress .

us secretary of state condoleezza rice , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and russian foreign minister sergei lavrov will attend the meeting of the quartet , which comprises the united states , the un , the eu and russia .
the potsdam meeting was aimed at preparing the summit of leaders of the group of eight most industrialized nations in heiligendamm , northeast germany , june 6-8 .
the ministers were tackling a range of international crises including the iranian and north korean nuclear programs , afghanistan and kosovo .
but japan poured cold water on one of the issues germany had placed at the top of its priority list for the summit - a binding agreement on reducing greenhouse gases .

japan has been leading efforts among asian nations to limit global warming .
it said it believed major emitters of greenhouse gases such as the united states , china and india should agree to join the process before any timetable was put in place .
" until we know if they will join us , it is premature , " sakaba said .
germany took advantage of the presence of rice and lavrov to hastily convene the middle east quartet , the body which drew up the stalled roadmap for peace .
however , faced with the bloodiest internal clashes in lebanon for decades and the firing of palestinian rockets into israel and israeli airstrikes in gaza , expectations for the meeting were low .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive security at the g8 heiligendamm location in potsdam , the minister said they were troubled by the situation in the region and called on the palestinian government to put an end to internal strife and missile attacks against israel , a german delegation source said .
" the spiral of violence must be stopped , " steinmeier told his fellow ministers , the source said .
there was broad agreement that the international community needed to encourage talks between israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmoud abbas .
they urged the palestinian authority to fulfill the demands of the middle east quartet including renouncing violence , recognizing israel and respecting previous agreements with the jewish state .
and they called on israel to unfreeze palestinian tax revenue and customs duties .
kosovo on the agenda the future status of kosovo , an issue that bitterly divides russia and the west , was also on the table in potsdam .
russia rejects proposals by chief un negotiator martti ahtisaari to grant kosovo internationally supervised independence from serbia .

" we are going to have a discussion on kosovo that will not be easy , " he said .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner , the un representative for kosovo from 1999-2001 , said the issue was " very difficult . "
russian foreign foreign minister sergei lavrov told reporters he wanted " justice " for kosovo .
the ministers also addressed the situation in strife-torn afghanistan .
afghan foreign minister rangeen dadfar spanta and his pakistani counterpart khurshid kasuri were attending the potsdam talks as part of a german-brokered initiative to resolve a dispute about their joint border .
afghanistan and pakistan have been trading recriminations about growing violence linked to taliban extremists on either side of the border .

us secretary of state condoleezza rice , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and russian foreign minister sergei lavrov will attend the meeting of the quartet , which comprises the united states , the un , the eu and russia .
the potsdam meeting was aimed at preparing the summit of leaders of the group of eight most industrialized nations in heiligendamm , northeast germany , june 6-8 .
the ministers were tackling a range of international crises including the iranian and north korean nuclear programs , afghanistan and kosovo .
but japan poured cold water on one of the issues germany had placed at the top of its priority list for the summit - a binding agreement on reducing greenhouse gases .

japan has been leading efforts among asian nations to limit global warming .
it said it believed major emitters of greenhouse gases such as the united states , china and india should agree to join the process before any timetable was put in place .
" until we know if they will join us , it is premature , " sakaba said .
germany took advantage of the presence of rice and lavrov to hastily convene the middle east quartet , the body which drew up the stalled roadmap for peace .
however , faced with the bloodiest internal clashes in lebanon for decades and the firing of palestinian rockets into israel and israeli airstrikes in gaza , expectations for the meeting were low .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive security at the g8 heiligendamm location in potsdam , the minister said they were troubled by the situation in the region and called on the palestinian government to put an end to internal strife and missile attacks against israel , a german delegation source said .

laurens dillich , the head of public service broadcaster bnn , told public radio : " the chances of the candidates obtaining a kidney are 33 percent , far better than for those on organ waiting lists .
you would imagine that -lrb- waiting times -rrb- have improved , but they are getting longer . "
bnn , a channel aimed at young people , is screening the show on the fifth anniversary of the death of its founder , bart de graaff .
he died after waiting seven years for a kidney donation .
international criticism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bart de graaff , in 1999 the project has prompted condemnation across the netherlands and beyond .
in brussels , a spokesman for the european commission - which on wednesday presented an action plan to reduce organ donor waiting lists - said it was in " pretty bad taste . "
the dutch kidney foundation welcomed the attention bnn had brought on the subject , but noted that " their way of doing it is not ours , and it will bring no practical solution . "
" i 'm afraid it 's primarily about the shock effect which has characterized the channel bnn since … the mid-90s , " media analyst jo groebel told dw-radio .
" i 'm afraid that … the whole debate is just increasing the market value and the market success of such a program , and this is what makes it extremely cynical - that the discussion itself adds to the program .
this is not the first time bnn has courted controversy .
previous broadcasts include " sex , a user 's guide , " a series of no-holds-barred education programs , and " shoot up and swallow , " a series dedicated to sex and drugs .
" the big donorshow " was dreamt up by endemol , the dutch production company behind " big brother " and other reality television shows .
it focuses on lisa , a 37-year-old woman dying of a brain tumor .
she must decide which of three patients selected by the producers should receive her kidney .
viewers can offer their opinions by sms text message .
lawmakers want ban on tuesday , the show was brought up in dutch parliament , where lawmakers agreed on the need to highlight the shortage of organ donors but were divided on whether reality television was the best way to do it .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's organ donor card some lawmakers called on the ministers for health and media to take the program off air .
the two cabinet members had already made clear they did not have the authority to ban the program .
in the netherlands , organ transplants are subject to strict laws , which prohibit donors from choosing who will receive their organs after their death .
however , an exemption is made in the case of kidney transplants , which can be carried out while the donor is still alive , allowing the donor to choose the beneficiary if there is some link between the two people .
after an eu-wide survey showed that while 81 percent of european citizens support the use of organ donor cards , only 12 percent have one , the european commission proposed its action plan , which includes introducing an eu-wide donor card and creating organ transplant coordinators in hospitals .
the eu executive arm is hopeful that european legislation on common standards for the quality and safety of organ donation will be introduced next year when its proposals are developed . dw staff with wire reports -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " there is no cohesion of tv writing staff in germany " german tv networks are taking their cues state-side in a bid to create better drama series .

the well-preserved passport , issued in 1948 by an italian delegation of the international committee of the red cross , was presented on tuesday at the buenos aires holocaust museum .

the well-preserved passport , issued in 1948 by an italian delegation of the international committee of the red cross , was presented on tuesday at the buenos aires holocaust museum .
it also bears the stamp and the signature of the argentine vice-counsel in genova , italy at that time , pedro solari capurro .
a factory worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eichmann was sentenced to death by an israeli court federal judge maria servini de cubria recently opened the eichmann file and found the well-preserved passport , graciela jinich , the director of the buenos aires holocaust museum , told dpa news service .
eichmann 's wife had presented the passport to authorities in 1960 after he had been abducted by israeli secret service agents from the buenos aires suburb where he lived a normal life working at the mercedes benz factory .
he was taken to israel , tried for crimes against humanity and hanged in 1962 .
" this document leaves no room for doubts on how easy it was for not only eichmann , but also other war criminals , to attain fake identification documents , change their names and enter our country , " jinich said .
suppressed information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eichmann was one of the leaders of the mass deportation of jews to extermination camps the united states released documents last year which showed that the cia learned about eichmann 's location and alias two years before israel captured him but kept the information secret as part of its efforts to combat communism in post-war west germany .
they also showed that the united states used a large network of spies recruited among former nazis and that the cia had virtually no interest in arresting war criminals , focusing instead on cold war issues .
" the american policy of the time was not to pursue nazi war criminals , " said historian timothy naftali , who reviewed thousands of documents on cia ties to nazis from the us national archives .
" they thought that was the responsibility of the germans . "
according to the cia papers , west germany knew from 1952 that eichmann was hiding in argentina under an assumed identity , but kept quiet about it fearing the fugitive might talk about hans globke , a former nazi who was a top national security advisor to konrad adenauer , the chancellor at the time . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " this is a german story " in an interview with dw-world.de , us historian timothy naftali says germans should pressure their own government to receive more information on the role of nazis in german government after 1945 .

" that means not only informing the members of these organizations about one 's own plans but also entertaining a willingness to abandon them if necessary , " he wrote .
beck pointed out that the plans to station the defense system in poland and the czech republic had inflicted " great harm " on relations between russia and the united states and europe .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kurt beck he also called for a new round of global disarmament : " disarmament policy must ... be urgently re-established as a key regulatory principle in international relations , " he wrote .
" major international disarmament regimes are already in shreds or have been completely destroyed . "
money better spent elsewhere ?
beck stressed the importance of close ties between the us and germany , but also used the opportunity to point out that washington had already sunk more than $ 100 billion in developing the shield , which may not even work .
that money could have been spent differently and " achieved more for the security of the united states , " he added .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us wants to install part of the defense system in bohemia as head of the spd , which is part of christian democrat angela merkel 's government coalition , beck is the party 's most likely candidate for chancellor in 2009 .
in the past , he has been openly critical of us plans for the defense system meant to block attacks from hostile countries , warning in march that it could spark a new arms race .
those comments led to tensions within germany 's governing coalition as his column on tuesday was also likely to do .
chancellor merkel has been muted about the defense shield plans , only saying there should be a debate on the missile shield within nato and that the eu should " present a common front " on it . dw staff -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de putin lashes out at us , eu as russia tests missile russian president putin warned tuesday that a planned us missile defense shield would make europe a " powder keg " and lashed out at his eu critics .

german public libraries began issuing audio books and e-books for loan via the internet on wednesday in a pilot scheme which they described as a first for europe . initially , nearly 10,000 titles will be available for download from the public-library systems in the port city of hamburg and the southern city of würzburg to subscribers ' personal computers .
users can check them out online at any time of the day and night .
after five days , the items expire and become unusable .
the audio and video files employ microsoft 's wma encoding and can be played on computers and other devices using windows software .
" it 's the libraries ' answer to the digital revolution , " said holger behrens , chief executive of divibib , the company based in wiesbaden , germany which devised the system .
competing with amazon bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : online libraries will appeal to younger , internet-savvy readers hella schwemer-martienssen , director of the hamburg public library system , said that public libraries in germany lend out around 350 million items annually and that libraries needed to compete with online retailer amazon , offering loans to customers who did not want to buy .
borrowing materials online is expected to appeal in particular to a younger , internet-savvy audience .
in würzburg , one of the cities chosen for the pilot project , 70 percent of library patrons are younger than 40 years .
" young users use web 2.0 , " said hannelore vogt , manager of the würzburg city library , referring to the popular term which describes an ecosystem of user-centered online communities .
" and they rightly expect from us library 2.0 , " she said .
the pilot project will be extended to two more cities - cologne and munich - in mid-june . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de european data privacy officials worry about big brother google the world 's most popular internet search engine is also the most intrusive , according to privacy rights advocates .

" that means not only informing the members of these organizations about one 's own plans but also entertaining a willingness to abandon them if necessary , " he wrote .

" major international disarmament regimes are already in shreds or have been completely destroyed . "
money better spent elsewhere ?
beck stressed the importance of close ties between the us and germany , but also used the opportunity to point out that washington had already sunk more than $ 100 billion in developing the shield , which may not even work .
that money could have been spent differently and " achieved more for the security of the united states , " he added .

" that means not only informing the members of these organizations about one 's own plans but also entertaining a willingness to abandon them if necessary , " he wrote .
beck pointed out that the plans to station the defense system in poland and the czech republic had inflicted " great harm " on relations between russia and the united states and europe .

beck stressed the importance of close ties between the us and germany , but also used the opportunity to point out that washington had already sunk more than $ 100 billion in developing the shield , which may not even work .

the number of officers , which include the some 40 german representatives already there , is to be expanded to around 160 over the course of the mission .
a burgeoning drug trade , widespread corruption and insurgent violence are among the challenges the local police are preparing for .
mission includes southern regions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : currently over 40 german police officers are working with 3,500 afghan trainees the mission 's main objective is " to improve cohesion and coordination -lrb- of afghan police -rrb- through mentoring , monitoring , advising and training , " said brigadier general friedrich eichele , the german mission commander who will head the eu task force .
police trainers would be armed for purposes of self-defence , but would have to rely on the nato-led isaf peacekeeping force for protection , said eichele , who added that the running costs for the first year would amount to 43.6 million euros -lrb- $ 58.8 million -rrb- .
dubbed eupol , the german-run mission will be headquartered in the capital city of kabul but will encompass regions throughout afghanistan including southern provinces where insurgent fighting has been most intense , said eu special representative for afghanistan francesc vendrell tuesday from brussels .
recent civilian deaths in the region have sparked concerns that the local population has lost faith in the international peacekeeping force . a minimum contribution for vendrell , the project does n't go far enough .
" i think that the eu has decided to play as big a role as possible , unfortunately not as big as i would have liked , " added vendrell , who said he would have like to have seen it at the same size as the mission in kosovo .
the eu is planning to send 1,500 police trainers if the breakaway serb province wins independence .
drugs and corruption fuelling insurgency bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un estimated that poppy cultivation in 2006 increased by 59 percent over 2005 late last year , nato requested that the eu take charge of building up the police training project .
analysts have said that rampant drug trade and corruption are fuelling the insurgency .
according to un estimates , some 300 illegal armed groups exist in the country .
the us has also put pressure on the eu to speed up progress .
until now , germany has been the main european country involved in police training in afghanistan and has trained some 17,000 local law enforcement officers since 2002 .
an existing us police mission in afghanistan involves 500 trainers , including members of private security companies .
eupol is meant to complement the american force .
the war-torn country currently has a police force of 60,000 , which is ill-equipped and riddled by corruption .
according to international estimates , some 82,000 officers are needed .
the number of afghan officers trained by the european team would depend on the security situation , said officials . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germans divided on how to honor fallen soldiers less than a week after three german soldiers were killed in afghanistan , debate is heating up over a monument to honor the country 's post-world war ii armed forces members who died while on duty at home and abroad .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : wolfgang schäuble wants to see a new anti-doping law passed in the bundestag " doping destroys the value of sport , " schäuble said .
" its credibility , its function as a provider of role models and its approval by the public are being put on the test . "
schäuble is meanwhile pressing for a rapid passage through parliament of a new anti-doping law , which among other things would permit lenient treatment for people who come forward to testify .
the government is also examining proposals to ban imports of medicines intended for doping offences .
german chancellor angela merkel has urged cyclists who used performance-enhancing drugs to come clean and break a " cartel of silence . "
" there has evidently been systematic and continued manipulation of unimaginable proportions in professional cycling , " the chancellor said in a statement .

the group had said in 2005 that there were some problems with production and that it was investigating the extent of these .

stock market rules require managers to inform the market quickly if they become aware of a sudden and significant change in their company 's prospects .
forgeard also argued that during his period in various top positions at airbus , the company had become " a world leader , " and that despite the planned loss of 10,000 jobs , " the balance over eight years is positive to the extent of tens of thousands of jobs . "

forgeard , former joint chief executive at eads which owns airbus , told the magazine le point : " airbus did not report any unrecoverable delay before the middle of april 2006 , and at that time the financial consequences were very limited . "
he repeated that he had " respected all of the rules -lrb- at eads -rrb- which are among the most restrictive among companies quoted on the cac 40 index . "
the controversy and criticism of a big severance payment to forgeard are hot issues in france particularly , where the new government under president nicolas sarkozy has signaled it will act to curb so-called " golden handshakes . "
insider trading ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's forgeard was co-chair of eads from june 2005 - june 2006 forgeard and many other senior managers sold stock options in march last year , three months before the european aeronautics defence and space company and airbus announced serious delays in production of the a380 superjumbo airliner .
two big shareholders in eads , daimlerchrysler in germany and lagardere group in france each decided on march 20 to sell stakes of 7.5 percent .
the group had said in 2005 that there were some problems with production and that it was investigating the extent of these .
but the announcement in june 2006 of deep problems came as a shock to the stock market and the price of shares in eads fell heavily .
the problems rapidly developed into a long crisis with changes in top management and a rescue plan involving the loss of 10,000 jobs , although this remains clouded in some uncertainty .
there is also a prospect that eads will have to raise new capital .
forgeard is the target of suspicions , renewed in allegations in a press report on tuesday , that he was aware of the impact of production problems on the group when he decided to exercise stock options .
blames german managers the use of such privileged information , which has not been communicated publicly to market authorities , is known as insider trading and is illegal because it privileges one investor over another , distorts the equitable availability of information and therefore undermines confidence in a stock market .
stock market rules require managers to inform the market quickly if they become aware of a sudden and significant change in their company 's prospects .
forgeard also argued that during his period in various top positions at airbus , the company had become " a world leader , " and that despite the planned loss of 10,000 jobs , " the balance over eight years is positive to the extent of tens of thousands of jobs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delays have plagued the a380 superjumbo he also blamed a large part of the production problems on the attitude of top managers in germany where much of the work on airbus airliners is carried out , saying they wanted to continue doing things their way while he wanted to a single , overall method of working .
this was a reference to revelations that software used for installing cabling systems in hamburg , germany , was not compatible with design software at airbus headquarters in toulouse , france .
problems in adapting complex cabling to the requirements of individual airlines were at the center of the delays to production .
forgeard also launched a personal attack on his co-chair at the time , germany 's thomas enders .
" i ask myself whether he had n't been commissioned by daimler boss jürgen schrempp to neutralize or even get rid of me , " the former manager said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de bundesliga -pipe- 30.05.2007 young stars shone brightest in 2006-7 großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the league was dominated by players in their early twenties in an unusual season , stuttgart took the title with a team of youngsters .
so it 's no coincidence dw-world.de 's top eleven has an average age of just under 25 .
we pay tribute to the players who came up big in the clutch . up front no one player was more important to his team than bochum 's theofanis gekas .
the greek forward went on a tear in the second half of the season , lifting his side from the relegation zone to eighth place in the standings and topping the league with 20 goals .
gekas is moving to leverkusen , where he 'll have to show that 2006-7 was no fluke .
until then , he can take pride in a breakthrough season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gekas provided a lot of greek tragedy for defenses mario gomez had 14 goals and eight assists , fewer than bremen 's miroslav klose , but that was due to injury .
and unlike klose , gomez finished the season strongly , scoring a crucial equalizer in the second-to-last game to keep stuttgart 's title drive on track .
at the tender age of 21 , he 's poised to become a regular in the german national squad . on the bench : klose -lrb- bremen -rrb- , kuranyi -lrb- schalke -rrb- , zidan -lrb- mainz -rrb- , frei -lrb- dortmund -rrb- the midfield the players themselves voted bremen 's brazilian playmaker diego the season 's mvp , and they get no argument here .
thirteen goals and 14 assists in his first season in the bundesliga speak volumes , and the truly scary thing is : he 's only 22 ! bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : diego 's dribbling skills stymied opposing midfielders diego is joined by two rising young stars from stuttgart who had a huge impact this spring .
thomas hitzls per ger , nicknamed the " hammer , " has the hardest shot in the german game , and he scored in each of stuttgart 's final two come-from-behind wins . like hitzlsperger , roberto hilbert finished the season with seven goals , four of which came during the streak of eight straight wins that sealed the title for stuttgart .
he deservedly won his first cap for the german national side during that stretch , and it 's easy to picture him , at only 22 , getting better and better . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzlsperger scored some of the season 's most spectacular goals completing our dream midfield is leverkusen 's bernd schneider .
one of the league 's most consistent and technically proficient players , the 33-year-old veteran had six goals and 11 eleven assists .
more importantly , he held things together on a team that was n't clicking early , leading leverkusen to fifth place and a spot in the uefa cup . on the bench : frings -lrb- bremen -rrb- , pardo -lrb- stuttgart -rrb- , marcelinho -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- , misimovic -lrb- bochum -rrb- at the back bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : led by bordon , schalke only conceded 32 goals nuremberg and schalke had the league 's stingiest defenses , so they 're the place we start building our back four .
at left back , the honors go to nuremberg 's javier pinola .
the spaniard with the league 's worst hairstyle really performed in nuremberg 's german cup triumph , scoring twice in penalty shoot-outs to keep his side alive in the tournament and adding a clutch assist in the final . in the middle , no defender was more intimidating than schalke 's marcelo bordon .
a devout catholic he may be , but his christian charity certainly does not extend to opposing strikers in the box .
bordon also scored three goals as schalke , once again , came up tragically short . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delpierre completely shut down bayern in a key match in april he 's paired with stuttgart 's unsung hero , matthieu delpierre .
the frenchman made very few mistakes this season despite playing in all but one of the team 's league and cup matches .
what 's more he was able to stay in front of his man without fouling , picking up only four yellow cards over that long stretch . schalke 's rafinha fills out the back line .
he ended the season with a respectable two goals and three assists , but what does n't show up in the statistics is the amount of pressure the speedy brazilian created on the right-hand flank .
at only 22 he played with a maturity and acumen way beyond his years . on the bench : naldo -lrb- bremen -rrb- , mertesecker -lrb- bremen -rrb- , wolf -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- , madlung -lrb- wolfsburg -rrb- between the posts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : neuer 's colleagues in the bundesliga also voted him the season 's best keeper and what 's true of rafinha goes double for schalke keeper manuel neuer .
the 21-year-old deposed one of the league 's most seasoned number ones , frank rost , in the tenth week , and for the rest of the season he never conceded more than two goals in a match .
and he did that in the high-pressure atmosphere of schalke , which was gunning for its first german league title in 49 years .
if his teammates up front had n't frozen up against dortmund , neuer could have capped off a remarkable rookie season with the bundesliga 's ultimate prize . on the bench : schäfer -lrb- nuremberg -rrb- jefferson chase send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nuremberg claim german cup with late scorcher danish midfielder jan kristiansen was the star on saturday night with a 30-meter blast in extra-time .
that goal gave nuremberg a 3-2 win over 10-man stuttgart and ended the bavarians ' 45-year wait for the german cup .
-lrb- 29.05.2007 -rrb- rough ride to the bundesliga title for champions stuttgart although vfb stuttgart were crowned bundesliga champions on saturday , it was not a smooth ride for armin veh 's men whose early-season form showed little title-winning potential .

it 's just one of a series of tight , yet controversial security measures . german television pictures showed shots of the 2.5-meter -lrb- 2.7 yard -rrb- metal fence , topped with barbed wire , that runs 11.6 kilometers -lrb- 7.2 miles -rrb- around the town .
early wednesday morning , authorities closed off the two access points leading to the resort in heiligendamm .
the closure also affects a railway line and a road through the resort ; boats are banned from the area near the shore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations have been going on for weeks across germany with the fence being a general security precaution , the controversial measures are also designed to keep anti-globalization demonstrators well away from the world leaders attending the summit .
protestors , however , have called the security steps excessive .
pricey security about 16,000 members of the security forces , more than five percent of germany 's total , will be on duty in the town to deal with what could be as many as 100,000 protestors .
the security operation has been the focus of heated debate , not least because of its 12.5 million-euro -lrb- $ 16.8 million -rrb- price tag .
most normal traffic will be banned from the zone until june 9 , a day after the summit 's end .
only local residents , delivery vehicles and the hotel staff looking after the high-powered delegations will be allowed through the two checkpoints in the 2.5 meter -lrb- 8 foot -rrb- -tall metal and concrete fence that creates the the security zone .
around 1,000 people will be issued with special badges .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators broke through a police line in gleneagles in 2005 on friday , a german court partially overruled a ban on demonstrations within a radius of five kilometres -lrb- three miles -rrb- of the baltic sea resort .
the court in schwerin in northeastern germany said protests should be allowed on the other side of a security fence encircling the hotel where leaders of the group of eight most-industrialized nations will gather .
the german government had wanted to keep protestors out of sight of the fence .

it 's just one of a series of tight , yet controversial security measures . german television pictures showed shots of the 2.5-meter -lrb- 2.7 yard -rrb- metal fence , topped with barbed wire , that runs 11.6 kilometers -lrb- 7.2 miles -rrb- around the town .
early wednesday morning , authorities closed off the two access points leading to the resort in heiligendamm .
the closure also affects a railway line and a road through the resort ; boats are banned from the area near the shore .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrations have been going on for weeks across germany with the fence being a general security precaution , the controversial measures are also designed to keep anti-globalization demonstrators well away from the world leaders attending the summit .
protestors , however , have called the security steps excessive .
pricey security about 16,000 members of the security forces , more than five percent of germany 's total , will be on duty in the town to deal with what could be as many as 100,000 protestors .
the security operation has been the focus of heated debate , not least because of its 12.5 million-euro -lrb- $ 16.8 million -rrb- price tag .
most normal traffic will be banned from the zone until june 9 , a day after the summit 's end .
only local residents , delivery vehicles and the hotel staff looking after the high-powered delegations will be allowed through the two checkpoints in the 2.5 meter -lrb- 8 foot -rrb- -tall metal and concrete fence that creates the the security zone .
around 1,000 people will be issued with special badges .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstrators broke through a police line in gleneagles in 2005 on friday , a german court partially overruled a ban on demonstrations within a radius of five kilometres -lrb- three miles -rrb- of the baltic sea resort .
the court in schwerin in northeastern germany said protests should be allowed on the other side of a security fence encircling the hotel where leaders of the group of eight most-industrialized nations will gather .
the german government had wanted to keep protestors out of sight of the fence .

we pay tribute to the players who came up big in the clutch . up front no one player was more important to his team than bochum 's theofanis gekas .
the greek forward went on a tear in the second half of the season , lifting his side from the relegation zone to eighth place in the standings and topping the league with 20 goals .
gekas is moving to leverkusen , where he 'll have to show that 2006-7 was no fluke .
until then , he can take pride in a breakthrough season . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gekas provided a lot of greek tragedy for defenses mario gomez had 14 goals and eight assists , fewer than bremen 's miroslav klose , but that was due to injury .

us secretary of state condoleezza rice , german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier and russian foreign minister sergei lavrov will attend the meeting of the quartet , which comprises the united states , the un , the eu and russia .
the potsdam meeting was aimed at preparing the summit of leaders of the group of eight most industrialized nations in heiligendamm , northeast germany , june 6-8 .
the ministers were tackling a range of international crises including the iranian and north korean nuclear programs , afghanistan and kosovo .
but japan poured cold water on one of the issues germany had placed at the top of its priority list for the summit - a binding agreement on reducing greenhouse gases .
divisions over climate bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us secretary of state rice -lrb- l -rrb- was also in potsdam foreign ministry spokesman mitsuo sakaba said german proposals to complete negotiations on a successor to the kyoto protocol on greenhouse gases by 2009 were " premature . "
japan has been leading efforts among asian nations to limit global warming .
it said it believed major emitters of greenhouse gases such as the united states , china and india should agree to join the process before any timetable was put in place .
" until we know if they will join us , it is premature , " sakaba said .
germany took advantage of the presence of rice and lavrov to hastily convene the middle east quartet , the body which drew up the stalled roadmap for peace .
however , faced with the bloodiest internal clashes in lebanon for decades and the firing of palestinian rockets into israel and israeli airstrikes in gaza , expectations for the meeting were low .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : massive security at the g8 heiligendamm location in potsdam , the minister said they were troubled by the situation in the region and called on the palestinian government to put an end to internal strife and missile attacks against israel , a german delegation source said .
" the spiral of violence must be stopped , " steinmeier told his fellow ministers , the source said .
there was broad agreement that the international community needed to encourage talks between israeli prime minister ehud olmert and palestinian president mahmoud abbas .
they urged the palestinian authority to fulfill the demands of the middle east quartet including renouncing violence , recognizing israel and respecting previous agreements with the jewish state .
and they called on israel to unfreeze palestinian tax revenue and customs duties .
kosovo on the agenda the future status of kosovo , an issue that bitterly divides russia and the west , was also on the table in potsdam .
russia rejects proposals by chief un negotiator martti ahtisaari to grant kosovo internationally supervised independence from serbia .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some criticize the world 's poorest get lost in the g8 shuffle steinmeier said he expected a clash over the province at the meeting .
" we are going to have a discussion on kosovo that will not be easy , " he said .
french foreign minister bernard kouchner , the un representative for kosovo from 1999-2001 , said the issue was " very difficult . "
russian foreign foreign minister sergei lavrov told reporters he wanted " justice " for kosovo .
the ministers also addressed the situation in strife-torn afghanistan .
afghan foreign minister rangeen dadfar spanta and his pakistani counterpart khurshid kasuri were attending the potsdam talks as part of a german-brokered initiative to resolve a dispute about their joint border .
afghanistan and pakistan have been trading recriminations about growing violence linked to taliban extremists on either side of the border .
steinmeier said cooperation between the neighbors was crucial to regional stability .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 30.05.2007 ex-eads chief denies having insider info on airbus delays großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads stocks fell heavily after problems at the company became public a former top manager in the airbus aircraft group has rejected renewed suggestions that he made a fortune illegally by selling shares , knowing that the company was in deep trouble . on wednesday , noel forgeard said he had not been informed of the extent of production problems and their potential financial impact on the eads-airbus group when he exercised stock options worth 2.5 million euros -lrb- $ 3.4 million -rrb- on march 7 , 2006 .
forgeard , former joint chief executive at eads which owns airbus , told the magazine le point : " airbus did not report any unrecoverable delay before the middle of april 2006 , and at that time the financial consequences were very limited . "
he repeated that he had " respected all of the rules -lrb- at eads -rrb- which are among the most restrictive among companies quoted on the cac 40 index . "
the controversy and criticism of a big severance payment to forgeard are hot issues in france particularly , where the new government under president nicolas sarkozy has signaled it will act to curb so-called " golden handshakes . "
insider trading ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's forgeard was co-chair of eads from june 2005 - june 2006 forgeard and many other senior managers sold stock options in march last year , three months before the european aeronautics defence and space company and airbus announced serious delays in production of the a380 superjumbo airliner .
two big shareholders in eads , daimlerchrysler in germany and lagardere group in france each decided on march 20 to sell stakes of 7.5 percent .
the group had said in 2005 that there were some problems with production and that it was investigating the extent of these .
but the announcement in june 2006 of deep problems came as a shock to the stock market and the price of shares in eads fell heavily .
the problems rapidly developed into a long crisis with changes in top management and a rescue plan involving the loss of 10,000 jobs , although this remains clouded in some uncertainty .
there is also a prospect that eads will have to raise new capital .
forgeard is the target of suspicions , renewed in allegations in a press report on tuesday , that he was aware of the impact of production problems on the group when he decided to exercise stock options .
blames german managers the use of such privileged information , which has not been communicated publicly to market authorities , is known as insider trading and is illegal because it privileges one investor over another , distorts the equitable availability of information and therefore undermines confidence in a stock market .
stock market rules require managers to inform the market quickly if they become aware of a sudden and significant change in their company 's prospects .
forgeard also argued that during his period in various top positions at airbus , the company had become " a world leader , " and that despite the planned loss of 10,000 jobs , " the balance over eight years is positive to the extent of tens of thousands of jobs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delays have plagued the a380 superjumbo he also blamed a large part of the production problems on the attitude of top managers in germany where much of the work on airbus airliners is carried out , saying they wanted to continue doing things their way while he wanted to a single , overall method of working .
this was a reference to revelations that software used for installing cabling systems in hamburg , germany , was not compatible with design software at airbus headquarters in toulouse , france .
problems in adapting complex cabling to the requirements of individual airlines were at the center of the delays to production .
forgeard also launched a personal attack on his co-chair at the time , germany 's thomas enders .
" i ask myself whether he had n't been commissioned by daimler boss jürgen schrempp to neutralize or even get rid of me , " the former manager said .
qatar stays loyal the head of lagardere group , and joint co-chairman of eads , arnaud lagardere was questioned at length on tuesday by stock market regulators probing suspicions that there had been insider trading in eads stock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus planes are european co-productions both forgeard and lagardere have insisted that they did nothing wrong .
on wednesday , the persian gulf state of qatar signed an order for 80 airbus a350 aircraft worth $ 16 billion , the largest contract to date for the model .

forgeard , former joint chief executive at eads which owns airbus , told the magazine le point : " airbus did not report any unrecoverable delay before the middle of april 2006 , and at that time the financial consequences were very limited . "
he repeated that he had " respected all of the rules -lrb- at eads -rrb- which are among the most restrictive among companies quoted on the cac 40 index . "
the controversy and criticism of a big severance payment to forgeard are hot issues in france particularly , where the new government under president nicolas sarkozy has signaled it will act to curb so-called " golden handshakes . "
insider trading ?
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : france 's forgeard was co-chair of eads from june 2005 - june 2006 forgeard and many other senior managers sold stock options in march last year , three months before the european aeronautics defence and space company and airbus announced serious delays in production of the a380 superjumbo airliner .
two big shareholders in eads , daimlerchrysler in germany and lagardere group in france each decided on march 20 to sell stakes of 7.5 percent .
the group had said in 2005 that there were some problems with production and that it was investigating the extent of these .
but the announcement in june 2006 of deep problems came as a shock to the stock market and the price of shares in eads fell heavily .
the problems rapidly developed into a long crisis with changes in top management and a rescue plan involving the loss of 10,000 jobs , although this remains clouded in some uncertainty .
there is also a prospect that eads will have to raise new capital .
forgeard is the target of suspicions , renewed in allegations in a press report on tuesday , that he was aware of the impact of production problems on the group when he decided to exercise stock options .
blames german managers the use of such privileged information , which has not been communicated publicly to market authorities , is known as insider trading and is illegal because it privileges one investor over another , distorts the equitable availability of information and therefore undermines confidence in a stock market .
stock market rules require managers to inform the market quickly if they become aware of a sudden and significant change in their company 's prospects .
forgeard also argued that during his period in various top positions at airbus , the company had become " a world leader , " and that despite the planned loss of 10,000 jobs , " the balance over eight years is positive to the extent of tens of thousands of jobs . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : delays have plagued the a380 superjumbo he also blamed a large part of the production problems on the attitude of top managers in germany where much of the work on airbus airliners is carried out , saying they wanted to continue doing things their way while he wanted to a single , overall method of working .
this was a reference to revelations that software used for installing cabling systems in hamburg , germany , was not compatible with design software at airbus headquarters in toulouse , france .
problems in adapting complex cabling to the requirements of individual airlines were at the center of the delays to production .
forgeard also launched a personal attack on his co-chair at the time , germany 's thomas enders .
" i ask myself whether he had n't been commissioned by daimler boss jürgen schrempp to neutralize or even get rid of me , " the former manager said .
qatar stays loyal the head of lagardere group , and joint co-chairman of eads , arnaud lagardere was questioned at length on tuesday by stock market regulators probing suspicions that there had been insider trading in eads stock .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : airbus planes are european co-productions both forgeard and lagardere have insisted that they did nothing wrong .
on wednesday , the persian gulf state of qatar signed an order for 80 airbus a350 aircraft worth $ 16 billion , the largest contract to date for the model .

the well-preserved passport , issued in 1948 by an italian delegation of the international committee of the red cross , was presented on tuesday at the buenos aires holocaust museum .
it also bears the stamp and the signature of the argentine vice-counsel in genova , italy at that time , pedro solari capurro .
a factory worker bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eichmann was sentenced to death by an israeli court federal judge maria servini de cubria recently opened the eichmann file and found the well-preserved passport , graciela jinich , the director of the buenos aires holocaust museum , told dpa news service .
eichmann 's wife had presented the passport to authorities in 1960 after he had been abducted by israeli secret service agents from the buenos aires suburb where he lived a normal life working at the mercedes benz factory .
he was taken to israel , tried for crimes against humanity and hanged in 1962 .
" this document leaves no room for doubts on how easy it was for not only eichmann , but also other war criminals , to attain fake identification documents , change their names and enter our country , " jinich said .
suppressed information bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eichmann was one of the leaders of the mass deportation of jews to extermination camps the united states released documents last year which showed that the cia learned about eichmann 's location and alias two years before israel captured him but kept the information secret as part of its efforts to combat communism in post-war west germany .
they also showed that the united states used a large network of spies recruited among former nazis and that the cia had virtually no interest in arresting war criminals , focusing instead on cold war issues .
" the american policy of the time was not to pursue nazi war criminals , " said historian timothy naftali , who reviewed thousands of documents on cia ties to nazis from the us national archives .
" they thought that was the responsibility of the germans . "
according to the cia papers , west germany knew from 1952 that eichmann was hiding in argentina under an assumed identity , but kept quiet about it fearing the fugitive might talk about hans globke , a former nazi who was a top national security advisor to konrad adenauer , the chancellor at the time . dw staff / dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : " this is a german story " in an interview with dw-world.de , us historian timothy naftali says germans should pressure their own government to receive more information on the role of nazis in german government after 1945 .

mind you , at the heart if it is a huge international fraud and you do n't crack that kind of crime overnight .
billions of pounds are being stolen by organised gangs who get access to our bank and credit card accounts .
we wanted to find out how they did it , test the security measures that are in place to stop them and , most difficult of all , track down the masterminds behind this lucrative crime .
we started by talking to victims , and there are plenty of them out there .
the programme at 1900 bst one man told us he was puzzled when his credit card account suddenly started having money paid into it .
at one point he was £ 3,600 in credit .
what he did n't know was that criminals had hacked into his account and were using it to launder stolen cash .
then all the money , including his , was cleared out .
he had been the victim of telephony fraud , and as the name suggests , the telephone is at the centre of this crime .
someone pretending to be from his bank had phoned and fooled him into giving out vital information .
then the false caller took on his identity , called his bank and got more personal details .
the criminals assembled a complete dossier of confidential financial information .
then bingo , they were into his account .
take this example , and multiply it by tens of thousands , and the rewards begin to add up .
fraud estimates fraud crime costs £ 14bn per year in the uk telephone fraud worth between £ 1bn - £ 3bn per year costs each person £ 300 per year in bank charges allegations defended working undercover but where did the criminals get the initial information that allowed them to start the whole process ?
well , we knew call centres - the type we all phone on a regular basis - had been targeted in the past .
rogue workers can steal confidential details and sell them on or in some cases the criminals themselves manage to get jobs .
to check this out we had an undercover journalist apply for a job at one of scotland 's biggest call centre operations - rhl , which is branded as response .
she was successful .
during her training the issue of security was hammered home loud and clear .
but once she started the job proper there were two troubling lapses .
she was able to write down customers ' account details on bits of paper , put them in her handbag and remove them from the building .
employee references priceless information in the hands of the wrong person .
employee vetting is also very important when confidential information is being handled on a daily basis .
but our investigator 's references were never checked out by the company .
we obviously wanted to get rhl 's reaction to all this .
but when we approached the company with our findings rhl 's response was to go to court in a bid to stop our programme being broadcast .
that failed and a judge ruled in favour of the bbc .
rhl then told us it took our findings very seriously and were always looking at ways of improving procedures .
convicted killer imran shahid runs the fraud gang we knew this type of crime was going on across the uk .
now we wanted to find out just who was making money out of it .
our sources led us to believe that one of the biggest criminal gangs involved - with operations that spanned the globe - was based right on our doorstep here in scotland , on glasgow 's south side .
and we had uncovered a remarkable link with that gang .
remember the fraud victim i told you about earlier ?
well , frontline came across his name and financial details - along with dozens of others -written in a ledger found in a flat in the pakistan city of lahore .
the flat was being used as a hideout by one of the men wanted for the murder of glasgow schoolboy kriss donald .
three men were later extradited back to scotland and are now serving life sentences .
we managed to track down a former gang member who confirmed the killers were the masterminds behind a criminal enterprise that was stealing financial details , accessing accounts and getting away with millions of pounds .

it is a joint venture by the university of wales , bangor and the theatre , and organisers say the " exciting " project will benefit the college and community .
theatre board chair janet roberts said the present building would close in 12-15 months , but the theatr gwynedd " brand " would continue .
" we will be homeless for around two to three years but we will be using different buildings in gwynedd and anglesey , " she said .
the present " fantastic auditorium " was the only performing space at the theatre , she added , and a desperate shortage of space made a new building essential .
" it will be a huge challenge but very exciting , " ms roberts added .
ms roberts said it would be more cost effective to build the news centre .
university deputy vice-chancellor meri huws said users were invited to comment on what they wanted .
it was too early in the project for there to be any details , ms huws added , but discussions had already taken place with the arts council for wales .

" we started this because our citizens are exposed to serious risks with mines , " explains professor nikola kezic , as honey bees buzz around his head .
" luckily we also have a long tradition of keeping bees and making honey .
our solution makes use of what we have . "
croatia , like bosnia-hercegovina and the other countries of the former yugoslavia , has a big landmine problem , inherited from the wars of the 1990s .
more than 1,000 sq km -lrb- 380 sq miles -rrb- of croatian countryside are thought to be contaminated by the mines .
about 250,000 mines are still buried , and more than 100 people have been killed by them in croatia since 1998 .
lure of food removing mines is slow and very expensive .
and even after the de-miners have done their work , some may remain in the soil .
prof kezic 's idea is to use honey bees to find any explosives that might have been missed by the de-mining teams .
training the bees to find mines takes place in a large net tent pitched on a lawn at the university 's faculty of agriculture .
a hive of bees sits at one end , with several feeding points for the bees set up around the tent .
but only a few of the feeding points contain food , and the soil immediately around them has been impregnated with explosive chemicals .
the idea is that the bees ' keen sense of smell soon associates the smell of explosives with food .
so far this has proved successful .
prof kezic says that training the bees takes only three or four days .
the first day or so is spent in the large net tent , getting the bees used to associating the smell of tnt with food .
after that several bees are taken out of the colony and tested to see if they react correctly when presented with extracts of explosives .
" this year our work is to increase the bees ' sensitivity to the smell of tnt , " says prof kezic .
he warns that it will take time before they are sure the system is reliable enough to use properly .
painstaking method once the technique has been shown to be reliable , the idea is to use the bees on areas that have already been de-mined .
the colony of specially trained bees will be released in the de-mined area , and followed with a special heat-sensitive camera .
the bees will be expected to settle on areas of ground that smell of explosives .
if they land on an area where no landmine was discovered earlier , the de-mining team will investigate to make sure they have not missed one .
if the technique proves a success it might provide a cheap and easily available resource for de-mining teams all over the balkans .
other animals have been used before to detect explosives .
gambian giant pouched rats are used in several african countries , including mozambique , to find mines .
like the bees in croatia , they are trained to associate the smell of tnt with food .
dogs are also used to find landmines and to sniff out hidden explosives , for instance in airports .
but unlike rats and bees , the weight of sniffer dogs means that they can be at risk of setting off the mines they are trying to detect .
dogs have also been used for offensive operations in wartime .
in world war ii the soviet red army trained dogs to run underneath enemy tanks .
the dogs had petrol bombs strapped to their backs which ignited when they knocked against the enemy vehicles .
in the croatian countryside bee-keeping has been popular for centuries .
delicious pots of honey and other produce can be bought directly from the bee-keepers at roadside stalls all over the region .
despite many years of working with bees , prof kezic has not lost his enthusiasm for them .
his office , full of charts , diagrams and models of bees , is testament to his interest in these social insects .
and in his fridge there is further evidence of what makes bees so special : pots of honey and some delicious honey-flavoured raki , the local strong alcohol .

about 250,000 mines are still buried , and more than 100 people have been killed by them in croatia since 1998 .
lure of food removing mines is slow and very expensive .
and even after the de-miners have done their work , some may remain in the soil .
field testing is the next step after trials in the tent prof kezic 's idea is to use honey bees to find any explosives that might have been missed by the de-mining teams .
training the bees to find mines takes place in a large net tent pitched on a lawn at the university 's faculty of agriculture .
a hive of bees sits at one end , with several feeding points for the bees set up around the tent .
but only a few of the feeding points contain food , and the soil immediately around them has been impregnated with explosive chemicals .
the idea is that the bees ' keen sense of smell soon associates the smell of explosives with food .
so far this has proved successful .
prof kezic says bees can quickly be trained to detect explosives prof kezic says that training the bees takes only three or four days .
the first day or so is spent in the large net tent , getting the bees used to associating the smell of tnt with food .
after that several bees are taken out of the colony and tested to see if they react correctly when presented with extracts of explosives .
" this year our work is to increase the bees ' sensitivity to the smell of tnt , " says prof kezic .
he warns that it will take time before they are sure the system is reliable enough to use properly .
painstaking method once the technique has been shown to be reliable , the idea is to use the bees on areas that have already been de-mined .
parts of croatia are still littered with mines laid in the 1990s the colony of specially trained bees will be released in the de-mined area , and followed with a special heat-sensitive camera .
the bees will be expected to settle on areas of ground that smell of explosives .
if they land on an area where no landmine was discovered earlier , the de-mining team will investigate to make sure they have not missed one .
if the technique proves a success it might provide a cheap and easily available resource for de-mining teams all over the balkans .
other animals have been used before to detect explosives .
gambian giant pouched rats are used in several african countries , including mozambique , to find mines .
like the bees in croatia , they are trained to associate the smell of tnt with food .
dogs are also used to find landmines and to sniff out hidden explosives , for instance in airports .
but unlike rats and bees , the weight of sniffer dogs means that they can be at risk of setting off the mines they are trying to detect .
dogs have also been used for offensive operations in wartime .
in world war ii the soviet red army trained dogs to run underneath enemy tanks .
the dogs had petrol bombs strapped to their backs which ignited when they knocked against the enemy vehicles .
in the croatian countryside bee-keeping has been popular for centuries .
delicious pots of honey and other produce can be bought directly from the bee-keepers at roadside stalls all over the region .
despite many years of working with bees , prof kezic has not lost his enthusiasm for them .
his office , full of charts , diagrams and models of bees , is testament to his interest in these social insects .
and in his fridge there is further evidence of what makes bees so special : pots of honey and some delicious honey-flavoured raki , the local strong alcohol .

the refugees are demanding india allow them to go back to bhutan via west bengal 's border with nepal .
one refugee was killed and more than 20 injured when indian police fired on them when they tried to enter india .
nepal is home to about 107,000 ethnic nepalese expelled from bhutan , which says they are illegal immigrants .
the un high commissioner for refugees antonio guterres recently urged the bhutanese government to repatriate them .
divided since tuesday , thousands of refugees have been trying to cross the mechi river that marks the border of west bengal state with nepal .
indian police say at least six of their men were injured when the refugees pelted them with stones on tuesday .
violence has also continued for a third day in some refugee camps in beldangi in eastern nepal , where large numbers of bhutanese refugees oppose un plans to settle them in western countries .
they beat up some of their own leaders who support third-country settlement in the us , leading to intervention by the nepal police .
two refugees were killed in beldangi when police fired shots over the weekend .
after nearly two decades in the camps of nepal , the bhutanese refugees are divided .
some accept a future in the west ; others are determined to go back and enrol as voters in bhutan ahead of next year 's parliamentary elections in the himalayan kingdom .
but india says it is determined to stop them in view of delhi 's cordial relations with bhutan .

last week , constable geraldine donnelly pleaded guilty to the offence .
she was fined £ 120 and banned for 12 months .
the 30-year-old psni officer 's role in the ad for the christmas season had to be cut out - at a cost of £ 9,000 .
the advertisement carried the tag line : " you 'll get smashed if you drive on drugs " .
it is part of a psni / doe road safety series .
the bbc news website obtained information about the cost of the re-edit from internal psni correspondence requested under the freedom of information act .
constable donnelly , who appeared at bangor magistrates court on wednesday 23 may , had 140mg of alcohol in 100ml of blood .
the legal limit is 80mg .
the court heard how she had been involved in a collision with another car on the county down town 's gransha road in january 2005 .
the advert in which she appeared , and for which she provided a voice-over , had to be reworked by advertising agency lyle bailie to be used in the run-up to christmas last year .
constable donnelly 's conviction comes just months after the psni recorded its worst ever year for drink-driving - 2006 saw 22 officers charged and convicted of the offence .
previously 2002 had been the worst year for drink-driving among psni officers when 15 officers were found guilty of being over the limit behind the wheel .
constable donnelly will now be subject to internal psni disciplinary proceedings which can include dismissal .
a psni spokeswoman declined to comment .

figures for april reveal the service reached 66.3 % of life threatening emergencies inside eight minutes .
it is the second month running the service has beaten the 60 % target set by the welsh assembly government .
the service was branded " appalling " and " unacceptable " in a report by a committee of ams in march .
the improvements are down to modernisation and staff commitment , said chief executive alan murray .
mr murray , who became chief executive last august , said a modernisation plan entitled time to make a difference - drawn up in consultation with staff , unions and other healthcare providers - would further improve the service .
at the time of his appointment , the figure for calls reached in eight minutes was 55.4 % .
a series of measures , including using gps in control centres and more use of rapid response vehicles , have since been introduced .
mr murray said the improvements were aided by staff commitment mr murray said the welsh ambulance services trust was a very different organisation from the one heavily criticised in the reports of the auditor general , the healthcare inspectorate wales and the wales audit office .
" all those reports pointed out there was good reason to be optimistic about the future and their faith is being borne out by the improvement in our performance , " he said .
" our modernisation plan is a patient care-led strategy although there is obviously a correlation between the speed with which ambulances arrive and good patient outcomes . "
the service 's previous best performance record in its nine year history was set in march 2004 when the figure reached 63.03 % .
the service also said it was on track to beat its targets for may .
its response figure for february was as low 49.8 % but this improved to 60.8 % in march .
as a result of the improved performance , the service has claimed it reaches an extra 70 people suffering life-threatening emergencies within the target time every week .
generally morale has improved but it 's still a very stressful job paramedic supervisor nigel rees it follows a difficult period for the service , which had appealed to people living in cardiff and the vale of glamorgan to only dial 999 in a life-threatening emergency a few months ago because of the pressure it was under .
the welsh ambulance service was also rocked by changes in management and a public inquiry ordered by assembly members into its poor performance .
but even the traditionally poorest performing region - the south east - posted good response times over the months of march and april , said the service .
in april , their time topped the league reaching 68.1 % .
nigel rees , a paramedic supervisor in swansea , said the number of rapid response vehicles had doubled in the last six months which had made a difference .
" the cars get to the 999 call roughly three to four minutes before the ambulance , or it 's supposed to anyway , and that means that treatment can start that much sooner so the patient will benefit .
paramedic supervisor nigel rees said morale has improved " we had a problem with our meal break situation before whereas now they have improved .
so generally morale has improved but it 's still a very stressful job . "
trust chairman stuart fletcher said the board was " delighted " with the changes and pointed out that the record figures came despite the service dealing with more cases than ever .
the drive for improved performance had been spearheaded by director of ambulance services mike cassidy who also took personal control of south east region .
he praised staff for responding to calls more quickly .
" we are not pursuing these response times for their own sake but because it leads to a better chance of survival for patients , " he said .

figures for april reveal the service reached 66.3 % of life threatening emergencies inside eight minutes .
it is the second month running the service has beaten the 60 % target set by the welsh assembly government .
the service was branded " appalling " and " unacceptable " in a report by a committee of ams in march .
the improvements are down to modernisation and staff commitment , said chief executive alan murray .
mr murray , who became chief executive last august , said a modernisation plan entitled time to make a difference - drawn up in consultation with staff , unions and other healthcare providers - would further improve the service .
at the time of his appointment , the figure for calls reached in eight minutes was 55.4 % .
a series of measures , including using gps in control centres and more use of rapid response vehicles , have since been introduced .
mr murray said the improvements were aided by staff commitment mr murray said the welsh ambulance services trust was a very different organisation from the one heavily criticised in the reports of the auditor general , the healthcare inspectorate wales and the wales audit office .
" all those reports pointed out there was good reason to be optimistic about the future and their faith is being borne out by the improvement in our performance , " he said .
" our modernisation plan is a patient care-led strategy although there is obviously a correlation between the speed with which ambulances arrive and good patient outcomes . "
the service 's previous best performance record in its nine year history was set in march 2004 when the figure reached 63.03 % .
the service also said it was on track to beat its targets for may .
its response figure for february was as low 49.8 % but this improved to 60.8 % in march .

pvrs let users create their own schedule at the touch of a button personal video recorders -lrb- pvrs -rrb- let audiences create their own schedules , tailored to their mood .
cynics might argue this is nothing new - after all , people have struggled to clear piles of videotapes lying around their living rooms for the past 25 years .
but there is something more ruthless about having a list of shows ready to go at a moment 's notice .
the concept , dubbed " timeshifting " , applies whether viewers record a show or if they see it on a separate " + 1 " service , where the entire output of a channel is shown again with a 60-minute delay , to maximise viewing opportunities .
" we believe timeshifting will become a more important part of the way people view television , " says bjarne thelin , chief executive of uk ratings measurement company barb .
" they can catalogue recordings to access the stuff they 've recorded more easily . "
and this counts for one of the selling points of pvrs , he says - the ability to pause a live programme if the telephone rings or to deal with another distraction .
" you might only be offsetting something by 30 seconds or a minute , but that effectively is timeshifting . "
non-live viewing research also suggests that people who have access to pvrs watch more tv .
barb says that fewer than 2 % of all tv programmes in the uk are timeshifted - but bskyb suggests this rises to 12 % in homes with sky + boxes .
drama is by far the most commonly recorded genre in sky + homes internal research by e4 found one episode of its teenage drama skins was seen by 900,000 people when screened on a thursday evening in february .
but the figure grew by 305,000 , or 34 % , when viewing from recordings , repeats and the e4 + 1 service were added .
a spokesman said the show 's younger audience was likely to be comfortable with the idea of finding skins in the schedule at a time convenient for them , or recording it .
and broadcasters are keen to ensure they do not " lose " figures for non-live viewing .
true figures from thursday , nielsen - the us equivalent of barb - will begin releasing viewing figures for the 24 , 48 and 72 hours following transmission , taking recordings into account .
the third of these measures - dubbed " live plus three " - has gained particular attention among networks such as abc and cbs , with executives indicating recently that they believed this would become more of a standard assessment of true viewing figures .
tv viewing habits are changing - now shows can be seen on phones nielsen is also to start measuring ratings for commercials , something which has been done in the uk since 1981 .
" up until the advent of the pvr , the programme rating was a pretty good surrogate for how many people were watching your advertisement , " says company spokesman gary holmes .
" now there 's the prospect of people fast-forwarding through the commercials . "
he says that networks are " very interested in making sure that they get credit for the extra viewing that takes place on pvrs " , while advertisers are " not interested in paying for adverts that were fast-forwarded through " .
differences in the way uk ratings are gathered are also likely in future , according to chris mundy , the bbc 's head of audiences .
" what we have n't spent huge amounts of time doing is analysing how many people watch programmes one day , two days , three days after transmission .
" this is going to change massively when on-demand really comes on stream , and the iplayer launches in a couple of months ' time , " he says , referring to the online catch-up service which will " store " seven days of bbc output .
favourite genres bskyb describes its sky + box - now in a quarter of its 8.5m households - as " the ipod of tv " and has decided to drop the service 's £ 10 monthly subscription to broaden its appeal .
other pvr boxes are available which do not require a regular fee , such as those which work on the freeview digital terrestrial platform .
internal bskyb research , from a viewing panel of 33,000 customers , suggests that drama is by far the most timeshifted genre , accounting for 40 % of recordings .
ratings for e4 's skins benefited hugely from timeshifted viewing news and sport , dominated by live events , sit at the bottom of the list .
but while timeshifting is becoming more common , some within the industry caution that the overwhelming majority of viewing still involves live broadcasts .
there may be a hard core of timeshifting fanatics , but barb 's figures mean 98 % of viewing is still " live " .
broadcaster itv said that in terms of setting advertising rates , the " currency " of the uk market had been based on consolidated seven-day viewing figures compiled by barb " for as long as we can remember " and was unlikely to change .
and perhaps advertisers can be reassured by bskyb data suggesting that 40 % of people with sky + boxes still sit through commercial breaks .
this suggests that even with the option to fast-forward , millions of viewers like watching tv just the way it always has been .

pvrs let users create their own schedule at the touch of a button personal video recorders -lrb- pvrs -rrb- let audiences create their own schedules , tailored to their mood .
cynics might argue this is nothing new - after all , people have struggled to clear piles of videotapes lying around their living rooms for the past 25 years .
but there is something more ruthless about having a list of shows ready to go at a moment 's notice .
the concept , dubbed " timeshifting " , applies whether viewers record a show or if they see it on a separate " + 1 " service , where the entire output of a channel is shown again with a 60-minute delay , to maximise viewing opportunities .
" we believe timeshifting will become a more important part of the way people view television , " says bjarne thelin , chief executive of uk ratings measurement company barb .
" they can catalogue recordings to access the stuff they 've recorded more easily . "
and this counts for one of the selling points of pvrs , he says - the ability to pause a live programme if the telephone rings or to deal with another distraction .
" you might only be offsetting something by 30 seconds or a minute , but that effectively is timeshifting . "
non-live viewing research also suggests that people who have access to pvrs watch more tv .
barb says that fewer than 2 % of all tv programmes in the uk are timeshifted - but bskyb suggests this rises to 12 % in homes with sky + boxes .
drama is by far the most commonly recorded genre in sky + homes internal research by e4 found one episode of its teenage drama skins was seen by 900,000 people when screened on a thursday evening in february .
but the figure grew by 305,000 , or 34 % , when viewing from recordings , repeats and the e4 + 1 service were added .
a spokesman said the show 's younger audience was likely to be comfortable with the idea of finding skins in the schedule at a time convenient for them , or recording it .
and broadcasters are keen to ensure they do not " lose " figures for non-live viewing .
true figures from thursday , nielsen - the us equivalent of barb - will begin releasing viewing figures for the 24 , 48 and 72 hours following transmission , taking recordings into account .
the third of these measures - dubbed " live plus three " - has gained particular attention among networks such as abc and cbs , with executives indicating recently that they believed this would become more of a standard assessment of true viewing figures .
tv viewing habits are changing - now shows can be seen on phones nielsen is also to start measuring ratings for commercials , something which has been done in the uk since 1981 .
" up until the advent of the pvr , the programme rating was a pretty good surrogate for how many people were watching your advertisement , " says company spokesman gary holmes .
" now there 's the prospect of people fast-forwarding through the commercials . "
he says that networks are " very interested in making sure that they get credit for the extra viewing that takes place on pvrs " , while advertisers are " not interested in paying for adverts that were fast-forwarded through " .
differences in the way uk ratings are gathered are also likely in future , according to chris mundy , the bbc 's head of audiences .
" what we have n't spent huge amounts of time doing is analysing how many people watch programmes one day , two days , three days after transmission .
" this is going to change massively when on-demand really comes on stream , and the iplayer launches in a couple of months ' time , " he says , referring to the online catch-up service which will " store " seven days of bbc output .
favourite genres bskyb describes its sky + box - now in a quarter of its 8.5m households - as " the ipod of tv " and has decided to drop the service 's £ 10 monthly subscription to broaden its appeal .
other pvr boxes are available which do not require a regular fee , such as those which work on the freeview digital terrestrial platform .
internal bskyb research , from a viewing panel of 33,000 customers , suggests that drama is by far the most timeshifted genre , accounting for 40 % of recordings .
ratings for e4 's skins benefited hugely from timeshifted viewing news and sport , dominated by live events , sit at the bottom of the list .
but while timeshifting is becoming more common , some within the industry caution that the overwhelming majority of viewing still involves live broadcasts .
there may be a hard core of timeshifting fanatics , but barb 's figures mean 98 % of viewing is still " live " .
broadcaster itv said that in terms of setting advertising rates , the " currency " of the uk market had been based on consolidated seven-day viewing figures compiled by barb " for as long as we can remember " and was unlikely to change .
and perhaps advertisers can be reassured by bskyb data suggesting that 40 % of people with sky + boxes still sit through commercial breaks .
this suggests that even with the option to fast-forward , millions of viewers like watching tv just the way it always has been .

personal video recorders -lrb- pvrs -rrb- let audiences create their own schedules , tailored to their mood .
cynics might argue this is nothing new - after all , people have struggled to clear piles of videotapes lying around their living rooms for the past 25 years .
but there is something more ruthless about having a list of shows ready to go at a moment 's notice .
the concept , dubbed " timeshifting " , applies whether viewers record a show or if they see it on a separate " + 1 " service , where the entire output of a channel is shown again with a 60-minute delay , to maximise viewing opportunities .
" we believe timeshifting will become a more important part of the way people view television , " says bjarne thelin , chief executive of uk ratings measurement company barb .
" they can catalogue recordings to access the stuff they 've recorded more easily . "
and this counts for one of the selling points of pvrs , he says - the ability to pause a live programme if the telephone rings or to deal with another distraction .
" you might only be offsetting something by 30 seconds or a minute , but that effectively is timeshifting . "
non-live viewing research also suggests that people who have access to pvrs watch more tv .
barb says that fewer than 2 % of all tv programmes in the uk are timeshifted - but bskyb suggests this rises to 12 % in homes with sky + boxes .
internal research by e4 found one episode of its teenage drama skins was seen by 900,000 people when screened on a thursday evening in february .
but the figure grew by 305,000 , or 34 % , when viewing from recordings , repeats and the e4 + 1 service were added .
a spokesman said the show 's younger audience was likely to be comfortable with the idea of finding skins in the schedule at a time convenient for them , or recording it .
and broadcasters are keen to ensure they do not " lose " figures for non-live viewing .
true figures from thursday , nielsen - the us equivalent of barb - will begin releasing viewing figures for the 24 , 48 and 72 hours following transmission , taking recordings into account .
the third of these measures - dubbed " live plus three " - has gained particular attention among networks such as abc and cbs , with executives indicating recently that they believed this would become more of a standard assessment of true viewing figures .
nielsen is also to start measuring ratings for commercials , something which has been done in the uk since 1981 .
" up until the advent of the pvr , the programme rating was a pretty good surrogate for how many people were watching your advertisement , " says company spokesman gary holmes .
" now there 's the prospect of people fast-forwarding through the commercials . "
he says that networks are " very interested in making sure that they get credit for the extra viewing that takes place on pvrs " , while advertisers are " not interested in paying for adverts that were fast-forwarded through " .
differences in the way uk ratings are gathered are also likely in future , according to chris mundy , the bbc 's head of audiences .
" what we have n't spent huge amounts of time doing is analysing how many people watch programmes one day , two days , three days after transmission .
