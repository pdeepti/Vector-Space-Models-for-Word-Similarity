five years later , there are fears in certain quarters that the national front candidate might pull off a similar feat and make it to the run-off for france 's highest office .
but there 's little chance of that happening , according to alain howiller , president of the institute of political studies in strasbourg .
" le pen wo n't make it to the second round this time , " he said .
frank baasner , director of the german-french institute echoed the view .
" experience shows these things do n't repeat themselves , " he said .
" national identity " as a vote-getter but campaign managers at former interior minister nicolas sarkozy 's conservative ump camp remain wary .
according to french satirical weekly canard enchaine , sarkozy 's aides reckon that le pen 's anti-immigrant national front could take as much as 20 percent of the vote .
daniela schwarzer , an expert on france at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin also said that le pen 's influence could not be written off .
" the national front 's voter potential is possibly higher than the surveys show it to be , " she told dw-world.de. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy sings the national anthem with kids at a party congress in paris sarkozy 's campaign managers seem convinced that the election will only be won on the right .
and as if to emphasize that point , their candidate has been focusing all his energies on the topic of national identity in the final days leading up to the first round of voting on sunday .
the conservative frontrunner has said that only those who speak french sufficiently well will be allowed to settle down permanently in france .
sarkozy has also backed quotas for immigrants and choosing them on the basis of professional qualifications .
he has said he would set up a " ministry for immigration and national identity " if he 's elected .
" france is embittered that its national identity is endangered by unlimited immigration , " sarokzy said recently .
that 's a classic ploy of the far right , according to alain howiller .
" those are ideas that le pen has been propagating for 25 years , " he said .
royal shows nationalist streak and it 's not just sarkozy angling for votes from the far right .
even sarkozy 's socialist challenger , segolene royal , has displayed a strong nationalist streak in recent weeks .
at a campaign rally two weeks ago , royal urged her supporters for the first time to sing the national anthem .
over the weekend , royal stepped up her new-found nationalist drive by urging all french to have a french flag at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal has shown a nationalist streak in recent weeks experts , such as daniela schwarzer , worry that the " irresponsible " way royal and sarkozy have been flirting with the topic of national identity could have serious long-terms political consequences .
" if the whole discussion in a left-wing party like the ps -lrb- the socialist party -rrb- and a moderate right-wing party such as the ump leans so strongly towards the far-right fringe then it changes the whole atmosphere in society , " schwarzer said .
" then even openly xenophobic slogans do n't horrify anymore . "
le pen in unfamiliar territory sarkozy and royal 's right-wing dabbling may end up benefiting le pen , not just in the long term , but also more immediately .
the veteran politician has said he 's " happy " about the right tilt the election campaign in france has taken so far .
" that 's because it shows all the french that i 'm right , " le pen said recently .
the front national candidate has been charting unfamiliar territory during his campaign this time .
in a bid to stay relevant in the fight for both frustrated voters on the far right as well as protest voters , the 78-year-old has a young women , apparently from north africa , advertise for him on posters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-marie le pen is fishing for votes in unfamiliar waters le pen has also been campaigning in the depressed suburbs with the slogan : " neither friend , nor black , white nor north african - french ! "
the strategy might just work .

" everything but sarkozy " the one campaign slogan residents of the suburbs seem to agree on is : " everything but sarkozy . "
it 's obvious that they have n't forgotten the conservative frontrunner who described violent youth there as " scum " during riots in late 2005 .
a long announced campaign visit by sarkozy to the lyon suburb of villeurbanne , where the ump candidate planned to talk to youth amid whirring television cameras in an obvious publicity gimmick , never took place .

but with state coffers increasingly empty and a continually tight job market , observers say unpaid work can have hidden benefits . in the us , volunteering is widespread - a credo promoted at home and in schools , and even as pseudo-governmental doctrine .
from tutoring in after school programs , to working as an aide in a hospital , to helping build houses for the poor - americans have long been schooled in the importance of " giving back to community . " but since its postwar economic boom , germany has used its tax base wealth to provide for the needy and offer its citizens singularly generous social benefits .
volunteer work was mainly done by charitable religious groups , or young men exempted from military service , fulfilling an obligatory year of civil service . increasingly , though , young people going onto the job market are discovering the side benefits that can be reaped from a volunteer stint .
such experience can help develop the highly touted " soft skills " that are increasingly in demand in the business world , observers say . after all , anyone can call themselves a " team player , " but a well-chosen , unpaid job may give them the chance to actually prove they are one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in german statistics , sports activities are often counted as " volunteer work " " for people looking for their first job , working as a volunteer is a great advantage , " said sascha theisen , the spokesman for stepstone.de , an employment-recruiting internet portal that advises people at all stages of their career .
" it gives them the chance to gain experience , for instance in leading a project , or solving problems or managing people . " it also means they could come to the job with a network already in place of people who would be good contacts later on down the road , " he added . too much of a good thing ? but theisen warned that people who are already in the middle of their careers should be careful not to overdo it .
german employers would only really smile upon someone involved in an activity that might be beneficial to business : taking an active role in a professional association , for instance . " if someone is busy leading several sports clubs and on top of that they sing in a choir , you have to ask yourself , are they going to have enough time for their job ? "
theisen asked . christoph lender saw the benefits of volunteering first hand .
by his own account , the half-dozen years he spent leading catholic youth groups helped give him just those skills required by his first employer , a bank .
at the job interview , they discussed the work he had done coordinating events , leading discussions and meetings , and being an authority figure for 10 to 15 kids every week . " it 's a signal for a company , that in addition to your studies and any internships you do , that you also took time for other things , and were socially engaged , " lender said .
" it speaks for how you choose to spend your time . " job boost a ' byproduct ' but lender stressed that his motivation for taking up volunteer work was not some calculated attempt to improve his chances on the job market . " i did it for my own personal development , " he said .
" the good experience with the job was just a byproduct of that . " german software giant sap 's hiring approach also supports lender 's experience . spokesperson alla ruggaber-mast said the company looks for people who are motivated and independent , with highly developed " soft skills " in communication , problem solving , and conflict resolution .
but while the firm " welcomes candidates who are socially engaged , that is not a decisive factor in hiring . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a voluntary civil service year , often in old age homes , means a military exemption according to the latest german government survey on volunteerism from 2004 , some 36 percent of germans claim volunteer responsibilities , up from 34 percent five years earlier . but that high number includes such volunteer jobs as taking an active role in a sports club or cultural institute .
the figure for " social " volunteerism - such as leading a youth group - was at 5.5 percent in 2004 , up from 4 percent in 1999 . there are historical reasons that relatively few germans take on social volunteer jobs , said werner lindwehr , a spokesman for the agency for self-help and volunteering in the city of osnabrück , in the state of lower saxony . " directly after the war , volunteerism was part of society , out of necessity , " lindwehr said .
" people helped one another . " later , the state took over many of those responsibilities . " and it may be that germans started just sitting back and saying , ' i 'll let the state take care of it , " ' he acknowledged . difference to usa today , however , he sees a movement toward citizens taking a more active role .
a " culture of volunteerism " is , indeed , developing in germany , he said . " people want to do more than just vote every four years , " lindwehr said .
" they want to do something on their own doorstep , and they see that they are taken seriously by the government . " but volunteerism in germany will never have the same status as in the us , where it fills a quasi-governmental function , he added . " you ca n't compare the volunteerism with usa and here , " he said .
" the us has a much worse social system .
in my opinion , they have more need , and thus more organization . " in germany , lindwehr argued , volunteerism will grow , but it will have a more " political " character , with volunteers and governments forming a sort of bridge to get things done .
for instance , he said , people are becoming increasingly active in local citizens ' initiatives . not everyone likes it an example is a group of people who decide their playground needs renovation , but the town says there is no funding for it .
so the local government will act as a go between , and find a carpenter who is willing to donate wood , or people to help manage the construction . despite these examples , volunteerism in germany is far from being accepted as purely beneficial .

they have to get their stadiums , transport systems and hotels up to scratch and overcome a legacy of hooliganism and corruption . a day after poland and ukraine scored a shock win over italy and fellow joint bidders hungary and croatia in the race to clinch the major soccer tournament - which takes place every four years - the enormity of the task facing the two host nations was beginning to sink in .
they will need nothing short of a herculean construction and investor drive to build stadium , hotels and other infrastructure .
in addition , security worries , hooliganism and corruption remain nagging problems .
organizers and politicians , however , insist they will roll up their sleeves in order to ensure the success of the soccer championships .
poland tries to calm jitters in the lead up to wednesday 's decision by european soccer 's governing body , uefa , at a meeting in cardiff , the polish-ukrainian bidders tried to calm jitters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president yushchenko -lrb- r . -rrb- and polish president kaczynski polish president lech kaczynski who traveled to the welsh capital with ukrainian president viktor yushchenko to make an 11th-hour pitch for their bid , said there was much work to be done .
" we must not forget the enormity of the task of organizing euro 2012 , but that is also excellent news for poland , " kaczynski said .

" five years is long enough and i am sure that with the mobilization and determination of the local authorities and the people , we will succeed . "
it will be the first time that either poland or ukraine will host a major soccer championship .
it 's the third major sporting event , following the beijing olympic games in 2008 and the soccer world cup in south africa in 2010 , to break away from the traditional grounds of western europe and the americas .
infrastructure in need of massive overhaul polish authorities said last week that around 26 billion euros -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- , including eu financing , have been earmarked to upgrade infrastructure .
fans will need every bit of it .
anyone wanting to travel by road from gdansk in northern poland to donetsk , a host city in eastern ukraine , has to traverse 2,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,240 miles -rrb- .
the 22-hour car or bus trip - not counting the lengthy wait at the polish-ukrainian border - is mostly on single lane roads .
only 23 kilometers -lrb- 14 miles -rrb- of the trip is on motorway .

the situation is worse in ukraine .
there , train travel is hardly better : it currently takes 43 hours , at best , to get from gdansk to donetsk .
lack of investment means it is too dangerous to use high speed trains on the aging tracks .
while booming low-cost airlines carry hundreds of thousands of poles between their homes and western europe each year , there are still no cheap links between ukraine and poland .
outside major cities , particularly in ukraine , good hotels are hard to come by - or at least in sufficient numbers to cater to tens of thousands of fans , journalists and soccer officials .
hooliganism , right wing crimes raise concerns polish soccer is also blighted by hooliganism .
fears that polish fans would cause trouble at last year 's world cup in neighboring germany led to a massive police operation in both countries , although in the end the hooligans stayed away .
in addition , polish soccer 's image has been dented by corruption .
a two-year-old match-fixing scandal has led to more than 60 arrests , including several referees , a member of the polish soccer association -lrb- pzpn -rrb- leadership and a string of club officials .

i 'm convinced that we will manage it even earlier , " lipiec said .
" the championships must take place in an atmosphere of fair play . "

poland , too , has a flourishing far-right scene .
" good news for ukrainians " despite the huge problems , kiev remains confident that it can manage to surmount most challenges .
indeed , there are signs that the country is already gearing up to tackle the gargantuan task .
although kiev is currently locked in political crisis pitting supporters of the president and prime minister against each other , the two sides are united about euro 2012 .
four ukrainian cities selected as venues have already started preparations including upgrading their existing soccer facilities .
and the kiev mayor 's office has said the capital would completely renovate its 86,000-seat olympic stadium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is confident that investors will step in to build much needed stadiums in the west of the country , lviv city authorities have said they will renovate the city 's 28,000-seat stadium and increase its capacity .
ukraine 's reigning champions , shakhtar donetsk , are currently building a new 50,000-seat ground , while dnepropetrovsk , who finished sixth last season , had also began the construction of a new arena in their town .
ukraine 's sports minister , viktor korzh , said major investors were ready to step in alongside the authorities .
" there are serious investors , who are ready to invest up to 37 billion hryvnias -lrb- about 5.7 billion euros , $ 7.7 billion -rrb- in the construction of airports , roads , hotels and improving sports infrastructure , " he said .

they have to get their stadiums , transport systems and hotels up to scratch and overcome a legacy of hooliganism and corruption . a day after poland and ukraine scored a shock win over italy and fellow joint bidders hungary and croatia in the race to clinch the major soccer tournament - which takes place every four years - the enormity of the task facing the two host nations was beginning to sink in .
they will need nothing short of a herculean construction and investor drive to build stadium , hotels and other infrastructure .
in addition , security worries , hooliganism and corruption remain nagging problems .
organizers and politicians , however , insist they will roll up their sleeves in order to ensure the success of the soccer championships .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.04.2007 german jobseekers plumb volunteerism 's possibilities großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : offering a helping hand to others may be helpful to one 's own career unlike the us , germany does not have a highly developed culture of volunteerism .
but with state coffers increasingly empty and a continually tight job market , observers say unpaid work can have hidden benefits . in the us , volunteering is widespread - a credo promoted at home and in schools , and even as pseudo-governmental doctrine .
from tutoring in after school programs , to working as an aide in a hospital , to helping build houses for the poor - americans have long been schooled in the importance of " giving back to community . " but since its postwar economic boom , germany has used its tax base wealth to provide for the needy and offer its citizens singularly generous social benefits .
volunteer work was mainly done by charitable religious groups , or young men exempted from military service , fulfilling an obligatory year of civil service . increasingly , though , young people going onto the job market are discovering the side benefits that can be reaped from a volunteer stint .
such experience can help develop the highly touted " soft skills " that are increasingly in demand in the business world , observers say . after all , anyone can call themselves a " team player , " but a well-chosen , unpaid job may give them the chance to actually prove they are one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in german statistics , sports activities are often counted as " volunteer work " " for people looking for their first job , working as a volunteer is a great advantage , " said sascha theisen , the spokesman for stepstone.de , an employment-recruiting internet portal that advises people at all stages of their career .
" it gives them the chance to gain experience , for instance in leading a project , or solving problems or managing people . " it also means they could come to the job with a network already in place of people who would be good contacts later on down the road , " he added . too much of a good thing ? but theisen warned that people who are already in the middle of their careers should be careful not to overdo it .
german employers would only really smile upon someone involved in an activity that might be beneficial to business : taking an active role in a professional association , for instance . " if someone is busy leading several sports clubs and on top of that they sing in a choir , you have to ask yourself , are they going to have enough time for their job ? "
theisen asked . christoph lender saw the benefits of volunteering first hand .
by his own account , the half-dozen years he spent leading catholic youth groups helped give him just those skills required by his first employer , a bank .
at the job interview , they discussed the work he had done coordinating events , leading discussions and meetings , and being an authority figure for 10 to 15 kids every week . " it 's a signal for a company , that in addition to your studies and any internships you do , that you also took time for other things , and were socially engaged , " lender said .
" it speaks for how you choose to spend your time . " job boost a ' byproduct ' but lender stressed that his motivation for taking up volunteer work was not some calculated attempt to improve his chances on the job market . " i did it for my own personal development , " he said .
" the good experience with the job was just a byproduct of that . " german software giant sap 's hiring approach also supports lender 's experience . spokesperson alla ruggaber-mast said the company looks for people who are motivated and independent , with highly developed " soft skills " in communication , problem solving , and conflict resolution .
but while the firm " welcomes candidates who are socially engaged , that is not a decisive factor in hiring . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a voluntary civil service year , often in old age homes , means a military exemption according to the latest german government survey on volunteerism from 2004 , some 36 percent of germans claim volunteer responsibilities , up from 34 percent five years earlier . but that high number includes such volunteer jobs as taking an active role in a sports club or cultural institute .
the figure for " social " volunteerism - such as leading a youth group - was at 5.5 percent in 2004 , up from 4 percent in 1999 . there are historical reasons that relatively few germans take on social volunteer jobs , said werner lindwehr , a spokesman for the agency for self-help and volunteering in the city of osnabrück , in the state of lower saxony . " directly after the war , volunteerism was part of society , out of necessity , " lindwehr said .
" people helped one another . " later , the state took over many of those responsibilities . " and it may be that germans started just sitting back and saying , ' i 'll let the state take care of it , " ' he acknowledged . difference to usa today , however , he sees a movement toward citizens taking a more active role .
a " culture of volunteerism " is , indeed , developing in germany , he said . " people want to do more than just vote every four years , " lindwehr said .
" they want to do something on their own doorstep , and they see that they are taken seriously by the government . " but volunteerism in germany will never have the same status as in the us , where it fills a quasi-governmental function , he added . " you ca n't compare the volunteerism with usa and here , " he said .
" the us has a much worse social system .
in my opinion , they have more need , and thus more organization . " in germany , lindwehr argued , volunteerism will grow , but it will have a more " political " character , with volunteers and governments forming a sort of bridge to get things done .
for instance , he said , people are becoming increasingly active in local citizens ' initiatives . not everyone likes it an example is a group of people who decide their playground needs renovation , but the town says there is no funding for it .
so the local government will act as a go between , and find a carpenter who is willing to donate wood , or people to help manage the construction . despite these examples , volunteerism in germany is far from being accepted as purely beneficial .
debates occasionally flare up over the usefulness of the civil-service year , and there are those who decry the notion of unpaid work at all , saying it steals jobs from people who need them . meanwhile , christoph lender said that from where he stands , he has seen little evidence that the country will be overrun by volunteers any time soon . " among my friends , i guess you would say i am one of the more socially engaged , " lender said .
" young people have a lot of other things to do - with sports , going out , the internet … everyone has to decide how they want to spend their time .

" it 's only the beginning of a first real exchange of views , " one diplomat told afp on condition of anonymity , adding that " it is too early to expect any decisions . " " thursday 's meetings could help restore confidence among us , particularly with russia , but also ease german concerns , " the diplomat said . but he warned : " if things have n't cooled down after these meetings , there could be a danger of more clearly marked divisions among the allies . " germany wants us to consult moscow the united states announced in january it had begun negotiations on installing a missile interceptor bank in poland , a radar system in the czech republic plus an early warning radar somewhere in the caucasus region . washington maintains that the system would not only protect the united states but also many of its european allies against " rogue threats " from countries like iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister jung wants the us to ease moscow 's concerns but russia is irked by the idea that its old cold war foe would set this up in its back yard and has accused washington of hiding its real intentions , trying to start another arms race , and threatened to retaliate . germany is demanding closer consultation with moscow but is also concerned that parts of southern europe - bulgaria , romania , greece and turkey - would be exposed outside the shield , expected to be fully operational in 2013 . " the germans do n't know clearly yet what they really want , but they are obviously convinced that nato should play a role in it all , " the nato diplomat said . in the latest sign of washington 's efforts to assuage those fears , us officials presented russia tuesday with " new ideas " for bilateral cooperation between them on missile defense in general . russia adopts wait and see attitude another nato diplomat noted that washington wants to move quickly to get the project off the ground before us president george w. bush steps down next year . " as for the americans , they want to go fast and get the ball rolling before bush 's mandate ends , " he said .
" so they are ready for concessions , as long as the main thrust of the plan is kept . " but despite the apparently conciliatory us moves , russia was pessimistic its concerns will be addressed . " we hope , although i will say sincerely that i am not optimistic , that washington will listen to our analyses and worries , " igor ivanov , head of the russian national security council , said tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian minister ivanov says he 's not optimistic that the us will listen to moscow 's concerns a senior russian diplomat , alexander grushko , said separately that russia intended to have serious talks with nato foreign ministers in norway next week on the missile scheme and the alliance 's expansion into eastern europe . " we are counting on a deep and serious discussion in oslo concerning all aspects of the relationship between russia and nato , " he told interfax news agency . the dispute has accelerated debate at nato about its own missile plans . a study for the nato has found that there is a possible missile threat to the allies and that they have the technical means to counter it .

" racism and xenophobia can only be combatted effectively inside society , " german justice minister brigitte zypries told reporters after a meeting with her counterparts in luxembourg .
" criminal measures can only be supplementary , they can never be sufficient in combatting racism and xenophobia in itself , " said zypries whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
zypries said that the agreed piece of eu legislation , which is not legally binding for the bloc 's members , was an " important political signal " for the 27-nation union .
under the new rules , eu countries would set jail terms of at least one to three years for " publicly inciting to violence or hatred ... directed against a group of persons or a member of such a group defined by reference to race , color , religion , descent or national or ethnic origin . "
no minimum fines however , the legislation does not set any minimum fines .

watered-down compromise the eu 's anti-racism rules - debated since 2001 - seemed at risk after latvia , lithuania and estonia had demanded making illegal the condoning , denial or trivialization of crimes against humanity committed under the soviet regime led by joseph stalin .
other eu states were opposed to the baltic demands , arguing that they did not legally recognize crimes committed under the stalinist regime or define major stalin atrocities as genocide .

they have to get their stadiums , transport systems and hotels up to scratch and overcome a legacy of hooliganism and corruption . a day after poland and ukraine scored a shock win over italy and fellow joint bidders hungary and croatia in the race to clinch the major soccer tournament - which takes place every four years - the enormity of the task facing the two host nations was beginning to sink in .
they will need nothing short of a herculean construction and investor drive to build stadium , hotels and other infrastructure .
in addition , security worries , hooliganism and corruption remain nagging problems .
organizers and politicians , however , insist they will roll up their sleeves in order to ensure the success of the soccer championships .
poland tries to calm jitters in the lead up to wednesday 's decision by european soccer 's governing body , uefa , at a meeting in cardiff , the polish-ukrainian bidders tried to calm jitters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president yushchenko -lrb- r . -rrb- and polish president kaczynski polish president lech kaczynski who traveled to the welsh capital with ukrainian president viktor yushchenko to make an 11th-hour pitch for their bid , said there was much work to be done .
" we must not forget the enormity of the task of organizing euro 2012 , but that is also excellent news for poland , " kaczynski said .
" there will be new stadiums built in warsaw , gdansk , wroclaw and poznan .
that can only be seen in a positive light , " he added .
" five years is long enough and i am sure that with the mobilization and determination of the local authorities and the people , we will succeed . "
it will be the first time that either poland or ukraine will host a major soccer championship .
it 's the third major sporting event , following the beijing olympic games in 2008 and the soccer world cup in south africa in 2010 , to break away from the traditional grounds of western europe and the americas .
infrastructure in need of massive overhaul polish authorities said last week that around 26 billion euros -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- , including eu financing , have been earmarked to upgrade infrastructure .
fans will need every bit of it .
anyone wanting to travel by road from gdansk in northern poland to donetsk , a host city in eastern ukraine , has to traverse 2,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,240 miles -rrb- .
the 22-hour car or bus trip - not counting the lengthy wait at the polish-ukrainian border - is mostly on single lane roads .
only 23 kilometers -lrb- 14 miles -rrb- of the trip is on motorway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the few four-lane motorways in poland , near the ukraine border despite receiving vast eu funding since the fall of communism in 1989 and becoming a member of the bloc in 2004 , poland still has n't built a basic motorway network connecting its major cities .
the situation is worse in ukraine .
there , train travel is hardly better : it currently takes 43 hours , at best , to get from gdansk to donetsk .
lack of investment means it is too dangerous to use high speed trains on the aging tracks .
while booming low-cost airlines carry hundreds of thousands of poles between their homes and western europe each year , there are still no cheap links between ukraine and poland .
outside major cities , particularly in ukraine , good hotels are hard to come by - or at least in sufficient numbers to cater to tens of thousands of fans , journalists and soccer officials .
hooliganism , right wing crimes raise concerns polish soccer is also blighted by hooliganism .
fears that polish fans would cause trouble at last year 's world cup in neighboring germany led to a massive police operation in both countries , although in the end the hooligans stayed away .
in addition , polish soccer 's image has been dented by corruption .
a two-year-old match-fixing scandal has led to more than 60 arrests , including several referees , a member of the polish soccer association -lrb- pzpn -rrb- leadership and a string of club officials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hooliganism continues to blight polish soccer on thursday , polish sports minister tomasz lipiec vowed to make polish soccer graft-free by the time of the euro 2012 .
" we want to sort this problem out completely by 2012 .
i 'm convinced that we will manage it even earlier , " lipiec said .
" the championships must take place in an atmosphere of fair play . "
ukraine will also have to do more to improve security for foreign fans .
foreign embassies regularly warn their citizens about the risk of attacks by skinheads in the country .
poland , too , has a flourishing far-right scene .
" good news for ukrainians " despite the huge problems , kiev remains confident that it can manage to surmount most challenges .
indeed , there are signs that the country is already gearing up to tackle the gargantuan task .
although kiev is currently locked in political crisis pitting supporters of the president and prime minister against each other , the two sides are united about euro 2012 .
four ukrainian cities selected as venues have already started preparations including upgrading their existing soccer facilities .
and the kiev mayor 's office has said the capital would completely renovate its 86,000-seat olympic stadium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is confident that investors will step in to build much needed stadiums in the west of the country , lviv city authorities have said they will renovate the city 's 28,000-seat stadium and increase its capacity .
ukraine 's reigning champions , shakhtar donetsk , are currently building a new 50,000-seat ground , while dnepropetrovsk , who finished sixth last season , had also began the construction of a new arena in their town .
ukraine 's sports minister , viktor korzh , said major investors were ready to step in alongside the authorities .
" there are serious investors , who are ready to invest up to 37 billion hryvnias -lrb- about 5.7 billion euros , $ 7.7 billion -rrb- in the construction of airports , roads , hotels and improving sports infrastructure , " he said .
roman shpek , ukraine 's ambassador to the european union , said the decision to allow ukraine to be co-host of the euro 2012 could not be underestimated .
" it is one more step toward ukraine 's integration to the eu , " shpek told the international herald tribune .
" after all the political debates and struggles over the past several months , this is really good news for the ukrainian people .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 19.04.2007 french election campaign swerves to the right großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right politicians are trying to woo voters in the french suburbs as france prepares to go to the polls , even moderate candidates are trying to score points with right-wing slogans , while the real right-wingers are attempting to woo immigrants from the suburbs . far-right veteran jean-marie le pen stunned france in the presidential election in 2002 by clinching 16.9 percent of the vote in the first round and knocking then-socialist candidate lionel jospin out of the race .
five years later , there are fears in certain quarters that the national front candidate might pull off a similar feat and make it to the run-off for france 's highest office .
but there 's little chance of that happening , according to alain howiller , president of the institute of political studies in strasbourg .
" le pen wo n't make it to the second round this time , " he said .
frank baasner , director of the german-french institute echoed the view .
" experience shows these things do n't repeat themselves , " he said .
" national identity " as a vote-getter but campaign managers at former interior minister nicolas sarkozy 's conservative ump camp remain wary .
according to french satirical weekly canard enchaine , sarkozy 's aides reckon that le pen 's anti-immigrant national front could take as much as 20 percent of the vote .
daniela schwarzer , an expert on france at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin also said that le pen 's influence could not be written off .
" the national front 's voter potential is possibly higher than the surveys show it to be , " she told dw-world.de. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy sings the national anthem with kids at a party congress in paris sarkozy 's campaign managers seem convinced that the election will only be won on the right .
and as if to emphasize that point , their candidate has been focusing all his energies on the topic of national identity in the final days leading up to the first round of voting on sunday .
the conservative frontrunner has said that only those who speak french sufficiently well will be allowed to settle down permanently in france .
sarkozy has also backed quotas for immigrants and choosing them on the basis of professional qualifications .
he has said he would set up a " ministry for immigration and national identity " if he 's elected .
" france is embittered that its national identity is endangered by unlimited immigration , " sarokzy said recently .
that 's a classic ploy of the far right , according to alain howiller .
" those are ideas that le pen has been propagating for 25 years , " he said .
royal shows nationalist streak and it 's not just sarkozy angling for votes from the far right .
even sarkozy 's socialist challenger , segolene royal , has displayed a strong nationalist streak in recent weeks .
at a campaign rally two weeks ago , royal urged her supporters for the first time to sing the national anthem .
over the weekend , royal stepped up her new-found nationalist drive by urging all french to have a french flag at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal has shown a nationalist streak in recent weeks experts , such as daniela schwarzer , worry that the " irresponsible " way royal and sarkozy have been flirting with the topic of national identity could have serious long-terms political consequences .
" if the whole discussion in a left-wing party like the ps -lrb- the socialist party -rrb- and a moderate right-wing party such as the ump leans so strongly towards the far-right fringe then it changes the whole atmosphere in society , " schwarzer said .
" then even openly xenophobic slogans do n't horrify anymore . "
le pen in unfamiliar territory sarkozy and royal 's right-wing dabbling may end up benefiting le pen , not just in the long term , but also more immediately .
the veteran politician has said he 's " happy " about the right tilt the election campaign in france has taken so far .
" that 's because it shows all the french that i 'm right , " le pen said recently .
the front national candidate has been charting unfamiliar territory during his campaign this time .
in a bid to stay relevant in the fight for both frustrated voters on the far right as well as protest voters , the 78-year-old has a young women , apparently from north africa , advertise for him on posters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-marie le pen is fishing for votes in unfamiliar waters le pen has also been campaigning in the depressed suburbs with the slogan : " neither friend , nor black , white nor north african - french ! "
the strategy might just work .
according to studies by the paris-based cevipof institute , around 100,000 immigrants from north africa could vote for le pen on sunday .
" everything but sarkozy " the one campaign slogan residents of the suburbs seem to agree on is : " everything but sarkozy . "
it 's obvious that they have n't forgotten the conservative frontrunner who described violent youth there as " scum " during riots in late 2005 .
a long announced campaign visit by sarkozy to the lyon suburb of villeurbanne , where the ump candidate planned to talk to youth amid whirring television cameras in an obvious publicity gimmick , never took place .
" many youth in the suburbs will vote for le pen because he offers them a chance to explode a system that they hate , because they see no chance for themselves in it , " said schwarzer .
" for that they 're ready to overlook his xenophobic comments .

" the allies were convinced and are convinced that there are no implications of the united states ' system for the strategic balance , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said after the highest-level talks ever on the issue . " ten interceptors will not , can not affect the strategic balance and 10 interceptors can not pose a threat to russia , " he said , after meetings between the 26 nato allies followed by a so-called nato-russia council . washington announced in january plans to extend its missile shield into europe to counter a potential missile attack from " rogue states " like iran , and possibly north korea . it would involve 10 missile interceptors without warheads set up in poland and a radar system in the czech republic to track any attack .
this would be linked to an advance warning system , probably in the caucasus .
russia says it sees no need for missile shield the move has ruffled feathers in russia , which is deeply concerned about its former cold war foe setting up military shop in its back yard .

" there is a clearly a divide , " he said . but us assistant secretary of state john rood , part of the senior three-man team charged with easing russia 's fears and european doubts , said that moscow still plans to weigh the proposals . " the representatives in the nato-russia council today ... indicated that the russian government was going to study our proposal in greater detail before providing a more full response , " he said . russian representative konstantin totsky conceded the offer had not been rejected yet , but he said that moscow has grown tired of being dictated to by washington . " the us colleagues give us their proposals , and then we give them our proposals and we can continue like this for years and call it a process of consultation , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans for a missile shield in europe have sparked controversy and concerns " i think we should have a transition from consultation to dialogue and i think we started this dialogue today , " he said , adding : " we will scrutinize these proposals and we will come back to our us colleagues . " he also expressed concern that the missile shield , set to come into operation around 2013 , would continue to grow . " we know from experience that when you have a system it keeps developing , it can not stop , " he warned .
rest of europe also concerned european allies are concerned about the system too , particularly that it would leave members bulgaria , greece , romania and turkey uncovered , and they insisted on the " indivisibility " of the alliance 's defenses . spokesman james appathurai said that nato also discussed " bolting on " its planned theater defense missile system - aimed at protecting troops in the field but still only in the testing phase - to the shield to cover the hole . in any case , talks are set to continue . ivanov and us defense secretary robert gates may discuss the plan during a moscow meeting next week , and the nato allies will take it up again when alliance foreign ministers hold talks in olso next thursday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato , russia hold high-level us missile shield talks the united states and its nato allies will on thursday hold their first high-level talks with russian officials aimed at easing moscow 's fears of us plans to build part of a missile shield in europe .

" the current upturn will continue , but the pace of expansion will be slower than last year , " the institutes said .
" a key reason for this is restrictive fiscal policy , which is likely to knock around half a percentage point of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth .
and the european central bank , too , is switching to neutral in its monetary policy . " optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economic institutes hiked their projections for 2007 and 2008 the five institutes - diw in berlin , ifo in munich , ifw in kiel , ihw in halle and rwi in essen - expected the ecb to raise its benchmark " refi " refinancing rate by a further 0.25 percent this summer to 4.0 percent . nevertheless , the tighter monetary conditions would not hamper " robust economic expansion , since long-term interest rates remain comparatively low , " the report said . contributing to gdp growth of 2.4 percent this year - in their previous report last autumn , the institutes had projected growth of 1.4 percent for 2007 - would be strong domestic demand , the institutes said . " household consumption will gradually improve as result of higher disposable income , " the think tanks predicted .
" investment remains strong .
and exports will continue to support the economy . " reduced unemployment the strong economic performance would lead to an improvement on the labor market , with the annual average jobless total set to fall below four million for the first time since 2001 . the jobless total would fall to 3.77 million in 2007 from 4.49 million in 2006 and then decline to further to 3.47 million in 2008 , the institutes said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of people out of work may fall by some 700,000 the jobless rate , which measures the total number of unemployed as a proportion of the working population as a whole , was projected to decline from 10.3 percent in 2006 to 8.7 percent in 2007 and 8.0 percent in 2008 . the robust economy would also have a positive effect on german debts , pushing the public deficit down from 1.7 percent of gdp in 2006 to just 0.6 percent of gdp in 2007 .
germany was expected to achieve a balanced budget , or a deficit ratio of zero , in 2008 , according to the report . under the terms of the european stability and growth pact , eurozone members are not allowed to run up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp . but germany , the main architect of the pact , was in breach of the 3.0-percent rule every year between 2002 and 2005 . on the inflation front , german inflation was projected to pick up only fractionally to 1.8 percent in both 2007 and 2008 from 1.7 percent in 2006 , the institutes said . the ecb defines price stability as inflation rates close to but just below 2.0 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de optimism grows on outlook for german economy the run of good news for the german economy , europe 's biggest , looks set to continue for some time , with bundesbank president axel weber arguing on monday that current growth marks only the beginning of a longer upturn .
-lrb- 16.04.2007 -rrb- germany 's economy continues growth spurt germany 's economy will have a higher growth rate in 2007 than originally predicted , according to a forecast released monday .
the gdp is expected to increase 2.8 percent this year .
-lrb- 12.03.2007 -rrb- germany upbeat about economy despite tax hike the expected global economic slowdown and a sharp rise in sales tax will have only a limited impact on the german economy this year when unemployment is expected to fall to a record low , the government said wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 19.04.2007 french election campaign swerves to the right großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right politicians are trying to woo voters in the french suburbs as france prepares to go to the polls , even moderate candidates are trying to score points with right-wing slogans , while the real right-wingers are attempting to woo immigrants from the suburbs . far-right veteran jean-marie le pen stunned france in the presidential election in 2002 by clinching 16.9 percent of the vote in the first round and knocking then-socialist candidate lionel jospin out of the race .
five years later , there are fears in certain quarters that the national front candidate might pull off a similar feat and make it to the run-off for france 's highest office .
but there 's little chance of that happening , according to alain howiller , president of the institute of political studies in strasbourg .
" le pen wo n't make it to the second round this time , " he said .
frank baasner , director of the german-french institute echoed the view .
" experience shows these things do n't repeat themselves , " he said .
" national identity " as a vote-getter but campaign managers at former interior minister nicolas sarkozy 's conservative ump camp remain wary .
according to french satirical weekly canard enchaine , sarkozy 's aides reckon that le pen 's anti-immigrant national front could take as much as 20 percent of the vote .
daniela schwarzer , an expert on france at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin also said that le pen 's influence could not be written off .
" the national front 's voter potential is possibly higher than the surveys show it to be , " she told dw-world.de. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy sings the national anthem with kids at a party congress in paris sarkozy 's campaign managers seem convinced that the election will only be won on the right .
and as if to emphasize that point , their candidate has been focusing all his energies on the topic of national identity in the final days leading up to the first round of voting on sunday .
the conservative frontrunner has said that only those who speak french sufficiently well will be allowed to settle down permanently in france .
sarkozy has also backed quotas for immigrants and choosing them on the basis of professional qualifications .
he has said he would set up a " ministry for immigration and national identity " if he 's elected .
" france is embittered that its national identity is endangered by unlimited immigration , " sarokzy said recently .
that 's a classic ploy of the far right , according to alain howiller .
" those are ideas that le pen has been propagating for 25 years , " he said .
royal shows nationalist streak and it 's not just sarkozy angling for votes from the far right .
even sarkozy 's socialist challenger , segolene royal , has displayed a strong nationalist streak in recent weeks .
at a campaign rally two weeks ago , royal urged her supporters for the first time to sing the national anthem .
over the weekend , royal stepped up her new-found nationalist drive by urging all french to have a french flag at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal has shown a nationalist streak in recent weeks experts , such as daniela schwarzer , worry that the " irresponsible " way royal and sarkozy have been flirting with the topic of national identity could have serious long-terms political consequences .
" if the whole discussion in a left-wing party like the ps -lrb- the socialist party -rrb- and a moderate right-wing party such as the ump leans so strongly towards the far-right fringe then it changes the whole atmosphere in society , " schwarzer said .
" then even openly xenophobic slogans do n't horrify anymore . "
le pen in unfamiliar territory sarkozy and royal 's right-wing dabbling may end up benefiting le pen , not just in the long term , but also more immediately .
the veteran politician has said he 's " happy " about the right tilt the election campaign in france has taken so far .
" that 's because it shows all the french that i 'm right , " le pen said recently .
the front national candidate has been charting unfamiliar territory during his campaign this time .
in a bid to stay relevant in the fight for both frustrated voters on the far right as well as protest voters , the 78-year-old has a young women , apparently from north africa , advertise for him on posters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-marie le pen is fishing for votes in unfamiliar waters le pen has also been campaigning in the depressed suburbs with the slogan : " neither friend , nor black , white nor north african - french ! "
the strategy might just work .
according to studies by the paris-based cevipof institute , around 100,000 immigrants from north africa could vote for le pen on sunday .
" everything but sarkozy " the one campaign slogan residents of the suburbs seem to agree on is : " everything but sarkozy . "
it 's obvious that they have n't forgotten the conservative frontrunner who described violent youth there as " scum " during riots in late 2005 .
a long announced campaign visit by sarkozy to the lyon suburb of villeurbanne , where the ump candidate planned to talk to youth amid whirring television cameras in an obvious publicity gimmick , never took place .
" many youth in the suburbs will vote for le pen because he offers them a chance to explode a system that they hate , because they see no chance for themselves in it , " said schwarzer .
" for that they 're ready to overlook his xenophobic comments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 19.04.2007 eu agrees on penalties for racism and xenophobia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new rules are only of a symbolic nature the european union thursday agreed on new rules to criminalize racism and xenophobia in the bloc , but said that the long-debated measures were mainly of symbolic nature . " racism and xenophobia can only be combatted effectively inside society , " german justice minister brigitte zypries told reporters after a meeting with her counterparts in luxembourg .
" criminal measures can only be supplementary , they can never be sufficient in combatting racism and xenophobia in itself , " said zypries whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
zypries said that the agreed piece of eu legislation , which is not legally binding for the bloc 's members , was an " important political signal " for the 27-nation union .
under the new rules , eu countries would set jail terms of at least one to three years for " publicly inciting to violence or hatred ... directed against a group of persons or a member of such a group defined by reference to race , color , religion , descent or national or ethnic origin . "
no minimum fines however , the legislation does not set any minimum fines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agreement does n't specify what constitutes incitement to violence it also leaves up to national courts to define what exactly constitutes incitement to violence or hatred .
there will also be no europe-wide ban on the use of nazi symbols .
raising awareness frattini said that the new rules would fully respect the freedom of expression .
" we are punishing concrete action , not any ideas , we are punishing incitement to hatred in a concrete way or encouraging other people to take concrete -lrb- xenophobic -rrb- action , " frattini said .
he said that the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , would try to raise awareness for the stalinist atrocities by organizing public debates " on the horrible crimes of the last century , ...
nazi crimes , stalinist crimes . "
however , the events still needed parliamentary approval in seven eu countries .
watered-down compromise the eu 's anti-racism rules - debated since 2001 - seemed at risk after latvia , lithuania and estonia had demanded making illegal the condoning , denial or trivialization of crimes against humanity committed under the soviet regime led by joseph stalin .
other eu states were opposed to the baltic demands , arguing that they did not legally recognize crimes committed under the stalinist regime or define major stalin atrocities as genocide .
zypries said the eu did not intend to decide on history but wanted to create public awareness for crimes against humanity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic states wanted stalin 's crimes to be put on a par with hitler 's germany views a common eu law on combating racism and xenophobia as a moral obligation .
the new rules which would also make denying the holocaust - the mass killing of jews by nazis and nazi supporters - a crime in the eu if the statement incites to violence or hatred , do not cover denying the massacre of armenians in world war i. turkey denies that the killing of up to one million armenians constituted genocide , putting their deaths down to ethnic strife , disease and famine , and has prosecuted historians and journalists for calling it genocide .
watchdogs criticize rules as weak under the rules , the denial of crimes of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes will be punishable in the eu if these crimes have been defined by international courts and if the statement incites to hatred or violence .
laws against denying the holocaust already exist in austria , belgium , france , germany and spain .
european racism watchdogs have said that the agreed text is " weak , " adding that eu efforts were " without any substantial intent to provide strengthened protections for those who experience racist crime and violence in europe .

" racism and xenophobia can only be combatted effectively inside society , " german justice minister brigitte zypries told reporters after a meeting with her counterparts in luxembourg .
" criminal measures can only be supplementary , they can never be sufficient in combatting racism and xenophobia in itself , " said zypries whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
zypries said that the agreed piece of eu legislation , which is not legally binding for the bloc 's members , was an " important political signal " for the 27-nation union .
under the new rules , eu countries would set jail terms of at least one to three years for " publicly inciting to violence or hatred ... directed against a group of persons or a member of such a group defined by reference to race , color , religion , descent or national or ethnic origin . "
no minimum fines however , the legislation does not set any minimum fines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agreement does n't specify what constitutes incitement to violence it also leaves up to national courts to define what exactly constitutes incitement to violence or hatred .
there will also be no europe-wide ban on the use of nazi symbols .
raising awareness frattini said that the new rules would fully respect the freedom of expression .
" we are punishing concrete action , not any ideas , we are punishing incitement to hatred in a concrete way or encouraging other people to take concrete -lrb- xenophobic -rrb- action , " frattini said .
he said that the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , would try to raise awareness for the stalinist atrocities by organizing public debates " on the horrible crimes of the last century , ...
nazi crimes , stalinist crimes . "
however , the events still needed parliamentary approval in seven eu countries .
watered-down compromise the eu 's anti-racism rules - debated since 2001 - seemed at risk after latvia , lithuania and estonia had demanded making illegal the condoning , denial or trivialization of crimes against humanity committed under the soviet regime led by joseph stalin .
other eu states were opposed to the baltic demands , arguing that they did not legally recognize crimes committed under the stalinist regime or define major stalin atrocities as genocide .
zypries said the eu did not intend to decide on history but wanted to create public awareness for crimes against humanity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic states wanted stalin 's crimes to be put on a par with hitler 's germany views a common eu law on combating racism and xenophobia as a moral obligation .
the new rules which would also make denying the holocaust - the mass killing of jews by nazis and nazi supporters - a crime in the eu if the statement incites to violence or hatred , do not cover denying the massacre of armenians in world war i. turkey denies that the killing of up to one million armenians constituted genocide , putting their deaths down to ethnic strife , disease and famine , and has prosecuted historians and journalists for calling it genocide .
watchdogs criticize rules as weak under the rules , the denial of crimes of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes will be punishable in the eu if these crimes have been defined by international courts and if the statement incites to hatred or violence .
laws against denying the holocaust already exist in austria , belgium , france , germany and spain .

" racism and xenophobia can only be combatted effectively inside society , " german justice minister brigitte zypries told reporters after a meeting with her counterparts in luxembourg .
" criminal measures can only be supplementary , they can never be sufficient in combatting racism and xenophobia in itself , " said zypries whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
zypries said that the agreed piece of eu legislation , which is not legally binding for the bloc 's members , was an " important political signal " for the 27-nation union .
under the new rules , eu countries would set jail terms of at least one to three years for " publicly inciting to violence or hatred ... directed against a group of persons or a member of such a group defined by reference to race , color , religion , descent or national or ethnic origin . "
no minimum fines however , the legislation does not set any minimum fines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agreement does n't specify what constitutes incitement to violence it also leaves up to national courts to define what exactly constitutes incitement to violence or hatred .
there will also be no europe-wide ban on the use of nazi symbols .
raising awareness frattini said that the new rules would fully respect the freedom of expression .
" we are punishing concrete action , not any ideas , we are punishing incitement to hatred in a concrete way or encouraging other people to take concrete -lrb- xenophobic -rrb- action , " frattini said .
he said that the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , would try to raise awareness for the stalinist atrocities by organizing public debates " on the horrible crimes of the last century , ...
nazi crimes , stalinist crimes . "
however , the events still needed parliamentary approval in seven eu countries .
watered-down compromise the eu 's anti-racism rules - debated since 2001 - seemed at risk after latvia , lithuania and estonia had demanded making illegal the condoning , denial or trivialization of crimes against humanity committed under the soviet regime led by joseph stalin .
other eu states were opposed to the baltic demands , arguing that they did not legally recognize crimes committed under the stalinist regime or define major stalin atrocities as genocide .
zypries said the eu did not intend to decide on history but wanted to create public awareness for crimes against humanity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic states wanted stalin 's crimes to be put on a par with hitler 's germany views a common eu law on combating racism and xenophobia as a moral obligation .
the new rules which would also make denying the holocaust - the mass killing of jews by nazis and nazi supporters - a crime in the eu if the statement incites to violence or hatred , do not cover denying the massacre of armenians in world war i. turkey denies that the killing of up to one million armenians constituted genocide , putting their deaths down to ethnic strife , disease and famine , and has prosecuted historians and journalists for calling it genocide .
watchdogs criticize rules as weak under the rules , the denial of crimes of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes will be punishable in the eu if these crimes have been defined by international courts and if the statement incites to hatred or violence .
laws against denying the holocaust already exist in austria , belgium , france , germany and spain .

" a minister who spreads this kind of hysteria becomes a security risk himself , " he told the leipziger volkszeitung thursday in response to schäuble 's comment to weekly news magazine stern that presuming suspects were innocent until they had been proven guilty was inappropriate in the fight against terror . ute vogt , deputy leader of the social democrats , was equally alarmed . " anyone who questions the principle of innocent until proven guilty is the wrong person to be in charge of upholding and protecting the constitution , " she said . nothing new for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries , right , said schäuble 's comments were " imprecise and unfortunate " though she called the comments " imprecise and unfortunate , " german justice minister brigitte zypries said schäuble 's statements did not break any new ground . " naturally the presumption of innocence does not apply to averting dangers , " she said thursday .
" the presumption of innocence applies only to criminal proceedings , not preventive actions .

" a minister who spreads this kind of hysteria becomes a security risk himself , " he told the leipziger volkszeitung thursday in response to schäuble 's comment to weekly news magazine stern that presuming suspects were innocent until they had been proven guilty was inappropriate in the fight against terror . ute vogt , deputy leader of the social democrats , was equally alarmed . " anyone who questions the principle of innocent until proven guilty is the wrong person to be in charge of upholding and protecting the constitution , " she said . nothing new for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries , right , said schäuble 's comments were " imprecise and unfortunate " though she called the comments " imprecise and unfortunate , " german justice minister brigitte zypries said schäuble 's statements did not break any new ground . " naturally the presumption of innocence does not apply to averting dangers , " she said thursday .
" the presumption of innocence applies only to criminal proceedings , not preventive actions . " zypries said germany 's discussion of anti-terror measures had become " somewhat cloudy " and added that the results of schäuble 's plan " remain to be seen . " speaking to the daily berliner zeitung , however , gerhart baum , a former german interior minister and member of the free-market liberal fdp party , described schäuble 's comments as " constitutionally unacceptable " and called on chancellor angela merkel to rein in her minister .

" the allies were convinced and are convinced that there are no implications of the united states ' system for the strategic balance , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said after the highest-level talks ever on the issue . " ten interceptors will not , can not affect the strategic balance and 10 interceptors can not pose a threat to russia , " he said , after meetings between the 26 nato allies followed by a so-called nato-russia council . washington announced in january plans to extend its missile shield into europe to counter a potential missile attack from " rogue states " like iran , and possibly north korea . it would involve 10 missile interceptors without warheads set up in poland and a radar system in the czech republic to track any attack .
this would be linked to an advance warning system , probably in the caucasus .
russia says it sees no need for missile shield the move has ruffled feathers in russia , which is deeply concerned about its former cold war foe setting up military shop in its back yard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaap de hoop scheffer " we can not understand what eastern europe needs this system for , " first deputy prime minister sergei ivanov , a former russian defence minister , said thursday . washington has tried to ease russia 's concerns by suggesting possible areas of cooperation , including sharing early warning missile data , but ivanov appeared to reject the offer . " i honestly see no basis for speaking of possible cooperation , " he was quoted as saying by interfax news agency . scheffer aknowledged " a difference in threat perception " between the allies and russia .
" there is a clearly a divide , " he said . but us assistant secretary of state john rood , part of the senior three-man team charged with easing russia 's fears and european doubts , said that moscow still plans to weigh the proposals . " the representatives in the nato-russia council today ... indicated that the russian government was going to study our proposal in greater detail before providing a more full response , " he said . russian representative konstantin totsky conceded the offer had not been rejected yet , but he said that moscow has grown tired of being dictated to by washington . " the us colleagues give us their proposals , and then we give them our proposals and we can continue like this for years and call it a process of consultation , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans for a missile shield in europe have sparked controversy and concerns " i think we should have a transition from consultation to dialogue and i think we started this dialogue today , " he said , adding : " we will scrutinize these proposals and we will come back to our us colleagues . " he also expressed concern that the missile shield , set to come into operation around 2013 , would continue to grow . " we know from experience that when you have a system it keeps developing , it can not stop , " he warned .
rest of europe also concerned european allies are concerned about the system too , particularly that it would leave members bulgaria , greece , romania and turkey uncovered , and they insisted on the " indivisibility " of the alliance 's defenses . spokesman james appathurai said that nato also discussed " bolting on " its planned theater defense missile system - aimed at protecting troops in the field but still only in the testing phase - to the shield to cover the hole . in any case , talks are set to continue . ivanov and us defense secretary robert gates may discuss the plan during a moscow meeting next week , and the nato allies will take it up again when alliance foreign ministers hold talks in olso next thursday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato , russia hold high-level us missile shield talks the united states and its nato allies will on thursday hold their first high-level talks with russian officials aimed at easing moscow 's fears of us plans to build part of a missile shield in europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.04.2007 german jobseekers plumb volunteerism 's possibilities großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : offering a helping hand to others may be helpful to one 's own career unlike the us , germany does not have a highly developed culture of volunteerism .
but with state coffers increasingly empty and a continually tight job market , observers say unpaid work can have hidden benefits . in the us , volunteering is widespread - a credo promoted at home and in schools , and even as pseudo-governmental doctrine .
from tutoring in after school programs , to working as an aide in a hospital , to helping build houses for the poor - americans have long been schooled in the importance of " giving back to community . " but since its postwar economic boom , germany has used its tax base wealth to provide for the needy and offer its citizens singularly generous social benefits .
volunteer work was mainly done by charitable religious groups , or young men exempted from military service , fulfilling an obligatory year of civil service . increasingly , though , young people going onto the job market are discovering the side benefits that can be reaped from a volunteer stint .
such experience can help develop the highly touted " soft skills " that are increasingly in demand in the business world , observers say . after all , anyone can call themselves a " team player , " but a well-chosen , unpaid job may give them the chance to actually prove they are one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in german statistics , sports activities are often counted as " volunteer work " " for people looking for their first job , working as a volunteer is a great advantage , " said sascha theisen , the spokesman for stepstone.de , an employment-recruiting internet portal that advises people at all stages of their career .
" it gives them the chance to gain experience , for instance in leading a project , or solving problems or managing people . " it also means they could come to the job with a network already in place of people who would be good contacts later on down the road , " he added . too much of a good thing ? but theisen warned that people who are already in the middle of their careers should be careful not to overdo it .
german employers would only really smile upon someone involved in an activity that might be beneficial to business : taking an active role in a professional association , for instance . " if someone is busy leading several sports clubs and on top of that they sing in a choir , you have to ask yourself , are they going to have enough time for their job ? "
theisen asked . christoph lender saw the benefits of volunteering first hand .
by his own account , the half-dozen years he spent leading catholic youth groups helped give him just those skills required by his first employer , a bank .
at the job interview , they discussed the work he had done coordinating events , leading discussions and meetings , and being an authority figure for 10 to 15 kids every week . " it 's a signal for a company , that in addition to your studies and any internships you do , that you also took time for other things , and were socially engaged , " lender said .
" it speaks for how you choose to spend your time . " job boost a ' byproduct ' but lender stressed that his motivation for taking up volunteer work was not some calculated attempt to improve his chances on the job market . " i did it for my own personal development , " he said .
" the good experience with the job was just a byproduct of that . " german software giant sap 's hiring approach also supports lender 's experience . spokesperson alla ruggaber-mast said the company looks for people who are motivated and independent , with highly developed " soft skills " in communication , problem solving , and conflict resolution .
but while the firm " welcomes candidates who are socially engaged , that is not a decisive factor in hiring . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a voluntary civil service year , often in old age homes , means a military exemption according to the latest german government survey on volunteerism from 2004 , some 36 percent of germans claim volunteer responsibilities , up from 34 percent five years earlier . but that high number includes such volunteer jobs as taking an active role in a sports club or cultural institute .
the figure for " social " volunteerism - such as leading a youth group - was at 5.5 percent in 2004 , up from 4 percent in 1999 . there are historical reasons that relatively few germans take on social volunteer jobs , said werner lindwehr , a spokesman for the agency for self-help and volunteering in the city of osnabrück , in the state of lower saxony . " directly after the war , volunteerism was part of society , out of necessity , " lindwehr said .
" people helped one another . " later , the state took over many of those responsibilities .

but with state coffers increasingly empty and a continually tight job market , observers say unpaid work can have hidden benefits . in the us , volunteering is widespread - a credo promoted at home and in schools , and even as pseudo-governmental doctrine .
from tutoring in after school programs , to working as an aide in a hospital , to helping build houses for the poor - americans have long been schooled in the importance of " giving back to community . " but since its postwar economic boom , germany has used its tax base wealth to provide for the needy and offer its citizens singularly generous social benefits .
volunteer work was mainly done by charitable religious groups , or young men exempted from military service , fulfilling an obligatory year of civil service . increasingly , though , young people going onto the job market are discovering the side benefits that can be reaped from a volunteer stint .
such experience can help develop the highly touted " soft skills " that are increasingly in demand in the business world , observers say . after all , anyone can call themselves a " team player , " but a well-chosen , unpaid job may give them the chance to actually prove they are one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in german statistics , sports activities are often counted as " volunteer work " " for people looking for their first job , working as a volunteer is a great advantage , " said sascha theisen , the spokesman for stepstone.de , an employment-recruiting internet portal that advises people at all stages of their career .
" it gives them the chance to gain experience , for instance in leading a project , or solving problems or managing people . " it also means they could come to the job with a network already in place of people who would be good contacts later on down the road , " he added . too much of a good thing ? but theisen warned that people who are already in the middle of their careers should be careful not to overdo it .
german employers would only really smile upon someone involved in an activity that might be beneficial to business : taking an active role in a professional association , for instance . " if someone is busy leading several sports clubs and on top of that they sing in a choir , you have to ask yourself , are they going to have enough time for their job ? "
theisen asked . christoph lender saw the benefits of volunteering first hand .
by his own account , the half-dozen years he spent leading catholic youth groups helped give him just those skills required by his first employer , a bank .
at the job interview , they discussed the work he had done coordinating events , leading discussions and meetings , and being an authority figure for 10 to 15 kids every week . " it 's a signal for a company , that in addition to your studies and any internships you do , that you also took time for other things , and were socially engaged , " lender said .
" it speaks for how you choose to spend your time . " job boost a ' byproduct ' but lender stressed that his motivation for taking up volunteer work was not some calculated attempt to improve his chances on the job market . " i did it for my own personal development , " he said .
" the good experience with the job was just a byproduct of that . " german software giant sap 's hiring approach also supports lender 's experience . spokesperson alla ruggaber-mast said the company looks for people who are motivated and independent , with highly developed " soft skills " in communication , problem solving , and conflict resolution .
but while the firm " welcomes candidates who are socially engaged , that is not a decisive factor in hiring . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a voluntary civil service year , often in old age homes , means a military exemption according to the latest german government survey on volunteerism from 2004 , some 36 percent of germans claim volunteer responsibilities , up from 34 percent five years earlier . but that high number includes such volunteer jobs as taking an active role in a sports club or cultural institute .

but with state coffers increasingly empty and a continually tight job market , observers say unpaid work can have hidden benefits . in the us , volunteering is widespread - a credo promoted at home and in schools , and even as pseudo-governmental doctrine .
from tutoring in after school programs , to working as an aide in a hospital , to helping build houses for the poor - americans have long been schooled in the importance of " giving back to community . " but since its postwar economic boom , germany has used its tax base wealth to provide for the needy and offer its citizens singularly generous social benefits .
volunteer work was mainly done by charitable religious groups , or young men exempted from military service , fulfilling an obligatory year of civil service . increasingly , though , young people going onto the job market are discovering the side benefits that can be reaped from a volunteer stint .
such experience can help develop the highly touted " soft skills " that are increasingly in demand in the business world , observers say . after all , anyone can call themselves a " team player , " but a well-chosen , unpaid job may give them the chance to actually prove they are one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in german statistics , sports activities are often counted as " volunteer work " " for people looking for their first job , working as a volunteer is a great advantage , " said sascha theisen , the spokesman for stepstone.de , an employment-recruiting internet portal that advises people at all stages of their career .
" it gives them the chance to gain experience , for instance in leading a project , or solving problems or managing people . " it also means they could come to the job with a network already in place of people who would be good contacts later on down the road , " he added . too much of a good thing ? but theisen warned that people who are already in the middle of their careers should be careful not to overdo it .
german employers would only really smile upon someone involved in an activity that might be beneficial to business : taking an active role in a professional association , for instance . " if someone is busy leading several sports clubs and on top of that they sing in a choir , you have to ask yourself , are they going to have enough time for their job ? "
theisen asked . christoph lender saw the benefits of volunteering first hand .
by his own account , the half-dozen years he spent leading catholic youth groups helped give him just those skills required by his first employer , a bank .
at the job interview , they discussed the work he had done coordinating events , leading discussions and meetings , and being an authority figure for 10 to 15 kids every week . " it 's a signal for a company , that in addition to your studies and any internships you do , that you also took time for other things , and were socially engaged , " lender said .
" it speaks for how you choose to spend your time . " job boost a ' byproduct ' but lender stressed that his motivation for taking up volunteer work was not some calculated attempt to improve his chances on the job market . " i did it for my own personal development , " he said .
" the good experience with the job was just a byproduct of that . " german software giant sap 's hiring approach also supports lender 's experience . spokesperson alla ruggaber-mast said the company looks for people who are motivated and independent , with highly developed " soft skills " in communication , problem solving , and conflict resolution .
but while the firm " welcomes candidates who are socially engaged , that is not a decisive factor in hiring . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a voluntary civil service year , often in old age homes , means a military exemption according to the latest german government survey on volunteerism from 2004 , some 36 percent of germans claim volunteer responsibilities , up from 34 percent five years earlier . but that high number includes such volunteer jobs as taking an active role in a sports club or cultural institute .
the figure for " social " volunteerism - such as leading a youth group - was at 5.5 percent in 2004 , up from 4 percent in 1999 . there are historical reasons that relatively few germans take on social volunteer jobs , said werner lindwehr , a spokesman for the agency for self-help and volunteering in the city of osnabrück , in the state of lower saxony . " directly after the war , volunteerism was part of society , out of necessity , " lindwehr said .
" people helped one another . " later , the state took over many of those responsibilities . " and it may be that germans started just sitting back and saying , ' i 'll let the state take care of it , " ' he acknowledged . difference to usa today , however , he sees a movement toward citizens taking a more active role .
a " culture of volunteerism " is , indeed , developing in germany , he said . " people want to do more than just vote every four years , " lindwehr said .
" they want to do something on their own doorstep , and they see that they are taken seriously by the government . " but volunteerism in germany will never have the same status as in the us , where it fills a quasi-governmental function , he added . " you ca n't compare the volunteerism with usa and here , " he said .
" the us has a much worse social system .
in my opinion , they have more need , and thus more organization . " in germany , lindwehr argued , volunteerism will grow , but it will have a more " political " character , with volunteers and governments forming a sort of bridge to get things done .
for instance , he said , people are becoming increasingly active in local citizens ' initiatives . not everyone likes it an example is a group of people who decide their playground needs renovation , but the town says there is no funding for it .
so the local government will act as a go between , and find a carpenter who is willing to donate wood , or people to help manage the construction . despite these examples , volunteerism in germany is far from being accepted as purely beneficial .
debates occasionally flare up over the usefulness of the civil-service year , and there are those who decry the notion of unpaid work at all , saying it steals jobs from people who need them . meanwhile , christoph lender said that from where he stands , he has seen little evidence that the country will be overrun by volunteers any time soon . " among my friends , i guess you would say i am one of the more socially engaged , " lender said .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 19.04.2007 french election campaign swerves to the right großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right politicians are trying to woo voters in the french suburbs as france prepares to go to the polls , even moderate candidates are trying to score points with right-wing slogans , while the real right-wingers are attempting to woo immigrants from the suburbs . far-right veteran jean-marie le pen stunned france in the presidential election in 2002 by clinching 16.9 percent of the vote in the first round and knocking then-socialist candidate lionel jospin out of the race .
five years later , there are fears in certain quarters that the national front candidate might pull off a similar feat and make it to the run-off for france 's highest office .
but there 's little chance of that happening , according to alain howiller , president of the institute of political studies in strasbourg .
" le pen wo n't make it to the second round this time , " he said .
frank baasner , director of the german-french institute echoed the view .
" experience shows these things do n't repeat themselves , " he said .
" national identity " as a vote-getter but campaign managers at former interior minister nicolas sarkozy 's conservative ump camp remain wary .
according to french satirical weekly canard enchaine , sarkozy 's aides reckon that le pen 's anti-immigrant national front could take as much as 20 percent of the vote .
daniela schwarzer , an expert on france at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin also said that le pen 's influence could not be written off .
" the national front 's voter potential is possibly higher than the surveys show it to be , " she told dw-world.de. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy sings the national anthem with kids at a party congress in paris sarkozy 's campaign managers seem convinced that the election will only be won on the right .
and as if to emphasize that point , their candidate has been focusing all his energies on the topic of national identity in the final days leading up to the first round of voting on sunday .
the conservative frontrunner has said that only those who speak french sufficiently well will be allowed to settle down permanently in france .
sarkozy has also backed quotas for immigrants and choosing them on the basis of professional qualifications .
he has said he would set up a " ministry for immigration and national identity " if he 's elected .
" france is embittered that its national identity is endangered by unlimited immigration , " sarokzy said recently .
that 's a classic ploy of the far right , according to alain howiller .
" those are ideas that le pen has been propagating for 25 years , " he said .
royal shows nationalist streak and it 's not just sarkozy angling for votes from the far right .
even sarkozy 's socialist challenger , segolene royal , has displayed a strong nationalist streak in recent weeks .
at a campaign rally two weeks ago , royal urged her supporters for the first time to sing the national anthem .
over the weekend , royal stepped up her new-found nationalist drive by urging all french to have a french flag at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal has shown a nationalist streak in recent weeks experts , such as daniela schwarzer , worry that the " irresponsible " way royal and sarkozy have been flirting with the topic of national identity could have serious long-terms political consequences .
" if the whole discussion in a left-wing party like the ps -lrb- the socialist party -rrb- and a moderate right-wing party such as the ump leans so strongly towards the far-right fringe then it changes the whole atmosphere in society , " schwarzer said .
" then even openly xenophobic slogans do n't horrify anymore . "
le pen in unfamiliar territory sarkozy and royal 's right-wing dabbling may end up benefiting le pen , not just in the long term , but also more immediately .
the veteran politician has said he 's " happy " about the right tilt the election campaign in france has taken so far .
" that 's because it shows all the french that i 'm right , " le pen said recently .
the front national candidate has been charting unfamiliar territory during his campaign this time .
in a bid to stay relevant in the fight for both frustrated voters on the far right as well as protest voters , the 78-year-old has a young women , apparently from north africa , advertise for him on posters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-marie le pen is fishing for votes in unfamiliar waters le pen has also been campaigning in the depressed suburbs with the slogan : " neither friend , nor black , white nor north african - french ! "
the strategy might just work .
according to studies by the paris-based cevipof institute , around 100,000 immigrants from north africa could vote for le pen on sunday .
" everything but sarkozy " the one campaign slogan residents of the suburbs seem to agree on is : " everything but sarkozy . "
it 's obvious that they have n't forgotten the conservative frontrunner who described violent youth there as " scum " during riots in late 2005 .
a long announced campaign visit by sarkozy to the lyon suburb of villeurbanne , where the ump candidate planned to talk to youth amid whirring television cameras in an obvious publicity gimmick , never took place .
" many youth in the suburbs will vote for le pen because he offers them a chance to explode a system that they hate , because they see no chance for themselves in it , " said schwarzer .
" for that they 're ready to overlook his xenophobic comments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 19.04.2007 french election campaign swerves to the right großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right politicians are trying to woo voters in the french suburbs as france prepares to go to the polls , even moderate candidates are trying to score points with right-wing slogans , while the real right-wingers are attempting to woo immigrants from the suburbs . far-right veteran jean-marie le pen stunned france in the presidential election in 2002 by clinching 16.9 percent of the vote in the first round and knocking then-socialist candidate lionel jospin out of the race .
five years later , there are fears in certain quarters that the national front candidate might pull off a similar feat and make it to the run-off for france 's highest office .
but there 's little chance of that happening , according to alain howiller , president of the institute of political studies in strasbourg .
" le pen wo n't make it to the second round this time , " he said .
frank baasner , director of the german-french institute echoed the view .
" experience shows these things do n't repeat themselves , " he said .
" national identity " as a vote-getter but campaign managers at former interior minister nicolas sarkozy 's conservative ump camp remain wary .
according to french satirical weekly canard enchaine , sarkozy 's aides reckon that le pen 's anti-immigrant national front could take as much as 20 percent of the vote .
daniela schwarzer , an expert on france at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin also said that le pen 's influence could not be written off .
" the national front 's voter potential is possibly higher than the surveys show it to be , " she told dw-world.de. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy sings the national anthem with kids at a party congress in paris sarkozy 's campaign managers seem convinced that the election will only be won on the right .
and as if to emphasize that point , their candidate has been focusing all his energies on the topic of national identity in the final days leading up to the first round of voting on sunday .
the conservative frontrunner has said that only those who speak french sufficiently well will be allowed to settle down permanently in france .
sarkozy has also backed quotas for immigrants and choosing them on the basis of professional qualifications .
he has said he would set up a " ministry for immigration and national identity " if he 's elected .
" france is embittered that its national identity is endangered by unlimited immigration , " sarokzy said recently .
that 's a classic ploy of the far right , according to alain howiller .
" those are ideas that le pen has been propagating for 25 years , " he said .
royal shows nationalist streak and it 's not just sarkozy angling for votes from the far right .
even sarkozy 's socialist challenger , segolene royal , has displayed a strong nationalist streak in recent weeks .
at a campaign rally two weeks ago , royal urged her supporters for the first time to sing the national anthem .
over the weekend , royal stepped up her new-found nationalist drive by urging all french to have a french flag at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal has shown a nationalist streak in recent weeks experts , such as daniela schwarzer , worry that the " irresponsible " way royal and sarkozy have been flirting with the topic of national identity could have serious long-terms political consequences .
" if the whole discussion in a left-wing party like the ps -lrb- the socialist party -rrb- and a moderate right-wing party such as the ump leans so strongly towards the far-right fringe then it changes the whole atmosphere in society , " schwarzer said .
" then even openly xenophobic slogans do n't horrify anymore . "
le pen in unfamiliar territory sarkozy and royal 's right-wing dabbling may end up benefiting le pen , not just in the long term , but also more immediately .
the veteran politician has said he 's " happy " about the right tilt the election campaign in france has taken so far .
" that 's because it shows all the french that i 'm right , " le pen said recently .
the front national candidate has been charting unfamiliar territory during his campaign this time .
in a bid to stay relevant in the fight for both frustrated voters on the far right as well as protest voters , the 78-year-old has a young women , apparently from north africa , advertise for him on posters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-marie le pen is fishing for votes in unfamiliar waters le pen has also been campaigning in the depressed suburbs with the slogan : " neither friend , nor black , white nor north african - french ! "
the strategy might just work .
according to studies by the paris-based cevipof institute , around 100,000 immigrants from north africa could vote for le pen on sunday .
" everything but sarkozy " the one campaign slogan residents of the suburbs seem to agree on is : " everything but sarkozy . "
it 's obvious that they have n't forgotten the conservative frontrunner who described violent youth there as " scum " during riots in late 2005 .
a long announced campaign visit by sarkozy to the lyon suburb of villeurbanne , where the ump candidate planned to talk to youth amid whirring television cameras in an obvious publicity gimmick , never took place .
" many youth in the suburbs will vote for le pen because he offers them a chance to explode a system that they hate , because they see no chance for themselves in it , " said schwarzer .
" for that they 're ready to overlook his xenophobic comments .

" the allies were convinced and are convinced that there are no implications of the united states ' system for the strategic balance , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said after the highest-level talks ever on the issue . " ten interceptors will not , can not affect the strategic balance and 10 interceptors can not pose a threat to russia , " he said , after meetings between the 26 nato allies followed by a so-called nato-russia council . washington announced in january plans to extend its missile shield into europe to counter a potential missile attack from " rogue states " like iran , and possibly north korea . it would involve 10 missile interceptors without warheads set up in poland and a radar system in the czech republic to track any attack .
this would be linked to an advance warning system , probably in the caucasus .
russia says it sees no need for missile shield the move has ruffled feathers in russia , which is deeply concerned about its former cold war foe setting up military shop in its back yard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaap de hoop scheffer " we can not understand what eastern europe needs this system for , " first deputy prime minister sergei ivanov , a former russian defence minister , said thursday . washington has tried to ease russia 's concerns by suggesting possible areas of cooperation , including sharing early warning missile data , but ivanov appeared to reject the offer . " i honestly see no basis for speaking of possible cooperation , " he was quoted as saying by interfax news agency . scheffer aknowledged " a difference in threat perception " between the allies and russia .
" there is a clearly a divide , " he said . but us assistant secretary of state john rood , part of the senior three-man team charged with easing russia 's fears and european doubts , said that moscow still plans to weigh the proposals . " the representatives in the nato-russia council today ... indicated that the russian government was going to study our proposal in greater detail before providing a more full response , " he said . russian representative konstantin totsky conceded the offer had not been rejected yet , but he said that moscow has grown tired of being dictated to by washington . " the us colleagues give us their proposals , and then we give them our proposals and we can continue like this for years and call it a process of consultation , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans for a missile shield in europe have sparked controversy and concerns " i think we should have a transition from consultation to dialogue and i think we started this dialogue today , " he said , adding : " we will scrutinize these proposals and we will come back to our us colleagues . " he also expressed concern that the missile shield , set to come into operation around 2013 , would continue to grow . " we know from experience that when you have a system it keeps developing , it can not stop , " he warned .
rest of europe also concerned european allies are concerned about the system too , particularly that it would leave members bulgaria , greece , romania and turkey uncovered , and they insisted on the " indivisibility " of the alliance 's defenses . spokesman james appathurai said that nato also discussed " bolting on " its planned theater defense missile system - aimed at protecting troops in the field but still only in the testing phase - to the shield to cover the hole . in any case , talks are set to continue . ivanov and us defense secretary robert gates may discuss the plan during a moscow meeting next week , and the nato allies will take it up again when alliance foreign ministers hold talks in olso next thursday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato , russia hold high-level us missile shield talks the united states and its nato allies will on thursday hold their first high-level talks with russian officials aimed at easing moscow 's fears of us plans to build part of a missile shield in europe .

" five years is long enough and i am sure that with the mobilization and determination of the local authorities and the people , we will succeed . "
it will be the first time that either poland or ukraine will host a major soccer championship .
it 's the third major sporting event , following the beijing olympic games in 2008 and the soccer world cup in south africa in 2010 , to break away from the traditional grounds of western europe and the americas .

ukraine 's reigning champions , shakhtar donetsk , are currently building a new 50,000-seat ground , while dnepropetrovsk , who finished sixth last season , had also began the construction of a new arena in their town .
ukraine 's sports minister , viktor korzh , said major investors were ready to step in alongside the authorities .

they have to get their stadiums , transport systems and hotels up to scratch and overcome a legacy of hooliganism and corruption . a day after poland and ukraine scored a shock win over italy and fellow joint bidders hungary and croatia in the race to clinch the major soccer tournament - which takes place every four years - the enormity of the task facing the two host nations was beginning to sink in .
they will need nothing short of a herculean construction and investor drive to build stadium , hotels and other infrastructure .
in addition , security worries , hooliganism and corruption remain nagging problems .
organizers and politicians , however , insist they will roll up their sleeves in order to ensure the success of the soccer championships .
poland tries to calm jitters in the lead up to wednesday 's decision by european soccer 's governing body , uefa , at a meeting in cardiff , the polish-ukrainian bidders tried to calm jitters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president yushchenko -lrb- r . -rrb- and polish president kaczynski polish president lech kaczynski who traveled to the welsh capital with ukrainian president viktor yushchenko to make an 11th-hour pitch for their bid , said there was much work to be done .
" we must not forget the enormity of the task of organizing euro 2012 , but that is also excellent news for poland , " kaczynski said .
" there will be new stadiums built in warsaw , gdansk , wroclaw and poznan .
that can only be seen in a positive light , " he added .
" five years is long enough and i am sure that with the mobilization and determination of the local authorities and the people , we will succeed . "
it will be the first time that either poland or ukraine will host a major soccer championship .
it 's the third major sporting event , following the beijing olympic games in 2008 and the soccer world cup in south africa in 2010 , to break away from the traditional grounds of western europe and the americas .
infrastructure in need of massive overhaul polish authorities said last week that around 26 billion euros -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- , including eu financing , have been earmarked to upgrade infrastructure .
fans will need every bit of it .
anyone wanting to travel by road from gdansk in northern poland to donetsk , a host city in eastern ukraine , has to traverse 2,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,240 miles -rrb- .
the 22-hour car or bus trip - not counting the lengthy wait at the polish-ukrainian border - is mostly on single lane roads .
only 23 kilometers -lrb- 14 miles -rrb- of the trip is on motorway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the few four-lane motorways in poland , near the ukraine border despite receiving vast eu funding since the fall of communism in 1989 and becoming a member of the bloc in 2004 , poland still has n't built a basic motorway network connecting its major cities .
the situation is worse in ukraine .
there , train travel is hardly better : it currently takes 43 hours , at best , to get from gdansk to donetsk .
lack of investment means it is too dangerous to use high speed trains on the aging tracks .
while booming low-cost airlines carry hundreds of thousands of poles between their homes and western europe each year , there are still no cheap links between ukraine and poland .
outside major cities , particularly in ukraine , good hotels are hard to come by - or at least in sufficient numbers to cater to tens of thousands of fans , journalists and soccer officials .
hooliganism , right wing crimes raise concerns polish soccer is also blighted by hooliganism .
fears that polish fans would cause trouble at last year 's world cup in neighboring germany led to a massive police operation in both countries , although in the end the hooligans stayed away .
in addition , polish soccer 's image has been dented by corruption .
a two-year-old match-fixing scandal has led to more than 60 arrests , including several referees , a member of the polish soccer association -lrb- pzpn -rrb- leadership and a string of club officials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hooliganism continues to blight polish soccer on thursday , polish sports minister tomasz lipiec vowed to make polish soccer graft-free by the time of the euro 2012 .
" we want to sort this problem out completely by 2012 .
i 'm convinced that we will manage it even earlier , " lipiec said .
" the championships must take place in an atmosphere of fair play . "
ukraine will also have to do more to improve security for foreign fans .
foreign embassies regularly warn their citizens about the risk of attacks by skinheads in the country .

they will need nothing short of a herculean construction and investor drive to build stadium , hotels and other infrastructure .
in addition , security worries , hooliganism and corruption remain nagging problems .
organizers and politicians , however , insist they will roll up their sleeves in order to ensure the success of the soccer championships .

" we must not forget the enormity of the task of organizing euro 2012 , but that is also excellent news for poland , " kaczynski said .
" there will be new stadiums built in warsaw , gdansk , wroclaw and poznan .
that can only be seen in a positive light , " he added .
" five years is long enough and i am sure that with the mobilization and determination of the local authorities and the people , we will succeed . "
it will be the first time that either poland or ukraine will host a major soccer championship .
it 's the third major sporting event , following the beijing olympic games in 2008 and the soccer world cup in south africa in 2010 , to break away from the traditional grounds of western europe and the americas .
infrastructure in need of massive overhaul polish authorities said last week that around 26 billion euros -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- , including eu financing , have been earmarked to upgrade infrastructure .
fans will need every bit of it .
anyone wanting to travel by road from gdansk in northern poland to donetsk , a host city in eastern ukraine , has to traverse 2,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,240 miles -rrb- .

the situation is worse in ukraine .
there , train travel is hardly better : it currently takes 43 hours , at best , to get from gdansk to donetsk .
lack of investment means it is too dangerous to use high speed trains on the aging tracks .
while booming low-cost airlines carry hundreds of thousands of poles between their homes and western europe each year , there are still no cheap links between ukraine and poland .
outside major cities , particularly in ukraine , good hotels are hard to come by - or at least in sufficient numbers to cater to tens of thousands of fans , journalists and soccer officials .
hooliganism , right wing crimes raise concerns polish soccer is also blighted by hooliganism .
fears that polish fans would cause trouble at last year 's world cup in neighboring germany led to a massive police operation in both countries , although in the end the hooligans stayed away .
in addition , polish soccer 's image has been dented by corruption .
a two-year-old match-fixing scandal has led to more than 60 arrests , including several referees , a member of the polish soccer association -lrb- pzpn -rrb- leadership and a string of club officials .

" the allies were convinced and are convinced that there are no implications of the united states ' system for the strategic balance , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said after the highest-level talks ever on the issue . " ten interceptors will not , can not affect the strategic balance and 10 interceptors can not pose a threat to russia , " he said , after meetings between the 26 nato allies followed by a so-called nato-russia council . washington announced in january plans to extend its missile shield into europe to counter a potential missile attack from " rogue states " like iran , and possibly north korea . it would involve 10 missile interceptors without warheads set up in poland and a radar system in the czech republic to track any attack .
this would be linked to an advance warning system , probably in the caucasus .
russia says it sees no need for missile shield the move has ruffled feathers in russia , which is deeply concerned about its former cold war foe setting up military shop in its back yard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaap de hoop scheffer " we can not understand what eastern europe needs this system for , " first deputy prime minister sergei ivanov , a former russian defence minister , said thursday . washington has tried to ease russia 's concerns by suggesting possible areas of cooperation , including sharing early warning missile data , but ivanov appeared to reject the offer . " i honestly see no basis for speaking of possible cooperation , " he was quoted as saying by interfax news agency . scheffer aknowledged " a difference in threat perception " between the allies and russia .
" there is a clearly a divide , " he said . but us assistant secretary of state john rood , part of the senior three-man team charged with easing russia 's fears and european doubts , said that moscow still plans to weigh the proposals . " the representatives in the nato-russia council today ... indicated that the russian government was going to study our proposal in greater detail before providing a more full response , " he said . russian representative konstantin totsky conceded the offer had not been rejected yet , but he said that moscow has grown tired of being dictated to by washington . " the us colleagues give us their proposals , and then we give them our proposals and we can continue like this for years and call it a process of consultation , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans for a missile shield in europe have sparked controversy and concerns " i think we should have a transition from consultation to dialogue and i think we started this dialogue today , " he said , adding : " we will scrutinize these proposals and we will come back to our us colleagues . " he also expressed concern that the missile shield , set to come into operation around 2013 , would continue to grow . " we know from experience that when you have a system it keeps developing , it can not stop , " he warned .
rest of europe also concerned european allies are concerned about the system too , particularly that it would leave members bulgaria , greece , romania and turkey uncovered , and they insisted on the " indivisibility " of the alliance 's defenses . spokesman james appathurai said that nato also discussed " bolting on " its planned theater defense missile system - aimed at protecting troops in the field but still only in the testing phase - to the shield to cover the hole . in any case , talks are set to continue . ivanov and us defense secretary robert gates may discuss the plan during a moscow meeting next week , and the nato allies will take it up again when alliance foreign ministers hold talks in olso next thursday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato , russia hold high-level us missile shield talks the united states and its nato allies will on thursday hold their first high-level talks with russian officials aimed at easing moscow 's fears of us plans to build part of a missile shield in europe .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 19.04.2007 eu agrees on penalties for racism and xenophobia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new rules are only of a symbolic nature the european union thursday agreed on new rules to criminalize racism and xenophobia in the bloc , but said that the long-debated measures were mainly of symbolic nature . " racism and xenophobia can only be combatted effectively inside society , " german justice minister brigitte zypries told reporters after a meeting with her counterparts in luxembourg .
" criminal measures can only be supplementary , they can never be sufficient in combatting racism and xenophobia in itself , " said zypries whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
zypries said that the agreed piece of eu legislation , which is not legally binding for the bloc 's members , was an " important political signal " for the 27-nation union .
under the new rules , eu countries would set jail terms of at least one to three years for " publicly inciting to violence or hatred ... directed against a group of persons or a member of such a group defined by reference to race , color , religion , descent or national or ethnic origin . "
no minimum fines however , the legislation does not set any minimum fines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agreement does n't specify what constitutes incitement to violence it also leaves up to national courts to define what exactly constitutes incitement to violence or hatred .
there will also be no europe-wide ban on the use of nazi symbols .
raising awareness frattini said that the new rules would fully respect the freedom of expression .
" we are punishing concrete action , not any ideas , we are punishing incitement to hatred in a concrete way or encouraging other people to take concrete -lrb- xenophobic -rrb- action , " frattini said .
he said that the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , would try to raise awareness for the stalinist atrocities by organizing public debates " on the horrible crimes of the last century , ...
nazi crimes , stalinist crimes . "
however , the events still needed parliamentary approval in seven eu countries .
watered-down compromise the eu 's anti-racism rules - debated since 2001 - seemed at risk after latvia , lithuania and estonia had demanded making illegal the condoning , denial or trivialization of crimes against humanity committed under the soviet regime led by joseph stalin .
other eu states were opposed to the baltic demands , arguing that they did not legally recognize crimes committed under the stalinist regime or define major stalin atrocities as genocide .
zypries said the eu did not intend to decide on history but wanted to create public awareness for crimes against humanity .

" racism and xenophobia can only be combatted effectively inside society , " german justice minister brigitte zypries told reporters after a meeting with her counterparts in luxembourg .
" criminal measures can only be supplementary , they can never be sufficient in combatting racism and xenophobia in itself , " said zypries whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
zypries said that the agreed piece of eu legislation , which is not legally binding for the bloc 's members , was an " important political signal " for the 27-nation union .
under the new rules , eu countries would set jail terms of at least one to three years for " publicly inciting to violence or hatred ... directed against a group of persons or a member of such a group defined by reference to race , color , religion , descent or national or ethnic origin . "
no minimum fines however , the legislation does not set any minimum fines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agreement does n't specify what constitutes incitement to violence it also leaves up to national courts to define what exactly constitutes incitement to violence or hatred .
there will also be no europe-wide ban on the use of nazi symbols .
raising awareness frattini said that the new rules would fully respect the freedom of expression .
" we are punishing concrete action , not any ideas , we are punishing incitement to hatred in a concrete way or encouraging other people to take concrete -lrb- xenophobic -rrb- action , " frattini said .
he said that the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , would try to raise awareness for the stalinist atrocities by organizing public debates " on the horrible crimes of the last century , ...
nazi crimes , stalinist crimes . "
however , the events still needed parliamentary approval in seven eu countries .
watered-down compromise the eu 's anti-racism rules - debated since 2001 - seemed at risk after latvia , lithuania and estonia had demanded making illegal the condoning , denial or trivialization of crimes against humanity committed under the soviet regime led by joseph stalin .
other eu states were opposed to the baltic demands , arguing that they did not legally recognize crimes committed under the stalinist regime or define major stalin atrocities as genocide .
zypries said the eu did not intend to decide on history but wanted to create public awareness for crimes against humanity .

" the allies were convinced and are convinced that there are no implications of the united states ' system for the strategic balance , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said after the highest-level talks ever on the issue . " ten interceptors will not , can not affect the strategic balance and 10 interceptors can not pose a threat to russia , " he said , after meetings between the 26 nato allies followed by a so-called nato-russia council . washington announced in january plans to extend its missile shield into europe to counter a potential missile attack from " rogue states " like iran , and possibly north korea . it would involve 10 missile interceptors without warheads set up in poland and a radar system in the czech republic to track any attack .
this would be linked to an advance warning system , probably in the caucasus .
russia says it sees no need for missile shield the move has ruffled feathers in russia , which is deeply concerned about its former cold war foe setting up military shop in its back yard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaap de hoop scheffer " we can not understand what eastern europe needs this system for , " first deputy prime minister sergei ivanov , a former russian defence minister , said thursday . washington has tried to ease russia 's concerns by suggesting possible areas of cooperation , including sharing early warning missile data , but ivanov appeared to reject the offer . " i honestly see no basis for speaking of possible cooperation , " he was quoted as saying by interfax news agency . scheffer aknowledged " a difference in threat perception " between the allies and russia .
" there is a clearly a divide , " he said . but us assistant secretary of state john rood , part of the senior three-man team charged with easing russia 's fears and european doubts , said that moscow still plans to weigh the proposals . " the representatives in the nato-russia council today ... indicated that the russian government was going to study our proposal in greater detail before providing a more full response , " he said . russian representative konstantin totsky conceded the offer had not been rejected yet , but he said that moscow has grown tired of being dictated to by washington . " the us colleagues give us their proposals , and then we give them our proposals and we can continue like this for years and call it a process of consultation , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans for a missile shield in europe have sparked controversy and concerns " i think we should have a transition from consultation to dialogue and i think we started this dialogue today , " he said , adding : " we will scrutinize these proposals and we will come back to our us colleagues . " he also expressed concern that the missile shield , set to come into operation around 2013 , would continue to grow . " we know from experience that when you have a system it keeps developing , it can not stop , " he warned .
rest of europe also concerned european allies are concerned about the system too , particularly that it would leave members bulgaria , greece , romania and turkey uncovered , and they insisted on the " indivisibility " of the alliance 's defenses . spokesman james appathurai said that nato also discussed " bolting on " its planned theater defense missile system - aimed at protecting troops in the field but still only in the testing phase - to the shield to cover the hole . in any case , talks are set to continue . ivanov and us defense secretary robert gates may discuss the plan during a moscow meeting next week , and the nato allies will take it up again when alliance foreign ministers hold talks in olso next thursday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato , russia hold high-level us missile shield talks the united states and its nato allies will on thursday hold their first high-level talks with russian officials aimed at easing moscow 's fears of us plans to build part of a missile shield in europe .

five years later , there are fears in certain quarters that the national front candidate might pull off a similar feat and make it to the run-off for france 's highest office .
but there 's little chance of that happening , according to alain howiller , president of the institute of political studies in strasbourg .
" le pen wo n't make it to the second round this time , " he said .
frank baasner , director of the german-french institute echoed the view .

" racism and xenophobia can only be combatted effectively inside society , " german justice minister brigitte zypries told reporters after a meeting with her counterparts in luxembourg .
" criminal measures can only be supplementary , they can never be sufficient in combatting racism and xenophobia in itself , " said zypries whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
zypries said that the agreed piece of eu legislation , which is not legally binding for the bloc 's members , was an " important political signal " for the 27-nation union .
under the new rules , eu countries would set jail terms of at least one to three years for " publicly inciting to violence or hatred ... directed against a group of persons or a member of such a group defined by reference to race , color , religion , descent or national or ethnic origin . "
no minimum fines however , the legislation does not set any minimum fines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agreement does n't specify what constitutes incitement to violence it also leaves up to national courts to define what exactly constitutes incitement to violence or hatred .
there will also be no europe-wide ban on the use of nazi symbols .
raising awareness frattini said that the new rules would fully respect the freedom of expression .
" we are punishing concrete action , not any ideas , we are punishing incitement to hatred in a concrete way or encouraging other people to take concrete -lrb- xenophobic -rrb- action , " frattini said .
he said that the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , would try to raise awareness for the stalinist atrocities by organizing public debates " on the horrible crimes of the last century , ...
nazi crimes , stalinist crimes . "
however , the events still needed parliamentary approval in seven eu countries .
watered-down compromise the eu 's anti-racism rules - debated since 2001 - seemed at risk after latvia , lithuania and estonia had demanded making illegal the condoning , denial or trivialization of crimes against humanity committed under the soviet regime led by joseph stalin .
other eu states were opposed to the baltic demands , arguing that they did not legally recognize crimes committed under the stalinist regime or define major stalin atrocities as genocide .
zypries said the eu did not intend to decide on history but wanted to create public awareness for crimes against humanity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic states wanted stalin 's crimes to be put on a par with hitler 's germany views a common eu law on combating racism and xenophobia as a moral obligation .
the new rules which would also make denying the holocaust - the mass killing of jews by nazis and nazi supporters - a crime in the eu if the statement incites to violence or hatred , do not cover denying the massacre of armenians in world war i. turkey denies that the killing of up to one million armenians constituted genocide , putting their deaths down to ethnic strife , disease and famine , and has prosecuted historians and journalists for calling it genocide .
watchdogs criticize rules as weak under the rules , the denial of crimes of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes will be punishable in the eu if these crimes have been defined by international courts and if the statement incites to hatred or violence .
laws against denying the holocaust already exist in austria , belgium , france , germany and spain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 19.04.2007 french election campaign swerves to the right großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right politicians are trying to woo voters in the french suburbs as france prepares to go to the polls , even moderate candidates are trying to score points with right-wing slogans , while the real right-wingers are attempting to woo immigrants from the suburbs . far-right veteran jean-marie le pen stunned france in the presidential election in 2002 by clinching 16.9 percent of the vote in the first round and knocking then-socialist candidate lionel jospin out of the race .
five years later , there are fears in certain quarters that the national front candidate might pull off a similar feat and make it to the run-off for france 's highest office .
but there 's little chance of that happening , according to alain howiller , president of the institute of political studies in strasbourg .
" le pen wo n't make it to the second round this time , " he said .
frank baasner , director of the german-french institute echoed the view .
" experience shows these things do n't repeat themselves , " he said .
" national identity " as a vote-getter but campaign managers at former interior minister nicolas sarkozy 's conservative ump camp remain wary .
according to french satirical weekly canard enchaine , sarkozy 's aides reckon that le pen 's anti-immigrant national front could take as much as 20 percent of the vote .
daniela schwarzer , an expert on france at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin also said that le pen 's influence could not be written off .
" the national front 's voter potential is possibly higher than the surveys show it to be , " she told dw-world.de. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy sings the national anthem with kids at a party congress in paris sarkozy 's campaign managers seem convinced that the election will only be won on the right .
and as if to emphasize that point , their candidate has been focusing all his energies on the topic of national identity in the final days leading up to the first round of voting on sunday .
the conservative frontrunner has said that only those who speak french sufficiently well will be allowed to settle down permanently in france .
sarkozy has also backed quotas for immigrants and choosing them on the basis of professional qualifications .
he has said he would set up a " ministry for immigration and national identity " if he 's elected .
" france is embittered that its national identity is endangered by unlimited immigration , " sarokzy said recently .
that 's a classic ploy of the far right , according to alain howiller .
" those are ideas that le pen has been propagating for 25 years , " he said .
royal shows nationalist streak and it 's not just sarkozy angling for votes from the far right .
even sarkozy 's socialist challenger , segolene royal , has displayed a strong nationalist streak in recent weeks .
at a campaign rally two weeks ago , royal urged her supporters for the first time to sing the national anthem .
over the weekend , royal stepped up her new-found nationalist drive by urging all french to have a french flag at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal has shown a nationalist streak in recent weeks experts , such as daniela schwarzer , worry that the " irresponsible " way royal and sarkozy have been flirting with the topic of national identity could have serious long-terms political consequences .

five years later , there are fears in certain quarters that the national front candidate might pull off a similar feat and make it to the run-off for france 's highest office .
but there 's little chance of that happening , according to alain howiller , president of the institute of political studies in strasbourg .
" le pen wo n't make it to the second round this time , " he said .
frank baasner , director of the german-french institute echoed the view .
" experience shows these things do n't repeat themselves , " he said .
" national identity " as a vote-getter but campaign managers at former interior minister nicolas sarkozy 's conservative ump camp remain wary .
according to french satirical weekly canard enchaine , sarkozy 's aides reckon that le pen 's anti-immigrant national front could take as much as 20 percent of the vote .
daniela schwarzer , an expert on france at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin also said that le pen 's influence could not be written off .
" the national front 's voter potential is possibly higher than the surveys show it to be , " she told dw-world.de. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy sings the national anthem with kids at a party congress in paris sarkozy 's campaign managers seem convinced that the election will only be won on the right .
and as if to emphasize that point , their candidate has been focusing all his energies on the topic of national identity in the final days leading up to the first round of voting on sunday .
the conservative frontrunner has said that only those who speak french sufficiently well will be allowed to settle down permanently in france .
sarkozy has also backed quotas for immigrants and choosing them on the basis of professional qualifications .
he has said he would set up a " ministry for immigration and national identity " if he 's elected .
" france is embittered that its national identity is endangered by unlimited immigration , " sarokzy said recently .
that 's a classic ploy of the far right , according to alain howiller .
" those are ideas that le pen has been propagating for 25 years , " he said .
royal shows nationalist streak and it 's not just sarkozy angling for votes from the far right .
even sarkozy 's socialist challenger , segolene royal , has displayed a strong nationalist streak in recent weeks .
at a campaign rally two weeks ago , royal urged her supporters for the first time to sing the national anthem .
over the weekend , royal stepped up her new-found nationalist drive by urging all french to have a french flag at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal has shown a nationalist streak in recent weeks experts , such as daniela schwarzer , worry that the " irresponsible " way royal and sarkozy have been flirting with the topic of national identity could have serious long-terms political consequences .
" if the whole discussion in a left-wing party like the ps -lrb- the socialist party -rrb- and a moderate right-wing party such as the ump leans so strongly towards the far-right fringe then it changes the whole atmosphere in society , " schwarzer said .
" then even openly xenophobic slogans do n't horrify anymore . "

" the allies were convinced and are convinced that there are no implications of the united states ' system for the strategic balance , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said after the highest-level talks ever on the issue . " ten interceptors will not , can not affect the strategic balance and 10 interceptors can not pose a threat to russia , " he said , after meetings between the 26 nato allies followed by a so-called nato-russia council . washington announced in january plans to extend its missile shield into europe to counter a potential missile attack from " rogue states " like iran , and possibly north korea . it would involve 10 missile interceptors without warheads set up in poland and a radar system in the czech republic to track any attack .

" the representatives in the nato-russia council today ... indicated that the russian government was going to study our proposal in greater detail before providing a more full response , " he said . russian representative konstantin totsky conceded the offer had not been rejected yet , but he said that moscow has grown tired of being dictated to by washington . " the us colleagues give us their proposals , and then we give them our proposals and we can continue like this for years and call it a process of consultation , " he said .

they have to get their stadiums , transport systems and hotels up to scratch and overcome a legacy of hooliganism and corruption . a day after poland and ukraine scored a shock win over italy and fellow joint bidders hungary and croatia in the race to clinch the major soccer tournament - which takes place every four years - the enormity of the task facing the two host nations was beginning to sink in .
they will need nothing short of a herculean construction and investor drive to build stadium , hotels and other infrastructure .
in addition , security worries , hooliganism and corruption remain nagging problems .
organizers and politicians , however , insist they will roll up their sleeves in order to ensure the success of the soccer championships .
poland tries to calm jitters in the lead up to wednesday 's decision by european soccer 's governing body , uefa , at a meeting in cardiff , the polish-ukrainian bidders tried to calm jitters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president yushchenko -lrb- r . -rrb- and polish president kaczynski polish president lech kaczynski who traveled to the welsh capital with ukrainian president viktor yushchenko to make an 11th-hour pitch for their bid , said there was much work to be done .
" we must not forget the enormity of the task of organizing euro 2012 , but that is also excellent news for poland , " kaczynski said .
" there will be new stadiums built in warsaw , gdansk , wroclaw and poznan .
that can only be seen in a positive light , " he added .
" five years is long enough and i am sure that with the mobilization and determination of the local authorities and the people , we will succeed . "
it will be the first time that either poland or ukraine will host a major soccer championship .
it 's the third major sporting event , following the beijing olympic games in 2008 and the soccer world cup in south africa in 2010 , to break away from the traditional grounds of western europe and the americas .
infrastructure in need of massive overhaul polish authorities said last week that around 26 billion euros -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- , including eu financing , have been earmarked to upgrade infrastructure .
fans will need every bit of it .
anyone wanting to travel by road from gdansk in northern poland to donetsk , a host city in eastern ukraine , has to traverse 2,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,240 miles -rrb- .
the 22-hour car or bus trip - not counting the lengthy wait at the polish-ukrainian border - is mostly on single lane roads .
only 23 kilometers -lrb- 14 miles -rrb- of the trip is on motorway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the few four-lane motorways in poland , near the ukraine border despite receiving vast eu funding since the fall of communism in 1989 and becoming a member of the bloc in 2004 , poland still has n't built a basic motorway network connecting its major cities .
the situation is worse in ukraine .
there , train travel is hardly better : it currently takes 43 hours , at best , to get from gdansk to donetsk .
lack of investment means it is too dangerous to use high speed trains on the aging tracks .
while booming low-cost airlines carry hundreds of thousands of poles between their homes and western europe each year , there are still no cheap links between ukraine and poland .
outside major cities , particularly in ukraine , good hotels are hard to come by - or at least in sufficient numbers to cater to tens of thousands of fans , journalists and soccer officials .
hooliganism , right wing crimes raise concerns polish soccer is also blighted by hooliganism .
fears that polish fans would cause trouble at last year 's world cup in neighboring germany led to a massive police operation in both countries , although in the end the hooligans stayed away .
in addition , polish soccer 's image has been dented by corruption .
a two-year-old match-fixing scandal has led to more than 60 arrests , including several referees , a member of the polish soccer association -lrb- pzpn -rrb- leadership and a string of club officials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hooliganism continues to blight polish soccer on thursday , polish sports minister tomasz lipiec vowed to make polish soccer graft-free by the time of the euro 2012 .
" we want to sort this problem out completely by 2012 .
i 'm convinced that we will manage it even earlier , " lipiec said .
" the championships must take place in an atmosphere of fair play . "
ukraine will also have to do more to improve security for foreign fans .
foreign embassies regularly warn their citizens about the risk of attacks by skinheads in the country .
poland , too , has a flourishing far-right scene .
" good news for ukrainians " despite the huge problems , kiev remains confident that it can manage to surmount most challenges .
indeed , there are signs that the country is already gearing up to tackle the gargantuan task .
although kiev is currently locked in political crisis pitting supporters of the president and prime minister against each other , the two sides are united about euro 2012 .
four ukrainian cities selected as venues have already started preparations including upgrading their existing soccer facilities .
and the kiev mayor 's office has said the capital would completely renovate its 86,000-seat olympic stadium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is confident that investors will step in to build much needed stadiums in the west of the country , lviv city authorities have said they will renovate the city 's 28,000-seat stadium and increase its capacity .
ukraine 's reigning champions , shakhtar donetsk , are currently building a new 50,000-seat ground , while dnepropetrovsk , who finished sixth last season , had also began the construction of a new arena in their town .
ukraine 's sports minister , viktor korzh , said major investors were ready to step in alongside the authorities .
" there are serious investors , who are ready to invest up to 37 billion hryvnias -lrb- about 5.7 billion euros , $ 7.7 billion -rrb- in the construction of airports , roads , hotels and improving sports infrastructure , " he said .
roman shpek , ukraine 's ambassador to the european union , said the decision to allow ukraine to be co-host of the euro 2012 could not be underestimated .
" it is one more step toward ukraine 's integration to the eu , " shpek told the international herald tribune .

they have to get their stadiums , transport systems and hotels up to scratch and overcome a legacy of hooliganism and corruption . a day after poland and ukraine scored a shock win over italy and fellow joint bidders hungary and croatia in the race to clinch the major soccer tournament - which takes place every four years - the enormity of the task facing the two host nations was beginning to sink in .
they will need nothing short of a herculean construction and investor drive to build stadium , hotels and other infrastructure .
in addition , security worries , hooliganism and corruption remain nagging problems .
organizers and politicians , however , insist they will roll up their sleeves in order to ensure the success of the soccer championships .
poland tries to calm jitters in the lead up to wednesday 's decision by european soccer 's governing body , uefa , at a meeting in cardiff , the polish-ukrainian bidders tried to calm jitters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president yushchenko -lrb- r . -rrb- and polish president kaczynski polish president lech kaczynski who traveled to the welsh capital with ukrainian president viktor yushchenko to make an 11th-hour pitch for their bid , said there was much work to be done .
" we must not forget the enormity of the task of organizing euro 2012 , but that is also excellent news for poland , " kaczynski said .
" there will be new stadiums built in warsaw , gdansk , wroclaw and poznan .
that can only be seen in a positive light , " he added .
" five years is long enough and i am sure that with the mobilization and determination of the local authorities and the people , we will succeed . "
it will be the first time that either poland or ukraine will host a major soccer championship .
it 's the third major sporting event , following the beijing olympic games in 2008 and the soccer world cup in south africa in 2010 , to break away from the traditional grounds of western europe and the americas .
infrastructure in need of massive overhaul polish authorities said last week that around 26 billion euros -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- , including eu financing , have been earmarked to upgrade infrastructure .
fans will need every bit of it .
anyone wanting to travel by road from gdansk in northern poland to donetsk , a host city in eastern ukraine , has to traverse 2,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,240 miles -rrb- .
the 22-hour car or bus trip - not counting the lengthy wait at the polish-ukrainian border - is mostly on single lane roads .
only 23 kilometers -lrb- 14 miles -rrb- of the trip is on motorway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the few four-lane motorways in poland , near the ukraine border despite receiving vast eu funding since the fall of communism in 1989 and becoming a member of the bloc in 2004 , poland still has n't built a basic motorway network connecting its major cities .
the situation is worse in ukraine .
there , train travel is hardly better : it currently takes 43 hours , at best , to get from gdansk to donetsk .
lack of investment means it is too dangerous to use high speed trains on the aging tracks .
while booming low-cost airlines carry hundreds of thousands of poles between their homes and western europe each year , there are still no cheap links between ukraine and poland .
outside major cities , particularly in ukraine , good hotels are hard to come by - or at least in sufficient numbers to cater to tens of thousands of fans , journalists and soccer officials .
hooliganism , right wing crimes raise concerns polish soccer is also blighted by hooliganism .
fears that polish fans would cause trouble at last year 's world cup in neighboring germany led to a massive police operation in both countries , although in the end the hooligans stayed away .
in addition , polish soccer 's image has been dented by corruption .
a two-year-old match-fixing scandal has led to more than 60 arrests , including several referees , a member of the polish soccer association -lrb- pzpn -rrb- leadership and a string of club officials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hooliganism continues to blight polish soccer on thursday , polish sports minister tomasz lipiec vowed to make polish soccer graft-free by the time of the euro 2012 .
" we want to sort this problem out completely by 2012 .
i 'm convinced that we will manage it even earlier , " lipiec said .
" the championships must take place in an atmosphere of fair play . "
ukraine will also have to do more to improve security for foreign fans .
foreign embassies regularly warn their citizens about the risk of attacks by skinheads in the country .
poland , too , has a flourishing far-right scene .
" good news for ukrainians " despite the huge problems , kiev remains confident that it can manage to surmount most challenges .
indeed , there are signs that the country is already gearing up to tackle the gargantuan task .
although kiev is currently locked in political crisis pitting supporters of the president and prime minister against each other , the two sides are united about euro 2012 .
four ukrainian cities selected as venues have already started preparations including upgrading their existing soccer facilities .
and the kiev mayor 's office has said the capital would completely renovate its 86,000-seat olympic stadium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is confident that investors will step in to build much needed stadiums in the west of the country , lviv city authorities have said they will renovate the city 's 28,000-seat stadium and increase its capacity .
ukraine 's reigning champions , shakhtar donetsk , are currently building a new 50,000-seat ground , while dnepropetrovsk , who finished sixth last season , had also began the construction of a new arena in their town .
ukraine 's sports minister , viktor korzh , said major investors were ready to step in alongside the authorities .
" there are serious investors , who are ready to invest up to 37 billion hryvnias -lrb- about 5.7 billion euros , $ 7.7 billion -rrb- in the construction of airports , roads , hotels and improving sports infrastructure , " he said .
roman shpek , ukraine 's ambassador to the european union , said the decision to allow ukraine to be co-host of the euro 2012 could not be underestimated .
" it is one more step toward ukraine 's integration to the eu , " shpek told the international herald tribune .

" the allies were convinced and are convinced that there are no implications of the united states ' system for the strategic balance , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said after the highest-level talks ever on the issue . " ten interceptors will not , can not affect the strategic balance and 10 interceptors can not pose a threat to russia , " he said , after meetings between the 26 nato allies followed by a so-called nato-russia council . washington announced in january plans to extend its missile shield into europe to counter a potential missile attack from " rogue states " like iran , and possibly north korea . it would involve 10 missile interceptors without warheads set up in poland and a radar system in the czech republic to track any attack .
this would be linked to an advance warning system , probably in the caucasus .
russia says it sees no need for missile shield the move has ruffled feathers in russia , which is deeply concerned about its former cold war foe setting up military shop in its back yard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaap de hoop scheffer " we can not understand what eastern europe needs this system for , " first deputy prime minister sergei ivanov , a former russian defence minister , said thursday . washington has tried to ease russia 's concerns by suggesting possible areas of cooperation , including sharing early warning missile data , but ivanov appeared to reject the offer . " i honestly see no basis for speaking of possible cooperation , " he was quoted as saying by interfax news agency . scheffer aknowledged " a difference in threat perception " between the allies and russia .
" there is a clearly a divide , " he said . but us assistant secretary of state john rood , part of the senior three-man team charged with easing russia 's fears and european doubts , said that moscow still plans to weigh the proposals . " the representatives in the nato-russia council today ... indicated that the russian government was going to study our proposal in greater detail before providing a more full response , " he said . russian representative konstantin totsky conceded the offer had not been rejected yet , but he said that moscow has grown tired of being dictated to by washington . " the us colleagues give us their proposals , and then we give them our proposals and we can continue like this for years and call it a process of consultation , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans for a missile shield in europe have sparked controversy and concerns " i think we should have a transition from consultation to dialogue and i think we started this dialogue today , " he said , adding : " we will scrutinize these proposals and we will come back to our us colleagues . " he also expressed concern that the missile shield , set to come into operation around 2013 , would continue to grow . " we know from experience that when you have a system it keeps developing , it can not stop , " he warned .
rest of europe also concerned european allies are concerned about the system too , particularly that it would leave members bulgaria , greece , romania and turkey uncovered , and they insisted on the " indivisibility " of the alliance 's defenses . spokesman james appathurai said that nato also discussed " bolting on " its planned theater defense missile system - aimed at protecting troops in the field but still only in the testing phase - to the shield to cover the hole . in any case , talks are set to continue . ivanov and us defense secretary robert gates may discuss the plan during a moscow meeting next week , and the nato allies will take it up again when alliance foreign ministers hold talks in olso next thursday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato , russia hold high-level us missile shield talks the united states and its nato allies will on thursday hold their first high-level talks with russian officials aimed at easing moscow 's fears of us plans to build part of a missile shield in europe .

they have to get their stadiums , transport systems and hotels up to scratch and overcome a legacy of hooliganism and corruption . a day after poland and ukraine scored a shock win over italy and fellow joint bidders hungary and croatia in the race to clinch the major soccer tournament - which takes place every four years - the enormity of the task facing the two host nations was beginning to sink in .
they will need nothing short of a herculean construction and investor drive to build stadium , hotels and other infrastructure .
in addition , security worries , hooliganism and corruption remain nagging problems .
organizers and politicians , however , insist they will roll up their sleeves in order to ensure the success of the soccer championships .
poland tries to calm jitters in the lead up to wednesday 's decision by european soccer 's governing body , uefa , at a meeting in cardiff , the polish-ukrainian bidders tried to calm jitters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president yushchenko -lrb- r . -rrb- and polish president kaczynski polish president lech kaczynski who traveled to the welsh capital with ukrainian president viktor yushchenko to make an 11th-hour pitch for their bid , said there was much work to be done .
" we must not forget the enormity of the task of organizing euro 2012 , but that is also excellent news for poland , " kaczynski said .
" there will be new stadiums built in warsaw , gdansk , wroclaw and poznan .
that can only be seen in a positive light , " he added .
" five years is long enough and i am sure that with the mobilization and determination of the local authorities and the people , we will succeed . "
it will be the first time that either poland or ukraine will host a major soccer championship .
it 's the third major sporting event , following the beijing olympic games in 2008 and the soccer world cup in south africa in 2010 , to break away from the traditional grounds of western europe and the americas .
infrastructure in need of massive overhaul polish authorities said last week that around 26 billion euros -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- , including eu financing , have been earmarked to upgrade infrastructure .
fans will need every bit of it .
anyone wanting to travel by road from gdansk in northern poland to donetsk , a host city in eastern ukraine , has to traverse 2,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,240 miles -rrb- .
the 22-hour car or bus trip - not counting the lengthy wait at the polish-ukrainian border - is mostly on single lane roads .
only 23 kilometers -lrb- 14 miles -rrb- of the trip is on motorway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the few four-lane motorways in poland , near the ukraine border despite receiving vast eu funding since the fall of communism in 1989 and becoming a member of the bloc in 2004 , poland still has n't built a basic motorway network connecting its major cities .
the situation is worse in ukraine .
there , train travel is hardly better : it currently takes 43 hours , at best , to get from gdansk to donetsk .
lack of investment means it is too dangerous to use high speed trains on the aging tracks .
while booming low-cost airlines carry hundreds of thousands of poles between their homes and western europe each year , there are still no cheap links between ukraine and poland .
outside major cities , particularly in ukraine , good hotels are hard to come by - or at least in sufficient numbers to cater to tens of thousands of fans , journalists and soccer officials .
hooliganism , right wing crimes raise concerns polish soccer is also blighted by hooliganism .
fears that polish fans would cause trouble at last year 's world cup in neighboring germany led to a massive police operation in both countries , although in the end the hooligans stayed away .
in addition , polish soccer 's image has been dented by corruption .
a two-year-old match-fixing scandal has led to more than 60 arrests , including several referees , a member of the polish soccer association -lrb- pzpn -rrb- leadership and a string of club officials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hooliganism continues to blight polish soccer on thursday , polish sports minister tomasz lipiec vowed to make polish soccer graft-free by the time of the euro 2012 .
" we want to sort this problem out completely by 2012 .
i 'm convinced that we will manage it even earlier , " lipiec said .
" the championships must take place in an atmosphere of fair play . "
ukraine will also have to do more to improve security for foreign fans .
foreign embassies regularly warn their citizens about the risk of attacks by skinheads in the country .
poland , too , has a flourishing far-right scene .
" good news for ukrainians " despite the huge problems , kiev remains confident that it can manage to surmount most challenges .
indeed , there are signs that the country is already gearing up to tackle the gargantuan task .
although kiev is currently locked in political crisis pitting supporters of the president and prime minister against each other , the two sides are united about euro 2012 .
four ukrainian cities selected as venues have already started preparations including upgrading their existing soccer facilities .
and the kiev mayor 's office has said the capital would completely renovate its 86,000-seat olympic stadium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is confident that investors will step in to build much needed stadiums in the west of the country , lviv city authorities have said they will renovate the city 's 28,000-seat stadium and increase its capacity .
ukraine 's reigning champions , shakhtar donetsk , are currently building a new 50,000-seat ground , while dnepropetrovsk , who finished sixth last season , had also began the construction of a new arena in their town .
ukraine 's sports minister , viktor korzh , said major investors were ready to step in alongside the authorities .
" there are serious investors , who are ready to invest up to 37 billion hryvnias -lrb- about 5.7 billion euros , $ 7.7 billion -rrb- in the construction of airports , roads , hotels and improving sports infrastructure , " he said .
roman shpek , ukraine 's ambassador to the european union , said the decision to allow ukraine to be co-host of the euro 2012 could not be underestimated .
" it is one more step toward ukraine 's integration to the eu , " shpek told the international herald tribune .

" the current upturn will continue , but the pace of expansion will be slower than last year , " the institutes said .
" a key reason for this is restrictive fiscal policy , which is likely to knock around half a percentage point of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth .
and the european central bank , too , is switching to neutral in its monetary policy . " optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economic institutes hiked their projections for 2007 and 2008 the five institutes - diw in berlin , ifo in munich , ifw in kiel , ihw in halle and rwi in essen - expected the ecb to raise its benchmark " refi " refinancing rate by a further 0.25 percent this summer to 4.0 percent . nevertheless , the tighter monetary conditions would not hamper " robust economic expansion , since long-term interest rates remain comparatively low , " the report said . contributing to gdp growth of 2.4 percent this year - in their previous report last autumn , the institutes had projected growth of 1.4 percent for 2007 - would be strong domestic demand , the institutes said . " household consumption will gradually improve as result of higher disposable income , " the think tanks predicted .
" investment remains strong .
and exports will continue to support the economy . " reduced unemployment the strong economic performance would lead to an improvement on the labor market , with the annual average jobless total set to fall below four million for the first time since 2001 . the jobless total would fall to 3.77 million in 2007 from 4.49 million in 2006 and then decline to further to 3.47 million in 2008 , the institutes said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of people out of work may fall by some 700,000 the jobless rate , which measures the total number of unemployed as a proportion of the working population as a whole , was projected to decline from 10.3 percent in 2006 to 8.7 percent in 2007 and 8.0 percent in 2008 . the robust economy would also have a positive effect on german debts , pushing the public deficit down from 1.7 percent of gdp in 2006 to just 0.6 percent of gdp in 2007 .
germany was expected to achieve a balanced budget , or a deficit ratio of zero , in 2008 , according to the report . under the terms of the european stability and growth pact , eurozone members are not allowed to run up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp . but germany , the main architect of the pact , was in breach of the 3.0-percent rule every year between 2002 and 2005 . on the inflation front , german inflation was projected to pick up only fractionally to 1.8 percent in both 2007 and 2008 from 1.7 percent in 2006 , the institutes said . the ecb defines price stability as inflation rates close to but just below 2.0 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de optimism grows on outlook for german economy the run of good news for the german economy , europe 's biggest , looks set to continue for some time , with bundesbank president axel weber arguing on monday that current growth marks only the beginning of a longer upturn .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.04.2007 german jobseekers plumb volunteerism 's possibilities großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : offering a helping hand to others may be helpful to one 's own career unlike the us , germany does not have a highly developed culture of volunteerism .
but with state coffers increasingly empty and a continually tight job market , observers say unpaid work can have hidden benefits . in the us , volunteering is widespread - a credo promoted at home and in schools , and even as pseudo-governmental doctrine .
from tutoring in after school programs , to working as an aide in a hospital , to helping build houses for the poor - americans have long been schooled in the importance of " giving back to community . " but since its postwar economic boom , germany has used its tax base wealth to provide for the needy and offer its citizens singularly generous social benefits .
volunteer work was mainly done by charitable religious groups , or young men exempted from military service , fulfilling an obligatory year of civil service . increasingly , though , young people going onto the job market are discovering the side benefits that can be reaped from a volunteer stint .
such experience can help develop the highly touted " soft skills " that are increasingly in demand in the business world , observers say . after all , anyone can call themselves a " team player , " but a well-chosen , unpaid job may give them the chance to actually prove they are one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in german statistics , sports activities are often counted as " volunteer work " " for people looking for their first job , working as a volunteer is a great advantage , " said sascha theisen , the spokesman for stepstone.de , an employment-recruiting internet portal that advises people at all stages of their career .
" it gives them the chance to gain experience , for instance in leading a project , or solving problems or managing people . " it also means they could come to the job with a network already in place of people who would be good contacts later on down the road , " he added . too much of a good thing ? but theisen warned that people who are already in the middle of their careers should be careful not to overdo it .
german employers would only really smile upon someone involved in an activity that might be beneficial to business : taking an active role in a professional association , for instance . " if someone is busy leading several sports clubs and on top of that they sing in a choir , you have to ask yourself , are they going to have enough time for their job ? "
theisen asked . christoph lender saw the benefits of volunteering first hand .
by his own account , the half-dozen years he spent leading catholic youth groups helped give him just those skills required by his first employer , a bank .
at the job interview , they discussed the work he had done coordinating events , leading discussions and meetings , and being an authority figure for 10 to 15 kids every week . " it 's a signal for a company , that in addition to your studies and any internships you do , that you also took time for other things , and were socially engaged , " lender said .
" it speaks for how you choose to spend your time . " job boost a ' byproduct ' but lender stressed that his motivation for taking up volunteer work was not some calculated attempt to improve his chances on the job market . " i did it for my own personal development , " he said .
" the good experience with the job was just a byproduct of that . " german software giant sap 's hiring approach also supports lender 's experience . spokesperson alla ruggaber-mast said the company looks for people who are motivated and independent , with highly developed " soft skills " in communication , problem solving , and conflict resolution .
but while the firm " welcomes candidates who are socially engaged , that is not a decisive factor in hiring . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a voluntary civil service year , often in old age homes , means a military exemption according to the latest german government survey on volunteerism from 2004 , some 36 percent of germans claim volunteer responsibilities , up from 34 percent five years earlier . but that high number includes such volunteer jobs as taking an active role in a sports club or cultural institute .
the figure for " social " volunteerism - such as leading a youth group - was at 5.5 percent in 2004 , up from 4 percent in 1999 . there are historical reasons that relatively few germans take on social volunteer jobs , said werner lindwehr , a spokesman for the agency for self-help and volunteering in the city of osnabrück , in the state of lower saxony . " directly after the war , volunteerism was part of society , out of necessity , " lindwehr said .
" people helped one another . " later , the state took over many of those responsibilities . " and it may be that germans started just sitting back and saying , ' i 'll let the state take care of it , " ' he acknowledged . difference to usa today , however , he sees a movement toward citizens taking a more active role .
a " culture of volunteerism " is , indeed , developing in germany , he said . " people want to do more than just vote every four years , " lindwehr said .
" they want to do something on their own doorstep , and they see that they are taken seriously by the government . " but volunteerism in germany will never have the same status as in the us , where it fills a quasi-governmental function , he added . " you ca n't compare the volunteerism with usa and here , " he said .
" the us has a much worse social system .
in my opinion , they have more need , and thus more organization . " in germany , lindwehr argued , volunteerism will grow , but it will have a more " political " character , with volunteers and governments forming a sort of bridge to get things done .
for instance , he said , people are becoming increasingly active in local citizens ' initiatives . not everyone likes it an example is a group of people who decide their playground needs renovation , but the town says there is no funding for it .
so the local government will act as a go between , and find a carpenter who is willing to donate wood , or people to help manage the construction . despite these examples , volunteerism in germany is far from being accepted as purely beneficial .
debates occasionally flare up over the usefulness of the civil-service year , and there are those who decry the notion of unpaid work at all , saying it steals jobs from people who need them . meanwhile , christoph lender said that from where he stands , he has seen little evidence that the country will be overrun by volunteers any time soon . " among my friends , i guess you would say i am one of the more socially engaged , " lender said .
" young people have a lot of other things to do - with sports , going out , the internet … everyone has to decide how they want to spend their time .

five years later , there are fears in certain quarters that the national front candidate might pull off a similar feat and make it to the run-off for france 's highest office .
but there 's little chance of that happening , according to alain howiller , president of the institute of political studies in strasbourg .
" le pen wo n't make it to the second round this time , " he said .
frank baasner , director of the german-french institute echoed the view .
" experience shows these things do n't repeat themselves , " he said .
" national identity " as a vote-getter but campaign managers at former interior minister nicolas sarkozy 's conservative ump camp remain wary .
according to french satirical weekly canard enchaine , sarkozy 's aides reckon that le pen 's anti-immigrant national front could take as much as 20 percent of the vote .
daniela schwarzer , an expert on france at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin also said that le pen 's influence could not be written off .
" the national front 's voter potential is possibly higher than the surveys show it to be , " she told dw-world.de. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy sings the national anthem with kids at a party congress in paris sarkozy 's campaign managers seem convinced that the election will only be won on the right .
and as if to emphasize that point , their candidate has been focusing all his energies on the topic of national identity in the final days leading up to the first round of voting on sunday .
the conservative frontrunner has said that only those who speak french sufficiently well will be allowed to settle down permanently in france .
sarkozy has also backed quotas for immigrants and choosing them on the basis of professional qualifications .
he has said he would set up a " ministry for immigration and national identity " if he 's elected .
" france is embittered that its national identity is endangered by unlimited immigration , " sarokzy said recently .
that 's a classic ploy of the far right , according to alain howiller .
" those are ideas that le pen has been propagating for 25 years , " he said .
royal shows nationalist streak and it 's not just sarkozy angling for votes from the far right .
even sarkozy 's socialist challenger , segolene royal , has displayed a strong nationalist streak in recent weeks .
at a campaign rally two weeks ago , royal urged her supporters for the first time to sing the national anthem .
over the weekend , royal stepped up her new-found nationalist drive by urging all french to have a french flag at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal has shown a nationalist streak in recent weeks experts , such as daniela schwarzer , worry that the " irresponsible " way royal and sarkozy have been flirting with the topic of national identity could have serious long-terms political consequences .
" if the whole discussion in a left-wing party like the ps -lrb- the socialist party -rrb- and a moderate right-wing party such as the ump leans so strongly towards the far-right fringe then it changes the whole atmosphere in society , " schwarzer said .
" then even openly xenophobic slogans do n't horrify anymore . "
le pen in unfamiliar territory sarkozy and royal 's right-wing dabbling may end up benefiting le pen , not just in the long term , but also more immediately .
the veteran politician has said he 's " happy " about the right tilt the election campaign in france has taken so far .
" that 's because it shows all the french that i 'm right , " le pen said recently .
the front national candidate has been charting unfamiliar territory during his campaign this time .
in a bid to stay relevant in the fight for both frustrated voters on the far right as well as protest voters , the 78-year-old has a young women , apparently from north africa , advertise for him on posters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-marie le pen is fishing for votes in unfamiliar waters le pen has also been campaigning in the depressed suburbs with the slogan : " neither friend , nor black , white nor north african - french ! "

" racism and xenophobia can only be combatted effectively inside society , " german justice minister brigitte zypries told reporters after a meeting with her counterparts in luxembourg .
" criminal measures can only be supplementary , they can never be sufficient in combatting racism and xenophobia in itself , " said zypries whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
zypries said that the agreed piece of eu legislation , which is not legally binding for the bloc 's members , was an " important political signal " for the 27-nation union .
under the new rules , eu countries would set jail terms of at least one to three years for " publicly inciting to violence or hatred ... directed against a group of persons or a member of such a group defined by reference to race , color , religion , descent or national or ethnic origin . "
no minimum fines however , the legislation does not set any minimum fines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agreement does n't specify what constitutes incitement to violence it also leaves up to national courts to define what exactly constitutes incitement to violence or hatred .
there will also be no europe-wide ban on the use of nazi symbols .
raising awareness frattini said that the new rules would fully respect the freedom of expression .
" we are punishing concrete action , not any ideas , we are punishing incitement to hatred in a concrete way or encouraging other people to take concrete -lrb- xenophobic -rrb- action , " frattini said .
he said that the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , would try to raise awareness for the stalinist atrocities by organizing public debates " on the horrible crimes of the last century , ...
nazi crimes , stalinist crimes . "
however , the events still needed parliamentary approval in seven eu countries .
watered-down compromise the eu 's anti-racism rules - debated since 2001 - seemed at risk after latvia , lithuania and estonia had demanded making illegal the condoning , denial or trivialization of crimes against humanity committed under the soviet regime led by joseph stalin .
other eu states were opposed to the baltic demands , arguing that they did not legally recognize crimes committed under the stalinist regime or define major stalin atrocities as genocide .
zypries said the eu did not intend to decide on history but wanted to create public awareness for crimes against humanity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic states wanted stalin 's crimes to be put on a par with hitler 's germany views a common eu law on combating racism and xenophobia as a moral obligation .
the new rules which would also make denying the holocaust - the mass killing of jews by nazis and nazi supporters - a crime in the eu if the statement incites to violence or hatred , do not cover denying the massacre of armenians in world war i. turkey denies that the killing of up to one million armenians constituted genocide , putting their deaths down to ethnic strife , disease and famine , and has prosecuted historians and journalists for calling it genocide .
watchdogs criticize rules as weak under the rules , the denial of crimes of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes will be punishable in the eu if these crimes have been defined by international courts and if the statement incites to hatred or violence .
laws against denying the holocaust already exist in austria , belgium , france , germany and spain .

" racism and xenophobia can only be combatted effectively inside society , " german justice minister brigitte zypries told reporters after a meeting with her counterparts in luxembourg .
" criminal measures can only be supplementary , they can never be sufficient in combatting racism and xenophobia in itself , " said zypries whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
zypries said that the agreed piece of eu legislation , which is not legally binding for the bloc 's members , was an " important political signal " for the 27-nation union .
under the new rules , eu countries would set jail terms of at least one to three years for " publicly inciting to violence or hatred ... directed against a group of persons or a member of such a group defined by reference to race , color , religion , descent or national or ethnic origin . "
no minimum fines however , the legislation does not set any minimum fines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agreement does n't specify what constitutes incitement to violence it also leaves up to national courts to define what exactly constitutes incitement to violence or hatred .
there will also be no europe-wide ban on the use of nazi symbols .
raising awareness frattini said that the new rules would fully respect the freedom of expression .
" we are punishing concrete action , not any ideas , we are punishing incitement to hatred in a concrete way or encouraging other people to take concrete -lrb- xenophobic -rrb- action , " frattini said .
he said that the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , would try to raise awareness for the stalinist atrocities by organizing public debates " on the horrible crimes of the last century , ...
nazi crimes , stalinist crimes . "
however , the events still needed parliamentary approval in seven eu countries .
watered-down compromise the eu 's anti-racism rules - debated since 2001 - seemed at risk after latvia , lithuania and estonia had demanded making illegal the condoning , denial or trivialization of crimes against humanity committed under the soviet regime led by joseph stalin .
other eu states were opposed to the baltic demands , arguing that they did not legally recognize crimes committed under the stalinist regime or define major stalin atrocities as genocide .
zypries said the eu did not intend to decide on history but wanted to create public awareness for crimes against humanity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic states wanted stalin 's crimes to be put on a par with hitler 's germany views a common eu law on combating racism and xenophobia as a moral obligation .
the new rules which would also make denying the holocaust - the mass killing of jews by nazis and nazi supporters - a crime in the eu if the statement incites to violence or hatred , do not cover denying the massacre of armenians in world war i. turkey denies that the killing of up to one million armenians constituted genocide , putting their deaths down to ethnic strife , disease and famine , and has prosecuted historians and journalists for calling it genocide .
watchdogs criticize rules as weak under the rules , the denial of crimes of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes will be punishable in the eu if these crimes have been defined by international courts and if the statement incites to hatred or violence .
laws against denying the holocaust already exist in austria , belgium , france , germany and spain .

" it 's only the beginning of a first real exchange of views , " one diplomat told afp on condition of anonymity , adding that " it is too early to expect any decisions . " " thursday 's meetings could help restore confidence among us , particularly with russia , but also ease german concerns , " the diplomat said . but he warned : " if things have n't cooled down after these meetings , there could be a danger of more clearly marked divisions among the allies . " germany wants us to consult moscow the united states announced in january it had begun negotiations on installing a missile interceptor bank in poland , a radar system in the czech republic plus an early warning radar somewhere in the caucasus region . washington maintains that the system would not only protect the united states but also many of its european allies against " rogue threats " from countries like iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister jung wants the us to ease moscow 's concerns but russia is irked by the idea that its old cold war foe would set this up in its back yard and has accused washington of hiding its real intentions , trying to start another arms race , and threatened to retaliate . germany is demanding closer consultation with moscow but is also concerned that parts of southern europe - bulgaria , romania , greece and turkey - would be exposed outside the shield , expected to be fully operational in 2013 . " the germans do n't know clearly yet what they really want , but they are obviously convinced that nato should play a role in it all , " the nato diplomat said . in the latest sign of washington 's efforts to assuage those fears , us officials presented russia tuesday with " new ideas " for bilateral cooperation between them on missile defense in general . russia adopts wait and see attitude another nato diplomat noted that washington wants to move quickly to get the project off the ground before us president george w. bush steps down next year . " as for the americans , they want to go fast and get the ball rolling before bush 's mandate ends , " he said .
" so they are ready for concessions , as long as the main thrust of the plan is kept . " but despite the apparently conciliatory us moves , russia was pessimistic its concerns will be addressed . " we hope , although i will say sincerely that i am not optimistic , that washington will listen to our analyses and worries , " igor ivanov , head of the russian national security council , said tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian minister ivanov says he 's not optimistic that the us will listen to moscow 's concerns a senior russian diplomat , alexander grushko , said separately that russia intended to have serious talks with nato foreign ministers in norway next week on the missile scheme and the alliance 's expansion into eastern europe . " we are counting on a deep and serious discussion in oslo concerning all aspects of the relationship between russia and nato , " he told interfax news agency . the dispute has accelerated debate at nato about its own missile plans . a study for the nato has found that there is a possible missile threat to the allies and that they have the technical means to counter it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.04.2007 german jobseekers plumb volunteerism 's possibilities großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : offering a helping hand to others may be helpful to one 's own career unlike the us , germany does not have a highly developed culture of volunteerism .
but with state coffers increasingly empty and a continually tight job market , observers say unpaid work can have hidden benefits . in the us , volunteering is widespread - a credo promoted at home and in schools , and even as pseudo-governmental doctrine .
from tutoring in after school programs , to working as an aide in a hospital , to helping build houses for the poor - americans have long been schooled in the importance of " giving back to community . " but since its postwar economic boom , germany has used its tax base wealth to provide for the needy and offer its citizens singularly generous social benefits .
volunteer work was mainly done by charitable religious groups , or young men exempted from military service , fulfilling an obligatory year of civil service . increasingly , though , young people going onto the job market are discovering the side benefits that can be reaped from a volunteer stint .
such experience can help develop the highly touted " soft skills " that are increasingly in demand in the business world , observers say . after all , anyone can call themselves a " team player , " but a well-chosen , unpaid job may give them the chance to actually prove they are one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in german statistics , sports activities are often counted as " volunteer work " " for people looking for their first job , working as a volunteer is a great advantage , " said sascha theisen , the spokesman for stepstone.de , an employment-recruiting internet portal that advises people at all stages of their career .
" it gives them the chance to gain experience , for instance in leading a project , or solving problems or managing people . " it also means they could come to the job with a network already in place of people who would be good contacts later on down the road , " he added . too much of a good thing ? but theisen warned that people who are already in the middle of their careers should be careful not to overdo it .
german employers would only really smile upon someone involved in an activity that might be beneficial to business : taking an active role in a professional association , for instance . " if someone is busy leading several sports clubs and on top of that they sing in a choir , you have to ask yourself , are they going to have enough time for their job ? "
theisen asked . christoph lender saw the benefits of volunteering first hand .
by his own account , the half-dozen years he spent leading catholic youth groups helped give him just those skills required by his first employer , a bank .
at the job interview , they discussed the work he had done coordinating events , leading discussions and meetings , and being an authority figure for 10 to 15 kids every week . " it 's a signal for a company , that in addition to your studies and any internships you do , that you also took time for other things , and were socially engaged , " lender said .
" it speaks for how you choose to spend your time . " job boost a ' byproduct ' but lender stressed that his motivation for taking up volunteer work was not some calculated attempt to improve his chances on the job market . " i did it for my own personal development , " he said .
" the good experience with the job was just a byproduct of that . " german software giant sap 's hiring approach also supports lender 's experience . spokesperson alla ruggaber-mast said the company looks for people who are motivated and independent , with highly developed " soft skills " in communication , problem solving , and conflict resolution .
but while the firm " welcomes candidates who are socially engaged , that is not a decisive factor in hiring . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a voluntary civil service year , often in old age homes , means a military exemption according to the latest german government survey on volunteerism from 2004 , some 36 percent of germans claim volunteer responsibilities , up from 34 percent five years earlier . but that high number includes such volunteer jobs as taking an active role in a sports club or cultural institute .
the figure for " social " volunteerism - such as leading a youth group - was at 5.5 percent in 2004 , up from 4 percent in 1999 . there are historical reasons that relatively few germans take on social volunteer jobs , said werner lindwehr , a spokesman for the agency for self-help and volunteering in the city of osnabrück , in the state of lower saxony . " directly after the war , volunteerism was part of society , out of necessity , " lindwehr said .
" people helped one another . " later , the state took over many of those responsibilities . " and it may be that germans started just sitting back and saying , ' i 'll let the state take care of it , " ' he acknowledged . difference to usa today , however , he sees a movement toward citizens taking a more active role .
a " culture of volunteerism " is , indeed , developing in germany , he said . " people want to do more than just vote every four years , " lindwehr said .
" they want to do something on their own doorstep , and they see that they are taken seriously by the government . " but volunteerism in germany will never have the same status as in the us , where it fills a quasi-governmental function , he added . " you ca n't compare the volunteerism with usa and here , " he said .
" the us has a much worse social system .
in my opinion , they have more need , and thus more organization . " in germany , lindwehr argued , volunteerism will grow , but it will have a more " political " character , with volunteers and governments forming a sort of bridge to get things done .
for instance , he said , people are becoming increasingly active in local citizens ' initiatives . not everyone likes it an example is a group of people who decide their playground needs renovation , but the town says there is no funding for it .
so the local government will act as a go between , and find a carpenter who is willing to donate wood , or people to help manage the construction . despite these examples , volunteerism in germany is far from being accepted as purely beneficial .
debates occasionally flare up over the usefulness of the civil-service year , and there are those who decry the notion of unpaid work at all , saying it steals jobs from people who need them . meanwhile , christoph lender said that from where he stands , he has seen little evidence that the country will be overrun by volunteers any time soon . " among my friends , i guess you would say i am one of the more socially engaged , " lender said .

but with state coffers increasingly empty and a continually tight job market , observers say unpaid work can have hidden benefits . in the us , volunteering is widespread - a credo promoted at home and in schools , and even as pseudo-governmental doctrine .
from tutoring in after school programs , to working as an aide in a hospital , to helping build houses for the poor - americans have long been schooled in the importance of " giving back to community . " but since its postwar economic boom , germany has used its tax base wealth to provide for the needy and offer its citizens singularly generous social benefits .
volunteer work was mainly done by charitable religious groups , or young men exempted from military service , fulfilling an obligatory year of civil service . increasingly , though , young people going onto the job market are discovering the side benefits that can be reaped from a volunteer stint .
such experience can help develop the highly touted " soft skills " that are increasingly in demand in the business world , observers say . after all , anyone can call themselves a " team player , " but a well-chosen , unpaid job may give them the chance to actually prove they are one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in german statistics , sports activities are often counted as " volunteer work " " for people looking for their first job , working as a volunteer is a great advantage , " said sascha theisen , the spokesman for stepstone.de , an employment-recruiting internet portal that advises people at all stages of their career .
" it gives them the chance to gain experience , for instance in leading a project , or solving problems or managing people . " it also means they could come to the job with a network already in place of people who would be good contacts later on down the road , " he added . too much of a good thing ? but theisen warned that people who are already in the middle of their careers should be careful not to overdo it .
german employers would only really smile upon someone involved in an activity that might be beneficial to business : taking an active role in a professional association , for instance . " if someone is busy leading several sports clubs and on top of that they sing in a choir , you have to ask yourself , are they going to have enough time for their job ? "
theisen asked . christoph lender saw the benefits of volunteering first hand .
by his own account , the half-dozen years he spent leading catholic youth groups helped give him just those skills required by his first employer , a bank .
at the job interview , they discussed the work he had done coordinating events , leading discussions and meetings , and being an authority figure for 10 to 15 kids every week . " it 's a signal for a company , that in addition to your studies and any internships you do , that you also took time for other things , and were socially engaged , " lender said .
" it speaks for how you choose to spend your time . " job boost a ' byproduct ' but lender stressed that his motivation for taking up volunteer work was not some calculated attempt to improve his chances on the job market . " i did it for my own personal development , " he said .
" the good experience with the job was just a byproduct of that . " german software giant sap 's hiring approach also supports lender 's experience . spokesperson alla ruggaber-mast said the company looks for people who are motivated and independent , with highly developed " soft skills " in communication , problem solving , and conflict resolution .
but while the firm " welcomes candidates who are socially engaged , that is not a decisive factor in hiring . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a voluntary civil service year , often in old age homes , means a military exemption according to the latest german government survey on volunteerism from 2004 , some 36 percent of germans claim volunteer responsibilities , up from 34 percent five years earlier . but that high number includes such volunteer jobs as taking an active role in a sports club or cultural institute .
the figure for " social " volunteerism - such as leading a youth group - was at 5.5 percent in 2004 , up from 4 percent in 1999 . there are historical reasons that relatively few germans take on social volunteer jobs , said werner lindwehr , a spokesman for the agency for self-help and volunteering in the city of osnabrück , in the state of lower saxony . " directly after the war , volunteerism was part of society , out of necessity , " lindwehr said .
" people helped one another . " later , the state took over many of those responsibilities . " and it may be that germans started just sitting back and saying , ' i 'll let the state take care of it , " ' he acknowledged . difference to usa today , however , he sees a movement toward citizens taking a more active role .
a " culture of volunteerism " is , indeed , developing in germany , he said . " people want to do more than just vote every four years , " lindwehr said .
" they want to do something on their own doorstep , and they see that they are taken seriously by the government . " but volunteerism in germany will never have the same status as in the us , where it fills a quasi-governmental function , he added . " you ca n't compare the volunteerism with usa and here , " he said .
" the us has a much worse social system .
in my opinion , they have more need , and thus more organization . " in germany , lindwehr argued , volunteerism will grow , but it will have a more " political " character , with volunteers and governments forming a sort of bridge to get things done .
for instance , he said , people are becoming increasingly active in local citizens ' initiatives . not everyone likes it an example is a group of people who decide their playground needs renovation , but the town says there is no funding for it .
so the local government will act as a go between , and find a carpenter who is willing to donate wood , or people to help manage the construction . despite these examples , volunteerism in germany is far from being accepted as purely beneficial .
debates occasionally flare up over the usefulness of the civil-service year , and there are those who decry the notion of unpaid work at all , saying it steals jobs from people who need them . meanwhile , christoph lender said that from where he stands , he has seen little evidence that the country will be overrun by volunteers any time soon .

" a minister who spreads this kind of hysteria becomes a security risk himself , " he told the leipziger volkszeitung thursday in response to schäuble 's comment to weekly news magazine stern that presuming suspects were innocent until they had been proven guilty was inappropriate in the fight against terror . ute vogt , deputy leader of the social democrats , was equally alarmed . " anyone who questions the principle of innocent until proven guilty is the wrong person to be in charge of upholding and protecting the constitution , " she said . nothing new for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries , right , said schäuble 's comments were " imprecise and unfortunate " though she called the comments " imprecise and unfortunate , " german justice minister brigitte zypries said schäuble 's statements did not break any new ground . " naturally the presumption of innocence does not apply to averting dangers , " she said thursday .
" the presumption of innocence applies only to criminal proceedings , not preventive actions . " zypries said germany 's discussion of anti-terror measures had become " somewhat cloudy " and added that the results of schäuble 's plan " remain to be seen . " speaking to the daily berliner zeitung , however , gerhart baum , a former german interior minister and member of the free-market liberal fdp party , described schäuble 's comments as " constitutionally unacceptable " and called on chancellor angela merkel to rein in her minister . " i find it extraordinary that she has refrained from comment , " he said . finding common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many are concerned by the growing scale of preventative surveillance within the framework of new anti-terror legislation , the minister intends to expand germany 's surveillance structure significantly and , among other things , give the police automatic access to digital passport photos and fingerprints that will in future be stored on german identification documents . the minister has also proposed expanding video surveillance of public spaces , and automatic scanning and database comparison of vehicle license plates traveling or parked on public roads . the german government already gave its approval wednesday to a draft law that would require telephone operators to save call records for at least six months - in a move that data protection advocates fear will compromise citizens ' rights . the law , which zypries said is needed to bring german regulations in line with european union law , would require saving data regarding who makes contact , and when . but growing controversy surrounding such plans has prompted merkel and sdp leader kurt beck to call for a round of talks among coalition leaders .
merkel 's chief of staff in the chancellery , thomas de maiziere , is reported to have been asked to schedule a meeting " as quickly as possible , " to give ministers an opportunity to re-establish common ground with regard to anti-terror policies . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de top german politicians argue over measures to fight terrorism german politicians are at odds over a minister 's remark that the presumption of innocence does n't apply to suspected terrorists , as the cabinet on wednesday decided on new measures in the fight against terror .

they have to get their stadiums , transport systems and hotels up to scratch and overcome a legacy of hooliganism and corruption . a day after poland and ukraine scored a shock win over italy and fellow joint bidders hungary and croatia in the race to clinch the major soccer tournament - which takes place every four years - the enormity of the task facing the two host nations was beginning to sink in .
they will need nothing short of a herculean construction and investor drive to build stadium , hotels and other infrastructure .
in addition , security worries , hooliganism and corruption remain nagging problems .
organizers and politicians , however , insist they will roll up their sleeves in order to ensure the success of the soccer championships .
poland tries to calm jitters in the lead up to wednesday 's decision by european soccer 's governing body , uefa , at a meeting in cardiff , the polish-ukrainian bidders tried to calm jitters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president yushchenko -lrb- r . -rrb- and polish president kaczynski polish president lech kaczynski who traveled to the welsh capital with ukrainian president viktor yushchenko to make an 11th-hour pitch for their bid , said there was much work to be done .
" we must not forget the enormity of the task of organizing euro 2012 , but that is also excellent news for poland , " kaczynski said .
" there will be new stadiums built in warsaw , gdansk , wroclaw and poznan .
that can only be seen in a positive light , " he added .
" five years is long enough and i am sure that with the mobilization and determination of the local authorities and the people , we will succeed . "
it will be the first time that either poland or ukraine will host a major soccer championship .
it 's the third major sporting event , following the beijing olympic games in 2008 and the soccer world cup in south africa in 2010 , to break away from the traditional grounds of western europe and the americas .
infrastructure in need of massive overhaul polish authorities said last week that around 26 billion euros -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- , including eu financing , have been earmarked to upgrade infrastructure .
fans will need every bit of it .
anyone wanting to travel by road from gdansk in northern poland to donetsk , a host city in eastern ukraine , has to traverse 2,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,240 miles -rrb- .
the 22-hour car or bus trip - not counting the lengthy wait at the polish-ukrainian border - is mostly on single lane roads .
only 23 kilometers -lrb- 14 miles -rrb- of the trip is on motorway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the few four-lane motorways in poland , near the ukraine border despite receiving vast eu funding since the fall of communism in 1989 and becoming a member of the bloc in 2004 , poland still has n't built a basic motorway network connecting its major cities .
the situation is worse in ukraine .
there , train travel is hardly better : it currently takes 43 hours , at best , to get from gdansk to donetsk .
lack of investment means it is too dangerous to use high speed trains on the aging tracks .
while booming low-cost airlines carry hundreds of thousands of poles between their homes and western europe each year , there are still no cheap links between ukraine and poland .
outside major cities , particularly in ukraine , good hotels are hard to come by - or at least in sufficient numbers to cater to tens of thousands of fans , journalists and soccer officials .
hooliganism , right wing crimes raise concerns polish soccer is also blighted by hooliganism .
fears that polish fans would cause trouble at last year 's world cup in neighboring germany led to a massive police operation in both countries , although in the end the hooligans stayed away .
in addition , polish soccer 's image has been dented by corruption .
a two-year-old match-fixing scandal has led to more than 60 arrests , including several referees , a member of the polish soccer association -lrb- pzpn -rrb- leadership and a string of club officials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hooliganism continues to blight polish soccer on thursday , polish sports minister tomasz lipiec vowed to make polish soccer graft-free by the time of the euro 2012 .
" we want to sort this problem out completely by 2012 .
i 'm convinced that we will manage it even earlier , " lipiec said .
" the championships must take place in an atmosphere of fair play . "
ukraine will also have to do more to improve security for foreign fans .
foreign embassies regularly warn their citizens about the risk of attacks by skinheads in the country .
poland , too , has a flourishing far-right scene .
" good news for ukrainians " despite the huge problems , kiev remains confident that it can manage to surmount most challenges .
indeed , there are signs that the country is already gearing up to tackle the gargantuan task .
although kiev is currently locked in political crisis pitting supporters of the president and prime minister against each other , the two sides are united about euro 2012 .
four ukrainian cities selected as venues have already started preparations including upgrading their existing soccer facilities .
and the kiev mayor 's office has said the capital would completely renovate its 86,000-seat olympic stadium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is confident that investors will step in to build much needed stadiums in the west of the country , lviv city authorities have said they will renovate the city 's 28,000-seat stadium and increase its capacity .
ukraine 's reigning champions , shakhtar donetsk , are currently building a new 50,000-seat ground , while dnepropetrovsk , who finished sixth last season , had also began the construction of a new arena in their town .
ukraine 's sports minister , viktor korzh , said major investors were ready to step in alongside the authorities .
" there are serious investors , who are ready to invest up to 37 billion hryvnias -lrb- about 5.7 billion euros , $ 7.7 billion -rrb- in the construction of airports , roads , hotels and improving sports infrastructure , " he said .
roman shpek , ukraine 's ambassador to the european union , said the decision to allow ukraine to be co-host of the euro 2012 could not be underestimated .
" it is one more step toward ukraine 's integration to the eu , " shpek told the international herald tribune .

anyone wanting to travel by road from gdansk in northern poland to donetsk , a host city in eastern ukraine , has to traverse 2,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,240 miles -rrb- .

" it 's only the beginning of a first real exchange of views , " one diplomat told afp on condition of anonymity , adding that " it is too early to expect any decisions . " " thursday 's meetings could help restore confidence among us , particularly with russia , but also ease german concerns , " the diplomat said . but he warned : " if things have n't cooled down after these meetings , there could be a danger of more clearly marked divisions among the allies . " germany wants us to consult moscow the united states announced in january it had begun negotiations on installing a missile interceptor bank in poland , a radar system in the czech republic plus an early warning radar somewhere in the caucasus region . washington maintains that the system would not only protect the united states but also many of its european allies against " rogue threats " from countries like iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister jung wants the us to ease moscow 's concerns but russia is irked by the idea that its old cold war foe would set this up in its back yard and has accused washington of hiding its real intentions , trying to start another arms race , and threatened to retaliate . germany is demanding closer consultation with moscow but is also concerned that parts of southern europe - bulgaria , romania , greece and turkey - would be exposed outside the shield , expected to be fully operational in 2013 . " the germans do n't know clearly yet what they really want , but they are obviously convinced that nato should play a role in it all , " the nato diplomat said . in the latest sign of washington 's efforts to assuage those fears , us officials presented russia tuesday with " new ideas " for bilateral cooperation between them on missile defense in general . russia adopts wait and see attitude another nato diplomat noted that washington wants to move quickly to get the project off the ground before us president george w. bush steps down next year . " as for the americans , they want to go fast and get the ball rolling before bush 's mandate ends , " he said .
" so they are ready for concessions , as long as the main thrust of the plan is kept . " but despite the apparently conciliatory us moves , russia was pessimistic its concerns will be addressed . " we hope , although i will say sincerely that i am not optimistic , that washington will listen to our analyses and worries , " igor ivanov , head of the russian national security council , said tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian minister ivanov says he 's not optimistic that the us will listen to moscow 's concerns a senior russian diplomat , alexander grushko , said separately that russia intended to have serious talks with nato foreign ministers in norway next week on the missile scheme and the alliance 's expansion into eastern europe . " we are counting on a deep and serious discussion in oslo concerning all aspects of the relationship between russia and nato , " he told interfax news agency . the dispute has accelerated debate at nato about its own missile plans . a study for the nato has found that there is a possible missile threat to the allies and that they have the technical means to counter it .

" the allies were convinced and are convinced that there are no implications of the united states ' system for the strategic balance , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said after the highest-level talks ever on the issue . " ten interceptors will not , can not affect the strategic balance and 10 interceptors can not pose a threat to russia , " he said , after meetings between the 26 nato allies followed by a so-called nato-russia council . washington announced in january plans to extend its missile shield into europe to counter a potential missile attack from " rogue states " like iran , and possibly north korea . it would involve 10 missile interceptors without warheads set up in poland and a radar system in the czech republic to track any attack .
this would be linked to an advance warning system , probably in the caucasus .
russia says it sees no need for missile shield the move has ruffled feathers in russia , which is deeply concerned about its former cold war foe setting up military shop in its back yard .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jaap de hoop scheffer " we can not understand what eastern europe needs this system for , " first deputy prime minister sergei ivanov , a former russian defence minister , said thursday . washington has tried to ease russia 's concerns by suggesting possible areas of cooperation , including sharing early warning missile data , but ivanov appeared to reject the offer . " i honestly see no basis for speaking of possible cooperation , " he was quoted as saying by interfax news agency . scheffer aknowledged " a difference in threat perception " between the allies and russia .
" there is a clearly a divide , " he said . but us assistant secretary of state john rood , part of the senior three-man team charged with easing russia 's fears and european doubts , said that moscow still plans to weigh the proposals . " the representatives in the nato-russia council today ... indicated that the russian government was going to study our proposal in greater detail before providing a more full response , " he said . russian representative konstantin totsky conceded the offer had not been rejected yet , but he said that moscow has grown tired of being dictated to by washington . " the us colleagues give us their proposals , and then we give them our proposals and we can continue like this for years and call it a process of consultation , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us plans for a missile shield in europe have sparked controversy and concerns " i think we should have a transition from consultation to dialogue and i think we started this dialogue today , " he said , adding : " we will scrutinize these proposals and we will come back to our us colleagues . " he also expressed concern that the missile shield , set to come into operation around 2013 , would continue to grow . " we know from experience that when you have a system it keeps developing , it can not stop , " he warned .
rest of europe also concerned european allies are concerned about the system too , particularly that it would leave members bulgaria , greece , romania and turkey uncovered , and they insisted on the " indivisibility " of the alliance 's defenses . spokesman james appathurai said that nato also discussed " bolting on " its planned theater defense missile system - aimed at protecting troops in the field but still only in the testing phase - to the shield to cover the hole . in any case , talks are set to continue . ivanov and us defense secretary robert gates may discuss the plan during a moscow meeting next week , and the nato allies will take it up again when alliance foreign ministers hold talks in olso next thursday . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de nato , russia hold high-level us missile shield talks the united states and its nato allies will on thursday hold their first high-level talks with russian officials aimed at easing moscow 's fears of us plans to build part of a missile shield in europe .

" it 's only the beginning of a first real exchange of views , " one diplomat told afp on condition of anonymity , adding that " it is too early to expect any decisions . " " thursday 's meetings could help restore confidence among us , particularly with russia , but also ease german concerns , " the diplomat said . but he warned : " if things have n't cooled down after these meetings , there could be a danger of more clearly marked divisions among the allies . " germany wants us to consult moscow the united states announced in january it had begun negotiations on installing a missile interceptor bank in poland , a radar system in the czech republic plus an early warning radar somewhere in the caucasus region . washington maintains that the system would not only protect the united states but also many of its european allies against " rogue threats " from countries like iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister jung wants the us to ease moscow 's concerns but russia is irked by the idea that its old cold war foe would set this up in its back yard and has accused washington of hiding its real intentions , trying to start another arms race , and threatened to retaliate . germany is demanding closer consultation with moscow but is also concerned that parts of southern europe - bulgaria , romania , greece and turkey - would be exposed outside the shield , expected to be fully operational in 2013 . " the germans do n't know clearly yet what they really want , but they are obviously convinced that nato should play a role in it all , " the nato diplomat said . in the latest sign of washington 's efforts to assuage those fears , us officials presented russia tuesday with " new ideas " for bilateral cooperation between them on missile defense in general . russia adopts wait and see attitude another nato diplomat noted that washington wants to move quickly to get the project off the ground before us president george w. bush steps down next year . " as for the americans , they want to go fast and get the ball rolling before bush 's mandate ends , " he said .
" so they are ready for concessions , as long as the main thrust of the plan is kept . " but despite the apparently conciliatory us moves , russia was pessimistic its concerns will be addressed . " we hope , although i will say sincerely that i am not optimistic , that washington will listen to our analyses and worries , " igor ivanov , head of the russian national security council , said tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian minister ivanov says he 's not optimistic that the us will listen to moscow 's concerns a senior russian diplomat , alexander grushko , said separately that russia intended to have serious talks with nato foreign ministers in norway next week on the missile scheme and the alliance 's expansion into eastern europe . " we are counting on a deep and serious discussion in oslo concerning all aspects of the relationship between russia and nato , " he told interfax news agency . the dispute has accelerated debate at nato about its own missile plans . a study for the nato has found that there is a possible missile threat to the allies and that they have the technical means to counter it .

" it 's only the beginning of a first real exchange of views , " one diplomat told afp on condition of anonymity , adding that " it is too early to expect any decisions . " " thursday 's meetings could help restore confidence among us , particularly with russia , but also ease german concerns , " the diplomat said . but he warned : " if things have n't cooled down after these meetings , there could be a danger of more clearly marked divisions among the allies . " germany wants us to consult moscow the united states announced in january it had begun negotiations on installing a missile interceptor bank in poland , a radar system in the czech republic plus an early warning radar somewhere in the caucasus region . washington maintains that the system would not only protect the united states but also many of its european allies against " rogue threats " from countries like iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister jung wants the us to ease moscow 's concerns but russia is irked by the idea that its old cold war foe would set this up in its back yard and has accused washington of hiding its real intentions , trying to start another arms race , and threatened to retaliate . germany is demanding closer consultation with moscow but is also concerned that parts of southern europe - bulgaria , romania , greece and turkey - would be exposed outside the shield , expected to be fully operational in 2013 . " the germans do n't know clearly yet what they really want , but they are obviously convinced that nato should play a role in it all , " the nato diplomat said . in the latest sign of washington 's efforts to assuage those fears , us officials presented russia tuesday with " new ideas " for bilateral cooperation between them on missile defense in general . russia adopts wait and see attitude another nato diplomat noted that washington wants to move quickly to get the project off the ground before us president george w. bush steps down next year . " as for the americans , they want to go fast and get the ball rolling before bush 's mandate ends , " he said .
" so they are ready for concessions , as long as the main thrust of the plan is kept . " but despite the apparently conciliatory us moves , russia was pessimistic its concerns will be addressed . " we hope , although i will say sincerely that i am not optimistic , that washington will listen to our analyses and worries , " igor ivanov , head of the russian national security council , said tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian minister ivanov says he 's not optimistic that the us will listen to moscow 's concerns a senior russian diplomat , alexander grushko , said separately that russia intended to have serious talks with nato foreign ministers in norway next week on the missile scheme and the alliance 's expansion into eastern europe .

but with state coffers increasingly empty and a continually tight job market , observers say unpaid work can have hidden benefits . in the us , volunteering is widespread - a credo promoted at home and in schools , and even as pseudo-governmental doctrine .
from tutoring in after school programs , to working as an aide in a hospital , to helping build houses for the poor - americans have long been schooled in the importance of " giving back to community . " but since its postwar economic boom , germany has used its tax base wealth to provide for the needy and offer its citizens singularly generous social benefits .
volunteer work was mainly done by charitable religious groups , or young men exempted from military service , fulfilling an obligatory year of civil service . increasingly , though , young people going onto the job market are discovering the side benefits that can be reaped from a volunteer stint .
such experience can help develop the highly touted " soft skills " that are increasingly in demand in the business world , observers say . after all , anyone can call themselves a " team player , " but a well-chosen , unpaid job may give them the chance to actually prove they are one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in german statistics , sports activities are often counted as " volunteer work " " for people looking for their first job , working as a volunteer is a great advantage , " said sascha theisen , the spokesman for stepstone.de , an employment-recruiting internet portal that advises people at all stages of their career .
" it gives them the chance to gain experience , for instance in leading a project , or solving problems or managing people . " it also means they could come to the job with a network already in place of people who would be good contacts later on down the road , " he added . too much of a good thing ? but theisen warned that people who are already in the middle of their careers should be careful not to overdo it .
german employers would only really smile upon someone involved in an activity that might be beneficial to business : taking an active role in a professional association , for instance . " if someone is busy leading several sports clubs and on top of that they sing in a choir , you have to ask yourself , are they going to have enough time for their job ? "
theisen asked . christoph lender saw the benefits of volunteering first hand .
by his own account , the half-dozen years he spent leading catholic youth groups helped give him just those skills required by his first employer , a bank .
at the job interview , they discussed the work he had done coordinating events , leading discussions and meetings , and being an authority figure for 10 to 15 kids every week . " it 's a signal for a company , that in addition to your studies and any internships you do , that you also took time for other things , and were socially engaged , " lender said .
" it speaks for how you choose to spend your time . " job boost a ' byproduct ' but lender stressed that his motivation for taking up volunteer work was not some calculated attempt to improve his chances on the job market . " i did it for my own personal development , " he said .
" the good experience with the job was just a byproduct of that . " german software giant sap 's hiring approach also supports lender 's experience . spokesperson alla ruggaber-mast said the company looks for people who are motivated and independent , with highly developed " soft skills " in communication , problem solving , and conflict resolution .
but while the firm " welcomes candidates who are socially engaged , that is not a decisive factor in hiring . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a voluntary civil service year , often in old age homes , means a military exemption according to the latest german government survey on volunteerism from 2004 , some 36 percent of germans claim volunteer responsibilities , up from 34 percent five years earlier . but that high number includes such volunteer jobs as taking an active role in a sports club or cultural institute .
the figure for " social " volunteerism - such as leading a youth group - was at 5.5 percent in 2004 , up from 4 percent in 1999 . there are historical reasons that relatively few germans take on social volunteer jobs , said werner lindwehr , a spokesman for the agency for self-help and volunteering in the city of osnabrück , in the state of lower saxony . " directly after the war , volunteerism was part of society , out of necessity , " lindwehr said .
" people helped one another . " later , the state took over many of those responsibilities . " and it may be that germans started just sitting back and saying , ' i 'll let the state take care of it , " ' he acknowledged . difference to usa today , however , he sees a movement toward citizens taking a more active role .
a " culture of volunteerism " is , indeed , developing in germany , he said . " people want to do more than just vote every four years , " lindwehr said .
" they want to do something on their own doorstep , and they see that they are taken seriously by the government . " but volunteerism in germany will never have the same status as in the us , where it fills a quasi-governmental function , he added . " you ca n't compare the volunteerism with usa and here , " he said .
" the us has a much worse social system .
in my opinion , they have more need , and thus more organization . " in germany , lindwehr argued , volunteerism will grow , but it will have a more " political " character , with volunteers and governments forming a sort of bridge to get things done .
for instance , he said , people are becoming increasingly active in local citizens ' initiatives . not everyone likes it an example is a group of people who decide their playground needs renovation , but the town says there is no funding for it .
so the local government will act as a go between , and find a carpenter who is willing to donate wood , or people to help manage the construction . despite these examples , volunteerism in germany is far from being accepted as purely beneficial .
debates occasionally flare up over the usefulness of the civil-service year , and there are those who decry the notion of unpaid work at all , saying it steals jobs from people who need them . meanwhile , christoph lender said that from where he stands , he has seen little evidence that the country will be overrun by volunteers any time soon .

the figure for " social " volunteerism - such as leading a youth group - was at 5.5 percent in 2004 , up from 4 percent in 1999 . there are historical reasons that relatively few germans take on social volunteer jobs , said werner lindwehr , a spokesman for the agency for self-help and volunteering in the city of osnabrück , in the state of lower saxony .

a " culture of volunteerism " is , indeed , developing in germany , he said . " people want to do more than just vote every four years , " lindwehr said .
" they want to do something on their own doorstep , and they see that they are taken seriously by the government . " but volunteerism in germany will never have the same status as in the us , where it fills a quasi-governmental function , he added . " you ca n't compare the volunteerism with usa and here , " he said .
" the us has a much worse social system .
in my opinion , they have more need , and thus more organization . " in germany , lindwehr argued , volunteerism will grow , but it will have a more " political " character , with volunteers and governments forming a sort of bridge to get things done .
for instance , he said , people are becoming increasingly active in local citizens ' initiatives . not everyone likes it an example is a group of people who decide their playground needs renovation , but the town says there is no funding for it .

but with state coffers increasingly empty and a continually tight job market , observers say unpaid work can have hidden benefits . in the us , volunteering is widespread - a credo promoted at home and in schools , and even as pseudo-governmental doctrine .
from tutoring in after school programs , to working as an aide in a hospital , to helping build houses for the poor - americans have long been schooled in the importance of " giving back to community . " but since its postwar economic boom , germany has used its tax base wealth to provide for the needy and offer its citizens singularly generous social benefits .
volunteer work was mainly done by charitable religious groups , or young men exempted from military service , fulfilling an obligatory year of civil service . increasingly , though , young people going onto the job market are discovering the side benefits that can be reaped from a volunteer stint .
such experience can help develop the highly touted " soft skills " that are increasingly in demand in the business world , observers say . after all , anyone can call themselves a " team player , " but a well-chosen , unpaid job may give them the chance to actually prove they are one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in german statistics , sports activities are often counted as " volunteer work " " for people looking for their first job , working as a volunteer is a great advantage , " said sascha theisen , the spokesman for stepstone.de , an employment-recruiting internet portal that advises people at all stages of their career .
" it gives them the chance to gain experience , for instance in leading a project , or solving problems or managing people . " it also means they could come to the job with a network already in place of people who would be good contacts later on down the road , " he added . too much of a good thing ? but theisen warned that people who are already in the middle of their careers should be careful not to overdo it .
german employers would only really smile upon someone involved in an activity that might be beneficial to business : taking an active role in a professional association , for instance . " if someone is busy leading several sports clubs and on top of that they sing in a choir , you have to ask yourself , are they going to have enough time for their job ? "
theisen asked . christoph lender saw the benefits of volunteering first hand .
by his own account , the half-dozen years he spent leading catholic youth groups helped give him just those skills required by his first employer , a bank .
at the job interview , they discussed the work he had done coordinating events , leading discussions and meetings , and being an authority figure for 10 to 15 kids every week . " it 's a signal for a company , that in addition to your studies and any internships you do , that you also took time for other things , and were socially engaged , " lender said .

" a minister who spreads this kind of hysteria becomes a security risk himself , " he told the leipziger volkszeitung thursday in response to schäuble 's comment to weekly news magazine stern that presuming suspects were innocent until they had been proven guilty was inappropriate in the fight against terror . ute vogt , deputy leader of the social democrats , was equally alarmed . " anyone who questions the principle of innocent until proven guilty is the wrong person to be in charge of upholding and protecting the constitution , " she said . nothing new for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries , right , said schäuble 's comments were " imprecise and unfortunate " though she called the comments " imprecise and unfortunate , " german justice minister brigitte zypries said schäuble 's statements did not break any new ground . " naturally the presumption of innocence does not apply to averting dangers , " she said thursday .
" the presumption of innocence applies only to criminal proceedings , not preventive actions . " zypries said germany 's discussion of anti-terror measures had become " somewhat cloudy " and added that the results of schäuble 's plan " remain to be seen . " speaking to the daily berliner zeitung , however , gerhart baum , a former german interior minister and member of the free-market liberal fdp party , described schäuble 's comments as " constitutionally unacceptable " and called on chancellor angela merkel to rein in her minister . " i find it extraordinary that she has refrained from comment , " he said . finding common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many are concerned by the growing scale of preventative surveillance within the framework of new anti-terror legislation , the minister intends to expand germany 's surveillance structure significantly and , among other things , give the police automatic access to digital passport photos and fingerprints that will in future be stored on german identification documents . the minister has also proposed expanding video surveillance of public spaces , and automatic scanning and database comparison of vehicle license plates traveling or parked on public roads . the german government already gave its approval wednesday to a draft law that would require telephone operators to save call records for at least six months - in a move that data protection advocates fear will compromise citizens ' rights . the law , which zypries said is needed to bring german regulations in line with european union law , would require saving data regarding who makes contact , and when . but growing controversy surrounding such plans has prompted merkel and sdp leader kurt beck to call for a round of talks among coalition leaders .
merkel 's chief of staff in the chancellery , thomas de maiziere , is reported to have been asked to schedule a meeting " as quickly as possible , " to give ministers an opportunity to re-establish common ground with regard to anti-terror policies . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de top german politicians argue over measures to fight terrorism german politicians are at odds over a minister 's remark that the presumption of innocence does n't apply to suspected terrorists , as the cabinet on wednesday decided on new measures in the fight against terror .

they have to get their stadiums , transport systems and hotels up to scratch and overcome a legacy of hooliganism and corruption . a day after poland and ukraine scored a shock win over italy and fellow joint bidders hungary and croatia in the race to clinch the major soccer tournament - which takes place every four years - the enormity of the task facing the two host nations was beginning to sink in .
they will need nothing short of a herculean construction and investor drive to build stadium , hotels and other infrastructure .
in addition , security worries , hooliganism and corruption remain nagging problems .
organizers and politicians , however , insist they will roll up their sleeves in order to ensure the success of the soccer championships .
poland tries to calm jitters in the lead up to wednesday 's decision by european soccer 's governing body , uefa , at a meeting in cardiff , the polish-ukrainian bidders tried to calm jitters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president yushchenko -lrb- r . -rrb- and polish president kaczynski polish president lech kaczynski who traveled to the welsh capital with ukrainian president viktor yushchenko to make an 11th-hour pitch for their bid , said there was much work to be done .
" we must not forget the enormity of the task of organizing euro 2012 , but that is also excellent news for poland , " kaczynski said .
" there will be new stadiums built in warsaw , gdansk , wroclaw and poznan .
that can only be seen in a positive light , " he added .
" five years is long enough and i am sure that with the mobilization and determination of the local authorities and the people , we will succeed . "
it will be the first time that either poland or ukraine will host a major soccer championship .
it 's the third major sporting event , following the beijing olympic games in 2008 and the soccer world cup in south africa in 2010 , to break away from the traditional grounds of western europe and the americas .
infrastructure in need of massive overhaul polish authorities said last week that around 26 billion euros -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- , including eu financing , have been earmarked to upgrade infrastructure .
fans will need every bit of it .
anyone wanting to travel by road from gdansk in northern poland to donetsk , a host city in eastern ukraine , has to traverse 2,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,240 miles -rrb- .
the 22-hour car or bus trip - not counting the lengthy wait at the polish-ukrainian border - is mostly on single lane roads .
only 23 kilometers -lrb- 14 miles -rrb- of the trip is on motorway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the few four-lane motorways in poland , near the ukraine border despite receiving vast eu funding since the fall of communism in 1989 and becoming a member of the bloc in 2004 , poland still has n't built a basic motorway network connecting its major cities .
the situation is worse in ukraine .
there , train travel is hardly better : it currently takes 43 hours , at best , to get from gdansk to donetsk .
lack of investment means it is too dangerous to use high speed trains on the aging tracks .
while booming low-cost airlines carry hundreds of thousands of poles between their homes and western europe each year , there are still no cheap links between ukraine and poland .
outside major cities , particularly in ukraine , good hotels are hard to come by - or at least in sufficient numbers to cater to tens of thousands of fans , journalists and soccer officials .
hooliganism , right wing crimes raise concerns polish soccer is also blighted by hooliganism .
fears that polish fans would cause trouble at last year 's world cup in neighboring germany led to a massive police operation in both countries , although in the end the hooligans stayed away .
in addition , polish soccer 's image has been dented by corruption .
a two-year-old match-fixing scandal has led to more than 60 arrests , including several referees , a member of the polish soccer association -lrb- pzpn -rrb- leadership and a string of club officials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hooliganism continues to blight polish soccer on thursday , polish sports minister tomasz lipiec vowed to make polish soccer graft-free by the time of the euro 2012 .
" we want to sort this problem out completely by 2012 .
i 'm convinced that we will manage it even earlier , " lipiec said .
" the championships must take place in an atmosphere of fair play . "
ukraine will also have to do more to improve security for foreign fans .
foreign embassies regularly warn their citizens about the risk of attacks by skinheads in the country .
poland , too , has a flourishing far-right scene .
" good news for ukrainians " despite the huge problems , kiev remains confident that it can manage to surmount most challenges .
indeed , there are signs that the country is already gearing up to tackle the gargantuan task .
although kiev is currently locked in political crisis pitting supporters of the president and prime minister against each other , the two sides are united about euro 2012 .
four ukrainian cities selected as venues have already started preparations including upgrading their existing soccer facilities .
and the kiev mayor 's office has said the capital would completely renovate its 86,000-seat olympic stadium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is confident that investors will step in to build much needed stadiums in the west of the country , lviv city authorities have said they will renovate the city 's 28,000-seat stadium and increase its capacity .
ukraine 's reigning champions , shakhtar donetsk , are currently building a new 50,000-seat ground , while dnepropetrovsk , who finished sixth last season , had also began the construction of a new arena in their town .
ukraine 's sports minister , viktor korzh , said major investors were ready to step in alongside the authorities .
" there are serious investors , who are ready to invest up to 37 billion hryvnias -lrb- about 5.7 billion euros , $ 7.7 billion -rrb- in the construction of airports , roads , hotels and improving sports infrastructure , " he said .
roman shpek , ukraine 's ambassador to the european union , said the decision to allow ukraine to be co-host of the euro 2012 could not be underestimated .
" it is one more step toward ukraine 's integration to the eu , " shpek told the international herald tribune .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de society -pipe- 19.04.2007 eu agrees on penalties for racism and xenophobia großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the new rules are only of a symbolic nature the european union thursday agreed on new rules to criminalize racism and xenophobia in the bloc , but said that the long-debated measures were mainly of symbolic nature . " racism and xenophobia can only be combatted effectively inside society , " german justice minister brigitte zypries told reporters after a meeting with her counterparts in luxembourg .
" criminal measures can only be supplementary , they can never be sufficient in combatting racism and xenophobia in itself , " said zypries whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
zypries said that the agreed piece of eu legislation , which is not legally binding for the bloc 's members , was an " important political signal " for the 27-nation union .
under the new rules , eu countries would set jail terms of at least one to three years for " publicly inciting to violence or hatred ... directed against a group of persons or a member of such a group defined by reference to race , color , religion , descent or national or ethnic origin . "
no minimum fines however , the legislation does not set any minimum fines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agreement does n't specify what constitutes incitement to violence it also leaves up to national courts to define what exactly constitutes incitement to violence or hatred .
there will also be no europe-wide ban on the use of nazi symbols .
raising awareness frattini said that the new rules would fully respect the freedom of expression .
" we are punishing concrete action , not any ideas , we are punishing incitement to hatred in a concrete way or encouraging other people to take concrete -lrb- xenophobic -rrb- action , " frattini said .
he said that the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , would try to raise awareness for the stalinist atrocities by organizing public debates " on the horrible crimes of the last century , ...
nazi crimes , stalinist crimes . "
however , the events still needed parliamentary approval in seven eu countries .
watered-down compromise the eu 's anti-racism rules - debated since 2001 - seemed at risk after latvia , lithuania and estonia had demanded making illegal the condoning , denial or trivialization of crimes against humanity committed under the soviet regime led by joseph stalin .
other eu states were opposed to the baltic demands , arguing that they did not legally recognize crimes committed under the stalinist regime or define major stalin atrocities as genocide .
zypries said the eu did not intend to decide on history but wanted to create public awareness for crimes against humanity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic states wanted stalin 's crimes to be put on a par with hitler 's germany views a common eu law on combating racism and xenophobia as a moral obligation .
the new rules which would also make denying the holocaust - the mass killing of jews by nazis and nazi supporters - a crime in the eu if the statement incites to violence or hatred , do not cover denying the massacre of armenians in world war i. turkey denies that the killing of up to one million armenians constituted genocide , putting their deaths down to ethnic strife , disease and famine , and has prosecuted historians and journalists for calling it genocide .
watchdogs criticize rules as weak under the rules , the denial of crimes of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes will be punishable in the eu if these crimes have been defined by international courts and if the statement incites to hatred or violence .
laws against denying the holocaust already exist in austria , belgium , france , germany and spain .
european racism watchdogs have said that the agreed text is " weak , " adding that eu efforts were " without any substantial intent to provide strengthened protections for those who experience racist crime and violence in europe . " dw staff / dpa -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german holocaust denier imprisoned for inciting racial hatred a german court sentenced holocaust denier germar rudolf to two and a half years in prison for inciting racial hatred in publications and web sites which " systematically " called into question the nazi genocide .

" racism and xenophobia can only be combatted effectively inside society , " german justice minister brigitte zypries told reporters after a meeting with her counterparts in luxembourg .
" criminal measures can only be supplementary , they can never be sufficient in combatting racism and xenophobia in itself , " said zypries whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
zypries said that the agreed piece of eu legislation , which is not legally binding for the bloc 's members , was an " important political signal " for the 27-nation union .
under the new rules , eu countries would set jail terms of at least one to three years for " publicly inciting to violence or hatred ... directed against a group of persons or a member of such a group defined by reference to race , color , religion , descent or national or ethnic origin . "
no minimum fines however , the legislation does not set any minimum fines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agreement does n't specify what constitutes incitement to violence it also leaves up to national courts to define what exactly constitutes incitement to violence or hatred .
there will also be no europe-wide ban on the use of nazi symbols .
raising awareness frattini said that the new rules would fully respect the freedom of expression .
" we are punishing concrete action , not any ideas , we are punishing incitement to hatred in a concrete way or encouraging other people to take concrete -lrb- xenophobic -rrb- action , " frattini said .
he said that the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , would try to raise awareness for the stalinist atrocities by organizing public debates " on the horrible crimes of the last century , ...
nazi crimes , stalinist crimes . "
however , the events still needed parliamentary approval in seven eu countries .
watered-down compromise the eu 's anti-racism rules - debated since 2001 - seemed at risk after latvia , lithuania and estonia had demanded making illegal the condoning , denial or trivialization of crimes against humanity committed under the soviet regime led by joseph stalin .
other eu states were opposed to the baltic demands , arguing that they did not legally recognize crimes committed under the stalinist regime or define major stalin atrocities as genocide .
zypries said the eu did not intend to decide on history but wanted to create public awareness for crimes against humanity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic states wanted stalin 's crimes to be put on a par with hitler 's germany views a common eu law on combating racism and xenophobia as a moral obligation .
the new rules which would also make denying the holocaust - the mass killing of jews by nazis and nazi supporters - a crime in the eu if the statement incites to violence or hatred , do not cover denying the massacre of armenians in world war i. turkey denies that the killing of up to one million armenians constituted genocide , putting their deaths down to ethnic strife , disease and famine , and has prosecuted historians and journalists for calling it genocide .
watchdogs criticize rules as weak under the rules , the denial of crimes of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes will be punishable in the eu if these crimes have been defined by international courts and if the statement incites to hatred or violence .
laws against denying the holocaust already exist in austria , belgium , france , germany and spain .
european racism watchdogs have said that the agreed text is " weak , " adding that eu efforts were " without any substantial intent to provide strengthened protections for those who experience racist crime and violence in europe .

" racism and xenophobia can only be combatted effectively inside society , " german justice minister brigitte zypries told reporters after a meeting with her counterparts in luxembourg .
" criminal measures can only be supplementary , they can never be sufficient in combatting racism and xenophobia in itself , " said zypries whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
zypries said that the agreed piece of eu legislation , which is not legally binding for the bloc 's members , was an " important political signal " for the 27-nation union .
under the new rules , eu countries would set jail terms of at least one to three years for " publicly inciting to violence or hatred ... directed against a group of persons or a member of such a group defined by reference to race , color , religion , descent or national or ethnic origin . "
no minimum fines however , the legislation does not set any minimum fines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agreement does n't specify what constitutes incitement to violence it also leaves up to national courts to define what exactly constitutes incitement to violence or hatred .

" we are punishing concrete action , not any ideas , we are punishing incitement to hatred in a concrete way or encouraging other people to take concrete -lrb- xenophobic -rrb- action , " frattini said .
he said that the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , would try to raise awareness for the stalinist atrocities by organizing public debates " on the horrible crimes of the last century , ...
nazi crimes , stalinist crimes . "
however , the events still needed parliamentary approval in seven eu countries .
watered-down compromise the eu 's anti-racism rules - debated since 2001 - seemed at risk after latvia , lithuania and estonia had demanded making illegal the condoning , denial or trivialization of crimes against humanity committed under the soviet regime led by joseph stalin .
other eu states were opposed to the baltic demands , arguing that they did not legally recognize crimes committed under the stalinist regime or define major stalin atrocities as genocide .
zypries said the eu did not intend to decide on history but wanted to create public awareness for crimes against humanity .

" it 's only the beginning of a first real exchange of views , " one diplomat told afp on condition of anonymity , adding that " it is too early to expect any decisions . " " thursday 's meetings could help restore confidence among us , particularly with russia , but also ease german concerns , " the diplomat said . but he warned : " if things have n't cooled down after these meetings , there could be a danger of more clearly marked divisions among the allies . " germany wants us to consult moscow the united states announced in january it had begun negotiations on installing a missile interceptor bank in poland , a radar system in the czech republic plus an early warning radar somewhere in the caucasus region . washington maintains that the system would not only protect the united states but also many of its european allies against " rogue threats " from countries like iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister jung wants the us to ease moscow 's concerns but russia is irked by the idea that its old cold war foe would set this up in its back yard and has accused washington of hiding its real intentions , trying to start another arms race , and threatened to retaliate . germany is demanding closer consultation with moscow but is also concerned that parts of southern europe - bulgaria , romania , greece and turkey - would be exposed outside the shield , expected to be fully operational in 2013 . " the germans do n't know clearly yet what they really want , but they are obviously convinced that nato should play a role in it all , " the nato diplomat said . in the latest sign of washington 's efforts to assuage those fears , us officials presented russia tuesday with " new ideas " for bilateral cooperation between them on missile defense in general . russia adopts wait and see attitude another nato diplomat noted that washington wants to move quickly to get the project off the ground before us president george w. bush steps down next year . " as for the americans , they want to go fast and get the ball rolling before bush 's mandate ends , " he said .
" so they are ready for concessions , as long as the main thrust of the plan is kept . " but despite the apparently conciliatory us moves , russia was pessimistic its concerns will be addressed . " we hope , although i will say sincerely that i am not optimistic , that washington will listen to our analyses and worries , " igor ivanov , head of the russian national security council , said tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian minister ivanov says he 's not optimistic that the us will listen to moscow 's concerns a senior russian diplomat , alexander grushko , said separately that russia intended to have serious talks with nato foreign ministers in norway next week on the missile scheme and the alliance 's expansion into eastern europe . " we are counting on a deep and serious discussion in oslo concerning all aspects of the relationship between russia and nato , " he told interfax news agency . the dispute has accelerated debate at nato about its own missile plans . a study for the nato has found that there is a possible missile threat to the allies and that they have the technical means to counter it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.04.2007 german jobseekers plumb volunteerism 's possibilities großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : offering a helping hand to others may be helpful to one 's own career unlike the us , germany does not have a highly developed culture of volunteerism .
but with state coffers increasingly empty and a continually tight job market , observers say unpaid work can have hidden benefits . in the us , volunteering is widespread - a credo promoted at home and in schools , and even as pseudo-governmental doctrine .
from tutoring in after school programs , to working as an aide in a hospital , to helping build houses for the poor - americans have long been schooled in the importance of " giving back to community . " but since its postwar economic boom , germany has used its tax base wealth to provide for the needy and offer its citizens singularly generous social benefits .
volunteer work was mainly done by charitable religious groups , or young men exempted from military service , fulfilling an obligatory year of civil service . increasingly , though , young people going onto the job market are discovering the side benefits that can be reaped from a volunteer stint .
such experience can help develop the highly touted " soft skills " that are increasingly in demand in the business world , observers say . after all , anyone can call themselves a " team player , " but a well-chosen , unpaid job may give them the chance to actually prove they are one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in german statistics , sports activities are often counted as " volunteer work " " for people looking for their first job , working as a volunteer is a great advantage , " said sascha theisen , the spokesman for stepstone.de , an employment-recruiting internet portal that advises people at all stages of their career .
" it gives them the chance to gain experience , for instance in leading a project , or solving problems or managing people . " it also means they could come to the job with a network already in place of people who would be good contacts later on down the road , " he added . too much of a good thing ? but theisen warned that people who are already in the middle of their careers should be careful not to overdo it .
german employers would only really smile upon someone involved in an activity that might be beneficial to business : taking an active role in a professional association , for instance . " if someone is busy leading several sports clubs and on top of that they sing in a choir , you have to ask yourself , are they going to have enough time for their job ? "
theisen asked . christoph lender saw the benefits of volunteering first hand .
by his own account , the half-dozen years he spent leading catholic youth groups helped give him just those skills required by his first employer , a bank .
at the job interview , they discussed the work he had done coordinating events , leading discussions and meetings , and being an authority figure for 10 to 15 kids every week . " it 's a signal for a company , that in addition to your studies and any internships you do , that you also took time for other things , and were socially engaged , " lender said .
" it speaks for how you choose to spend your time . " job boost a ' byproduct ' but lender stressed that his motivation for taking up volunteer work was not some calculated attempt to improve his chances on the job market . " i did it for my own personal development , " he said .
" the good experience with the job was just a byproduct of that . " german software giant sap 's hiring approach also supports lender 's experience . spokesperson alla ruggaber-mast said the company looks for people who are motivated and independent , with highly developed " soft skills " in communication , problem solving , and conflict resolution .
but while the firm " welcomes candidates who are socially engaged , that is not a decisive factor in hiring . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a voluntary civil service year , often in old age homes , means a military exemption according to the latest german government survey on volunteerism from 2004 , some 36 percent of germans claim volunteer responsibilities , up from 34 percent five years earlier . but that high number includes such volunteer jobs as taking an active role in a sports club or cultural institute .
the figure for " social " volunteerism - such as leading a youth group - was at 5.5 percent in 2004 , up from 4 percent in 1999 . there are historical reasons that relatively few germans take on social volunteer jobs , said werner lindwehr , a spokesman for the agency for self-help and volunteering in the city of osnabrück , in the state of lower saxony . " directly after the war , volunteerism was part of society , out of necessity , " lindwehr said .
" people helped one another . " later , the state took over many of those responsibilities . " and it may be that germans started just sitting back and saying , ' i 'll let the state take care of it , " ' he acknowledged . difference to usa today , however , he sees a movement toward citizens taking a more active role .
a " culture of volunteerism " is , indeed , developing in germany , he said . " people want to do more than just vote every four years , " lindwehr said .
" they want to do something on their own doorstep , and they see that they are taken seriously by the government . " but volunteerism in germany will never have the same status as in the us , where it fills a quasi-governmental function , he added . " you ca n't compare the volunteerism with usa and here , " he said .
" the us has a much worse social system .
in my opinion , they have more need , and thus more organization . " in germany , lindwehr argued , volunteerism will grow , but it will have a more " political " character , with volunteers and governments forming a sort of bridge to get things done .
for instance , he said , people are becoming increasingly active in local citizens ' initiatives . not everyone likes it an example is a group of people who decide their playground needs renovation , but the town says there is no funding for it .
so the local government will act as a go between , and find a carpenter who is willing to donate wood , or people to help manage the construction . despite these examples , volunteerism in germany is far from being accepted as purely beneficial .
debates occasionally flare up over the usefulness of the civil-service year , and there are those who decry the notion of unpaid work at all , saying it steals jobs from people who need them . meanwhile , christoph lender said that from where he stands , he has seen little evidence that the country will be overrun by volunteers any time soon . " among my friends , i guess you would say i am one of the more socially engaged , " lender said .
" young people have a lot of other things to do - with sports , going out , the internet … everyone has to decide how they want to spend their time .

but with state coffers increasingly empty and a continually tight job market , observers say unpaid work can have hidden benefits . in the us , volunteering is widespread - a credo promoted at home and in schools , and even as pseudo-governmental doctrine .
from tutoring in after school programs , to working as an aide in a hospital , to helping build houses for the poor - americans have long been schooled in the importance of " giving back to community . " but since its postwar economic boom , germany has used its tax base wealth to provide for the needy and offer its citizens singularly generous social benefits .
volunteer work was mainly done by charitable religious groups , or young men exempted from military service , fulfilling an obligatory year of civil service . increasingly , though , young people going onto the job market are discovering the side benefits that can be reaped from a volunteer stint .
such experience can help develop the highly touted " soft skills " that are increasingly in demand in the business world , observers say . after all , anyone can call themselves a " team player , " but a well-chosen , unpaid job may give them the chance to actually prove they are one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in german statistics , sports activities are often counted as " volunteer work " " for people looking for their first job , working as a volunteer is a great advantage , " said sascha theisen , the spokesman for stepstone.de , an employment-recruiting internet portal that advises people at all stages of their career .
" it gives them the chance to gain experience , for instance in leading a project , or solving problems or managing people . " it also means they could come to the job with a network already in place of people who would be good contacts later on down the road , " he added . too much of a good thing ? but theisen warned that people who are already in the middle of their careers should be careful not to overdo it .
german employers would only really smile upon someone involved in an activity that might be beneficial to business : taking an active role in a professional association , for instance . " if someone is busy leading several sports clubs and on top of that they sing in a choir , you have to ask yourself , are they going to have enough time for their job ? "
theisen asked . christoph lender saw the benefits of volunteering first hand .
by his own account , the half-dozen years he spent leading catholic youth groups helped give him just those skills required by his first employer , a bank .
at the job interview , they discussed the work he had done coordinating events , leading discussions and meetings , and being an authority figure for 10 to 15 kids every week . " it 's a signal for a company , that in addition to your studies and any internships you do , that you also took time for other things , and were socially engaged , " lender said .
" it speaks for how you choose to spend your time . " job boost a ' byproduct ' but lender stressed that his motivation for taking up volunteer work was not some calculated attempt to improve his chances on the job market . " i did it for my own personal development , " he said .
" the good experience with the job was just a byproduct of that . " german software giant sap 's hiring approach also supports lender 's experience . spokesperson alla ruggaber-mast said the company looks for people who are motivated and independent , with highly developed " soft skills " in communication , problem solving , and conflict resolution .
but while the firm " welcomes candidates who are socially engaged , that is not a decisive factor in hiring . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a voluntary civil service year , often in old age homes , means a military exemption according to the latest german government survey on volunteerism from 2004 , some 36 percent of germans claim volunteer responsibilities , up from 34 percent five years earlier . but that high number includes such volunteer jobs as taking an active role in a sports club or cultural institute .
the figure for " social " volunteerism - such as leading a youth group - was at 5.5 percent in 2004 , up from 4 percent in 1999 . there are historical reasons that relatively few germans take on social volunteer jobs , said werner lindwehr , a spokesman for the agency for self-help and volunteering in the city of osnabrück , in the state of lower saxony . " directly after the war , volunteerism was part of society , out of necessity , " lindwehr said .
" people helped one another . " later , the state took over many of those responsibilities . " and it may be that germans started just sitting back and saying , ' i 'll let the state take care of it , " ' he acknowledged . difference to usa today , however , he sees a movement toward citizens taking a more active role .
a " culture of volunteerism " is , indeed , developing in germany , he said . " people want to do more than just vote every four years , " lindwehr said .
" they want to do something on their own doorstep , and they see that they are taken seriously by the government . " but volunteerism in germany will never have the same status as in the us , where it fills a quasi-governmental function , he added . " you ca n't compare the volunteerism with usa and here , " he said .
" the us has a much worse social system .
in my opinion , they have more need , and thus more organization . " in germany , lindwehr argued , volunteerism will grow , but it will have a more " political " character , with volunteers and governments forming a sort of bridge to get things done .
for instance , he said , people are becoming increasingly active in local citizens ' initiatives . not everyone likes it an example is a group of people who decide their playground needs renovation , but the town says there is no funding for it .
so the local government will act as a go between , and find a carpenter who is willing to donate wood , or people to help manage the construction . despite these examples , volunteerism in germany is far from being accepted as purely beneficial .
debates occasionally flare up over the usefulness of the civil-service year , and there are those who decry the notion of unpaid work at all , saying it steals jobs from people who need them . meanwhile , christoph lender said that from where he stands , he has seen little evidence that the country will be overrun by volunteers any time soon .

" a minister who spreads this kind of hysteria becomes a security risk himself , " he told the leipziger volkszeitung thursday in response to schäuble 's comment to weekly news magazine stern that presuming suspects were innocent until they had been proven guilty was inappropriate in the fight against terror . ute vogt , deputy leader of the social democrats , was equally alarmed . " anyone who questions the principle of innocent until proven guilty is the wrong person to be in charge of upholding and protecting the constitution , " she said . nothing new for germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : zypries , right , said schäuble 's comments were " imprecise and unfortunate " though she called the comments " imprecise and unfortunate , " german justice minister brigitte zypries said schäuble 's statements did not break any new ground . " naturally the presumption of innocence does not apply to averting dangers , " she said thursday .
" the presumption of innocence applies only to criminal proceedings , not preventive actions . " zypries said germany 's discussion of anti-terror measures had become " somewhat cloudy " and added that the results of schäuble 's plan " remain to be seen .

" i find it extraordinary that she has refrained from comment , " he said . finding common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many are concerned by the growing scale of preventative surveillance within the framework of new anti-terror legislation , the minister intends to expand germany 's surveillance structure significantly and , among other things , give the police automatic access to digital passport photos and fingerprints that will in future be stored on german identification documents . the minister has also proposed expanding video surveillance of public spaces , and automatic scanning and database comparison of vehicle license plates traveling or parked on public roads . the german government already gave its approval wednesday to a draft law that would require telephone operators to save call records for at least six months - in a move that data protection advocates fear will compromise citizens ' rights . the law , which zypries said is needed to bring german regulations in line with european union law , would require saving data regarding who makes contact , and when . but growing controversy surrounding such plans has prompted merkel and sdp leader kurt beck to call for a round of talks among coalition leaders .
merkel 's chief of staff in the chancellery , thomas de maiziere , is reported to have been asked to schedule a meeting " as quickly as possible , " to give ministers an opportunity to re-establish common ground with regard to anti-terror policies . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de top german politicians argue over measures to fight terrorism german politicians are at odds over a minister 's remark that the presumption of innocence does n't apply to suspected terrorists , as the cabinet on wednesday decided on new measures in the fight against terror .

five years later , there are fears in certain quarters that the national front candidate might pull off a similar feat and make it to the run-off for france 's highest office .
but there 's little chance of that happening , according to alain howiller , president of the institute of political studies in strasbourg .
" le pen wo n't make it to the second round this time , " he said .
frank baasner , director of the german-french institute echoed the view .
" experience shows these things do n't repeat themselves , " he said .
" national identity " as a vote-getter but campaign managers at former interior minister nicolas sarkozy 's conservative ump camp remain wary .
according to french satirical weekly canard enchaine , sarkozy 's aides reckon that le pen 's anti-immigrant national front could take as much as 20 percent of the vote .
daniela schwarzer , an expert on france at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin also said that le pen 's influence could not be written off .
" the national front 's voter potential is possibly higher than the surveys show it to be , " she told dw-world.de. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy sings the national anthem with kids at a party congress in paris sarkozy 's campaign managers seem convinced that the election will only be won on the right .
and as if to emphasize that point , their candidate has been focusing all his energies on the topic of national identity in the final days leading up to the first round of voting on sunday .
the conservative frontrunner has said that only those who speak french sufficiently well will be allowed to settle down permanently in france .
sarkozy has also backed quotas for immigrants and choosing them on the basis of professional qualifications .
he has said he would set up a " ministry for immigration and national identity " if he 's elected .
" france is embittered that its national identity is endangered by unlimited immigration , " sarokzy said recently .
that 's a classic ploy of the far right , according to alain howiller .
" those are ideas that le pen has been propagating for 25 years , " he said .
royal shows nationalist streak and it 's not just sarkozy angling for votes from the far right .
even sarkozy 's socialist challenger , segolene royal , has displayed a strong nationalist streak in recent weeks .
at a campaign rally two weeks ago , royal urged her supporters for the first time to sing the national anthem .
over the weekend , royal stepped up her new-found nationalist drive by urging all french to have a french flag at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal has shown a nationalist streak in recent weeks experts , such as daniela schwarzer , worry that the " irresponsible " way royal and sarkozy have been flirting with the topic of national identity could have serious long-terms political consequences .
" if the whole discussion in a left-wing party like the ps -lrb- the socialist party -rrb- and a moderate right-wing party such as the ump leans so strongly towards the far-right fringe then it changes the whole atmosphere in society , " schwarzer said .
" then even openly xenophobic slogans do n't horrify anymore . "
le pen in unfamiliar territory sarkozy and royal 's right-wing dabbling may end up benefiting le pen , not just in the long term , but also more immediately .
the veteran politician has said he 's " happy " about the right tilt the election campaign in france has taken so far .
" that 's because it shows all the french that i 'm right , " le pen said recently .
the front national candidate has been charting unfamiliar territory during his campaign this time .
in a bid to stay relevant in the fight for both frustrated voters on the far right as well as protest voters , the 78-year-old has a young women , apparently from north africa , advertise for him on posters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-marie le pen is fishing for votes in unfamiliar waters le pen has also been campaigning in the depressed suburbs with the slogan : " neither friend , nor black , white nor north african - french ! "
the strategy might just work .
according to studies by the paris-based cevipof institute , around 100,000 immigrants from north africa could vote for le pen on sunday .
" everything but sarkozy " the one campaign slogan residents of the suburbs seem to agree on is : " everything but sarkozy . "
it 's obvious that they have n't forgotten the conservative frontrunner who described violent youth there as " scum " during riots in late 2005 .
a long announced campaign visit by sarkozy to the lyon suburb of villeurbanne , where the ump candidate planned to talk to youth amid whirring television cameras in an obvious publicity gimmick , never took place .
" many youth in the suburbs will vote for le pen because he offers them a chance to explode a system that they hate , because they see no chance for themselves in it , " said schwarzer .

" the allies were convinced and are convinced that there are no implications of the united states ' system for the strategic balance , " nato secretary general jaap de hoop scheffer said after the highest-level talks ever on the issue . " ten interceptors will not , can not affect the strategic balance and 10 interceptors can not pose a threat to russia , " he said , after meetings between the 26 nato allies followed by a so-called nato-russia council . washington announced in january plans to extend its missile shield into europe to counter a potential missile attack from " rogue states " like iran , and possibly north korea . it would involve 10 missile interceptors without warheads set up in poland and a radar system in the czech republic to track any attack .

" the representatives in the nato-russia council today ... indicated that the russian government was going to study our proposal in greater detail before providing a more full response , " he said . russian representative konstantin totsky conceded the offer had not been rejected yet , but he said that moscow has grown tired of being dictated to by washington .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 19.04.2007 french election campaign swerves to the right großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right politicians are trying to woo voters in the french suburbs as france prepares to go to the polls , even moderate candidates are trying to score points with right-wing slogans , while the real right-wingers are attempting to woo immigrants from the suburbs . far-right veteran jean-marie le pen stunned france in the presidential election in 2002 by clinching 16.9 percent of the vote in the first round and knocking then-socialist candidate lionel jospin out of the race .
five years later , there are fears in certain quarters that the national front candidate might pull off a similar feat and make it to the run-off for france 's highest office .
but there 's little chance of that happening , according to alain howiller , president of the institute of political studies in strasbourg .
" le pen wo n't make it to the second round this time , " he said .
frank baasner , director of the german-french institute echoed the view .
" experience shows these things do n't repeat themselves , " he said .
" national identity " as a vote-getter but campaign managers at former interior minister nicolas sarkozy 's conservative ump camp remain wary .
according to french satirical weekly canard enchaine , sarkozy 's aides reckon that le pen 's anti-immigrant national front could take as much as 20 percent of the vote .
daniela schwarzer , an expert on france at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin also said that le pen 's influence could not be written off .
" the national front 's voter potential is possibly higher than the surveys show it to be , " she told dw-world.de. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy sings the national anthem with kids at a party congress in paris sarkozy 's campaign managers seem convinced that the election will only be won on the right .
and as if to emphasize that point , their candidate has been focusing all his energies on the topic of national identity in the final days leading up to the first round of voting on sunday .
the conservative frontrunner has said that only those who speak french sufficiently well will be allowed to settle down permanently in france .
sarkozy has also backed quotas for immigrants and choosing them on the basis of professional qualifications .
he has said he would set up a " ministry for immigration and national identity " if he 's elected .
" france is embittered that its national identity is endangered by unlimited immigration , " sarokzy said recently .
that 's a classic ploy of the far right , according to alain howiller .
" those are ideas that le pen has been propagating for 25 years , " he said .
royal shows nationalist streak and it 's not just sarkozy angling for votes from the far right .
even sarkozy 's socialist challenger , segolene royal , has displayed a strong nationalist streak in recent weeks .
at a campaign rally two weeks ago , royal urged her supporters for the first time to sing the national anthem .
over the weekend , royal stepped up her new-found nationalist drive by urging all french to have a french flag at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal has shown a nationalist streak in recent weeks experts , such as daniela schwarzer , worry that the " irresponsible " way royal and sarkozy have been flirting with the topic of national identity could have serious long-terms political consequences .
" if the whole discussion in a left-wing party like the ps -lrb- the socialist party -rrb- and a moderate right-wing party such as the ump leans so strongly towards the far-right fringe then it changes the whole atmosphere in society , " schwarzer said .
" then even openly xenophobic slogans do n't horrify anymore . "
le pen in unfamiliar territory sarkozy and royal 's right-wing dabbling may end up benefiting le pen , not just in the long term , but also more immediately .
the veteran politician has said he 's " happy " about the right tilt the election campaign in france has taken so far .
" that 's because it shows all the french that i 'm right , " le pen said recently .
the front national candidate has been charting unfamiliar territory during his campaign this time .
in a bid to stay relevant in the fight for both frustrated voters on the far right as well as protest voters , the 78-year-old has a young women , apparently from north africa , advertise for him on posters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-marie le pen is fishing for votes in unfamiliar waters le pen has also been campaigning in the depressed suburbs with the slogan : " neither friend , nor black , white nor north african - french ! "
the strategy might just work .
according to studies by the paris-based cevipof institute , around 100,000 immigrants from north africa could vote for le pen on sunday .
" everything but sarkozy " the one campaign slogan residents of the suburbs seem to agree on is : " everything but sarkozy . "
it 's obvious that they have n't forgotten the conservative frontrunner who described violent youth there as " scum " during riots in late 2005 .
a long announced campaign visit by sarkozy to the lyon suburb of villeurbanne , where the ump candidate planned to talk to youth amid whirring television cameras in an obvious publicity gimmick , never took place .
" many youth in the suburbs will vote for le pen because he offers them a chance to explode a system that they hate , because they see no chance for themselves in it , " said schwarzer .
" for that they 're ready to overlook his xenophobic comments .

but with state coffers increasingly empty and a continually tight job market , observers say unpaid work can have hidden benefits . in the us , volunteering is widespread - a credo promoted at home and in schools , and even as pseudo-governmental doctrine .
from tutoring in after school programs , to working as an aide in a hospital , to helping build houses for the poor - americans have long been schooled in the importance of " giving back to community . " but since its postwar economic boom , germany has used its tax base wealth to provide for the needy and offer its citizens singularly generous social benefits .
volunteer work was mainly done by charitable religious groups , or young men exempted from military service , fulfilling an obligatory year of civil service . increasingly , though , young people going onto the job market are discovering the side benefits that can be reaped from a volunteer stint .
such experience can help develop the highly touted " soft skills " that are increasingly in demand in the business world , observers say . after all , anyone can call themselves a " team player , " but a well-chosen , unpaid job may give them the chance to actually prove they are one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in german statistics , sports activities are often counted as " volunteer work " " for people looking for their first job , working as a volunteer is a great advantage , " said sascha theisen , the spokesman for stepstone.de , an employment-recruiting internet portal that advises people at all stages of their career .
" it gives them the chance to gain experience , for instance in leading a project , or solving problems or managing people . " it also means they could come to the job with a network already in place of people who would be good contacts later on down the road , " he added . too much of a good thing ? but theisen warned that people who are already in the middle of their careers should be careful not to overdo it .
german employers would only really smile upon someone involved in an activity that might be beneficial to business : taking an active role in a professional association , for instance . " if someone is busy leading several sports clubs and on top of that they sing in a choir , you have to ask yourself , are they going to have enough time for their job ? "
theisen asked . christoph lender saw the benefits of volunteering first hand .
by his own account , the half-dozen years he spent leading catholic youth groups helped give him just those skills required by his first employer , a bank .
at the job interview , they discussed the work he had done coordinating events , leading discussions and meetings , and being an authority figure for 10 to 15 kids every week . " it 's a signal for a company , that in addition to your studies and any internships you do , that you also took time for other things , and were socially engaged , " lender said .
" it speaks for how you choose to spend your time . " job boost a ' byproduct ' but lender stressed that his motivation for taking up volunteer work was not some calculated attempt to improve his chances on the job market . " i did it for my own personal development , " he said .
" the good experience with the job was just a byproduct of that . " german software giant sap 's hiring approach also supports lender 's experience . spokesperson alla ruggaber-mast said the company looks for people who are motivated and independent , with highly developed " soft skills " in communication , problem solving , and conflict resolution .
but while the firm " welcomes candidates who are socially engaged , that is not a decisive factor in hiring . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a voluntary civil service year , often in old age homes , means a military exemption according to the latest german government survey on volunteerism from 2004 , some 36 percent of germans claim volunteer responsibilities , up from 34 percent five years earlier . but that high number includes such volunteer jobs as taking an active role in a sports club or cultural institute .
the figure for " social " volunteerism - such as leading a youth group - was at 5.5 percent in 2004 , up from 4 percent in 1999 . there are historical reasons that relatively few germans take on social volunteer jobs , said werner lindwehr , a spokesman for the agency for self-help and volunteering in the city of osnabrück , in the state of lower saxony . " directly after the war , volunteerism was part of society , out of necessity , " lindwehr said .
" people helped one another . " later , the state took over many of those responsibilities . " and it may be that germans started just sitting back and saying , ' i 'll let the state take care of it , " ' he acknowledged . difference to usa today , however , he sees a movement toward citizens taking a more active role .
a " culture of volunteerism " is , indeed , developing in germany , he said . " people want to do more than just vote every four years , " lindwehr said .
" they want to do something on their own doorstep , and they see that they are taken seriously by the government . " but volunteerism in germany will never have the same status as in the us , where it fills a quasi-governmental function , he added . " you ca n't compare the volunteerism with usa and here , " he said .
" the us has a much worse social system .
in my opinion , they have more need , and thus more organization . " in germany , lindwehr argued , volunteerism will grow , but it will have a more " political " character , with volunteers and governments forming a sort of bridge to get things done .
for instance , he said , people are becoming increasingly active in local citizens ' initiatives . not everyone likes it an example is a group of people who decide their playground needs renovation , but the town says there is no funding for it .
so the local government will act as a go between , and find a carpenter who is willing to donate wood , or people to help manage the construction . despite these examples , volunteerism in germany is far from being accepted as purely beneficial .
debates occasionally flare up over the usefulness of the civil-service year , and there are those who decry the notion of unpaid work at all , saying it steals jobs from people who need them . meanwhile , christoph lender said that from where he stands , he has seen little evidence that the country will be overrun by volunteers any time soon . " among my friends , i guess you would say i am one of the more socially engaged , " lender said .

" they want to do something on their own doorstep , and they see that they are taken seriously by the government . " but volunteerism in germany will never have the same status as in the us , where it fills a quasi-governmental function , he added . " you ca n't compare the volunteerism with usa and here , " he said .
" the us has a much worse social system .
in my opinion , they have more need , and thus more organization . " in germany , lindwehr argued , volunteerism will grow , but it will have a more " political " character , with volunteers and governments forming a sort of bridge to get things done .
for instance , he said , people are becoming increasingly active in local citizens ' initiatives . not everyone likes it an example is a group of people who decide their playground needs renovation , but the town says there is no funding for it .
so the local government will act as a go between , and find a carpenter who is willing to donate wood , or people to help manage the construction . despite these examples , volunteerism in germany is far from being accepted as purely beneficial .
debates occasionally flare up over the usefulness of the civil-service year , and there are those who decry the notion of unpaid work at all , saying it steals jobs from people who need them . meanwhile , christoph lender said that from where he stands , he has seen little evidence that the country will be overrun by volunteers any time soon . " among my friends , i guess you would say i am one of the more socially engaged , " lender said .
" young people have a lot of other things to do - with sports , going out , the internet … everyone has to decide how they want to spend their time .

five years later , there are fears in certain quarters that the national front candidate might pull off a similar feat and make it to the run-off for france 's highest office .
but there 's little chance of that happening , according to alain howiller , president of the institute of political studies in strasbourg .
" le pen wo n't make it to the second round this time , " he said .
frank baasner , director of the german-french institute echoed the view .
" experience shows these things do n't repeat themselves , " he said .
" national identity " as a vote-getter but campaign managers at former interior minister nicolas sarkozy 's conservative ump camp remain wary .
according to french satirical weekly canard enchaine , sarkozy 's aides reckon that le pen 's anti-immigrant national front could take as much as 20 percent of the vote .
daniela schwarzer , an expert on france at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin also said that le pen 's influence could not be written off .
" the national front 's voter potential is possibly higher than the surveys show it to be , " she told dw-world.de. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy sings the national anthem with kids at a party congress in paris sarkozy 's campaign managers seem convinced that the election will only be won on the right .
and as if to emphasize that point , their candidate has been focusing all his energies on the topic of national identity in the final days leading up to the first round of voting on sunday .
the conservative frontrunner has said that only those who speak french sufficiently well will be allowed to settle down permanently in france .
sarkozy has also backed quotas for immigrants and choosing them on the basis of professional qualifications .
he has said he would set up a " ministry for immigration and national identity " if he 's elected .
" france is embittered that its national identity is endangered by unlimited immigration , " sarokzy said recently .
that 's a classic ploy of the far right , according to alain howiller .
" those are ideas that le pen has been propagating for 25 years , " he said .
royal shows nationalist streak and it 's not just sarkozy angling for votes from the far right .
even sarkozy 's socialist challenger , segolene royal , has displayed a strong nationalist streak in recent weeks .
at a campaign rally two weeks ago , royal urged her supporters for the first time to sing the national anthem .
over the weekend , royal stepped up her new-found nationalist drive by urging all french to have a french flag at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal has shown a nationalist streak in recent weeks experts , such as daniela schwarzer , worry that the " irresponsible " way royal and sarkozy have been flirting with the topic of national identity could have serious long-terms political consequences .
" if the whole discussion in a left-wing party like the ps -lrb- the socialist party -rrb- and a moderate right-wing party such as the ump leans so strongly towards the far-right fringe then it changes the whole atmosphere in society , " schwarzer said .
" then even openly xenophobic slogans do n't horrify anymore . "
le pen in unfamiliar territory sarkozy and royal 's right-wing dabbling may end up benefiting le pen , not just in the long term , but also more immediately .
the veteran politician has said he 's " happy " about the right tilt the election campaign in france has taken so far .
" that 's because it shows all the french that i 'm right , " le pen said recently .
the front national candidate has been charting unfamiliar territory during his campaign this time .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-marie le pen is fishing for votes in unfamiliar waters le pen has also been campaigning in the depressed suburbs with the slogan : " neither friend , nor black , white nor north african - french ! "
the strategy might just work .
according to studies by the paris-based cevipof institute , around 100,000 immigrants from north africa could vote for le pen on sunday .

it 's obvious that they have n't forgotten the conservative frontrunner who described violent youth there as " scum " during riots in late 2005 .
a long announced campaign visit by sarkozy to the lyon suburb of villeurbanne , where the ump candidate planned to talk to youth amid whirring television cameras in an obvious publicity gimmick , never took place .

they have to get their stadiums , transport systems and hotels up to scratch and overcome a legacy of hooliganism and corruption . a day after poland and ukraine scored a shock win over italy and fellow joint bidders hungary and croatia in the race to clinch the major soccer tournament - which takes place every four years - the enormity of the task facing the two host nations was beginning to sink in .
they will need nothing short of a herculean construction and investor drive to build stadium , hotels and other infrastructure .
in addition , security worries , hooliganism and corruption remain nagging problems .
organizers and politicians , however , insist they will roll up their sleeves in order to ensure the success of the soccer championships .
poland tries to calm jitters in the lead up to wednesday 's decision by european soccer 's governing body , uefa , at a meeting in cardiff , the polish-ukrainian bidders tried to calm jitters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president yushchenko -lrb- r . -rrb- and polish president kaczynski polish president lech kaczynski who traveled to the welsh capital with ukrainian president viktor yushchenko to make an 11th-hour pitch for their bid , said there was much work to be done .
" we must not forget the enormity of the task of organizing euro 2012 , but that is also excellent news for poland , " kaczynski said .
" there will be new stadiums built in warsaw , gdansk , wroclaw and poznan .
that can only be seen in a positive light , " he added .
" five years is long enough and i am sure that with the mobilization and determination of the local authorities and the people , we will succeed . "
it will be the first time that either poland or ukraine will host a major soccer championship .
it 's the third major sporting event , following the beijing olympic games in 2008 and the soccer world cup in south africa in 2010 , to break away from the traditional grounds of western europe and the americas .
infrastructure in need of massive overhaul polish authorities said last week that around 26 billion euros -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- , including eu financing , have been earmarked to upgrade infrastructure .
fans will need every bit of it .
anyone wanting to travel by road from gdansk in northern poland to donetsk , a host city in eastern ukraine , has to traverse 2,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,240 miles -rrb- .
the 22-hour car or bus trip - not counting the lengthy wait at the polish-ukrainian border - is mostly on single lane roads .
only 23 kilometers -lrb- 14 miles -rrb- of the trip is on motorway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the few four-lane motorways in poland , near the ukraine border despite receiving vast eu funding since the fall of communism in 1989 and becoming a member of the bloc in 2004 , poland still has n't built a basic motorway network connecting its major cities .
the situation is worse in ukraine .
there , train travel is hardly better : it currently takes 43 hours , at best , to get from gdansk to donetsk .
lack of investment means it is too dangerous to use high speed trains on the aging tracks .
while booming low-cost airlines carry hundreds of thousands of poles between their homes and western europe each year , there are still no cheap links between ukraine and poland .
outside major cities , particularly in ukraine , good hotels are hard to come by - or at least in sufficient numbers to cater to tens of thousands of fans , journalists and soccer officials .
hooliganism , right wing crimes raise concerns polish soccer is also blighted by hooliganism .
fears that polish fans would cause trouble at last year 's world cup in neighboring germany led to a massive police operation in both countries , although in the end the hooligans stayed away .
in addition , polish soccer 's image has been dented by corruption .
a two-year-old match-fixing scandal has led to more than 60 arrests , including several referees , a member of the polish soccer association -lrb- pzpn -rrb- leadership and a string of club officials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hooliganism continues to blight polish soccer on thursday , polish sports minister tomasz lipiec vowed to make polish soccer graft-free by the time of the euro 2012 .
" we want to sort this problem out completely by 2012 .
i 'm convinced that we will manage it even earlier , " lipiec said .
" the championships must take place in an atmosphere of fair play . "
ukraine will also have to do more to improve security for foreign fans .
foreign embassies regularly warn their citizens about the risk of attacks by skinheads in the country .
poland , too , has a flourishing far-right scene .
" good news for ukrainians " despite the huge problems , kiev remains confident that it can manage to surmount most challenges .
indeed , there are signs that the country is already gearing up to tackle the gargantuan task .
although kiev is currently locked in political crisis pitting supporters of the president and prime minister against each other , the two sides are united about euro 2012 .
four ukrainian cities selected as venues have already started preparations including upgrading their existing soccer facilities .
and the kiev mayor 's office has said the capital would completely renovate its 86,000-seat olympic stadium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is confident that investors will step in to build much needed stadiums in the west of the country , lviv city authorities have said they will renovate the city 's 28,000-seat stadium and increase its capacity .
ukraine 's reigning champions , shakhtar donetsk , are currently building a new 50,000-seat ground , while dnepropetrovsk , who finished sixth last season , had also began the construction of a new arena in their town .
ukraine 's sports minister , viktor korzh , said major investors were ready to step in alongside the authorities .
" there are serious investors , who are ready to invest up to 37 billion hryvnias -lrb- about 5.7 billion euros , $ 7.7 billion -rrb- in the construction of airports , roads , hotels and improving sports infrastructure , " he said .
roman shpek , ukraine 's ambassador to the european union , said the decision to allow ukraine to be co-host of the euro 2012 could not be underestimated .
" it is one more step toward ukraine 's integration to the eu , " shpek told the international herald tribune .

they have to get their stadiums , transport systems and hotels up to scratch and overcome a legacy of hooliganism and corruption . a day after poland and ukraine scored a shock win over italy and fellow joint bidders hungary and croatia in the race to clinch the major soccer tournament - which takes place every four years - the enormity of the task facing the two host nations was beginning to sink in .
they will need nothing short of a herculean construction and investor drive to build stadium , hotels and other infrastructure .
in addition , security worries , hooliganism and corruption remain nagging problems .
organizers and politicians , however , insist they will roll up their sleeves in order to ensure the success of the soccer championships .
poland tries to calm jitters in the lead up to wednesday 's decision by european soccer 's governing body , uefa , at a meeting in cardiff , the polish-ukrainian bidders tried to calm jitters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president yushchenko -lrb- r . -rrb- and polish president kaczynski polish president lech kaczynski who traveled to the welsh capital with ukrainian president viktor yushchenko to make an 11th-hour pitch for their bid , said there was much work to be done .
" we must not forget the enormity of the task of organizing euro 2012 , but that is also excellent news for poland , " kaczynski said .
" there will be new stadiums built in warsaw , gdansk , wroclaw and poznan .
that can only be seen in a positive light , " he added .
" five years is long enough and i am sure that with the mobilization and determination of the local authorities and the people , we will succeed . "
it will be the first time that either poland or ukraine will host a major soccer championship .
it 's the third major sporting event , following the beijing olympic games in 2008 and the soccer world cup in south africa in 2010 , to break away from the traditional grounds of western europe and the americas .
infrastructure in need of massive overhaul polish authorities said last week that around 26 billion euros -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- , including eu financing , have been earmarked to upgrade infrastructure .
fans will need every bit of it .
anyone wanting to travel by road from gdansk in northern poland to donetsk , a host city in eastern ukraine , has to traverse 2,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,240 miles -rrb- .
the 22-hour car or bus trip - not counting the lengthy wait at the polish-ukrainian border - is mostly on single lane roads .
only 23 kilometers -lrb- 14 miles -rrb- of the trip is on motorway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the few four-lane motorways in poland , near the ukraine border despite receiving vast eu funding since the fall of communism in 1989 and becoming a member of the bloc in 2004 , poland still has n't built a basic motorway network connecting its major cities .
the situation is worse in ukraine .
there , train travel is hardly better : it currently takes 43 hours , at best , to get from gdansk to donetsk .
lack of investment means it is too dangerous to use high speed trains on the aging tracks .
while booming low-cost airlines carry hundreds of thousands of poles between their homes and western europe each year , there are still no cheap links between ukraine and poland .
outside major cities , particularly in ukraine , good hotels are hard to come by - or at least in sufficient numbers to cater to tens of thousands of fans , journalists and soccer officials .
hooliganism , right wing crimes raise concerns polish soccer is also blighted by hooliganism .
fears that polish fans would cause trouble at last year 's world cup in neighboring germany led to a massive police operation in both countries , although in the end the hooligans stayed away .
in addition , polish soccer 's image has been dented by corruption .
a two-year-old match-fixing scandal has led to more than 60 arrests , including several referees , a member of the polish soccer association -lrb- pzpn -rrb- leadership and a string of club officials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hooliganism continues to blight polish soccer on thursday , polish sports minister tomasz lipiec vowed to make polish soccer graft-free by the time of the euro 2012 .
" we want to sort this problem out completely by 2012 .
i 'm convinced that we will manage it even earlier , " lipiec said .
" the championships must take place in an atmosphere of fair play . "
ukraine will also have to do more to improve security for foreign fans .
foreign embassies regularly warn their citizens about the risk of attacks by skinheads in the country .
poland , too , has a flourishing far-right scene .
" good news for ukrainians " despite the huge problems , kiev remains confident that it can manage to surmount most challenges .
indeed , there are signs that the country is already gearing up to tackle the gargantuan task .
although kiev is currently locked in political crisis pitting supporters of the president and prime minister against each other , the two sides are united about euro 2012 .
four ukrainian cities selected as venues have already started preparations including upgrading their existing soccer facilities .
and the kiev mayor 's office has said the capital would completely renovate its 86,000-seat olympic stadium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is confident that investors will step in to build much needed stadiums in the west of the country , lviv city authorities have said they will renovate the city 's 28,000-seat stadium and increase its capacity .
ukraine 's reigning champions , shakhtar donetsk , are currently building a new 50,000-seat ground , while dnepropetrovsk , who finished sixth last season , had also began the construction of a new arena in their town .
ukraine 's sports minister , viktor korzh , said major investors were ready to step in alongside the authorities .
" there are serious investors , who are ready to invest up to 37 billion hryvnias -lrb- about 5.7 billion euros , $ 7.7 billion -rrb- in the construction of airports , roads , hotels and improving sports infrastructure , " he said .
roman shpek , ukraine 's ambassador to the european union , said the decision to allow ukraine to be co-host of the euro 2012 could not be underestimated .
" it is one more step toward ukraine 's integration to the eu , " shpek told the international herald tribune .

" if you get the first goal early in such a match it is a major factor . "
frankfurt coach friedhelm funkel said he knew his team was in over its head .
" last year we beat them narrowly in the round of 16 , but tonight they were clearly the better team , " he said .
" we have lost against the team which will win the cup . "

" it 's only the beginning of a first real exchange of views , " one diplomat told afp on condition of anonymity , adding that " it is too early to expect any decisions . " " thursday 's meetings could help restore confidence among us , particularly with russia , but also ease german concerns , " the diplomat said . but he warned : " if things have n't cooled down after these meetings , there could be a danger of more clearly marked divisions among the allies . " germany wants us to consult moscow the united states announced in january it had begun negotiations on installing a missile interceptor bank in poland , a radar system in the czech republic plus an early warning radar somewhere in the caucasus region . washington maintains that the system would not only protect the united states but also many of its european allies against " rogue threats " from countries like iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister jung wants the us to ease moscow 's concerns but russia is irked by the idea that its old cold war foe would set this up in its back yard and has accused washington of hiding its real intentions , trying to start another arms race , and threatened to retaliate . germany is demanding closer consultation with moscow but is also concerned that parts of southern europe - bulgaria , romania , greece and turkey - would be exposed outside the shield , expected to be fully operational in 2013 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 19.04.2007 euphoric euro 2012 hosts poland , ukraine brace for hard work großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : warsaw erupted in celebrations wednesday poland and ukraine face a mammoth task in preparing for euro 2012 .
they have to get their stadiums , transport systems and hotels up to scratch and overcome a legacy of hooliganism and corruption . a day after poland and ukraine scored a shock win over italy and fellow joint bidders hungary and croatia in the race to clinch the major soccer tournament - which takes place every four years - the enormity of the task facing the two host nations was beginning to sink in .
they will need nothing short of a herculean construction and investor drive to build stadium , hotels and other infrastructure .
in addition , security worries , hooliganism and corruption remain nagging problems .
organizers and politicians , however , insist they will roll up their sleeves in order to ensure the success of the soccer championships .
poland tries to calm jitters in the lead up to wednesday 's decision by european soccer 's governing body , uefa , at a meeting in cardiff , the polish-ukrainian bidders tried to calm jitters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president yushchenko -lrb- r . -rrb- and polish president kaczynski polish president lech kaczynski who traveled to the welsh capital with ukrainian president viktor yushchenko to make an 11th-hour pitch for their bid , said there was much work to be done .
" we must not forget the enormity of the task of organizing euro 2012 , but that is also excellent news for poland , " kaczynski said .
" there will be new stadiums built in warsaw , gdansk , wroclaw and poznan .
that can only be seen in a positive light , " he added .
" five years is long enough and i am sure that with the mobilization and determination of the local authorities and the people , we will succeed . "
it will be the first time that either poland or ukraine will host a major soccer championship .
it 's the third major sporting event , following the beijing olympic games in 2008 and the soccer world cup in south africa in 2010 , to break away from the traditional grounds of western europe and the americas .
infrastructure in need of massive overhaul polish authorities said last week that around 26 billion euros -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- , including eu financing , have been earmarked to upgrade infrastructure .
fans will need every bit of it .
anyone wanting to travel by road from gdansk in northern poland to donetsk , a host city in eastern ukraine , has to traverse 2,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,240 miles -rrb- .
the 22-hour car or bus trip - not counting the lengthy wait at the polish-ukrainian border - is mostly on single lane roads .
only 23 kilometers -lrb- 14 miles -rrb- of the trip is on motorway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the few four-lane motorways in poland , near the ukraine border despite receiving vast eu funding since the fall of communism in 1989 and becoming a member of the bloc in 2004 , poland still has n't built a basic motorway network connecting its major cities .
the situation is worse in ukraine .
there , train travel is hardly better : it currently takes 43 hours , at best , to get from gdansk to donetsk .
lack of investment means it is too dangerous to use high speed trains on the aging tracks .
while booming low-cost airlines carry hundreds of thousands of poles between their homes and western europe each year , there are still no cheap links between ukraine and poland .
outside major cities , particularly in ukraine , good hotels are hard to come by - or at least in sufficient numbers to cater to tens of thousands of fans , journalists and soccer officials .
hooliganism , right wing crimes raise concerns polish soccer is also blighted by hooliganism .
fears that polish fans would cause trouble at last year 's world cup in neighboring germany led to a massive police operation in both countries , although in the end the hooligans stayed away .
in addition , polish soccer 's image has been dented by corruption .
a two-year-old match-fixing scandal has led to more than 60 arrests , including several referees , a member of the polish soccer association -lrb- pzpn -rrb- leadership and a string of club officials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hooliganism continues to blight polish soccer on thursday , polish sports minister tomasz lipiec vowed to make polish soccer graft-free by the time of the euro 2012 .
" we want to sort this problem out completely by 2012 .
i 'm convinced that we will manage it even earlier , " lipiec said .
" the championships must take place in an atmosphere of fair play . "
ukraine will also have to do more to improve security for foreign fans .
foreign embassies regularly warn their citizens about the risk of attacks by skinheads in the country .
poland , too , has a flourishing far-right scene .
" good news for ukrainians " despite the huge problems , kiev remains confident that it can manage to surmount most challenges .
indeed , there are signs that the country is already gearing up to tackle the gargantuan task .
although kiev is currently locked in political crisis pitting supporters of the president and prime minister against each other , the two sides are united about euro 2012 .
four ukrainian cities selected as venues have already started preparations including upgrading their existing soccer facilities .
and the kiev mayor 's office has said the capital would completely renovate its 86,000-seat olympic stadium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is confident that investors will step in to build much needed stadiums in the west of the country , lviv city authorities have said they will renovate the city 's 28,000-seat stadium and increase its capacity .
ukraine 's reigning champions , shakhtar donetsk , are currently building a new 50,000-seat ground , while dnepropetrovsk , who finished sixth last season , had also began the construction of a new arena in their town .
ukraine 's sports minister , viktor korzh , said major investors were ready to step in alongside the authorities .
" there are serious investors , who are ready to invest up to 37 billion hryvnias -lrb- about 5.7 billion euros , $ 7.7 billion -rrb- in the construction of airports , roads , hotels and improving sports infrastructure , " he said .
roman shpek , ukraine 's ambassador to the european union , said the decision to allow ukraine to be co-host of the euro 2012 could not be underestimated .
" it is one more step toward ukraine 's integration to the eu , " shpek told the international herald tribune .

" the current upturn will continue , but the pace of expansion will be slower than last year , " the institutes said .
" a key reason for this is restrictive fiscal policy , which is likely to knock around half a percentage point of gross domestic product -lrb- gdp -rrb- growth .
and the european central bank , too , is switching to neutral in its monetary policy . " optimism bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the economic institutes hiked their projections for 2007 and 2008 the five institutes - diw in berlin , ifo in munich , ifw in kiel , ihw in halle and rwi in essen - expected the ecb to raise its benchmark " refi " refinancing rate by a further 0.25 percent this summer to 4.0 percent . nevertheless , the tighter monetary conditions would not hamper " robust economic expansion , since long-term interest rates remain comparatively low , " the report said . contributing to gdp growth of 2.4 percent this year - in their previous report last autumn , the institutes had projected growth of 1.4 percent for 2007 - would be strong domestic demand , the institutes said . " household consumption will gradually improve as result of higher disposable income , " the think tanks predicted .
" investment remains strong .
and exports will continue to support the economy . " reduced unemployment the strong economic performance would lead to an improvement on the labor market , with the annual average jobless total set to fall below four million for the first time since 2001 . the jobless total would fall to 3.77 million in 2007 from 4.49 million in 2006 and then decline to further to 3.47 million in 2008 , the institutes said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the number of people out of work may fall by some 700,000 the jobless rate , which measures the total number of unemployed as a proportion of the working population as a whole , was projected to decline from 10.3 percent in 2006 to 8.7 percent in 2007 and 8.0 percent in 2008 . the robust economy would also have a positive effect on german debts , pushing the public deficit down from 1.7 percent of gdp in 2006 to just 0.6 percent of gdp in 2007 .
germany was expected to achieve a balanced budget , or a deficit ratio of zero , in 2008 , according to the report . under the terms of the european stability and growth pact , eurozone members are not allowed to run up public deficits in excess of 3.0 percent of gdp . but germany , the main architect of the pact , was in breach of the 3.0-percent rule every year between 2002 and 2005 . on the inflation front , german inflation was projected to pick up only fractionally to 1.8 percent in both 2007 and 2008 from 1.7 percent in 2006 , the institutes said . the ecb defines price stability as inflation rates close to but just below 2.0 percent . dw staff / afp -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de optimism grows on outlook for german economy the run of good news for the german economy , europe 's biggest , looks set to continue for some time , with bundesbank president axel weber arguing on monday that current growth marks only the beginning of a longer upturn .

" i find it extraordinary that she has refrained from comment , " he said . finding common ground bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many are concerned by the growing scale of preventative surveillance within the framework of new anti-terror legislation , the minister intends to expand germany 's surveillance structure significantly and , among other things , give the police automatic access to digital passport photos and fingerprints that will in future be stored on german identification documents . the minister has also proposed expanding video surveillance of public spaces , and automatic scanning and database comparison of vehicle license plates traveling or parked on public roads . the german government already gave its approval wednesday to a draft law that would require telephone operators to save call records for at least six months - in a move that data protection advocates fear will compromise citizens ' rights . the law , which zypries said is needed to bring german regulations in line with european union law , would require saving data regarding who makes contact , and when . but growing controversy surrounding such plans has prompted merkel and sdp leader kurt beck to call for a round of talks among coalition leaders .
merkel 's chief of staff in the chancellery , thomas de maiziere , is reported to have been asked to schedule a meeting " as quickly as possible , " to give ministers an opportunity to re-establish common ground with regard to anti-terror policies . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de top german politicians argue over measures to fight terrorism german politicians are at odds over a minister 's remark that the presumption of innocence does n't apply to suspected terrorists , as the cabinet on wednesday decided on new measures in the fight against terror .

" racism and xenophobia can only be combatted effectively inside society , " german justice minister brigitte zypries told reporters after a meeting with her counterparts in luxembourg .
" criminal measures can only be supplementary , they can never be sufficient in combatting racism and xenophobia in itself , " said zypries whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
zypries said that the agreed piece of eu legislation , which is not legally binding for the bloc 's members , was an " important political signal " for the 27-nation union .
under the new rules , eu countries would set jail terms of at least one to three years for " publicly inciting to violence or hatred ... directed against a group of persons or a member of such a group defined by reference to race , color , religion , descent or national or ethnic origin . "
no minimum fines however , the legislation does not set any minimum fines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agreement does n't specify what constitutes incitement to violence it also leaves up to national courts to define what exactly constitutes incitement to violence or hatred .

" we are punishing concrete action , not any ideas , we are punishing incitement to hatred in a concrete way or encouraging other people to take concrete -lrb- xenophobic -rrb- action , " frattini said .
he said that the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , would try to raise awareness for the stalinist atrocities by organizing public debates " on the horrible crimes of the last century , ...
nazi crimes , stalinist crimes . "
however , the events still needed parliamentary approval in seven eu countries .
watered-down compromise the eu 's anti-racism rules - debated since 2001 - seemed at risk after latvia , lithuania and estonia had demanded making illegal the condoning , denial or trivialization of crimes against humanity committed under the soviet regime led by joseph stalin .
other eu states were opposed to the baltic demands , arguing that they did not legally recognize crimes committed under the stalinist regime or define major stalin atrocities as genocide .
zypries said the eu did not intend to decide on history but wanted to create public awareness for crimes against humanity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic states wanted stalin 's crimes to be put on a par with hitler 's germany views a common eu law on combating racism and xenophobia as a moral obligation .

watchdogs criticize rules as weak under the rules , the denial of crimes of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes will be punishable in the eu if these crimes have been defined by international courts and if the statement incites to hatred or violence .
laws against denying the holocaust already exist in austria , belgium , france , germany and spain .

" racism and xenophobia can only be combatted effectively inside society , " german justice minister brigitte zypries told reporters after a meeting with her counterparts in luxembourg .
" criminal measures can only be supplementary , they can never be sufficient in combatting racism and xenophobia in itself , " said zypries whose country currently holds the rotating eu presidency .
zypries said that the agreed piece of eu legislation , which is not legally binding for the bloc 's members , was an " important political signal " for the 27-nation union .
under the new rules , eu countries would set jail terms of at least one to three years for " publicly inciting to violence or hatred ... directed against a group of persons or a member of such a group defined by reference to race , color , religion , descent or national or ethnic origin . "
no minimum fines however , the legislation does not set any minimum fines .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agreement does n't specify what constitutes incitement to violence it also leaves up to national courts to define what exactly constitutes incitement to violence or hatred .
there will also be no europe-wide ban on the use of nazi symbols .
raising awareness frattini said that the new rules would fully respect the freedom of expression .
" we are punishing concrete action , not any ideas , we are punishing incitement to hatred in a concrete way or encouraging other people to take concrete -lrb- xenophobic -rrb- action , " frattini said .
he said that the european commission , the eu 's executive arm , would try to raise awareness for the stalinist atrocities by organizing public debates " on the horrible crimes of the last century , ...
nazi crimes , stalinist crimes . "
however , the events still needed parliamentary approval in seven eu countries .
watered-down compromise the eu 's anti-racism rules - debated since 2001 - seemed at risk after latvia , lithuania and estonia had demanded making illegal the condoning , denial or trivialization of crimes against humanity committed under the soviet regime led by joseph stalin .
other eu states were opposed to the baltic demands , arguing that they did not legally recognize crimes committed under the stalinist regime or define major stalin atrocities as genocide .
zypries said the eu did not intend to decide on history but wanted to create public awareness for crimes against humanity .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the baltic states wanted stalin 's crimes to be put on a par with hitler 's germany views a common eu law on combating racism and xenophobia as a moral obligation .
the new rules which would also make denying the holocaust - the mass killing of jews by nazis and nazi supporters - a crime in the eu if the statement incites to violence or hatred , do not cover denying the massacre of armenians in world war i. turkey denies that the killing of up to one million armenians constituted genocide , putting their deaths down to ethnic strife , disease and famine , and has prosecuted historians and journalists for calling it genocide .
watchdogs criticize rules as weak under the rules , the denial of crimes of genocide , crimes against humanity and war crimes will be punishable in the eu if these crimes have been defined by international courts and if the statement incites to hatred or violence .
laws against denying the holocaust already exist in austria , belgium , france , germany and spain .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 19.04.2007 french election campaign swerves to the right großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right politicians are trying to woo voters in the french suburbs as france prepares to go to the polls , even moderate candidates are trying to score points with right-wing slogans , while the real right-wingers are attempting to woo immigrants from the suburbs . far-right veteran jean-marie le pen stunned france in the presidential election in 2002 by clinching 16.9 percent of the vote in the first round and knocking then-socialist candidate lionel jospin out of the race .
five years later , there are fears in certain quarters that the national front candidate might pull off a similar feat and make it to the run-off for france 's highest office .
but there 's little chance of that happening , according to alain howiller , president of the institute of political studies in strasbourg .
" le pen wo n't make it to the second round this time , " he said .
frank baasner , director of the german-french institute echoed the view .
" experience shows these things do n't repeat themselves , " he said .
" national identity " as a vote-getter but campaign managers at former interior minister nicolas sarkozy 's conservative ump camp remain wary .
according to french satirical weekly canard enchaine , sarkozy 's aides reckon that le pen 's anti-immigrant national front could take as much as 20 percent of the vote .
daniela schwarzer , an expert on france at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin also said that le pen 's influence could not be written off .
" the national front 's voter potential is possibly higher than the surveys show it to be , " she told dw-world.de. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy sings the national anthem with kids at a party congress in paris sarkozy 's campaign managers seem convinced that the election will only be won on the right .
and as if to emphasize that point , their candidate has been focusing all his energies on the topic of national identity in the final days leading up to the first round of voting on sunday .
the conservative frontrunner has said that only those who speak french sufficiently well will be allowed to settle down permanently in france .
sarkozy has also backed quotas for immigrants and choosing them on the basis of professional qualifications .
he has said he would set up a " ministry for immigration and national identity " if he 's elected .
" france is embittered that its national identity is endangered by unlimited immigration , " sarokzy said recently .
that 's a classic ploy of the far right , according to alain howiller .
" those are ideas that le pen has been propagating for 25 years , " he said .
royal shows nationalist streak and it 's not just sarkozy angling for votes from the far right .
even sarkozy 's socialist challenger , segolene royal , has displayed a strong nationalist streak in recent weeks .
at a campaign rally two weeks ago , royal urged her supporters for the first time to sing the national anthem .
over the weekend , royal stepped up her new-found nationalist drive by urging all french to have a french flag at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal has shown a nationalist streak in recent weeks experts , such as daniela schwarzer , worry that the " irresponsible " way royal and sarkozy have been flirting with the topic of national identity could have serious long-terms political consequences .
" if the whole discussion in a left-wing party like the ps -lrb- the socialist party -rrb- and a moderate right-wing party such as the ump leans so strongly towards the far-right fringe then it changes the whole atmosphere in society , " schwarzer said .
" then even openly xenophobic slogans do n't horrify anymore . "
le pen in unfamiliar territory sarkozy and royal 's right-wing dabbling may end up benefiting le pen , not just in the long term , but also more immediately .
the veteran politician has said he 's " happy " about the right tilt the election campaign in france has taken so far .
" that 's because it shows all the french that i 'm right , " le pen said recently .
the front national candidate has been charting unfamiliar territory during his campaign this time .
in a bid to stay relevant in the fight for both frustrated voters on the far right as well as protest voters , the 78-year-old has a young women , apparently from north africa , advertise for him on posters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-marie le pen is fishing for votes in unfamiliar waters le pen has also been campaigning in the depressed suburbs with the slogan : " neither friend , nor black , white nor north african - french ! "
the strategy might just work .
according to studies by the paris-based cevipof institute , around 100,000 immigrants from north africa could vote for le pen on sunday .
" everything but sarkozy " the one campaign slogan residents of the suburbs seem to agree on is : " everything but sarkozy . "
it 's obvious that they have n't forgotten the conservative frontrunner who described violent youth there as " scum " during riots in late 2005 .
a long announced campaign visit by sarkozy to the lyon suburb of villeurbanne , where the ump candidate planned to talk to youth amid whirring television cameras in an obvious publicity gimmick , never took place .
" many youth in the suburbs will vote for le pen because he offers them a chance to explode a system that they hate , because they see no chance for themselves in it , " said schwarzer .
" for that they 're ready to overlook his xenophobic comments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de politics -pipe- 19.04.2007 french election campaign swerves to the right großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : far-right politicians are trying to woo voters in the french suburbs as france prepares to go to the polls , even moderate candidates are trying to score points with right-wing slogans , while the real right-wingers are attempting to woo immigrants from the suburbs . far-right veteran jean-marie le pen stunned france in the presidential election in 2002 by clinching 16.9 percent of the vote in the first round and knocking then-socialist candidate lionel jospin out of the race .
five years later , there are fears in certain quarters that the national front candidate might pull off a similar feat and make it to the run-off for france 's highest office .
but there 's little chance of that happening , according to alain howiller , president of the institute of political studies in strasbourg .
" le pen wo n't make it to the second round this time , " he said .
frank baasner , director of the german-french institute echoed the view .
" experience shows these things do n't repeat themselves , " he said .
" national identity " as a vote-getter but campaign managers at former interior minister nicolas sarkozy 's conservative ump camp remain wary .
according to french satirical weekly canard enchaine , sarkozy 's aides reckon that le pen 's anti-immigrant national front could take as much as 20 percent of the vote .
daniela schwarzer , an expert on france at the german institute for international and security affairs in berlin also said that le pen 's influence could not be written off .
" the national front 's voter potential is possibly higher than the surveys show it to be , " she told dw-world.de. bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy sings the national anthem with kids at a party congress in paris sarkozy 's campaign managers seem convinced that the election will only be won on the right .
and as if to emphasize that point , their candidate has been focusing all his energies on the topic of national identity in the final days leading up to the first round of voting on sunday .
the conservative frontrunner has said that only those who speak french sufficiently well will be allowed to settle down permanently in france .
sarkozy has also backed quotas for immigrants and choosing them on the basis of professional qualifications .
he has said he would set up a " ministry for immigration and national identity " if he 's elected .
" france is embittered that its national identity is endangered by unlimited immigration , " sarokzy said recently .
that 's a classic ploy of the far right , according to alain howiller .
" those are ideas that le pen has been propagating for 25 years , " he said .
royal shows nationalist streak and it 's not just sarkozy angling for votes from the far right .
even sarkozy 's socialist challenger , segolene royal , has displayed a strong nationalist streak in recent weeks .
at a campaign rally two weeks ago , royal urged her supporters for the first time to sing the national anthem .
over the weekend , royal stepped up her new-found nationalist drive by urging all french to have a french flag at home .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : royal has shown a nationalist streak in recent weeks experts , such as daniela schwarzer , worry that the " irresponsible " way royal and sarkozy have been flirting with the topic of national identity could have serious long-terms political consequences .
" if the whole discussion in a left-wing party like the ps -lrb- the socialist party -rrb- and a moderate right-wing party such as the ump leans so strongly towards the far-right fringe then it changes the whole atmosphere in society , " schwarzer said .
" then even openly xenophobic slogans do n't horrify anymore . "
le pen in unfamiliar territory sarkozy and royal 's right-wing dabbling may end up benefiting le pen , not just in the long term , but also more immediately .
the veteran politician has said he 's " happy " about the right tilt the election campaign in france has taken so far .
" that 's because it shows all the french that i 'm right , " le pen said recently .
the front national candidate has been charting unfamiliar territory during his campaign this time .
in a bid to stay relevant in the fight for both frustrated voters on the far right as well as protest voters , the 78-year-old has a young women , apparently from north africa , advertise for him on posters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jean-marie le pen is fishing for votes in unfamiliar waters le pen has also been campaigning in the depressed suburbs with the slogan : " neither friend , nor black , white nor north african - french ! "
the strategy might just work .
according to studies by the paris-based cevipof institute , around 100,000 immigrants from north africa could vote for le pen on sunday .
" everything but sarkozy " the one campaign slogan residents of the suburbs seem to agree on is : " everything but sarkozy . "
it 's obvious that they have n't forgotten the conservative frontrunner who described violent youth there as " scum " during riots in late 2005 .
a long announced campaign visit by sarkozy to the lyon suburb of villeurbanne , where the ump candidate planned to talk to youth amid whirring television cameras in an obvious publicity gimmick , never took place .
" many youth in the suburbs will vote for le pen because he offers them a chance to explode a system that they hate , because they see no chance for themselves in it , " said schwarzer .
" for that they 're ready to overlook his xenophobic comments .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de business -pipe- 19.04.2007 german jobseekers plumb volunteerism 's possibilities großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : offering a helping hand to others may be helpful to one 's own career unlike the us , germany does not have a highly developed culture of volunteerism .
but with state coffers increasingly empty and a continually tight job market , observers say unpaid work can have hidden benefits . in the us , volunteering is widespread - a credo promoted at home and in schools , and even as pseudo-governmental doctrine .
from tutoring in after school programs , to working as an aide in a hospital , to helping build houses for the poor - americans have long been schooled in the importance of " giving back to community . " but since its postwar economic boom , germany has used its tax base wealth to provide for the needy and offer its citizens singularly generous social benefits .
volunteer work was mainly done by charitable religious groups , or young men exempted from military service , fulfilling an obligatory year of civil service . increasingly , though , young people going onto the job market are discovering the side benefits that can be reaped from a volunteer stint .
such experience can help develop the highly touted " soft skills " that are increasingly in demand in the business world , observers say . after all , anyone can call themselves a " team player , " but a well-chosen , unpaid job may give them the chance to actually prove they are one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in german statistics , sports activities are often counted as " volunteer work " " for people looking for their first job , working as a volunteer is a great advantage , " said sascha theisen , the spokesman for stepstone.de , an employment-recruiting internet portal that advises people at all stages of their career .
" it gives them the chance to gain experience , for instance in leading a project , or solving problems or managing people . " it also means they could come to the job with a network already in place of people who would be good contacts later on down the road , " he added . too much of a good thing ? but theisen warned that people who are already in the middle of their careers should be careful not to overdo it .
german employers would only really smile upon someone involved in an activity that might be beneficial to business : taking an active role in a professional association , for instance . " if someone is busy leading several sports clubs and on top of that they sing in a choir , you have to ask yourself , are they going to have enough time for their job ? "
theisen asked . christoph lender saw the benefits of volunteering first hand .
by his own account , the half-dozen years he spent leading catholic youth groups helped give him just those skills required by his first employer , a bank .
at the job interview , they discussed the work he had done coordinating events , leading discussions and meetings , and being an authority figure for 10 to 15 kids every week . " it 's a signal for a company , that in addition to your studies and any internships you do , that you also took time for other things , and were socially engaged , " lender said .
" it speaks for how you choose to spend your time . " job boost a ' byproduct ' but lender stressed that his motivation for taking up volunteer work was not some calculated attempt to improve his chances on the job market . " i did it for my own personal development , " he said .
" the good experience with the job was just a byproduct of that . " german software giant sap 's hiring approach also supports lender 's experience . spokesperson alla ruggaber-mast said the company looks for people who are motivated and independent , with highly developed " soft skills " in communication , problem solving , and conflict resolution .
but while the firm " welcomes candidates who are socially engaged , that is not a decisive factor in hiring . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a voluntary civil service year , often in old age homes , means a military exemption according to the latest german government survey on volunteerism from 2004 , some 36 percent of germans claim volunteer responsibilities , up from 34 percent five years earlier . but that high number includes such volunteer jobs as taking an active role in a sports club or cultural institute .
the figure for " social " volunteerism - such as leading a youth group - was at 5.5 percent in 2004 , up from 4 percent in 1999 . there are historical reasons that relatively few germans take on social volunteer jobs , said werner lindwehr , a spokesman for the agency for self-help and volunteering in the city of osnabrück , in the state of lower saxony . " directly after the war , volunteerism was part of society , out of necessity , " lindwehr said .
" people helped one another . " later , the state took over many of those responsibilities . " and it may be that germans started just sitting back and saying , ' i 'll let the state take care of it , " ' he acknowledged . difference to usa today , however , he sees a movement toward citizens taking a more active role .
a " culture of volunteerism " is , indeed , developing in germany , he said . " people want to do more than just vote every four years , " lindwehr said .
" they want to do something on their own doorstep , and they see that they are taken seriously by the government . " but volunteerism in germany will never have the same status as in the us , where it fills a quasi-governmental function , he added . " you ca n't compare the volunteerism with usa and here , " he said .
" the us has a much worse social system .

but with state coffers increasingly empty and a continually tight job market , observers say unpaid work can have hidden benefits . in the us , volunteering is widespread - a credo promoted at home and in schools , and even as pseudo-governmental doctrine .
from tutoring in after school programs , to working as an aide in a hospital , to helping build houses for the poor - americans have long been schooled in the importance of " giving back to community . " but since its postwar economic boom , germany has used its tax base wealth to provide for the needy and offer its citizens singularly generous social benefits .
volunteer work was mainly done by charitable religious groups , or young men exempted from military service , fulfilling an obligatory year of civil service . increasingly , though , young people going onto the job market are discovering the side benefits that can be reaped from a volunteer stint .
such experience can help develop the highly touted " soft skills " that are increasingly in demand in the business world , observers say . after all , anyone can call themselves a " team player , " but a well-chosen , unpaid job may give them the chance to actually prove they are one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in german statistics , sports activities are often counted as " volunteer work " " for people looking for their first job , working as a volunteer is a great advantage , " said sascha theisen , the spokesman for stepstone.de , an employment-recruiting internet portal that advises people at all stages of their career .
" it gives them the chance to gain experience , for instance in leading a project , or solving problems or managing people . " it also means they could come to the job with a network already in place of people who would be good contacts later on down the road , " he added . too much of a good thing ? but theisen warned that people who are already in the middle of their careers should be careful not to overdo it .
german employers would only really smile upon someone involved in an activity that might be beneficial to business : taking an active role in a professional association , for instance . " if someone is busy leading several sports clubs and on top of that they sing in a choir , you have to ask yourself , are they going to have enough time for their job ? "
theisen asked . christoph lender saw the benefits of volunteering first hand .
by his own account , the half-dozen years he spent leading catholic youth groups helped give him just those skills required by his first employer , a bank .
at the job interview , they discussed the work he had done coordinating events , leading discussions and meetings , and being an authority figure for 10 to 15 kids every week . " it 's a signal for a company , that in addition to your studies and any internships you do , that you also took time for other things , and were socially engaged , " lender said .
" it speaks for how you choose to spend your time . " job boost a ' byproduct ' but lender stressed that his motivation for taking up volunteer work was not some calculated attempt to improve his chances on the job market . " i did it for my own personal development , " he said .
" the good experience with the job was just a byproduct of that . " german software giant sap 's hiring approach also supports lender 's experience . spokesperson alla ruggaber-mast said the company looks for people who are motivated and independent , with highly developed " soft skills " in communication , problem solving , and conflict resolution .
but while the firm " welcomes candidates who are socially engaged , that is not a decisive factor in hiring . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a voluntary civil service year , often in old age homes , means a military exemption according to the latest german government survey on volunteerism from 2004 , some 36 percent of germans claim volunteer responsibilities , up from 34 percent five years earlier . but that high number includes such volunteer jobs as taking an active role in a sports club or cultural institute .
the figure for " social " volunteerism - such as leading a youth group - was at 5.5 percent in 2004 , up from 4 percent in 1999 . there are historical reasons that relatively few germans take on social volunteer jobs , said werner lindwehr , a spokesman for the agency for self-help and volunteering in the city of osnabrück , in the state of lower saxony .

" but since its postwar economic boom , germany has used its tax base wealth to provide for the needy and offer its citizens singularly generous social benefits .
volunteer work was mainly done by charitable religious groups , or young men exempted from military service , fulfilling an obligatory year of civil service . increasingly , though , young people going onto the job market are discovering the side benefits that can be reaped from a volunteer stint .
such experience can help develop the highly touted " soft skills " that are increasingly in demand in the business world , observers say . after all , anyone can call themselves a " team player , " but a well-chosen , unpaid job may give them the chance to actually prove they are one . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : in german statistics , sports activities are often counted as " volunteer work " " for people looking for their first job , working as a volunteer is a great advantage , " said sascha theisen , the spokesman for stepstone.de , an employment-recruiting internet portal that advises people at all stages of their career .
" it gives them the chance to gain experience , for instance in leading a project , or solving problems or managing people . " it also means they could come to the job with a network already in place of people who would be good contacts later on down the road , " he added . too much of a good thing ? but theisen warned that people who are already in the middle of their careers should be careful not to overdo it .
german employers would only really smile upon someone involved in an activity that might be beneficial to business : taking an active role in a professional association , for instance . " if someone is busy leading several sports clubs and on top of that they sing in a choir , you have to ask yourself , are they going to have enough time for their job ? "
theisen asked . christoph lender saw the benefits of volunteering first hand .
by his own account , the half-dozen years he spent leading catholic youth groups helped give him just those skills required by his first employer , a bank .
at the job interview , they discussed the work he had done coordinating events , leading discussions and meetings , and being an authority figure for 10 to 15 kids every week . " it 's a signal for a company , that in addition to your studies and any internships you do , that you also took time for other things , and were socially engaged , " lender said .
" it speaks for how you choose to spend your time . " job boost a ' byproduct ' but lender stressed that his motivation for taking up volunteer work was not some calculated attempt to improve his chances on the job market . " i did it for my own personal development , " he said .
" the good experience with the job was just a byproduct of that . " german software giant sap 's hiring approach also supports lender 's experience . spokesperson alla ruggaber-mast said the company looks for people who are motivated and independent , with highly developed " soft skills " in communication , problem solving , and conflict resolution .
but while the firm " welcomes candidates who are socially engaged , that is not a decisive factor in hiring . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a voluntary civil service year , often in old age homes , means a military exemption according to the latest german government survey on volunteerism from 2004 , some 36 percent of germans claim volunteer responsibilities , up from 34 percent five years earlier . but that high number includes such volunteer jobs as taking an active role in a sports club or cultural institute .
the figure for " social " volunteerism - such as leading a youth group - was at 5.5 percent in 2004 , up from 4 percent in 1999 . there are historical reasons that relatively few germans take on social volunteer jobs , said werner lindwehr , a spokesman for the agency for self-help and volunteering in the city of osnabrück , in the state of lower saxony . " directly after the war , volunteerism was part of society , out of necessity , " lindwehr said .
" people helped one another . " later , the state took over many of those responsibilities . " and it may be that germans started just sitting back and saying , ' i 'll let the state take care of it , " ' he acknowledged . difference to usa today , however , he sees a movement toward citizens taking a more active role .
a " culture of volunteerism " is , indeed , developing in germany , he said . " people want to do more than just vote every four years , " lindwehr said .
" they want to do something on their own doorstep , and they see that they are taken seriously by the government . " but volunteerism in germany will never have the same status as in the us , where it fills a quasi-governmental function , he added . " you ca n't compare the volunteerism with usa and here , " he said .
" the us has a much worse social system .
in my opinion , they have more need , and thus more organization . " in germany , lindwehr argued , volunteerism will grow , but it will have a more " political " character , with volunteers and governments forming a sort of bridge to get things done .
for instance , he said , people are becoming increasingly active in local citizens ' initiatives . not everyone likes it an example is a group of people who decide their playground needs renovation , but the town says there is no funding for it .
so the local government will act as a go between , and find a carpenter who is willing to donate wood , or people to help manage the construction . despite these examples , volunteerism in germany is far from being accepted as purely beneficial .
debates occasionally flare up over the usefulness of the civil-service year , and there are those who decry the notion of unpaid work at all , saying it steals jobs from people who need them . meanwhile , christoph lender said that from where he stands , he has seen little evidence that the country will be overrun by volunteers any time soon .

" it 's only the beginning of a first real exchange of views , " one diplomat told afp on condition of anonymity , adding that " it is too early to expect any decisions . " " thursday 's meetings could help restore confidence among us , particularly with russia , but also ease german concerns , " the diplomat said . but he warned : " if things have n't cooled down after these meetings , there could be a danger of more clearly marked divisions among the allies . " germany wants us to consult moscow the united states announced in january it had begun negotiations on installing a missile interceptor bank in poland , a radar system in the czech republic plus an early warning radar somewhere in the caucasus region . washington maintains that the system would not only protect the united states but also many of its european allies against " rogue threats " from countries like iran . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german defense minister jung wants the us to ease moscow 's concerns but russia is irked by the idea that its old cold war foe would set this up in its back yard and has accused washington of hiding its real intentions , trying to start another arms race , and threatened to retaliate . germany is demanding closer consultation with moscow but is also concerned that parts of southern europe - bulgaria , romania , greece and turkey - would be exposed outside the shield , expected to be fully operational in 2013 . " the germans do n't know clearly yet what they really want , but they are obviously convinced that nato should play a role in it all , " the nato diplomat said . in the latest sign of washington 's efforts to assuage those fears , us officials presented russia tuesday with " new ideas " for bilateral cooperation between them on missile defense in general . russia adopts wait and see attitude another nato diplomat noted that washington wants to move quickly to get the project off the ground before us president george w. bush steps down next year . " as for the americans , they want to go fast and get the ball rolling before bush 's mandate ends , " he said .
" so they are ready for concessions , as long as the main thrust of the plan is kept . " but despite the apparently conciliatory us moves , russia was pessimistic its concerns will be addressed . " we hope , although i will say sincerely that i am not optimistic , that washington will listen to our analyses and worries , " igor ivanov , head of the russian national security council , said tuesday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian minister ivanov says he 's not optimistic that the us will listen to moscow 's concerns a senior russian diplomat , alexander grushko , said separately that russia intended to have serious talks with nato foreign ministers in norway next week on the missile scheme and the alliance 's expansion into eastern europe . " we are counting on a deep and serious discussion in oslo concerning all aspects of the relationship between russia and nato , " he told interfax news agency . the dispute has accelerated debate at nato about its own missile plans . a study for the nato has found that there is a possible missile threat to the allies and that they have the technical means to counter it .

in addition , security worries , hooliganism and corruption remain nagging problems .
organizers and politicians , however , insist they will roll up their sleeves in order to ensure the success of the soccer championships .
poland tries to calm jitters in the lead up to wednesday 's decision by european soccer 's governing body , uefa , at a meeting in cardiff , the polish-ukrainian bidders tried to calm jitters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukrainian president yushchenko -lrb- r . -rrb- and polish president kaczynski polish president lech kaczynski who traveled to the welsh capital with ukrainian president viktor yushchenko to make an 11th-hour pitch for their bid , said there was much work to be done .
" we must not forget the enormity of the task of organizing euro 2012 , but that is also excellent news for poland , " kaczynski said .
" there will be new stadiums built in warsaw , gdansk , wroclaw and poznan .
that can only be seen in a positive light , " he added .
" five years is long enough and i am sure that with the mobilization and determination of the local authorities and the people , we will succeed . "
it will be the first time that either poland or ukraine will host a major soccer championship .
it 's the third major sporting event , following the beijing olympic games in 2008 and the soccer world cup in south africa in 2010 , to break away from the traditional grounds of western europe and the americas .
infrastructure in need of massive overhaul polish authorities said last week that around 26 billion euros -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- , including eu financing , have been earmarked to upgrade infrastructure .
fans will need every bit of it .
anyone wanting to travel by road from gdansk in northern poland to donetsk , a host city in eastern ukraine , has to traverse 2,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,240 miles -rrb- .
the 22-hour car or bus trip - not counting the lengthy wait at the polish-ukrainian border - is mostly on single lane roads .
only 23 kilometers -lrb- 14 miles -rrb- of the trip is on motorway .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : one of the few four-lane motorways in poland , near the ukraine border despite receiving vast eu funding since the fall of communism in 1989 and becoming a member of the bloc in 2004 , poland still has n't built a basic motorway network connecting its major cities .
the situation is worse in ukraine .
there , train travel is hardly better : it currently takes 43 hours , at best , to get from gdansk to donetsk .
lack of investment means it is too dangerous to use high speed trains on the aging tracks .
while booming low-cost airlines carry hundreds of thousands of poles between their homes and western europe each year , there are still no cheap links between ukraine and poland .
outside major cities , particularly in ukraine , good hotels are hard to come by - or at least in sufficient numbers to cater to tens of thousands of fans , journalists and soccer officials .
hooliganism , right wing crimes raise concerns polish soccer is also blighted by hooliganism .
fears that polish fans would cause trouble at last year 's world cup in neighboring germany led to a massive police operation in both countries , although in the end the hooligans stayed away .
in addition , polish soccer 's image has been dented by corruption .
a two-year-old match-fixing scandal has led to more than 60 arrests , including several referees , a member of the polish soccer association -lrb- pzpn -rrb- leadership and a string of club officials .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hooliganism continues to blight polish soccer on thursday , polish sports minister tomasz lipiec vowed to make polish soccer graft-free by the time of the euro 2012 .
" we want to sort this problem out completely by 2012 .
i 'm convinced that we will manage it even earlier , " lipiec said .
" the championships must take place in an atmosphere of fair play . "
ukraine will also have to do more to improve security for foreign fans .
foreign embassies regularly warn their citizens about the risk of attacks by skinheads in the country .
poland , too , has a flourishing far-right scene .
" good news for ukrainians " despite the huge problems , kiev remains confident that it can manage to surmount most challenges .
indeed , there are signs that the country is already gearing up to tackle the gargantuan task .
although kiev is currently locked in political crisis pitting supporters of the president and prime minister against each other , the two sides are united about euro 2012 .
four ukrainian cities selected as venues have already started preparations including upgrading their existing soccer facilities .
and the kiev mayor 's office has said the capital would completely renovate its 86,000-seat olympic stadium .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine is confident that investors will step in to build much needed stadiums in the west of the country , lviv city authorities have said they will renovate the city 's 28,000-seat stadium and increase its capacity .
ukraine 's reigning champions , shakhtar donetsk , are currently building a new 50,000-seat ground , while dnepropetrovsk , who finished sixth last season , had also began the construction of a new arena in their town .
ukraine 's sports minister , viktor korzh , said major investors were ready to step in alongside the authorities .
" there are serious investors , who are ready to invest up to 37 billion hryvnias -lrb- about 5.7 billion euros , $ 7.7 billion -rrb- in the construction of airports , roads , hotels and improving sports infrastructure , " he said .
roman shpek , ukraine 's ambassador to the european union , said the decision to allow ukraine to be co-host of the euro 2012 could not be underestimated .
" it is one more step toward ukraine 's integration to the eu , " shpek told the international herald tribune .

they have to get their stadiums , transport systems and hotels up to scratch and overcome a legacy of hooliganism and corruption . a day after poland and ukraine scored a shock win over italy and fellow joint bidders hungary and croatia in the race to clinch the major soccer tournament - which takes place every four years - the enormity of the task facing the two host nations was beginning to sink in .
they will need nothing short of a herculean construction and investor drive to build stadium , hotels and other infrastructure .
in addition , security worries , hooliganism and corruption remain nagging problems .
organizers and politicians , however , insist they will roll up their sleeves in order to ensure the success of the soccer championships .
poland tries to calm jitters in the lead up to wednesday 's decision by european soccer 's governing body , uefa , at a meeting in cardiff , the polish-ukrainian bidders tried to calm jitters .

" we must not forget the enormity of the task of organizing euro 2012 , but that is also excellent news for poland , " kaczynski said .
" there will be new stadiums built in warsaw , gdansk , wroclaw and poznan .
that can only be seen in a positive light , " he added .
" five years is long enough and i am sure that with the mobilization and determination of the local authorities and the people , we will succeed . "
it will be the first time that either poland or ukraine will host a major soccer championship .
it 's the third major sporting event , following the beijing olympic games in 2008 and the soccer world cup in south africa in 2010 , to break away from the traditional grounds of western europe and the americas .
infrastructure in need of massive overhaul polish authorities said last week that around 26 billion euros -lrb- $ 35 billion -rrb- , including eu financing , have been earmarked to upgrade infrastructure .
fans will need every bit of it .
anyone wanting to travel by road from gdansk in northern poland to donetsk , a host city in eastern ukraine , has to traverse 2,000 kilometers -lrb- 1,240 miles -rrb- .
the 22-hour car or bus trip - not counting the lengthy wait at the polish-ukrainian border - is mostly on single lane roads .
only 23 kilometers -lrb- 14 miles -rrb- of the trip is on motorway .

the situation is worse in ukraine .
there , train travel is hardly better : it currently takes 43 hours , at best , to get from gdansk to donetsk .
lack of investment means it is too dangerous to use high speed trains on the aging tracks .
while booming low-cost airlines carry hundreds of thousands of poles between their homes and western europe each year , there are still no cheap links between ukraine and poland .

american researchers found fossilised remains in new york state two years ago , but their identity was unknown .
they called in dr christopher berry from cardiff university , who confirmed the remains are from the genus wattieza , a fern-like plant which formed earth 's first known forests .
dr berry described the discovery as a " spectacular " find .
the upright stumps of fossilised trees were first uncovered after a flash flood in gilboa , new york , more than a century ago .
but until two further fossils were found two years ago , which had fallen sideways with their trunk , branches , twigs and crown still intact , no-one knew what the entire trees looked like .
the american team called in dr berry , who has 17 years of tree fossil expertise , to help .
dr berry , of cardiff university 's school of earth , ocean and planetary sciences , said it was a " spectacular find " which had allowed scientists to recreate early forest ecosystems .
" this was also a significant moment in the history of the planet , " he said .
" the rise of the forests removed a lot of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .
this caused temperatures to drop and the planet became very similar to its present-day condition .
" branches from the trees would have fallen to the floor and decayed , providing a new food chain for the bugs living below . "
dr berry worked with colleagues from binghamton university , new york and from new york state museum .
their findings are published in the 19 april edition of the scientific journal nature .

" the rise of the forests removed a lot of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere .
this caused temperatures to drop and the planet became very similar to its present-day condition .
" branches from the trees would have fallen to the floor and decayed , providing a new food chain for the bugs living below . "
dr berry worked with colleagues from binghamton university , new york and from new york state museum .
their findings are published in the 19 april edition of the scientific journal nature .

mr howard said there would only be enough water in the huge murray-darling river system for drinking purposes .
he acknowledged that this would have a " potentially devastating " impact on many horticultural , crop and dairy industries around the river basin .
but he said there was no choice , and he described the situation as " grim " .
irrigators are already warning that if they can not water their land , there will be huge crop losses and australian consumers will face large price rises .
praying for rain australia is suffering from its worst drought on record , and the lack of rainfall has already severely reduced the production of major irrigated crops in the murray-darling river basin .
the basin , which covers an area the size of france and spain combined , accounts for 41 % of australian agriculture and usually provides about 85 % of the nation 's irrigation supply .
" if it does n't rain in sufficient volume over the next six to eight weeks , there will be no water allocations for irrigation purposes in the basin " until may 2008 , mr howard told reporters in canberra .
there would be water only for " critical urban supplies " and farmers ' own domestic use , he said .
" it is a grim situation , and there is no point in pretending to australia otherwise , " he said .
" we must all hope and pray there is rain . "
mr howard acknowledged that banning irrigation for crops and livestock in the murray-darling basin would have a " critical " impact on many industries in the area .
farmers are warning that australians could face major food price rises if no water is allocated to irrigators in the murray-darling basin .
national farmers ' federation head ben fargher said that thousands of farmers could lose their citrus , almond and olives trees if they can not be watered this year .
" if those ... trees do die , then it takes a number of years to recover - maybe five to six years of lost production , " he told abc radio .
australia may not have a rice crop at all this season if it gets no irrigation allocations , laurie arthur , president of the ricegrowers association , told reuters news agency .
" if it stays dry there will potentially be catastrophic losses , " he said .
australia 's wine grape production and the farming of stone fruits is also likely to be affected .
election issue mr howard 's government is anxious to tackle the country 's drought - which is now in its sixth year .
in january , he announced a a $ 10bn -lrb- $ 7bn -rrb- package to tackle the country 's water problems , including a plan to overhaul irrigation pipes along the murray-darling river system .
he also introduced plans for the federal government to assume regulatory control of the river system from the four states that currently administer irrigation rights .
all states but one - victoria - have so far agreed to the plan .
water scarcity is likely to be a key issue in australia 's elections later this year .

mr howard said there would only be enough water in the huge murray-darling river system for drinking purposes .
he acknowledged that this would have a " potentially devastating " impact on many horticultural , crop and dairy industries around the river basin .
but he said there was no choice , and he described the situation as " grim " .
irrigators are already warning that if they can not water their land , there will be huge crop losses and australian consumers will face large price rises .
praying for rain australia is suffering from its worst drought on record , and the lack of rainfall has already severely reduced the production of major irrigated crops in the murray-darling river basin .
the basin , which covers an area the size of france and spain combined , accounts for 41 % of australian agriculture and usually provides about 85 % of the nation 's irrigation supply .
" if it does n't rain in sufficient volume over the next six to eight weeks , there will be no water allocations for irrigation purposes in the basin " until may 2008 , mr howard told reporters in canberra .
there would be water only for " critical urban supplies " and farmers ' own domestic use , he said .
" it is a grim situation , and there is no point in pretending to australia otherwise , " he said .
" we must all hope and pray there is rain . "
mr howard acknowledged that banning irrigation for crops and livestock in the murray-darling basin would have a " critical " impact on many industries in the area .
farmers are warning that australians could face major food price rises if no water is allocated to irrigators in the murray-darling basin .
national farmers ' federation head ben fargher said that thousands of farmers could lose their citrus , almond and olives trees if they can not be watered this year .
" if those ... trees do die , then it takes a number of years to recover - maybe five to six years of lost production , " he told abc radio .
australia may not have a rice crop at all this season if it gets no irrigation allocations , laurie arthur , president of the ricegrowers association , told reuters news agency .
" if it stays dry there will potentially be catastrophic losses , " he said .
australia 's wine grape production and the farming of stone fruits is also likely to be affected .
election issue mr howard 's government is anxious to tackle the country 's drought - which is now in its sixth year .
in january , he announced a a $ 10bn -lrb- $ 7bn -rrb- package to tackle the country 's water problems , including a plan to overhaul irrigation pipes along the murray-darling river system .
he also introduced plans for the federal government to assume regulatory control of the river system from the four states that currently administer irrigation rights .
all states but one - victoria - have so far agreed to the plan .
water scarcity is likely to be a key issue in australia 's elections later this year .

southampton and kent university experts asked 883 women why they had abortions in the second trimester - between 13 and 24 weeks into the pregnancy .
the researchers say women need more information so that they realise they are pregnant much earlier .
but anti-abortion campaigners said the rights of the unborn child should take precedence . "
the most significant finding in this study is that 41 % of women indicated that the delay was due to indecision " alive and kicking spokeswoman around 11 % of abortions take place after the 12th week of pregnancy .
just over 1 % of those occur after a woman is 20 weeks pregnant .
most abortions are permitted until the 24th week , although they can be carried out later if doctors believe the baby has a severe disability or if the mother 's life is at risk the time-limit for abortions is proving increasingly controversial , as medical advances mean even very premature babies can survive .
about 190,000 abortions take place in england and wales annually .
concerns this study , which allowed women to give more than one reason for opting to have a late abortion , found women had not realised they were pregnant for two main reasons .
just under 40 % of women had not realised they were pregnant because they had irregular periods .
another 31 % had been using contraception , and so had not thought they could be pregnant .
and 41 % said they had taken time to come to a decision about whether or not to have an abortion , delaying the procedure .
but 30 % had simply not done anything once they suspected they were pregnant , with many waiting weeks to do a pregnancy test .
half of those questioned were at least seven weeks pregnant when they were aware of their situation - a quarter were over 11 weeks pregnant .
forty-two per cent said they had waited more than two weeks between requesting and having an abortion , and 23 % waited more than three weeks , the maximum recommended by the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists .
and many women said they had concerns about what was actually involved in an abortion , which had led to them waiting before going ahead .
dr ellie lee , senior lecturer in social policy at the university of kent , who worked on the study , said : " there has been a great deal of media and public debate recently about second-trimester abortions , especially those performed at 20 weeks and over .
dr lee , who is also a member of the pro-choice forum , said : " what has been lacking in this discussion so far is an understanding of why women have abortions at this stage .
" this means few have sought to properly address how women can be helped to terminate pregnancies earlier , and how policy makers and service providers might best think about the relevant issues for those women who seek second-trimester abortion . "
she added : " if you were to reduce the upper time limit on abortion , it 's arguable some women may feel rushed into a decision and may go ahead with an abortion when they would otherwise have had the baby . "
lack of knowledge ann furedi , chief executive of british pregnancy advisory service , which provides abortions , said : " ' we frequently see women who did not know enough about their own bodies to recognise the early symptoms of pregnancy , especially if they have irregular or continuing periods , as many women do . "
but a spokeswoman for the anti-abortion alive and kicking campaign said : " the most significant finding in this study is that 41 % of women indicated that the delay was due to indecision .
" we believe that the rights of the unborn child should take precedence over the uncertainty of the mother , an opinion that is shared by the vast majority of the public who are particularly concerned about late abortion . "

forty-two per cent said they had waited more than two weeks between requesting and having an abortion , and 23 % waited more than three weeks , the maximum recommended by the royal college of obstetricians and gynaecologists .
and many women said they had concerns about what was actually involved in an abortion , which had led to them waiting before going ahead .

here two such sites - ebay and viagogo - defend their position .
the scene is familiar to music lovers up and down the land .
you hammer the telephone , open numerous windows on the internet , but you still fail to get your hands on a ticket for your favourite band .
within minutes the concert is sold out and your dreams of rocking with the police or reliving your teenage years with take that are shattered .
or are they ?
within seconds , internet auction sites are awash with tickets selling for two , three , four times what they were a few minutes earlier .
it is tempting , and many succumb to buying from that secondary market .
promoters estimate up to a third of tickets are resold .
and it is a situation the music industry fears will get worse , laying the blame firmly at the feet of so-called " bedroom ticket touts " and the internet auction sites they sell them on .
it is an accusation the sites feel is unjustified .
gladiators " consumers actually like having the option of going to the secondary market , " says eric baker , chief executive of " ticket exchange " website viagogo . "
the way the primary market stands , the odds of getting a ticket is stacked against the real genuine music fan " vanessa canzini , ebay on viagogo , the seller sets the price or can auction the ticket .
viagogo guarantees the seller is paid , and if the buyer 's tickets do not arrive or are fraudulent , it will find replacements on the secondary market .
viagogo charges the seller 15 % commission and the buyer 10 % for the pleasure .
mr baker , whose previous - and similar - company stubhub sold more than $ 400m worth of tickets in 2006 , rejects suggestions that his site gives sellers a legitimate platform on which to peddle their tickets .
" people have resold tickets since the days of the gladiators , " he says .
" they were probably very enterprising teenagers , asking if people wanted to pay more to sit next to ceasar , or whatever .
" the reselling of tickets is not going to go away , so the question is how do you make it a better situation for the world that we live in today , and i believe this is it . "
' perfect market ' ebay , the biggest internet auction site , holds a similar view .
" we come at this from the standpoint that tickets are personal property , " explains ebay corporate reputation manager vanessa canzini .
" like a book or cd , people are free to resell them if they want to for as much as the market will bear .
" we have been called the ' perfect market ' .
supply meets demand and people pay what they think something is worth . "
ebay disputes that large-scale ticket touting takes place on its site , citing research by icm last year that showed nine out of 10 ebay sellers who had listed tickets in the previous 12 months had listed less than five .
" what we do see is people who resell their ticket because they can longer go , or , if we are being honest , will sell two tickets then buy another two to make a profit on them , but it is very , very small scale . "
ms canzini says it is up to the music industry to tackle touts if they feel it is a growing problem .
" we feel promoters and organisers put the tickets in the hands of touts in the first place .
" they sell them to people in bulk , or have phonelines and websites crashing because of a stampede , then they expect us to police the mess that they create in doing so .
" the way the primary market stands , the odds of getting a ticket is stacked against the real genuine music fan .
most people do n't have time to sit on the internet all day trying . "
recently some promoters have tried to beat ebay at their own game , by auctioning the best seats at some concerts , and undermining the secondary market .
' official ' auctions the police , beyonce , genesis and justin timberlake were done in this way , with bids for timberlake starting at £ 265 on one official site .
it is a new technique that makes ebay bristle .
" they will auction off up to ten rows of a concert at a time .
the higher the bid , the better the seat location .
we do n't think that is particularly transparent , " says ms canzini .
as a result of " summits " the government has held with the music industry and auction sites , ebay decided to make sellers disclose the face value of their tickets , but concert promoters want ebay to go one step further .
they want ebay to make sellers print the serial numbers of the tickets they are selling to prove they have them .
but ebay is reluctant to enforce this , as promoters could then void the tickets under the terms and conditions of the original sale .
this , ms canzini says , would hit music fans and penalise the genuine sellers .
" i ca n't go to a concert , i list my ticket , you buy it , you go along on the night - a genuine fan - you are devastated to be told that the tickets are voided .
that 's not acceptable . "
" let 's not forget that the secondary ticket market was around long before ebay came on the scene , and it will be around whether ebay is there or not . "

and it is a situation the music industry fears will get worse , laying the blame firmly at the feet of so-called " bedroom ticket touts " and the internet auction sites they sell them on .
it is an accusation the sites feel is unjustified .
gladiators " consumers actually like having the option of going to the secondary market , " says eric baker , chief executive of " ticket exchange " website viagogo .
the way the primary market stands , the odds of getting a ticket is stacked against the real genuine music fan vanessa canzini , ebay on viagogo , the seller sets the price or can auction the ticket .
viagogo guarantees the seller is paid , and if the buyer 's tickets do not arrive or are fraudulent , it will find replacements on the secondary market .
viagogo charges the seller 15 % commission and the buyer 10 % for the pleasure .
mr baker , whose previous - and similar - company stubhub sold more than $ 400m worth of tickets in 2006 , rejects suggestions that his site gives sellers a legitimate platform on which to peddle their tickets .
" people have resold tickets since the days of the gladiators , " he says .
" they were probably very enterprising teenagers , asking if people wanted to pay more to sit next to ceasar , or whatever .
" the reselling of tickets is not going to go away , so the question is how do you make it a better situation for the world that we live in today , and i believe this is it . "
' perfect market ' ebay , the biggest internet auction site , holds a similar view .
eric baker says viagogo is making the secondary market safer " we come at this from the standpoint that tickets are personal property , " explains ebay corporate reputation manager vanessa canzini .
" like a book or cd , people are free to resell them if they want to for as much as the market will bear .
" we have been called the ' perfect market ' .
supply meets demand and people pay what they think something is worth . "
ebay disputes that large-scale ticket touting takes place on its site , citing research by icm last year that showed nine out of 10 ebay sellers who had listed tickets in the previous 12 months had listed less than five .
" what we do see is people who resell their ticket because they can longer go , or , if we are being honest , will sell two tickets then buy another two to make a profit on them , but it is very , very small scale . "
ms canzini says it is up to the music industry to tackle touts if they feel it is a growing problem .
" we feel promoters and organisers put the tickets in the hands of touts in the first place .
" they sell them to people in bulk , or have phonelines and websites crashing because of a stampede , then they expect us to police the mess that they create in doing so .
" the way the primary market stands , the odds of getting a ticket is stacked against the real genuine music fan .
most people do n't have time to sit on the internet all day trying . "
so-called ' bedroom ticket touts ' sell their wares on sites like ebay recently some promoters have tried to beat ebay at their own game , by auctioning the best seats at some concerts , and undermining the secondary market .
' official ' auctions the police , beyonce , genesis and justin timberlake were done in this way , with bids for timberlake starting at £ 265 on one official site .
it is a new technique that makes ebay bristle .
" they will auction off up to ten rows of a concert at a time .
the higher the bid , the better the seat location .
we do n't think that is particularly transparent , " says ms canzini .
as a result of " summits " the government has held with the music industry and auction sites , ebay decided to make sellers disclose the face value of their tickets , but concert promoters want ebay to go one step further .
they want ebay to make sellers print the serial numbers of the tickets they are selling to prove they have them .
but ebay is reluctant to enforce this , as promoters could then void the tickets under the terms and conditions of the original sale .
this , ms canzini says , would hit music fans and penalise the genuine sellers .
" i ca n't go to a concert , i list my ticket , you buy it , you go along on the night - a genuine fan - you are devastated to be told that the tickets are voided .
that 's not acceptable . "
" let 's not forget that the secondary ticket market was around long before ebay came on the scene , and it will be around whether ebay is there or not . "

here two such sites - ebay and viagogo - defend their position .
the scene is familiar to music lovers up and down the land .
you hammer the telephone , open numerous windows on the internet , but you still fail to get your hands on a ticket for your favourite band .
hundreds of tickets exchange hands on ebay every day within minutes the concert is sold out and your dreams of rocking with the police or reliving your teenage years with take that are shattered .
or are they ?
within seconds , internet auction sites are awash with tickets selling for two , three , four times what they were a few minutes earlier .
it is tempting , and many succumb to buying from that secondary market .
promoters estimate up to a third of tickets are resold .
and it is a situation the music industry fears will get worse , laying the blame firmly at the feet of so-called " bedroom ticket touts " and the internet auction sites they sell them on .
it is an accusation the sites feel is unjustified .
gladiators " consumers actually like having the option of going to the secondary market , " says eric baker , chief executive of " ticket exchange " website viagogo .
the way the primary market stands , the odds of getting a ticket is stacked against the real genuine music fan vanessa canzini , ebay on viagogo , the seller sets the price or can auction the ticket .
viagogo guarantees the seller is paid , and if the buyer 's tickets do not arrive or are fraudulent , it will find replacements on the secondary market .
viagogo charges the seller 15 % commission and the buyer 10 % for the pleasure .
mr baker , whose previous - and similar - company stubhub sold more than $ 400m worth of tickets in 2006 , rejects suggestions that his site gives sellers a legitimate platform on which to peddle their tickets .
" people have resold tickets since the days of the gladiators , " he says .
" they were probably very enterprising teenagers , asking if people wanted to pay more to sit next to ceasar , or whatever .
" the reselling of tickets is not going to go away , so the question is how do you make it a better situation for the world that we live in today , and i believe this is it . "
' perfect market ' ebay , the biggest internet auction site , holds a similar view .
eric baker says viagogo is making the secondary market safer " we come at this from the standpoint that tickets are personal property , " explains ebay corporate reputation manager vanessa canzini .
" like a book or cd , people are free to resell them if they want to for as much as the market will bear .
" we have been called the ' perfect market ' .
supply meets demand and people pay what they think something is worth . "
ebay disputes that large-scale ticket touting takes place on its site , citing research by icm last year that showed nine out of 10 ebay sellers who had listed tickets in the previous 12 months had listed less than five .
" what we do see is people who resell their ticket because they can longer go , or , if we are being honest , will sell two tickets then buy another two to make a profit on them , but it is very , very small scale . "
ms canzini says it is up to the music industry to tackle touts if they feel it is a growing problem .
" we feel promoters and organisers put the tickets in the hands of touts in the first place .
" they sell them to people in bulk , or have phonelines and websites crashing because of a stampede , then they expect us to police the mess that they create in doing so .
" the way the primary market stands , the odds of getting a ticket is stacked against the real genuine music fan .
most people do n't have time to sit on the internet all day trying . "
so-called ' bedroom ticket touts ' sell their wares on sites like ebay recently some promoters have tried to beat ebay at their own game , by auctioning the best seats at some concerts , and undermining the secondary market .
' official ' auctions the police , beyonce , genesis and justin timberlake were done in this way , with bids for timberlake starting at £ 265 on one official site .
it is a new technique that makes ebay bristle .
" they will auction off up to ten rows of a concert at a time .
the higher the bid , the better the seat location .
we do n't think that is particularly transparent , " says ms canzini .
as a result of " summits " the government has held with the music industry and auction sites , ebay decided to make sellers disclose the face value of their tickets , but concert promoters want ebay to go one step further .
they want ebay to make sellers print the serial numbers of the tickets they are selling to prove they have them .
but ebay is reluctant to enforce this , as promoters could then void the tickets under the terms and conditions of the original sale .
this , ms canzini says , would hit music fans and penalise the genuine sellers .
" i ca n't go to a concert , i list my ticket , you buy it , you go along on the night - a genuine fan - you are devastated to be told that the tickets are voided .
that 's not acceptable . "

they 're a deferential lot , he said .
i believed him .
by then , i 'd already attended the rcn congress that took place a few weeks before the general election in 2005 .
delegates had listened patiently as politicians from the three main parties spoke at a hustings .
the gloom about deficits and job losses in some parts of the health service seems to have contributed to a collective feeling among nurses of insecurity the main emotion during those few days came from a young nurse whose voice broke , as she talked about the violence she 'd experienced from people attending her accident and emergency department .
skip forward to 2006 - and those instincts that the health secretary 's speech would n't be much of an event .
how wrong we were .
fierce rows were brewing about nhs deficits , and patricia hewitt 's remark that it had been the best year ever for the health service was proving inflammatory .
within a couple of minutes of her beginning to address delegates , it was clear that the mood in the hall was set for confrontation .
' not megabucks , not peanuts ' the student nurses , who like to provide a lively presence at congress , were particularly vocal .
this year , the royal college of nursing did n't invite politicians to harrogate .
a sensible move no doubt - although we journalists like the headlines , more productive exchanges are achieved in private meetings .
but the atmosphere was nonetheless very feisty - particularly during yesterday 's debate on pay , which culminated in one nurse 's roar as he shouted to the audience to back the prospect of industrial action .
" wonderful stuff " , a woman said to me afterwards .
it 's hard for outsiders to understand this anger .
spending on the nhs has rocketed in recent years , and the average nurse 's salary is now £ 25,000 - not megabucks , but certainly not peanuts either .
but the delay to this year 's pay award has caused anger , particularly as scotland has decided to give nurses the full amount straight away .
leader 's challenge the gloom about deficits and job losses in some parts of the health service seems to have contributed to a collective feeling among nurses of insecurity .
more than one delegate remarked to me that several decades into their career , they were feeling at their most vulnerable among - as they put it - colleagues who were all fighting for their jobs .
let 's be clear - i 'm not saying the health service is in crisis .
but the government admits there have been pressures on staff in the past year- and the staff are saying they 're feeling it .
the challenge for the new leader of the uk 's nurses , dr peter carter , is how to take forward this strength of feeling - in a way that does n't conflict with the rcn 's declaration that it will do nothing to damage care for patients .

he was caught on camera rolling his eyes and raising his eyebrows as a contestant paid tribute to the 32 people who were shot dead on monday .
cowell claims he did not hear chris richardson 's speech on stage .
" i may not be the nicest person in the world , but i would never disrespect those families or victims , " he said .
cowell , who had accused richardson of singing in a " nasal tone " , insists he was talking to fellow judge paula abdul about the performance when he made the face .
executive producer ken warwick said cowell was " mortified " over the accusations .
chris richardson is from virginia , where the shootings took place " he would be the biggest fool on television if he did that .
and he 's not a fool , believe me , " mr warwick said .
he said noise and the microphone set-up made it difficult for cowell to hear richardson after his song .
in a statement , another executive producer , nigel lythgoe , also defended the music mogul .
" this is a sad time for everyone , so it is especially disheartening that a quick camera cutaway could have been misinterpreted , " he said .
the fox network said it had received few complaints about the incident .
dave burnell , the manager of wfxr , the local fox station in virginia , dismissed the matter as unimportant .
show tribute " it 's just like everything .
everyone second-guesses everything these days , " he said .
" the media should be concentrating on why this person did it , talking about the families affected . "
at the start of the show , host ryan seacrest paid tribute to the victims .

cho was known to the police before the shooting but did he fit some kind of killer 's profile ?
it appears that the 23-year-old 's actions and intentions fell into a pattern of previous school and college shootings .
robin kowalski , a psychologist at clemson university in south carolina , has co-written a comprehensive study on school shootings .
she told the bbc news website that cho 's actions bore strong similarities with other killings .
like eric harris and dylan klebold - perpetrators of the columbine massacre - and kimveer gill , who went on a killing spree at a canadian school last year , the foundation for cho 's violent act was laid out long before it took place .
and , like those killers , he left behind rage-filled testaments - harris , klebold and kimveer via the internet , cho via his video .
cho even refers to the columbine perpetrators as " martyrs " in his video , which bore similarities to images on kimveer 's own web page .
on it , kimveer is shown brandishing a gun and a hunting knife .
cho 's own video also shows him with guns and a knife .
common factors " we distinguished five common factors in the shootings we studied , " says ms kowalski .
" the first is an acute rejection episode - such as a break up with a girlfriend - which usually takes place shortly before the killer acts . "
kimveer gill said he wanted to die in a hail of gunfire it is not known at this stage whether cho had experienced an acute rejection episode .
but in his video , he makes it clear he believes there was an on-going history of rejection , another factor , according to ms kowalski .
" teasing , bullying or other kinds of rejection were common elements in school shootings , " she says .
in his video , cho says : " you have vandalised my heart , raped my soul and tortured my conscience .
you thought it was one pathetic more life you were extinguishing .
thanks to you , i die like jesus christ to inspire generations of the weak and the defenceless people . "
he also labelled fellow students " brats " and " snobs " .
a fascination with guns and explosives is another factor .
cho , it appears , had acquired weaponry over a period of time .
the video also shows him dressed in a hunting vest , black baseball cap and gloves brandishing guns at the camera .
psychological problems another factor is a pre-occupation with death .
" they talk about it a lot and they think about it .
cho 's plays appear to indicate a fascination with the subject , " says ms kowalski .
cho sent the video to nbc before carrying out the second shootings in one of his plays , entitled richard mcbeef , the main character named john is alone in his room throwing darts at a target covered with a picture of his stepfather , the eponymous character .
john says : " i hate him .
must kill dick .
must kill dick .
dick must die .
kill dick . "
ms kowalski also found that perpetrators had underlying psychological problems .
cho had previously been accused of stalking two female students , and had been taken to a mental health facility in 2005 .
there were also concerns at the time that he was suicidal .
steve hinshaw , chair of the psychology department at the university of california berkeley , told afp news agency , that while it was impossible to accurately diagnose cho from the brief set of video clips , his actions and words showed cho could have been suffering from a severe case of grandiosity and possibly either bipolar depression or schizophrenia .
" he made a statement that he wo n't be put down and this must be shown in a self-destructive but self-promoting blaze of glory , " he said .
secret service study ms kowalski said that in many campus and school killings , the perpetrators planned their attacks some time in advance .
cho must have planned the attack more than a month ago , when he purchased his first gun .
it appears that he began working on material for his video at least six days before the shootings : " this guy was very methodical and very calculated , " says ms kowalski .
" he was very clear cut about what he wanted to do . "
in 2002 , the us secret service conducted a major study of 37 school shootings to learn the patterns of the school-aged assassins .
the columbine massacre was well-planned most attacks , the report said , come from loners with some kind of grievance .
it found that more than half had revenge as a motive .
it also found that such shooters do not snap - they plan and they usually tell a friend or a classmate before the attack .
it also found that in 75 % of cases , at least one adult had raised concern about the attacker before the incident happened because of his behaviour .
cho 's creative writing was so disturbing that he was referred to the school 's counselling service .
dr scott poland , is a psychologist at nova southeastern university in fort lauderdale and an expert on school killings .
" the focus right now is on trying to figure out why cho did what he did - but even in school shootings where the perpetrators have survived , we have often been left with many unanswered questions , " he told the bbc news website .
methodical according to the secret service , there is no accurate or useful " profile " of students who engaged in targeted school violence .
there are many students who are troubled and many who have a fascination with death , but it does n't mean that they are going to kill people robin kowalski , psychologist it says that profiling students who may have traits similar to those of school shooters is not an effective remedy .
experts say that the concern with profiling is that it can include a high percentage of students that have similar characteristics .
" it will take the right set of personality characteristics in addition to certain environmental triggers to produce such events .
there are many students who are troubled and many who have a fascination with death , but it does n't mean that they are going to kill people , " says ms kowalski .
such attacks have a tremendous and lasting effect on the place that was targeted .
in the aftermath , questions are inevitably asked about whether the authorities should have known that the attack was being planned , and could have been prevented .
" this young man was known to be different and unique and one of the issues at college campuses is whether or not we can mandate any kind of counselling , " says professor poland .
" do we , for example , have the leverage to make a student who is troubled come to the counselling service ?
" we need to make sure that students know that the counselling service always has trained psychologists that can help them . "
he added that he would like to see the focus shifted on to the needs of the surviving students and teachers .
" my experience is that the school often underestimates the long-term effect of the crisis .
it is not unusual for there to be a lot of depression and suicides in the weeks and months after the tragedy . "

cho was known to the police before the shooting but did he fit some kind of killer 's profile ?
it appears that the 23-year-old 's actions and intentions fell into a pattern of previous school and college shootings .
robin kowalski , a psychologist at clemson university in south carolina , has co-written a comprehensive study on school shootings .
she told the bbc news website that cho 's actions bore strong similarities with other killings .
like eric harris and dylan klebold - perpetrators of the columbine massacre - and kimveer gill , who went on a killing spree at a canadian school last year , the foundation for cho 's violent act was laid out long before it took place .
and , like those killers , he left behind rage-filled testaments - harris , klebold and kimveer via the internet , cho via his video .
cho even refers to the columbine perpetrators as " martyrs " in his video , which bore similarities to images on kimveer 's own web page .
on it , kimveer is shown brandishing a gun and a hunting knife .
cho 's own video also shows him with guns and a knife .
common factors " we distinguished five common factors in the shootings we studied , " says ms kowalski .
" the first is an acute rejection episode - such as a break up with a girlfriend - which usually takes place shortly before the killer acts . "
kimveer gill said he wanted to die in a hail of gunfire it is not known at this stage whether cho had experienced an acute rejection episode .
but in his video , he makes it clear he believes there was an on-going history of rejection , another factor , according to ms kowalski .
" teasing , bullying or other kinds of rejection were common elements in school shootings , " she says .
in his video , cho says : " you have vandalised my heart , raped my soul and tortured my conscience .
you thought it was one pathetic more life you were extinguishing .
thanks to you , i die like jesus christ to inspire generations of the weak and the defenceless people . "
he also labelled fellow students " brats " and " snobs " .
a fascination with guns and explosives is another factor .
cho , it appears , had acquired weaponry over a period of time .
the video also shows him dressed in a hunting vest , black baseball cap and gloves brandishing guns at the camera .
psychological problems another factor is a pre-occupation with death .
" they talk about it a lot and they think about it .
cho 's plays appear to indicate a fascination with the subject , " says ms kowalski .
cho sent the video to nbc before carrying out the second shootings in one of his plays , entitled richard mcbeef , the main character named john is alone in his room throwing darts at a target covered with a picture of his stepfather , the eponymous character .
john says : " i hate him .
must kill dick .
must kill dick .
dick must die .
kill dick . "
ms kowalski also found that perpetrators had underlying psychological problems .
cho had previously been accused of stalking two female students , and had been taken to a mental health facility in 2005 .
there were also concerns at the time that he was suicidal .
steve hinshaw , chair of the psychology department at the university of california berkeley , told afp news agency , that while it was impossible to accurately diagnose cho from the brief set of video clips , his actions and words showed cho could have been suffering from a severe case of grandiosity and possibly either bipolar depression or schizophrenia .
" he made a statement that he wo n't be put down and this must be shown in a self-destructive but self-promoting blaze of glory , " he said .
secret service study ms kowalski said that in many campus and school killings , the perpetrators planned their attacks some time in advance .
cho must have planned the attack more than a month ago , when he purchased his first gun .
it appears that he began working on material for his video at least six days before the shootings : " this guy was very methodical and very calculated , " says ms kowalski .
" he was very clear cut about what he wanted to do . "
in 2002 , the us secret service conducted a major study of 37 school shootings to learn the patterns of the school-aged assassins .
the columbine massacre was well-planned most attacks , the report said , come from loners with some kind of grievance .
it found that more than half had revenge as a motive .
it also found that such shooters do not snap - they plan and they usually tell a friend or a classmate before the attack .
it also found that in 75 % of cases , at least one adult had raised concern about the attacker before the incident happened because of his behaviour .
cho 's creative writing was so disturbing that he was referred to the school 's counselling service .
dr scott poland , is a psychologist at nova southeastern university in fort lauderdale and an expert on school killings .
" the focus right now is on trying to figure out why cho did what he did - but even in school shootings where the perpetrators have survived , we have often been left with many unanswered questions , " he told the bbc news website .

newly retired msp donald gorrie said it should " never say never " to an independence referendum .
the nationalists are committed to one , but scots lib dem leader nicol stephen has regarded it as a " significant block " to a power-sharing deal .
mr gorrie said this need not be the case , and has urged all party leaders to set aside " macho posturing " .
he said they should be prepared to " negotiate away disagreements " after the may election , adding that labour would have the lib dems " over a barrel " if it became clear they would not talk to the snp .
possible compromise personally , mr gorrie favours referendums , but politically , he expressed concern that the liberal democrats would weaken their negotiating position by ruling one out .
the holyrood and westminster veteran has suggested a multi-option referendum as a possible compromise .
the liberal democrats , he claimed , may have to choose whether to form a coalition with labour or the snp .
he said they should do so on the basis of which party would help deliver the liberal democrats manifesto .

newly retired msp donald gorrie said it should " never say never " to an independence referendum .
the nationalists are committed to one , but scots lib dem leader nicol stephen has regarded it as a " significant block " to a power-sharing deal .
mr gorrie said this need not be the case , and has urged all party leaders to set aside " macho posturing " .
he said they should be prepared to " negotiate away disagreements " after the may election , adding that labour would have the lib dems " over a barrel " if it became clear they would not talk to the snp .
possible compromise personally , mr gorrie favours referendums , but politically , he expressed concern that the liberal democrats would weaken their negotiating position by ruling one out .
the holyrood and westminster veteran has suggested a multi-option referendum as a possible compromise .
the liberal democrats , he claimed , may have to choose whether to form a coalition with labour or the snp .
he said they should do so on the basis of which party would help deliver the liberal democrats manifesto .

the deal will see existing post office outlets relocated to wh smith stores an average of 250 metres from the original site , the retailer said .
the move , which follows trials in six outlets , will boost wh smith 's annual profits by about £ 2.5m , the firm said .
wh smith also reported a 7 % rise in pre-tax pre-exceptional profits to £ 59m for the six months to 28 february .
however , profits in its high street shops were down £ 2m to £ 51m as sales of cds and dvds declined .
combination ' makes sense ' wh smith said that there was a " natural fit " between its brand and the post office which had been demonstrated by the pilot scheme .
