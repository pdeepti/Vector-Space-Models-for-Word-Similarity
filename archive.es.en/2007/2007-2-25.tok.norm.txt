" the court finds that serbia has not committed genocide , " rosalyn higgins , the president of the international court of justice , said . in the same ruling , the court judged that the srebrenica massacre was an act of genocide , but one that " can not be attributable to the respondent -lrb- serbia -rrb- . "
the court ruled that other mass killings of bosnian muslims did not amount to genocide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icj judges in the hague the court added that although serbia had violated its obligations to bosnia because it did not try to prevent the massacre of 8,000 bosnian muslims , belgrade would not have to pay financial compensation . genocide was made an international crime under a 1948 treaty but no un court has ever given a ruling against an individual country .
bosnia has accused serbia of masterminding the widespread " ethnic cleansing " of bosnian muslims and croats during the 1992-95 war , saying it was similar to the extermination campaigns of the nazis in world war ii . the bosnian government had demanded reparations while serbia insisted the top un court has no jurisdiction in the matter .
monday 's ruling is final ; no appeal is possible . unique case the case was also unique in that it covered the whole of the war in bosnia .
the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , the un 's ad hoc war-crimes court , has handed down many verdicts relating to bosnia but they were limited to certain events or the guilt of key people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic -lrb- center -rrb- in court the only trial that tackled the whole of the bosnian war and serbia 's involvement was that of former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic .
but it was never concluded since milosevic died last march before the proceedings ended . in hearings before the icj in february last year bosnia asked the court to conclude that the killings and rapes during the bosnian war were " international genocide " orchestrated by belgrade .
proving genocide requires establishing intent to destroy a group , in whole or in part , as well as demonstrating that genocidal acts took place . the trial was given evidence about events such as the massacre of muslims from the town of srebrenica near the end of the war .
after capturing the town , serb forces summarily killed some 8,000 men and boys who had try to flee .
the icty has already handed down two individual genocide convictions against serbian officers . hard to prove prior to the ruling , legal experts said that proving serbia as a state or milosevic as its president had the intent to commit genocide would be extremely difficult . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic is still on the run " even if they rule serbia was involved in the war and that acts of genocide were committed you can say that was genocide committed by -lrb- bosnian serb army commander -rrb- ratko mladic , but it will be harder to say it was committed by milosevic , " international law expert heikelina verrijn stuart told afp . " the icj can rule that there was involvement of serbia in the war , that there were incidents of genocide , like the 1995 srebrenica massacre , but that involvement of belgrade in the genocide is not proven . " no jurisdiction ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bosnian muslim man prays at the grave of his father , who was killed during the war serbia had argued that the icj has no jurisdiction in the matter because the bosnian complaint was filed against the rump federal republic of yugoslavia -lrb- fry -rrb- in 1993 - later replaced by serbia and montenegro - which only became a un member in 2000 .
the icj only has jurisdiction over un member states . serbia had also said a ruling against it would be unjust and had left a lasting black mark on the nation , which overthrew wartime leader milosevic in 2000 . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de serbia rejects un plan for kosovo serbia 's newly elected parliament has overwhelmingly voted against a un plan on the future of its breakaway province of kosovo as a violation of the country 's territorial integrity .

the spacecraft was forced to switch from solar to battery power for even longer as it traversed a martian solar eclipse , esa said . " we lost the radio signal when rosetta moved behind mars , and it reappeared as expected 15 minutes later , " said esa spokeswoman elso montagnon . rosetta came within just 250 kilometers -lrb- 155 miles -rrb- of the red planet and used martian gravity to swing its course onward , as it pursues its looping mission around the solar system in what esa has called a game of " cosmic billiards . " the big suspense of this evening was the eclipse , " montagnon said . critical moment for a full 25 minutes mars completely shut the probe off from the light of the sun .
deprived of the energy it otherwise captures from two huge solar panels , it continued to speed along at 39,191 kilometers per hour functioning on battery power . " it was the first time since its launch that rosetta crossed an eclipse , " montagnon said .
" we could not be 100 percent sure that the batteries would be up to the job .
it was a fairly critical moment . " because the spacecraft was on the far side of mars , mission control were completely in the dark during the switchover from solar power .
the probe was not designed to run on battery power , whose primary function was to add stability after takeoff . " clouds are visible " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mars seen from afar the billion-euro -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- rosetta , launched in 2004 on a 10-year voyage of some seven billion kilometers , took a series of pictures as it passed mars between 2 a.m. and 2:40 a.m.
gmt , the agency -lrb- esa -rrb- said in a statement . " clouds are visible at the north polar cap of mars and at the morning ' limb ' -lrb- the outermost edge of a celestial body -rrb- , " esa said .
" a high altitude cloud is also visible . " passing mars , the craft " changed direction and then sped away from the red planet on a brand new path , continuing on a journey that will ultimately take it beyond jupiter 's orbit , " the agency said . more to come esa 's head of missions manfred warhaut said the fly-past of mars was the most delicate stage of the mission since its launch .
rosetta now heads for earth , where it is due to arrive in november for another dramatic fly-past .
rosetta is scheduled to hook up with comet churyumov-gerasimenko in 2014 after a voyage of 7.1 billion kilometers . " today we have reached another milestone on the way to finding an answer to questions such as whether life on earth began with the help of comets , " the agency 's director of science , david southwood , was quoted as saying in an esa statement .
" this is only the beginning .

" the court finds that serbia has not committed genocide , " rosalyn higgins , the president of the international court of justice , said . in the same ruling , the court judged that the srebrenica massacre was an act of genocide , but one that " can not be attributable to the respondent -lrb- serbia -rrb- . "
the court ruled that other mass killings of bosnian muslims did not amount to genocide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icj judges in the hague the court added that although serbia had violated its obligations to bosnia because it did not try to prevent the massacre of 8,000 bosnian muslims , belgrade would not have to pay financial compensation . genocide was made an international crime under a 1948 treaty but no un court has ever given a ruling against an individual country .
bosnia has accused serbia of masterminding the widespread " ethnic cleansing " of bosnian muslims and croats during the 1992-95 war , saying it was similar to the extermination campaigns of the nazis in world war ii . the bosnian government had demanded reparations while serbia insisted the top un court has no jurisdiction in the matter .
monday 's ruling is final ; no appeal is possible . unique case the case was also unique in that it covered the whole of the war in bosnia .
the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , the un 's ad hoc war-crimes court , has handed down many verdicts relating to bosnia but they were limited to certain events or the guilt of key people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic -lrb- center -rrb- in court the only trial that tackled the whole of the bosnian war and serbia 's involvement was that of former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic .
but it was never concluded since milosevic died last march before the proceedings ended . in hearings before the icj in february last year bosnia asked the court to conclude that the killings and rapes during the bosnian war were " international genocide " orchestrated by belgrade .
proving genocide requires establishing intent to destroy a group , in whole or in part , as well as demonstrating that genocidal acts took place . the trial was given evidence about events such as the massacre of muslims from the town of srebrenica near the end of the war .
after capturing the town , serb forces summarily killed some 8,000 men and boys who had try to flee .
the icty has already handed down two individual genocide convictions against serbian officers . hard to prove prior to the ruling , legal experts said that proving serbia as a state or milosevic as its president had the intent to commit genocide would be extremely difficult . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic is still on the run " even if they rule serbia was involved in the war and that acts of genocide were committed you can say that was genocide committed by -lrb- bosnian serb army commander -rrb- ratko mladic , but it will be harder to say it was committed by milosevic , " international law expert heikelina verrijn stuart told afp . " the icj can rule that there was involvement of serbia in the war , that there were incidents of genocide , like the 1995 srebrenica massacre , but that involvement of belgrade in the genocide is not proven . " no jurisdiction ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bosnian muslim man prays at the grave of his father , who was killed during the war serbia had argued that the icj has no jurisdiction in the matter because the bosnian complaint was filed against the rump federal republic of yugoslavia -lrb- fry -rrb- in 1993 - later replaced by serbia and montenegro - which only became a un member in 2000 .

but it was never concluded since milosevic died last march before the proceedings ended . in hearings before the icj in february last year bosnia asked the court to conclude that the killings and rapes during the bosnian war were " international genocide " orchestrated by belgrade .
proving genocide requires establishing intent to destroy a group , in whole or in part , as well as demonstrating that genocidal acts took place . the trial was given evidence about events such as the massacre of muslims from the town of srebrenica near the end of the war .
after capturing the town , serb forces summarily killed some 8,000 men and boys who had try to flee .
the icty has already handed down two individual genocide convictions against serbian officers . hard to prove prior to the ruling , legal experts said that proving serbia as a state or milosevic as its president had the intent to commit genocide would be extremely difficult . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic is still on the run " even if they rule serbia was involved in the war and that acts of genocide were committed you can say that was genocide committed by -lrb- bosnian serb army commander -rrb- ratko mladic , but it will be harder to say it was committed by milosevic , " international law expert heikelina verrijn stuart told afp . " the icj can rule that there was involvement of serbia in the war , that there were incidents of genocide , like the 1995 srebrenica massacre , but that involvement of belgrade in the genocide is not proven . " no jurisdiction ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bosnian muslim man prays at the grave of his father , who was killed during the war serbia had argued that the icj has no jurisdiction in the matter because the bosnian complaint was filed against the rump federal republic of yugoslavia -lrb- fry -rrb- in 1993 - later replaced by serbia and montenegro - which only became a un member in 2000 .

" the court finds that serbia has not committed genocide , " rosalyn higgins , the president of the international court of justice , said . in the same ruling , the court judged that the srebrenica massacre was an act of genocide , but one that " can not be attributable to the respondent -lrb- serbia -rrb- . "
the court ruled that other mass killings of bosnian muslims did not amount to genocide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icj judges in the hague the court added that although serbia had violated its obligations to bosnia because it did not try to prevent the massacre of 8,000 bosnian muslims , belgrade would not have to pay financial compensation . genocide was made an international crime under a 1948 treaty but no un court has ever given a ruling against an individual country .
bosnia has accused serbia of masterminding the widespread " ethnic cleansing " of bosnian muslims and croats during the 1992-95 war , saying it was similar to the extermination campaigns of the nazis in world war ii . the bosnian government had demanded reparations while serbia insisted the top un court has no jurisdiction in the matter .

"
according to the study , the real figure may be much greater . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for multilingualism leonard orban " far from being an unwelcome cost to doing business , " european commissioner for multilingualism , leonard orban , said , " investing in language skills can dramatically improve a company 's business opportunities .
i plan to place multilingualism at the heart of the lisbon strategy for more growth and jobs . " orban , whose post was created last month when his country romania joined the eu , told reporters that he intended " to set all the official languages spoken in the european union on an equal footing . " increasingly , however , even within eu offices , english is becoming the lingua franca and many documents or press releases are available only in english , french or german . english as an intermediary language the report by the national center for languages in britain shows that trend being mirrored in large companies where " english appeared to be more extensively used as an intermediary language than was the case with smes , possibly reflecting its use also as a corporate language in many multi-nationals . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is english becoming a universal language ?
but the report and the european commission stress that that is not the case everywhere . " english is a key language for gaining access to export markets , " the commission said in a statement .
" however , the survey results suggest that the picture is far more complex than the much-quoted view that english is the world language .
russian is extensively used in eastern europe -lrb- along with german and polish -rrb- .
french is used to trade in areas of africa and spanish is used similarly in latin america .
longer-term business partnerships depend upon relationship-building and relationship-management .
to achieve this , cultural and linguistic knowledge of the target country are essential . " the british study will form the basis for the forthcoming work of the business forum , which orban intends to launch this year in partnership with european businesses , to understand better how language skills impact on eu trade and jobs . a european tower of babel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu spends 1 percent of its annual budget on language services the european union 's complex and overloaded language machine was handed a new burden in january as bulgarian , romanian and gaelic were added to the eu 's 20 official languages . the eu 's institutions are still struggling to assimilate the nine languages added to europe 's very own tower of babel in 2004 . at the moment , the eu 's three main institutions - the european council of 27 member countries , the executive european commission and the european parliament - employ around 4,000 interpreters and translators and at least 1,500 freelancers , who are used on a regular basis . all this costs eu tax payers close to one billion euros each year , or " less than one percent of the total budget , " as the commission likes to underline . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romanian to become eu 's first commissioner for multilingualism the european parliament will vote on romania 's candidate for the post of commissioner for multilingualism in december .
leonard orban is expected to be approved , but doubts remain as to how influential his role will be .
-lrb- 11.12.2006 -rrb- mother tongues neglected as integration tool in germany international mother language day is being observed across the globe on wednesday .

eastern european countries , however , are increasingly discovering the benefits of organics . the booming global organic market was worth an estimated 33 billion euros -lrb- $ 43 billion -rrb- in 2006 .
even though eastern european countries made up only a tiny portion of that market , the production of organic crops and goods in the region once known for its industrial assemblies and gray apartment blocks has been on a steady rise . thanks to increasing incomes and growing environmental awareness , domestic markets are starting to emerge in the region .
experts say that poland and the czech republic have the biggest internal markets for organic produce , followed by hungary . according to tom vaclavik , who runs a czech organic consulting company called green marketing , czech consumers bought an estimated 18 million euros worth of organic goods in 2006 .
this may be a drop in the ocean compared to germany - europe 's biggest organic market , which is worth 3.9 billion euros - but a threefold market growth could be expected within five years . " the demand is increasing incredibly , " vaclavik said .
" in the last two years , the market grew by combined 80 percent .
demand is really increasing , mainly in the large cities .
the media are also becoming more concerned about the quality of food production . " ripe for investment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand is outstripping supply as a result of the interest in organic products , domestic organic production has not been able to keep up with demand .

" in the processed food area , i would say it could be 60 or even 70 percent that are imported . " this is a common story throughout eastern europe , where organic produce is mainly raw , such as cereals - wheat , rye and barley - as well as berries , some fruits and vegetables .
there is currently hardly any investment in the processing and manufacture of organic goods in the region . " i think the market is ripe for new investments and new products , " vaclavik said .

but there is reason to believe that organic production in other eastern european countries will pick up as well . " if you look at the western european markets , demand is outstripping supply in many areas , " vaclavik said .

" it was the grain basket of europe in old times , and it is now becoming the organic grain basket of europe . " " if you look closely at what is happening with demand in the netherlands , in germany and in the united kingdom - these countries have quite a big demand for grain , and a big shortage was already covered by ukrainian supplies this year . " milovanov says ukraine 's organic sector is being held back by the lack of legislation setting legal standards .

eastern european countries , however , are increasingly discovering the benefits of organics . the booming global organic market was worth an estimated 33 billion euros -lrb- $ 43 billion -rrb- in 2006 .
even though eastern european countries made up only a tiny portion of that market , the production of organic crops and goods in the region once known for its industrial assemblies and gray apartment blocks has been on a steady rise . thanks to increasing incomes and growing environmental awareness , domestic markets are starting to emerge in the region .
experts say that poland and the czech republic have the biggest internal markets for organic produce , followed by hungary . according to tom vaclavik , who runs a czech organic consulting company called green marketing , czech consumers bought an estimated 18 million euros worth of organic goods in 2006 .
this may be a drop in the ocean compared to germany - europe 's biggest organic market , which is worth 3.9 billion euros - but a threefold market growth could be expected within five years . " the demand is increasing incredibly , " vaclavik said .
" in the last two years , the market grew by combined 80 percent .
demand is really increasing , mainly in the large cities .
the media are also becoming more concerned about the quality of food production . " ripe for investment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand is outstripping supply as a result of the interest in organic products , domestic organic production has not been able to keep up with demand . " organic products are mainly coming from germany , the netherlands , italy , france and even the united kingdom , " vaclavik said .
" in the processed food area , i would say it could be 60 or even 70 percent that are imported . " this is a common story throughout eastern europe , where organic produce is mainly raw , such as cereals - wheat , rye and barley - as well as berries , some fruits and vegetables .
there is currently hardly any investment in the processing and manufacture of organic goods in the region . " i think the market is ripe for new investments and new products , " vaclavik said .
" the market is still in its initial phase of development , but it 's quite cheap to invest .
it will be more expensive in five years . " expansion of farmland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern european organic products may fill up the needs of western consumers as well the increasing eastern european domestic markets and the booming western european markets are also fuelling the expansion of organic farmland in eastern europe . in 2006 , the czech republic had around 280,000 hectares -lrb- 692,000 acres -rrb- under production , poland 220,000 hectares , and hungary 130,000 hectares - making these three countries the market leaders .
but there is reason to believe that organic production in other eastern european countries will pick up as well . " if you look at the western european markets , demand is outstripping supply in many areas , " vaclavik said .
" there are shortages of milk , meat and organic feed , which has to be produced somewhere .

nicole renvert from berlin 's institute for international relations is the author of " changing values and interests . "
she told dw that germany and the us were drifting apart even before the rift over iraq . dw : how are germany and the us drifting apart ? nicole renvert : interests have shifted .
it 's not so much that our value systems differ , but we are pursuing other geo-political goals and we are also using different methods to reach these goals .
clearly , after the end of the cold war , the us became challenged in a different way to germany .
i think this realization came pretty late on both sides of the atlantic - that once you have changed goals and methods , you also have to change the way you interact . and why did this occur in such a small space of time ?
did sept .
11 and german reunification play a role ? i do n't think it did occur in short space of time .
i think basically the confrontation we saw in 2002 with the discussion about the intervention in iraq was just the tip of the iceberg .
i think the period after world war ii was an anomaly , when there was such a focus on western europe and particularly the relationship between germany and the us , which was seen as a model democracy .
after the end of the cold war we faced a period of normalization but then sept.11 changed many things , and one of these things was the way that germany and the us spoke to each other . to what extent is the media responsible for this ? the media has very short-lived dimensions .
sometimes it emphasizes tensions and sometimes it undermines long-standing relationships .
the relationship between germany and the us was never an easy one , and the media highlights it differently , at different times .
but now you get the impression this relationship has changed fundamentally , even though there have always been shifts and changes . how do things look now that angela merkel is chancellor and seems to be able to discuss topics with george w. bush and vladimir putin in a language they both seem to understand ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has helped thaw relations to the us i think she does a tremendous job .

those discussions are now over , and no more formal input from the member states is scheduled before a european summit in brussels on march 8-9 where the eu leaders will discuss the final text over dinner . some points already have unanimous backing .
everyone agrees that the berlin declaration should be short - two or three pages - and an easy read , unburdened by the kind of euro-babble , jargon and diplomatic subtleties that make so much of the eu 's output incomprehensible to the layperson . on top of that , the eu nations have agreed that the declaration should celebrate the peace and prosperity which the union has helped to construct since the dark days of world war ii . as ever , searching for a consensus the devil , as ever , is in the details . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker stressed last week that he would like the euro currency to get a mention " as one of the great successes of european construction .

" what we want is a simple document which celebrates what has been achieved by all member states , " a downing street spokesman told afp .
" if particular member states are going to be upset about some things , it 's not very constructive ... it 's difficult to see how the euro would be relevant . " germany faces the same problem if it is thinking of mentioning the schengen visa-free travel zone within the eu , another project which london has not adopted . " if we 're speaking about the ' europe of citizens , ' what could be more concrete than the abolition of frontiers ? " asked juncker spokesman guy schueller .
is there a european social model ? the other red line is the idea of championing a ' european social model ' as prescribed by europe 's left wing , which wants to put a more human face on the bloc 's free trade and globalization tendencies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french and dutch voters created a quandary for backers of the constitution " the notion of a european social model appears unstoppable , " notably in a bid to rally a section of the french voters who rejected the eu 's proposed constitution at a 2005 referendum , said one european diplomat .

those discussions are now over , and no more formal input from the member states is scheduled before a european summit in brussels on march 8-9 where the eu leaders will discuss the final text over dinner . some points already have unanimous backing .
everyone agrees that the berlin declaration should be short - two or three pages - and an easy read , unburdened by the kind of euro-babble , jargon and diplomatic subtleties that make so much of the eu 's output incomprehensible to the layperson . on top of that , the eu nations have agreed that the declaration should celebrate the peace and prosperity which the union has helped to construct since the dark days of world war ii . as ever , searching for a consensus the devil , as ever , is in the details . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker stressed last week that he would like the euro currency to get a mention " as one of the great successes of european construction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker says merkel should praise the euro those sentiments are unsurprising coming from the president of the eurogroup , which brings together the finance ministers from the 13 nations which use the common currency . unsurprising and unsatisfactory , according to britain , which still proudly retains the cherished pound sterling which , like the euro , is doing very nicely on the currency markets . " what we want is a simple document which celebrates what has been achieved by all member states , " a downing street spokesman told afp .
" if particular member states are going to be upset about some things , it 's not very constructive ... it 's difficult to see how the euro would be relevant . " germany faces the same problem if it is thinking of mentioning the schengen visa-free travel zone within the eu , another project which london has not adopted . " if we 're speaking about the ' europe of citizens , ' what could be more concrete than the abolition of frontiers ? " asked juncker spokesman guy schueller .
is there a european social model ? the other red line is the idea of championing a ' european social model ' as prescribed by europe 's left wing , which wants to put a more human face on the bloc 's free trade and globalization tendencies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french and dutch voters created a quandary for backers of the constitution " the notion of a european social model appears unstoppable , " notably in a bid to rally a section of the french voters who rejected the eu 's proposed constitution at a 2005 referendum , said one european diplomat . " but how do you formulate it ?
we 're in the classic rift between the neo-liberals and the more social vein , " he added . championing the move towards a more social europe , the employment ministers of belgium , bulgaria , cyprus , france , greece , hungary , italy , luxembourg and spain last week signed an agreement in luxembourg proclaiming the " indispensable balance between economic freedoms and social rights , so that the internal market can become an area also regulated by a social plan . " the eu 's d ead letter the idea begs the question , according to one european diplomat , " what is the european objective ?
a greater and greater integration ad infinitum ? " the divisions inherent in this question are nowhere better illustrated than in the search for agreement on an eu-wide constitution .
the current version , signed by all member states and ratified by two-thirds of them , has been a dead letter since being rejected by dutch and french voters in national referendums in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu celebrated new entrants bulgaria and romania in january but germany now has the constitutional bit firmly between its teeth and intends to revive the text - with whatever modifications prove necessary - and present a roadmap for its progression by the time portugal takes over the eu baton in july . however , many diplomatic sources agree that the germans do n't want to anticipate too much before the french presidential election in may . that should at least give them more time to write the 50th birthday card . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro zone economy strong , but still behind us the us continues to outpace europe in growth , despite the fact that the european economy started 2007 on a firm note .

"
according to the study , the real figure may be much greater . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for multilingualism leonard orban " far from being an unwelcome cost to doing business , " european commissioner for multilingualism , leonard orban , said , " investing in language skills can dramatically improve a company 's business opportunities .
i plan to place multilingualism at the heart of the lisbon strategy for more growth and jobs . " orban , whose post was created last month when his country romania joined the eu , told reporters that he intended " to set all the official languages spoken in the european union on an equal footing . " increasingly , however , even within eu offices , english is becoming the lingua franca and many documents or press releases are available only in english , french or german . english as an intermediary language the report by the national center for languages in britain shows that trend being mirrored in large companies where " english appeared to be more extensively used as an intermediary language than was the case with smes , possibly reflecting its use also as a corporate language in many multi-nationals . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is english becoming a universal language ?
but the report and the european commission stress that that is not the case everywhere . " english is a key language for gaining access to export markets , " the commission said in a statement .
" however , the survey results suggest that the picture is far more complex than the much-quoted view that english is the world language .
russian is extensively used in eastern europe -lrb- along with german and polish -rrb- .
french is used to trade in areas of africa and spanish is used similarly in latin america .
longer-term business partnerships depend upon relationship-building and relationship-management .
to achieve this , cultural and linguistic knowledge of the target country are essential . " the british study will form the basis for the forthcoming work of the business forum , which orban intends to launch this year in partnership with european businesses , to understand better how language skills impact on eu trade and jobs . a european tower of babel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu spends 1 percent of its annual budget on language services the european union 's complex and overloaded language machine was handed a new burden in january as bulgarian , romanian and gaelic were added to the eu 's 20 official languages . the eu 's institutions are still struggling to assimilate the nine languages added to europe 's very own tower of babel in 2004 . at the moment , the eu 's three main institutions - the european council of 27 member countries , the executive european commission and the european parliament - employ around 4,000 interpreters and translators and at least 1,500 freelancers , who are used on a regular basis . all this costs eu tax payers close to one billion euros each year , or " less than one percent of the total budget , " as the commission likes to underline . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romanian to become eu 's first commissioner for multilingualism the european parliament will vote on romania 's candidate for the post of commissioner for multilingualism in december .

nicole renvert from berlin 's institute for international relations is the author of " changing values and interests . "
she told dw that germany and the us were drifting apart even before the rift over iraq . dw : how are germany and the us drifting apart ? nicole renvert : interests have shifted .
it 's not so much that our value systems differ , but we are pursuing other geo-political goals and we are also using different methods to reach these goals .
clearly , after the end of the cold war , the us became challenged in a different way to germany .
i think this realization came pretty late on both sides of the atlantic - that once you have changed goals and methods , you also have to change the way you interact . and why did this occur in such a small space of time ?
did sept .
11 and german reunification play a role ? i do n't think it did occur in short space of time .

nicole renvert from berlin 's institute for international relations is the author of " changing values and interests . "
she told dw that germany and the us were drifting apart even before the rift over iraq . dw : how are germany and the us drifting apart ? nicole renvert : interests have shifted .
it 's not so much that our value systems differ , but we are pursuing other geo-political goals and we are also using different methods to reach these goals .
clearly , after the end of the cold war , the us became challenged in a different way to germany .
i think this realization came pretty late on both sides of the atlantic - that once you have changed goals and methods , you also have to change the way you interact . and why did this occur in such a small space of time ?

11 and german reunification play a role ? i do n't think it did occur in short space of time .
i think basically the confrontation we saw in 2002 with the discussion about the intervention in iraq was just the tip of the iceberg .
i think the period after world war ii was an anomaly , when there was such a focus on western europe and particularly the relationship between germany and the us , which was seen as a model democracy .
after the end of the cold war we faced a period of normalization but then sept.11 changed many things , and one of these things was the way that germany and the us spoke to each other . to what extent is the media responsible for this ? the media has very short-lived dimensions .
sometimes it emphasizes tensions and sometimes it undermines long-standing relationships .
the relationship between germany and the us was never an easy one , and the media highlights it differently , at different times .
but now you get the impression this relationship has changed fundamentally , even though there have always been shifts and changes . how do things look now that angela merkel is chancellor and seems to be able to discuss topics with george w. bush and vladimir putin in a language they both seem to understand ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has helped thaw relations to the us i think she does a tremendous job .
i think everyone is extremely surprised and impressed by how she rose to this new role as a real leader - in a very good sense of the word - and i do think it is important to have a dialogue .
during the late 1990s we neglected the importance of dialogue at a very high political level , and i think she managed to revitalize it . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush and merkel hail new chapter in us-german relations german chancellor angela merkel emerged from talks with president george w. bush in washington friday to say that us-german relations were back on track and that they shared common ground on many issues , including iran .

everyone agrees that the berlin declaration should be short - two or three pages - and an easy read , unburdened by the kind of euro-babble , jargon and diplomatic subtleties that make so much of the eu 's output incomprehensible to the layperson . on top of that , the eu nations have agreed that the declaration should celebrate the peace and prosperity which the union has helped to construct since the dark days of world war ii . as ever , searching for a consensus the devil , as ever , is in the details . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker stressed last week that he would like the euro currency to get a mention " as one of the great successes of european construction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker says merkel should praise the euro those sentiments are unsurprising coming from the president of the eurogroup , which brings together the finance ministers from the 13 nations which use the common currency . unsurprising and unsatisfactory , according to britain , which still proudly retains the cherished pound sterling which , like the euro , is doing very nicely on the currency markets . " what we want is a simple document which celebrates what has been achieved by all member states , " a downing street spokesman told afp .
" if particular member states are going to be upset about some things , it 's not very constructive ... it 's difficult to see how the euro would be relevant . " germany faces the same problem if it is thinking of mentioning the schengen visa-free travel zone within the eu , another project which london has not adopted . " if we 're speaking about the ' europe of citizens , ' what could be more concrete than the abolition of frontiers ? " asked juncker spokesman guy schueller .
is there a european social model ? the other red line is the idea of championing a ' european social model ' as prescribed by europe 's left wing , which wants to put a more human face on the bloc 's free trade and globalization tendencies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french and dutch voters created a quandary for backers of the constitution " the notion of a european social model appears unstoppable , " notably in a bid to rally a section of the french voters who rejected the eu 's proposed constitution at a 2005 referendum , said one european diplomat . " but how do you formulate it ?
we 're in the classic rift between the neo-liberals and the more social vein , " he added . championing the move towards a more social europe , the employment ministers of belgium , bulgaria , cyprus , france , greece , hungary , italy , luxembourg and spain last week signed an agreement in luxembourg proclaiming the " indispensable balance between economic freedoms and social rights , so that the internal market can become an area also regulated by a social plan . " the eu 's d ead letter the idea begs the question , according to one european diplomat , " what is the european objective ?
a greater and greater integration ad infinitum ? " the divisions inherent in this question are nowhere better illustrated than in the search for agreement on an eu-wide constitution .
the current version , signed by all member states and ratified by two-thirds of them , has been a dead letter since being rejected by dutch and french voters in national referendums in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu celebrated new entrants bulgaria and romania in january but germany now has the constitutional bit firmly between its teeth and intends to revive the text - with whatever modifications prove necessary - and present a roadmap for its progression by the time portugal takes over the eu baton in july . however , many diplomatic sources agree that the germans do n't want to anticipate too much before the french presidential election in may . that should at least give them more time to write the 50th birthday card . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro zone economy strong , but still behind us the us continues to outpace europe in growth , despite the fact that the european economy started 2007 on a firm note .

it 's not so much that our value systems differ , but we are pursuing other geo-political goals and we are also using different methods to reach these goals .
clearly , after the end of the cold war , the us became challenged in a different way to germany .

11 and german reunification play a role ? i do n't think it did occur in short space of time .
i think basically the confrontation we saw in 2002 with the discussion about the intervention in iraq was just the tip of the iceberg .
i think the period after world war ii was an anomaly , when there was such a focus on western europe and particularly the relationship between germany and the us , which was seen as a model democracy .
after the end of the cold war we faced a period of normalization but then sept.11 changed many things , and one of these things was the way that germany and the us spoke to each other . to what extent is the media responsible for this ? the media has very short-lived dimensions .
sometimes it emphasizes tensions and sometimes it undermines long-standing relationships .

i think everyone is extremely surprised and impressed by how she rose to this new role as a real leader - in a very good sense of the word - and i do think it is important to have a dialogue .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 25.02.2007 eastern european countries jumping on organic wagon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic products are becoming increasingly popular in eastern europe last year , the us and the eu 's western countries accounted for 96 percent of world sales of organic products .
eastern european countries , however , are increasingly discovering the benefits of organics . the booming global organic market was worth an estimated 33 billion euros -lrb- $ 43 billion -rrb- in 2006 .
even though eastern european countries made up only a tiny portion of that market , the production of organic crops and goods in the region once known for its industrial assemblies and gray apartment blocks has been on a steady rise . thanks to increasing incomes and growing environmental awareness , domestic markets are starting to emerge in the region .
experts say that poland and the czech republic have the biggest internal markets for organic produce , followed by hungary . according to tom vaclavik , who runs a czech organic consulting company called green marketing , czech consumers bought an estimated 18 million euros worth of organic goods in 2006 .
this may be a drop in the ocean compared to germany - europe 's biggest organic market , which is worth 3.9 billion euros - but a threefold market growth could be expected within five years . " the demand is increasing incredibly , " vaclavik said .
" in the last two years , the market grew by combined 80 percent .
demand is really increasing , mainly in the large cities .
the media are also becoming more concerned about the quality of food production . " ripe for investment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand is outstripping supply as a result of the interest in organic products , domestic organic production has not been able to keep up with demand . " organic products are mainly coming from germany , the netherlands , italy , france and even the united kingdom , " vaclavik said .
" in the processed food area , i would say it could be 60 or even 70 percent that are imported . " this is a common story throughout eastern europe , where organic produce is mainly raw , such as cereals - wheat , rye and barley - as well as berries , some fruits and vegetables .
there is currently hardly any investment in the processing and manufacture of organic goods in the region . " i think the market is ripe for new investments and new products , " vaclavik said .
" the market is still in its initial phase of development , but it 's quite cheap to invest .
it will be more expensive in five years . " expansion of farmland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern european organic products may fill up the needs of western consumers as well the increasing eastern european domestic markets and the booming western european markets are also fuelling the expansion of organic farmland in eastern europe . in 2006 , the czech republic had around 280,000 hectares -lrb- 692,000 acres -rrb- under production , poland 220,000 hectares , and hungary 130,000 hectares - making these three countries the market leaders .
but there is reason to believe that organic production in other eastern european countries will pick up as well . " if you look at the western european markets , demand is outstripping supply in many areas , " vaclavik said .
" there are shortages of milk , meat and organic feed , which has to be produced somewhere .
i believe some of the new eu countries such as romania , bulgaria but also slovakia and the czech republic could produce organic products . " europe 's organic grain basket another important newcomer to the organic scene is ukraine .
with 240,000 hectares under production , it 's the second most important producer in eastern and central europe .
the vast majority of ukraine 's organic farms are large-scale - more than 3,000 hectares . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine has been exporting most of its organic grains according to eugene milovanov of the organic federation of ukraine , the production is still mainly limited to wheat for export . " ukraine is already developing as agricultural and organic agricultural country , " milovanov said .
" it was the grain basket of europe in old times , and it is now becoming the organic grain basket of europe . " " if you look closely at what is happening with demand in the netherlands , in germany and in the united kingdom - these countries have quite a big demand for grain , and a big shortage was already covered by ukrainian supplies this year . " milovanov says ukraine 's organic sector is being held back by the lack of legislation setting legal standards .
in 2004 , however , the government formed a working group to draft regulations , and it is hoped that the parliament will pass the law later this year . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german farmers ca n't keep up with organic demand as agriculture industry representatives concentrate on organic products at the annual " green week " trade fair in berlin , germany 's organic farmers are finding it impossible to keep up with growing consumer demand .

the spacecraft was forced to switch from solar to battery power for even longer as it traversed a martian solar eclipse , esa said . " we lost the radio signal when rosetta moved behind mars , and it reappeared as expected 15 minutes later , " said esa spokeswoman elso montagnon . rosetta came within just 250 kilometers -lrb- 155 miles -rrb- of the red planet and used martian gravity to swing its course onward , as it pursues its looping mission around the solar system in what esa has called a game of " cosmic billiards . " the big suspense of this evening was the eclipse , " montagnon said . critical moment for a full 25 minutes mars completely shut the probe off from the light of the sun .
deprived of the energy it otherwise captures from two huge solar panels , it continued to speed along at 39,191 kilometers per hour functioning on battery power . " it was the first time since its launch that rosetta crossed an eclipse , " montagnon said .

"
according to the study , the real figure may be much greater . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eu commissioner for multilingualism leonard orban " far from being an unwelcome cost to doing business , " european commissioner for multilingualism , leonard orban , said , " investing in language skills can dramatically improve a company 's business opportunities .
i plan to place multilingualism at the heart of the lisbon strategy for more growth and jobs . " orban , whose post was created last month when his country romania joined the eu , told reporters that he intended " to set all the official languages spoken in the european union on an equal footing . " increasingly , however , even within eu offices , english is becoming the lingua franca and many documents or press releases are available only in english , french or german . english as an intermediary language the report by the national center for languages in britain shows that trend being mirrored in large companies where " english appeared to be more extensively used as an intermediary language than was the case with smes , possibly reflecting its use also as a corporate language in many multi-nationals . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : is english becoming a universal language ?
but the report and the european commission stress that that is not the case everywhere . " english is a key language for gaining access to export markets , " the commission said in a statement .
" however , the survey results suggest that the picture is far more complex than the much-quoted view that english is the world language .
russian is extensively used in eastern europe -lrb- along with german and polish -rrb- .
french is used to trade in areas of africa and spanish is used similarly in latin america .
longer-term business partnerships depend upon relationship-building and relationship-management .
to achieve this , cultural and linguistic knowledge of the target country are essential . " the british study will form the basis for the forthcoming work of the business forum , which orban intends to launch this year in partnership with european businesses , to understand better how language skills impact on eu trade and jobs . a european tower of babel bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu spends 1 percent of its annual budget on language services the european union 's complex and overloaded language machine was handed a new burden in january as bulgarian , romanian and gaelic were added to the eu 's 20 official languages . the eu 's institutions are still struggling to assimilate the nine languages added to europe 's very own tower of babel in 2004 . at the moment , the eu 's three main institutions - the european council of 27 member countries , the executive european commission and the european parliament - employ around 4,000 interpreters and translators and at least 1,500 freelancers , who are used on a regular basis . all this costs eu tax payers close to one billion euros each year , or " less than one percent of the total budget , " as the commission likes to underline . dw staff / afp -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de romanian to become eu 's first commissioner for multilingualism the european parliament will vote on romania 's candidate for the post of commissioner for multilingualism in december .
leonard orban is expected to be approved , but doubts remain as to how influential his role will be .

" the court finds that serbia has not committed genocide , " rosalyn higgins , the president of the international court of justice , said . in the same ruling , the court judged that the srebrenica massacre was an act of genocide , but one that " can not be attributable to the respondent -lrb- serbia -rrb- . "
the court ruled that other mass killings of bosnian muslims did not amount to genocide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icj judges in the hague the court added that although serbia had violated its obligations to bosnia because it did not try to prevent the massacre of 8,000 bosnian muslims , belgrade would not have to pay financial compensation . genocide was made an international crime under a 1948 treaty but no un court has ever given a ruling against an individual country .
bosnia has accused serbia of masterminding the widespread " ethnic cleansing " of bosnian muslims and croats during the 1992-95 war , saying it was similar to the extermination campaigns of the nazis in world war ii . the bosnian government had demanded reparations while serbia insisted the top un court has no jurisdiction in the matter .
monday 's ruling is final ; no appeal is possible . unique case the case was also unique in that it covered the whole of the war in bosnia .
the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , the un 's ad hoc war-crimes court , has handed down many verdicts relating to bosnia but they were limited to certain events or the guilt of key people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic -lrb- center -rrb- in court the only trial that tackled the whole of the bosnian war and serbia 's involvement was that of former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic .
but it was never concluded since milosevic died last march before the proceedings ended . in hearings before the icj in february last year bosnia asked the court to conclude that the killings and rapes during the bosnian war were " international genocide " orchestrated by belgrade .
proving genocide requires establishing intent to destroy a group , in whole or in part , as well as demonstrating that genocidal acts took place . the trial was given evidence about events such as the massacre of muslims from the town of srebrenica near the end of the war .
after capturing the town , serb forces summarily killed some 8,000 men and boys who had try to flee .
the icty has already handed down two individual genocide convictions against serbian officers . hard to prove prior to the ruling , legal experts said that proving serbia as a state or milosevic as its president had the intent to commit genocide would be extremely difficult . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic is still on the run " even if they rule serbia was involved in the war and that acts of genocide were committed you can say that was genocide committed by -lrb- bosnian serb army commander -rrb- ratko mladic , but it will be harder to say it was committed by milosevic , " international law expert heikelina verrijn stuart told afp . " the icj can rule that there was involvement of serbia in the war , that there were incidents of genocide , like the 1995 srebrenica massacre , but that involvement of belgrade in the genocide is not proven . " no jurisdiction ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bosnian muslim man prays at the grave of his father , who was killed during the war serbia had argued that the icj has no jurisdiction in the matter because the bosnian complaint was filed against the rump federal republic of yugoslavia -lrb- fry -rrb- in 1993 - later replaced by serbia and montenegro - which only became a un member in 2000 .

" the court finds that serbia has not committed genocide , " rosalyn higgins , the president of the international court of justice , said . in the same ruling , the court judged that the srebrenica massacre was an act of genocide , but one that " can not be attributable to the respondent -lrb- serbia -rrb- . "
the court ruled that other mass killings of bosnian muslims did not amount to genocide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icj judges in the hague the court added that although serbia had violated its obligations to bosnia because it did not try to prevent the massacre of 8,000 bosnian muslims , belgrade would not have to pay financial compensation . genocide was made an international crime under a 1948 treaty but no un court has ever given a ruling against an individual country .
bosnia has accused serbia of masterminding the widespread " ethnic cleansing " of bosnian muslims and croats during the 1992-95 war , saying it was similar to the extermination campaigns of the nazis in world war ii . the bosnian government had demanded reparations while serbia insisted the top un court has no jurisdiction in the matter .
monday 's ruling is final ; no appeal is possible . unique case the case was also unique in that it covered the whole of the war in bosnia .
the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , the un 's ad hoc war-crimes court , has handed down many verdicts relating to bosnia but they were limited to certain events or the guilt of key people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic -lrb- center -rrb- in court the only trial that tackled the whole of the bosnian war and serbia 's involvement was that of former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic .
but it was never concluded since milosevic died last march before the proceedings ended . in hearings before the icj in february last year bosnia asked the court to conclude that the killings and rapes during the bosnian war were " international genocide " orchestrated by belgrade .
proving genocide requires establishing intent to destroy a group , in whole or in part , as well as demonstrating that genocidal acts took place . the trial was given evidence about events such as the massacre of muslims from the town of srebrenica near the end of the war .
after capturing the town , serb forces summarily killed some 8,000 men and boys who had try to flee .
the icty has already handed down two individual genocide convictions against serbian officers . hard to prove prior to the ruling , legal experts said that proving serbia as a state or milosevic as its president had the intent to commit genocide would be extremely difficult . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic is still on the run " even if they rule serbia was involved in the war and that acts of genocide were committed you can say that was genocide committed by -lrb- bosnian serb army commander -rrb- ratko mladic , but it will be harder to say it was committed by milosevic , " international law expert heikelina verrijn stuart told afp . " the icj can rule that there was involvement of serbia in the war , that there were incidents of genocide , like the 1995 srebrenica massacre , but that involvement of belgrade in the genocide is not proven .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 25.02.2007 eastern european countries jumping on organic wagon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic products are becoming increasingly popular in eastern europe last year , the us and the eu 's western countries accounted for 96 percent of world sales of organic products .
eastern european countries , however , are increasingly discovering the benefits of organics . the booming global organic market was worth an estimated 33 billion euros -lrb- $ 43 billion -rrb- in 2006 .
even though eastern european countries made up only a tiny portion of that market , the production of organic crops and goods in the region once known for its industrial assemblies and gray apartment blocks has been on a steady rise . thanks to increasing incomes and growing environmental awareness , domestic markets are starting to emerge in the region .
experts say that poland and the czech republic have the biggest internal markets for organic produce , followed by hungary . according to tom vaclavik , who runs a czech organic consulting company called green marketing , czech consumers bought an estimated 18 million euros worth of organic goods in 2006 .
this may be a drop in the ocean compared to germany - europe 's biggest organic market , which is worth 3.9 billion euros - but a threefold market growth could be expected within five years . " the demand is increasing incredibly , " vaclavik said .
" in the last two years , the market grew by combined 80 percent .
demand is really increasing , mainly in the large cities .
the media are also becoming more concerned about the quality of food production . " ripe for investment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand is outstripping supply as a result of the interest in organic products , domestic organic production has not been able to keep up with demand . " organic products are mainly coming from germany , the netherlands , italy , france and even the united kingdom , " vaclavik said .
" in the processed food area , i would say it could be 60 or even 70 percent that are imported . " this is a common story throughout eastern europe , where organic produce is mainly raw , such as cereals - wheat , rye and barley - as well as berries , some fruits and vegetables .
there is currently hardly any investment in the processing and manufacture of organic goods in the region . " i think the market is ripe for new investments and new products , " vaclavik said .
" the market is still in its initial phase of development , but it 's quite cheap to invest .
it will be more expensive in five years . " expansion of farmland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern european organic products may fill up the needs of western consumers as well the increasing eastern european domestic markets and the booming western european markets are also fuelling the expansion of organic farmland in eastern europe . in 2006 , the czech republic had around 280,000 hectares -lrb- 692,000 acres -rrb- under production , poland 220,000 hectares , and hungary 130,000 hectares - making these three countries the market leaders .
but there is reason to believe that organic production in other eastern european countries will pick up as well . " if you look at the western european markets , demand is outstripping supply in many areas , " vaclavik said .
" there are shortages of milk , meat and organic feed , which has to be produced somewhere .
i believe some of the new eu countries such as romania , bulgaria but also slovakia and the czech republic could produce organic products . " europe 's organic grain basket another important newcomer to the organic scene is ukraine .
with 240,000 hectares under production , it 's the second most important producer in eastern and central europe .
the vast majority of ukraine 's organic farms are large-scale - more than 3,000 hectares . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine has been exporting most of its organic grains according to eugene milovanov of the organic federation of ukraine , the production is still mainly limited to wheat for export . " ukraine is already developing as agricultural and organic agricultural country , " milovanov said .
" it was the grain basket of europe in old times , and it is now becoming the organic grain basket of europe . " " if you look closely at what is happening with demand in the netherlands , in germany and in the united kingdom - these countries have quite a big demand for grain , and a big shortage was already covered by ukrainian supplies this year . " milovanov says ukraine 's organic sector is being held back by the lack of legislation setting legal standards .
in 2004 , however , the government formed a working group to draft regulations , and it is hoped that the parliament will pass the law later this year . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german farmers ca n't keep up with organic demand as agriculture industry representatives concentrate on organic products at the annual " green week " trade fair in berlin , germany 's organic farmers are finding it impossible to keep up with growing consumer demand .

eastern european countries , however , are increasingly discovering the benefits of organics . the booming global organic market was worth an estimated 33 billion euros -lrb- $ 43 billion -rrb- in 2006 .
even though eastern european countries made up only a tiny portion of that market , the production of organic crops and goods in the region once known for its industrial assemblies and gray apartment blocks has been on a steady rise . thanks to increasing incomes and growing environmental awareness , domestic markets are starting to emerge in the region .
experts say that poland and the czech republic have the biggest internal markets for organic produce , followed by hungary . according to tom vaclavik , who runs a czech organic consulting company called green marketing , czech consumers bought an estimated 18 million euros worth of organic goods in 2006 .
this may be a drop in the ocean compared to germany - europe 's biggest organic market , which is worth 3.9 billion euros - but a threefold market growth could be expected within five years . " the demand is increasing incredibly , " vaclavik said .

there is currently hardly any investment in the processing and manufacture of organic goods in the region . " i think the market is ripe for new investments and new products , " vaclavik said .

the spacecraft was forced to switch from solar to battery power for even longer as it traversed a martian solar eclipse , esa said . " we lost the radio signal when rosetta moved behind mars , and it reappeared as expected 15 minutes later , " said esa spokeswoman elso montagnon . rosetta came within just 250 kilometers -lrb- 155 miles -rrb- of the red planet and used martian gravity to swing its course onward , as it pursues its looping mission around the solar system in what esa has called a game of " cosmic billiards . " the big suspense of this evening was the eclipse , " montagnon said . critical moment for a full 25 minutes mars completely shut the probe off from the light of the sun .
deprived of the energy it otherwise captures from two huge solar panels , it continued to speed along at 39,191 kilometers per hour functioning on battery power . " it was the first time since its launch that rosetta crossed an eclipse , " montagnon said .
" we could not be 100 percent sure that the batteries would be up to the job .
it was a fairly critical moment . " because the spacecraft was on the far side of mars , mission control were completely in the dark during the switchover from solar power .
the probe was not designed to run on battery power , whose primary function was to add stability after takeoff .

" a high altitude cloud is also visible . " passing mars , the craft " changed direction and then sped away from the red planet on a brand new path , continuing on a journey that will ultimately take it beyond jupiter 's orbit , " the agency said . more to come esa 's head of missions manfred warhaut said the fly-past of mars was the most delicate stage of the mission since its launch .
rosetta now heads for earth , where it is due to arrive in november for another dramatic fly-past .
rosetta is scheduled to hook up with comet churyumov-gerasimenko in 2014 after a voyage of 7.1 billion kilometers . " today we have reached another milestone on the way to finding an answer to questions such as whether life on earth began with the help of comets , " the agency 's director of science , david southwood , was quoted as saying in an esa statement .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the european union turns 50 the day the eu was born eu ponders more questions than answers amid celebrations founding fathers : europeans behind the union eu leaders adopt 50th anniversary berlin declaration diplomacy -pipe- 25.02.2007 berlin walks tightrope in search of eu anniversary text großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if only germany could find the balance so well a spat between london and luxembourg about the euro has highlighted the problems the german eu presidency faces in devising a celebratory declaration for the 50th anniversary of the bloc 's founding treaty next month . the question of encapsulating the successes of the european union in a few pages may not seem an overwhelming problem to euroskeptics , but is proving rather tricky for berlin . german chancellor angela merkel , whose country assumed the rotating eu presidency last month , asked the 27 member states to send envoys for bilateral talks at which they put forward all their national suggestions .
those discussions are now over , and no more formal input from the member states is scheduled before a european summit in brussels on march 8-9 where the eu leaders will discuss the final text over dinner . some points already have unanimous backing .
everyone agrees that the berlin declaration should be short - two or three pages - and an easy read , unburdened by the kind of euro-babble , jargon and diplomatic subtleties that make so much of the eu 's output incomprehensible to the layperson . on top of that , the eu nations have agreed that the declaration should celebrate the peace and prosperity which the union has helped to construct since the dark days of world war ii . as ever , searching for a consensus the devil , as ever , is in the details . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker stressed last week that he would like the euro currency to get a mention " as one of the great successes of european construction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker says merkel should praise the euro those sentiments are unsurprising coming from the president of the eurogroup , which brings together the finance ministers from the 13 nations which use the common currency . unsurprising and unsatisfactory , according to britain , which still proudly retains the cherished pound sterling which , like the euro , is doing very nicely on the currency markets .

eastern european countries , however , are increasingly discovering the benefits of organics . the booming global organic market was worth an estimated 33 billion euros -lrb- $ 43 billion -rrb- in 2006 .
even though eastern european countries made up only a tiny portion of that market , the production of organic crops and goods in the region once known for its industrial assemblies and gray apartment blocks has been on a steady rise . thanks to increasing incomes and growing environmental awareness , domestic markets are starting to emerge in the region .
experts say that poland and the czech republic have the biggest internal markets for organic produce , followed by hungary . according to tom vaclavik , who runs a czech organic consulting company called green marketing , czech consumers bought an estimated 18 million euros worth of organic goods in 2006 .
this may be a drop in the ocean compared to germany - europe 's biggest organic market , which is worth 3.9 billion euros - but a threefold market growth could be expected within five years . " the demand is increasing incredibly , " vaclavik said .
" in the last two years , the market grew by combined 80 percent .
demand is really increasing , mainly in the large cities .
the media are also becoming more concerned about the quality of food production . " ripe for investment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand is outstripping supply as a result of the interest in organic products , domestic organic production has not been able to keep up with demand .

" in the processed food area , i would say it could be 60 or even 70 percent that are imported . " this is a common story throughout eastern europe , where organic produce is mainly raw , such as cereals - wheat , rye and barley - as well as berries , some fruits and vegetables .
there is currently hardly any investment in the processing and manufacture of organic goods in the region . " i think the market is ripe for new investments and new products , " vaclavik said .

it will be more expensive in five years .

but there is reason to believe that organic production in other eastern european countries will pick up as well . " if you look at the western european markets , demand is outstripping supply in many areas , " vaclavik said .

eastern european countries , however , are increasingly discovering the benefits of organics . the booming global organic market was worth an estimated 33 billion euros -lrb- $ 43 billion -rrb- in 2006 .
even though eastern european countries made up only a tiny portion of that market , the production of organic crops and goods in the region once known for its industrial assemblies and gray apartment blocks has been on a steady rise . thanks to increasing incomes and growing environmental awareness , domestic markets are starting to emerge in the region .
experts say that poland and the czech republic have the biggest internal markets for organic produce , followed by hungary . according to tom vaclavik , who runs a czech organic consulting company called green marketing , czech consumers bought an estimated 18 million euros worth of organic goods in 2006 .
this may be a drop in the ocean compared to germany - europe 's biggest organic market , which is worth 3.9 billion euros - but a threefold market growth could be expected within five years . " the demand is increasing incredibly , " vaclavik said .

there is currently hardly any investment in the processing and manufacture of organic goods in the region . " i think the market is ripe for new investments and new products , " vaclavik said .

" organic products are mainly coming from germany , the netherlands , italy , france and even the united kingdom , " vaclavik said .
" in the processed food area , i would say it could be 60 or even 70 percent that are imported . " this is a common story throughout eastern europe , where organic produce is mainly raw , such as cereals - wheat , rye and barley - as well as berries , some fruits and vegetables .
there is currently hardly any investment in the processing and manufacture of organic goods in the region . " i think the market is ripe for new investments and new products , " vaclavik said .
" the market is still in its initial phase of development , but it 's quite cheap to invest .
it will be more expensive in five years . " expansion of farmland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern european organic products may fill up the needs of western consumers as well the increasing eastern european domestic markets and the booming western european markets are also fuelling the expansion of organic farmland in eastern europe . in 2006 , the czech republic had around 280,000 hectares -lrb- 692,000 acres -rrb- under production , poland 220,000 hectares , and hungary 130,000 hectares - making these three countries the market leaders .
but there is reason to believe that organic production in other eastern european countries will pick up as well . " if you look at the western european markets , demand is outstripping supply in many areas , " vaclavik said .
" there are shortages of milk , meat and organic feed , which has to be produced somewhere .
i believe some of the new eu countries such as romania , bulgaria but also slovakia and the czech republic could produce organic products . " europe 's organic grain basket another important newcomer to the organic scene is ukraine .
with 240,000 hectares under production , it 's the second most important producer in eastern and central europe .
the vast majority of ukraine 's organic farms are large-scale - more than 3,000 hectares . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine has been exporting most of its organic grains according to eugene milovanov of the organic federation of ukraine , the production is still mainly limited to wheat for export . " ukraine is already developing as agricultural and organic agricultural country , " milovanov said .
" it was the grain basket of europe in old times , and it is now becoming the organic grain basket of europe . " " if you look closely at what is happening with demand in the netherlands , in germany and in the united kingdom - these countries have quite a big demand for grain , and a big shortage was already covered by ukrainian supplies this year . " milovanov says ukraine 's organic sector is being held back by the lack of legislation setting legal standards .
in 2004 , however , the government formed a working group to draft regulations , and it is hoped that the parliament will pass the law later this year . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german farmers ca n't keep up with organic demand as agriculture industry representatives concentrate on organic products at the annual " green week " trade fair in berlin , germany 's organic farmers are finding it impossible to keep up with growing consumer demand .

" the court finds that serbia has not committed genocide , " rosalyn higgins , the president of the international court of justice , said . in the same ruling , the court judged that the srebrenica massacre was an act of genocide , but one that " can not be attributable to the respondent -lrb- serbia -rrb- . "
the court ruled that other mass killings of bosnian muslims did not amount to genocide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icj judges in the hague the court added that although serbia had violated its obligations to bosnia because it did not try to prevent the massacre of 8,000 bosnian muslims , belgrade would not have to pay financial compensation . genocide was made an international crime under a 1948 treaty but no un court has ever given a ruling against an individual country .
bosnia has accused serbia of masterminding the widespread " ethnic cleansing " of bosnian muslims and croats during the 1992-95 war , saying it was similar to the extermination campaigns of the nazis in world war ii . the bosnian government had demanded reparations while serbia insisted the top un court has no jurisdiction in the matter .
monday 's ruling is final ; no appeal is possible . unique case the case was also unique in that it covered the whole of the war in bosnia .

but it was never concluded since milosevic died last march before the proceedings ended . in hearings before the icj in february last year bosnia asked the court to conclude that the killings and rapes during the bosnian war were " international genocide " orchestrated by belgrade .
proving genocide requires establishing intent to destroy a group , in whole or in part , as well as demonstrating that genocidal acts took place . the trial was given evidence about events such as the massacre of muslims from the town of srebrenica near the end of the war .
after capturing the town , serb forces summarily killed some 8,000 men and boys who had try to flee .
the icty has already handed down two individual genocide convictions against serbian officers . hard to prove prior to the ruling , legal experts said that proving serbia as a state or milosevic as its president had the intent to commit genocide would be extremely difficult . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic is still on the run " even if they rule serbia was involved in the war and that acts of genocide were committed you can say that was genocide committed by -lrb- bosnian serb army commander -rrb- ratko mladic , but it will be harder to say it was committed by milosevic , " international law expert heikelina verrijn stuart told afp .

the court ruled that other mass killings of bosnian muslims did not amount to genocide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icj judges in the hague the court added that although serbia had violated its obligations to bosnia because it did not try to prevent the massacre of 8,000 bosnian muslims , belgrade would not have to pay financial compensation . genocide was made an international crime under a 1948 treaty but no un court has ever given a ruling against an individual country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the european union turns 50 the day the eu was born eu ponders more questions than answers amid celebrations founding fathers : europeans behind the union eu leaders adopt 50th anniversary berlin declaration diplomacy -pipe- 25.02.2007 berlin walks tightrope in search of eu anniversary text großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if only germany could find the balance so well a spat between london and luxembourg about the euro has highlighted the problems the german eu presidency faces in devising a celebratory declaration for the 50th anniversary of the bloc 's founding treaty next month . the question of encapsulating the successes of the european union in a few pages may not seem an overwhelming problem to euroskeptics , but is proving rather tricky for berlin . german chancellor angela merkel , whose country assumed the rotating eu presidency last month , asked the 27 member states to send envoys for bilateral talks at which they put forward all their national suggestions .
those discussions are now over , and no more formal input from the member states is scheduled before a european summit in brussels on march 8-9 where the eu leaders will discuss the final text over dinner . some points already have unanimous backing .
everyone agrees that the berlin declaration should be short - two or three pages - and an easy read , unburdened by the kind of euro-babble , jargon and diplomatic subtleties that make so much of the eu 's output incomprehensible to the layperson . on top of that , the eu nations have agreed that the declaration should celebrate the peace and prosperity which the union has helped to construct since the dark days of world war ii . as ever , searching for a consensus the devil , as ever , is in the details . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker stressed last week that he would like the euro currency to get a mention " as one of the great successes of european construction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker says merkel should praise the euro those sentiments are unsurprising coming from the president of the eurogroup , which brings together the finance ministers from the 13 nations which use the common currency . unsurprising and unsatisfactory , according to britain , which still proudly retains the cherished pound sterling which , like the euro , is doing very nicely on the currency markets . " what we want is a simple document which celebrates what has been achieved by all member states , " a downing street spokesman told afp .
" if particular member states are going to be upset about some things , it 's not very constructive ... it 's difficult to see how the euro would be relevant . " germany faces the same problem if it is thinking of mentioning the schengen visa-free travel zone within the eu , another project which london has not adopted . " if we 're speaking about the ' europe of citizens , ' what could be more concrete than the abolition of frontiers ? " asked juncker spokesman guy schueller .
is there a european social model ? the other red line is the idea of championing a ' european social model ' as prescribed by europe 's left wing , which wants to put a more human face on the bloc 's free trade and globalization tendencies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french and dutch voters created a quandary for backers of the constitution " the notion of a european social model appears unstoppable , " notably in a bid to rally a section of the french voters who rejected the eu 's proposed constitution at a 2005 referendum , said one european diplomat . " but how do you formulate it ?
we 're in the classic rift between the neo-liberals and the more social vein , " he added . championing the move towards a more social europe , the employment ministers of belgium , bulgaria , cyprus , france , greece , hungary , italy , luxembourg and spain last week signed an agreement in luxembourg proclaiming the " indispensable balance between economic freedoms and social rights , so that the internal market can become an area also regulated by a social plan . " the eu 's d ead letter the idea begs the question , according to one european diplomat , " what is the european objective ?
a greater and greater integration ad infinitum ? " the divisions inherent in this question are nowhere better illustrated than in the search for agreement on an eu-wide constitution .
the current version , signed by all member states and ratified by two-thirds of them , has been a dead letter since being rejected by dutch and french voters in national referendums in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu celebrated new entrants bulgaria and romania in january but germany now has the constitutional bit firmly between its teeth and intends to revive the text - with whatever modifications prove necessary - and present a roadmap for its progression by the time portugal takes over the eu baton in july . however , many diplomatic sources agree that the germans do n't want to anticipate too much before the french presidential election in may . that should at least give them more time to write the 50th birthday card . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro zone economy strong , but still behind us the us continues to outpace europe in growth , despite the fact that the european economy started 2007 on a firm note .

nicole renvert from berlin 's institute for international relations is the author of " changing values and interests . "
she told dw that germany and the us were drifting apart even before the rift over iraq . dw : how are germany and the us drifting apart ? nicole renvert : interests have shifted .
it 's not so much that our value systems differ , but we are pursuing other geo-political goals and we are also using different methods to reach these goals .
clearly , after the end of the cold war , the us became challenged in a different way to germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de in focus : the european union turns 50 the day the eu was born eu ponders more questions than answers amid celebrations founding fathers : europeans behind the union eu leaders adopt 50th anniversary berlin declaration diplomacy -pipe- 25.02.2007 berlin walks tightrope in search of eu anniversary text großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : if only germany could find the balance so well a spat between london and luxembourg about the euro has highlighted the problems the german eu presidency faces in devising a celebratory declaration for the 50th anniversary of the bloc 's founding treaty next month . the question of encapsulating the successes of the european union in a few pages may not seem an overwhelming problem to euroskeptics , but is proving rather tricky for berlin . german chancellor angela merkel , whose country assumed the rotating eu presidency last month , asked the 27 member states to send envoys for bilateral talks at which they put forward all their national suggestions .
those discussions are now over , and no more formal input from the member states is scheduled before a european summit in brussels on march 8-9 where the eu leaders will discuss the final text over dinner . some points already have unanimous backing .
everyone agrees that the berlin declaration should be short - two or three pages - and an easy read , unburdened by the kind of euro-babble , jargon and diplomatic subtleties that make so much of the eu 's output incomprehensible to the layperson . on top of that , the eu nations have agreed that the declaration should celebrate the peace and prosperity which the union has helped to construct since the dark days of world war ii . as ever , searching for a consensus the devil , as ever , is in the details . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker stressed last week that he would like the euro currency to get a mention " as one of the great successes of european construction . "
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : juncker says merkel should praise the euro those sentiments are unsurprising coming from the president of the eurogroup , which brings together the finance ministers from the 13 nations which use the common currency . unsurprising and unsatisfactory , according to britain , which still proudly retains the cherished pound sterling which , like the euro , is doing very nicely on the currency markets . " what we want is a simple document which celebrates what has been achieved by all member states , " a downing street spokesman told afp .
" if particular member states are going to be upset about some things , it 's not very constructive ... it 's difficult to see how the euro would be relevant . " germany faces the same problem if it is thinking of mentioning the schengen visa-free travel zone within the eu , another project which london has not adopted . " if we 're speaking about the ' europe of citizens , ' what could be more concrete than the abolition of frontiers ? " asked juncker spokesman guy schueller .
is there a european social model ? the other red line is the idea of championing a ' european social model ' as prescribed by europe 's left wing , which wants to put a more human face on the bloc 's free trade and globalization tendencies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french and dutch voters created a quandary for backers of the constitution " the notion of a european social model appears unstoppable , " notably in a bid to rally a section of the french voters who rejected the eu 's proposed constitution at a 2005 referendum , said one european diplomat . " but how do you formulate it ?
we 're in the classic rift between the neo-liberals and the more social vein , " he added . championing the move towards a more social europe , the employment ministers of belgium , bulgaria , cyprus , france , greece , hungary , italy , luxembourg and spain last week signed an agreement in luxembourg proclaiming the " indispensable balance between economic freedoms and social rights , so that the internal market can become an area also regulated by a social plan . " the eu 's d ead letter the idea begs the question , according to one european diplomat , " what is the european objective ?
a greater and greater integration ad infinitum ? " the divisions inherent in this question are nowhere better illustrated than in the search for agreement on an eu-wide constitution .
the current version , signed by all member states and ratified by two-thirds of them , has been a dead letter since being rejected by dutch and french voters in national referendums in 2005 .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu celebrated new entrants bulgaria and romania in january but germany now has the constitutional bit firmly between its teeth and intends to revive the text - with whatever modifications prove necessary - and present a roadmap for its progression by the time portugal takes over the eu baton in july . however , many diplomatic sources agree that the germans do n't want to anticipate too much before the french presidential election in may . that should at least give them more time to write the 50th birthday card . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de euro zone economy strong , but still behind us the us continues to outpace europe in growth , despite the fact that the european economy started 2007 on a firm note .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 25.02.2007 eastern european countries jumping on organic wagon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic products are becoming increasingly popular in eastern europe last year , the us and the eu 's western countries accounted for 96 percent of world sales of organic products .
eastern european countries , however , are increasingly discovering the benefits of organics . the booming global organic market was worth an estimated 33 billion euros -lrb- $ 43 billion -rrb- in 2006 .
even though eastern european countries made up only a tiny portion of that market , the production of organic crops and goods in the region once known for its industrial assemblies and gray apartment blocks has been on a steady rise . thanks to increasing incomes and growing environmental awareness , domestic markets are starting to emerge in the region .
experts say that poland and the czech republic have the biggest internal markets for organic produce , followed by hungary . according to tom vaclavik , who runs a czech organic consulting company called green marketing , czech consumers bought an estimated 18 million euros worth of organic goods in 2006 .
this may be a drop in the ocean compared to germany - europe 's biggest organic market , which is worth 3.9 billion euros - but a threefold market growth could be expected within five years . " the demand is increasing incredibly , " vaclavik said .
" in the last two years , the market grew by combined 80 percent .
demand is really increasing , mainly in the large cities .
the media are also becoming more concerned about the quality of food production . " ripe for investment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand is outstripping supply as a result of the interest in organic products , domestic organic production has not been able to keep up with demand . " organic products are mainly coming from germany , the netherlands , italy , france and even the united kingdom , " vaclavik said .
" in the processed food area , i would say it could be 60 or even 70 percent that are imported . " this is a common story throughout eastern europe , where organic produce is mainly raw , such as cereals - wheat , rye and barley - as well as berries , some fruits and vegetables .
there is currently hardly any investment in the processing and manufacture of organic goods in the region . " i think the market is ripe for new investments and new products , " vaclavik said .
" the market is still in its initial phase of development , but it 's quite cheap to invest .
it will be more expensive in five years . " expansion of farmland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern european organic products may fill up the needs of western consumers as well the increasing eastern european domestic markets and the booming western european markets are also fuelling the expansion of organic farmland in eastern europe . in 2006 , the czech republic had around 280,000 hectares -lrb- 692,000 acres -rrb- under production , poland 220,000 hectares , and hungary 130,000 hectares - making these three countries the market leaders .
but there is reason to believe that organic production in other eastern european countries will pick up as well . " if you look at the western european markets , demand is outstripping supply in many areas , " vaclavik said .
" there are shortages of milk , meat and organic feed , which has to be produced somewhere .
i believe some of the new eu countries such as romania , bulgaria but also slovakia and the czech republic could produce organic products . " europe 's organic grain basket another important newcomer to the organic scene is ukraine .
with 240,000 hectares under production , it 's the second most important producer in eastern and central europe .
the vast majority of ukraine 's organic farms are large-scale - more than 3,000 hectares . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine has been exporting most of its organic grains according to eugene milovanov of the organic federation of ukraine , the production is still mainly limited to wheat for export . " ukraine is already developing as agricultural and organic agricultural country , " milovanov said .
" it was the grain basket of europe in old times , and it is now becoming the organic grain basket of europe . " " if you look closely at what is happening with demand in the netherlands , in germany and in the united kingdom - these countries have quite a big demand for grain , and a big shortage was already covered by ukrainian supplies this year . " milovanov says ukraine 's organic sector is being held back by the lack of legislation setting legal standards .
in 2004 , however , the government formed a working group to draft regulations , and it is hoped that the parliament will pass the law later this year . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german farmers ca n't keep up with organic demand as agriculture industry representatives concentrate on organic products at the annual " green week " trade fair in berlin , germany 's organic farmers are finding it impossible to keep up with growing consumer demand .

eastern european countries , however , are increasingly discovering the benefits of organics . the booming global organic market was worth an estimated 33 billion euros -lrb- $ 43 billion -rrb- in 2006 .
even though eastern european countries made up only a tiny portion of that market , the production of organic crops and goods in the region once known for its industrial assemblies and gray apartment blocks has been on a steady rise . thanks to increasing incomes and growing environmental awareness , domestic markets are starting to emerge in the region .
experts say that poland and the czech republic have the biggest internal markets for organic produce , followed by hungary . according to tom vaclavik , who runs a czech organic consulting company called green marketing , czech consumers bought an estimated 18 million euros worth of organic goods in 2006 .
this may be a drop in the ocean compared to germany - europe 's biggest organic market , which is worth 3.9 billion euros - but a threefold market growth could be expected within five years . " the demand is increasing incredibly , " vaclavik said .

there is currently hardly any investment in the processing and manufacture of organic goods in the region . " i think the market is ripe for new investments and new products , " vaclavik said .

eastern european countries , however , are increasingly discovering the benefits of organics . the booming global organic market was worth an estimated 33 billion euros -lrb- $ 43 billion -rrb- in 2006 .
even though eastern european countries made up only a tiny portion of that market , the production of organic crops and goods in the region once known for its industrial assemblies and gray apartment blocks has been on a steady rise . thanks to increasing incomes and growing environmental awareness , domestic markets are starting to emerge in the region .
experts say that poland and the czech republic have the biggest internal markets for organic produce , followed by hungary . according to tom vaclavik , who runs a czech organic consulting company called green marketing , czech consumers bought an estimated 18 million euros worth of organic goods in 2006 .
this may be a drop in the ocean compared to germany - europe 's biggest organic market , which is worth 3.9 billion euros - but a threefold market growth could be expected within five years . " the demand is increasing incredibly , " vaclavik said .
" in the last two years , the market grew by combined 80 percent .
demand is really increasing , mainly in the large cities .
the media are also becoming more concerned about the quality of food production .

eu commission president jose barroso said sunday that the 27-member union had to move on taking climate control steps and position itself as the world leader in the fight against further damage to the environment . in an interview with german tabloid bild am sonntag , barroso said that the upcoming eu summit at the beginning of march would give state leaders an opportunity to take decisive steps regarding " one of the great global challenges of our time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso thinks it 's time to stop talking " we have talked for long enough - now we must act , " said barroso , who is planning on delivering a key note on climate policy in his home country portugal on monday . he called on members states to come to " clear-cut decisions about the corner stones of our future energy policy as 80 percent of all carbon gas emissions come from energy . " barroso added that the eu commission was committed to lower emissions by 30 percent by 2020 .

german environment minister sigmar gabriel meanwhile came out in support of a ban against incandescent light bulbs .
the australian government announced last week that it plans to ban this type of light bulbs as a climate control measure . " europe can not really afford products that have an energy efficiency of five percent , such as incandescent light bulbs , " gabriel wrote to eu environmental commissioner stavros dimas , according to bild am sonntag . the german minister added that europe should introduce standards against energy-wasting products .
according to studies , some 25 million tons of carbon monoxide emissions could be prevented if old-fashioned light bulbs would be replaced with newer , energy-efficient models . dimas himself seems open to the idea .

not surprising , as poker is booming here .
the game has become hip and popular on tv .
but critics warn it could encourage gambling addiction . poker clubs are springing up like mushrooms across germany .
every week , poker tournaments take place in practically every urban area .
it 's a game almost everyone is familiar with , either from playing simple variants like draw poker or from any good old western . " the basics are there , so people quickly lose their inhibitions to play , " said michael körner , a poker commentator at germany 's leading sports channel dsf .
he said poker 's fascination is due to three elements of the game . " it 's about money , suspense and player types , which people can relate to , " körner said .
" you have the poker lout , the nice guy , the parvenu or the young wild one . " figures by the german poker players association show there are some 260,000 active poker players in germany - 90 percent of which are male .
sandra dellenbusch from rhinepoker in hilden said her poker school offered seminars for an average of 200 players per week . " a lot of them are young people , who are also interested in strategic computer games or chess , " dellenbusch said . televised poker is particularly appealing the worldwide poker boom began in the united states following the prestigious world series of poker in 2003 in las vegas .
chris moneymaker , an accountant from tennessee , won the first prize of $ 2.5 million after qualifying online for a spot .
the triumph sparked a wildfire of amateur players hoping for the big money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extreme poker tournament is held on ice fields in finland on this side of the atlantic , the european poker tour -lrb- ept -rrb- is a leading tournament .
the german open will take place at the casino hohensyburg in dortmund from march 8-11 .
it is the first ept event to be staged in germany and all ept tournaments are televised throughout europe . poker 's popularity is also due to this transformation into a spectator sport , said jo mainz , head of the poker division at casino hohensyburg . " we have really experienced a tsunami of poker here since it started showing on television , " mainz said . german comedian stefan raab is hosting five poker tournaments in his popular late night show " tv total " this year .
and dsf plans to broadcast 800 hours of poker by the end of 2008 .
it reaches an average of 200,000 viewers with each tournament . according to körner , poker on television is all the more fascinating , as cameras give viewers a head start in terms of information . " the viewer becomes omniscient and this lets him get very close to the game , " he said . " rampant gambling will lead to rampant social problems . " there is a dark side to the poker boom , though , according to the association for gambling addiction in herford . " poker is being marketed as a hip event , " said the association 's spokeswoman ilona füchtenschnieder .
in televised tournaments , dynamic young men sit at the tables .
this has freed the game from its dingy image of being played in the back rooms of grimy bars and increased enthusiasm for poker . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poker can become addictive , critics warn " but rampant gambling will lead to rampant social problems , " füchtenschnieder said .
" that 's as sure as night follows day . " poker 's popularity on television has also led to an increase in online gambling , turning people 's living rooms into gambling havens .
but in germany , gambling for money is only allowed in state-controlled casinos . " it is a legal vacuum and the government should decide whether to regulate it or not , " füchtenschnieder said . for dsf 's körner , the association 's criticism is unfounded . " poker is just like power , sex , alcohol or food , " körner said .

not surprising , as poker is booming here .
the game has become hip and popular on tv .
but critics warn it could encourage gambling addiction . poker clubs are springing up like mushrooms across germany .
every week , poker tournaments take place in practically every urban area .
it 's a game almost everyone is familiar with , either from playing simple variants like draw poker or from any good old western . " the basics are there , so people quickly lose their inhibitions to play , " said michael körner , a poker commentator at germany 's leading sports channel dsf .
he said poker 's fascination is due to three elements of the game . " it 's about money , suspense and player types , which people can relate to , " körner said .
" you have the poker lout , the nice guy , the parvenu or the young wild one . " figures by the german poker players association show there are some 260,000 active poker players in germany - 90 percent of which are male .
sandra dellenbusch from rhinepoker in hilden said her poker school offered seminars for an average of 200 players per week . " a lot of them are young people , who are also interested in strategic computer games or chess , " dellenbusch said . televised poker is particularly appealing the worldwide poker boom began in the united states following the prestigious world series of poker in 2003 in las vegas .
chris moneymaker , an accountant from tennessee , won the first prize of $ 2.5 million after qualifying online for a spot .
the triumph sparked a wildfire of amateur players hoping for the big money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extreme poker tournament is held on ice fields in finland on this side of the atlantic , the european poker tour -lrb- ept -rrb- is a leading tournament .
the german open will take place at the casino hohensyburg in dortmund from march 8-11 .
it is the first ept event to be staged in germany and all ept tournaments are televised throughout europe . poker 's popularity is also due to this transformation into a spectator sport , said jo mainz , head of the poker division at casino hohensyburg . " we have really experienced a tsunami of poker here since it started showing on television , " mainz said . german comedian stefan raab is hosting five poker tournaments in his popular late night show " tv total " this year .
and dsf plans to broadcast 800 hours of poker by the end of 2008 .
it reaches an average of 200,000 viewers with each tournament . according to körner , poker on television is all the more fascinating , as cameras give viewers a head start in terms of information . " the viewer becomes omniscient and this lets him get very close to the game , " he said . " rampant gambling will lead to rampant social problems . " there is a dark side to the poker boom , though , according to the association for gambling addiction in herford . " poker is being marketed as a hip event , " said the association 's spokeswoman ilona füchtenschnieder .
in televised tournaments , dynamic young men sit at the tables .
this has freed the game from its dingy image of being played in the back rooms of grimy bars and increased enthusiasm for poker . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poker can become addictive , critics warn " but rampant gambling will lead to rampant social problems , " füchtenschnieder said .
" that 's as sure as night follows day . " poker 's popularity on television has also led to an increase in online gambling , turning people 's living rooms into gambling havens .
but in germany , gambling for money is only allowed in state-controlled casinos . " it is a legal vacuum and the government should decide whether to regulate it or not , " füchtenschnieder said . for dsf 's körner , the association 's criticism is unfounded . " poker is just like power , sex , alcohol or food , " körner said .
" too much is n't good .
no one is forcing you to bet your car .

the spacecraft was forced to switch from solar to battery power for even longer as it traversed a martian solar eclipse , esa said . " we lost the radio signal when rosetta moved behind mars , and it reappeared as expected 15 minutes later , " said esa spokeswoman elso montagnon . rosetta came within just 250 kilometers -lrb- 155 miles -rrb- of the red planet and used martian gravity to swing its course onward , as it pursues its looping mission around the solar system in what esa has called a game of " cosmic billiards . " the big suspense of this evening was the eclipse , " montagnon said . critical moment for a full 25 minutes mars completely shut the probe off from the light of the sun .
deprived of the energy it otherwise captures from two huge solar panels , it continued to speed along at 39,191 kilometers per hour functioning on battery power . " it was the first time since its launch that rosetta crossed an eclipse , " montagnon said .
" we could not be 100 percent sure that the batteries would be up to the job .
it was a fairly critical moment . " because the spacecraft was on the far side of mars , mission control were completely in the dark during the switchover from solar power .

" the big suspense of this evening was the eclipse , " montagnon said . critical moment for a full 25 minutes mars completely shut the probe off from the light of the sun .
deprived of the energy it otherwise captures from two huge solar panels , it continued to speed along at 39,191 kilometers per hour functioning on battery power . " it was the first time since its launch that rosetta crossed an eclipse , " montagnon said .
" we could not be 100 percent sure that the batteries would be up to the job .
it was a fairly critical moment . " because the spacecraft was on the far side of mars , mission control were completely in the dark during the switchover from solar power .
the probe was not designed to run on battery power , whose primary function was to add stability after takeoff . " clouds are visible " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mars seen from afar the billion-euro -lrb- $ 1.3 billion -rrb- rosetta , launched in 2004 on a 10-year voyage of some seven billion kilometers , took a series of pictures as it passed mars between 2 a.m. and 2:40 a.m.
gmt , the agency -lrb- esa -rrb- said in a statement . " clouds are visible at the north polar cap of mars and at the morning ' limb ' -lrb- the outermost edge of a celestial body -rrb- , " esa said .
" a high altitude cloud is also visible . " passing mars , the craft " changed direction and then sped away from the red planet on a brand new path , continuing on a journey that will ultimately take it beyond jupiter 's orbit , " the agency said . more to come esa 's head of missions manfred warhaut said the fly-past of mars was the most delicate stage of the mission since its launch .
rosetta now heads for earth , where it is due to arrive in november for another dramatic fly-past .
rosetta is scheduled to hook up with comet churyumov-gerasimenko in 2014 after a voyage of 7.1 billion kilometers . " today we have reached another milestone on the way to finding an answer to questions such as whether life on earth began with the help of comets , " the agency 's director of science , david southwood , was quoted as saying in an esa statement .
" this is only the beginning .

" the court finds that serbia has not committed genocide , " rosalyn higgins , the president of the international court of justice , said . in the same ruling , the court judged that the srebrenica massacre was an act of genocide , but one that " can not be attributable to the respondent -lrb- serbia -rrb- . "
the court ruled that other mass killings of bosnian muslims did not amount to genocide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icj judges in the hague the court added that although serbia had violated its obligations to bosnia because it did not try to prevent the massacre of 8,000 bosnian muslims , belgrade would not have to pay financial compensation . genocide was made an international crime under a 1948 treaty but no un court has ever given a ruling against an individual country .
bosnia has accused serbia of masterminding the widespread " ethnic cleansing " of bosnian muslims and croats during the 1992-95 war , saying it was similar to the extermination campaigns of the nazis in world war ii . the bosnian government had demanded reparations while serbia insisted the top un court has no jurisdiction in the matter .
monday 's ruling is final ; no appeal is possible . unique case the case was also unique in that it covered the whole of the war in bosnia .
the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , the un 's ad hoc war-crimes court , has handed down many verdicts relating to bosnia but they were limited to certain events or the guilt of key people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic -lrb- center -rrb- in court the only trial that tackled the whole of the bosnian war and serbia 's involvement was that of former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic .
but it was never concluded since milosevic died last march before the proceedings ended . in hearings before the icj in february last year bosnia asked the court to conclude that the killings and rapes during the bosnian war were " international genocide " orchestrated by belgrade .
proving genocide requires establishing intent to destroy a group , in whole or in part , as well as demonstrating that genocidal acts took place . the trial was given evidence about events such as the massacre of muslims from the town of srebrenica near the end of the war .
after capturing the town , serb forces summarily killed some 8,000 men and boys who had try to flee .
the icty has already handed down two individual genocide convictions against serbian officers . hard to prove prior to the ruling , legal experts said that proving serbia as a state or milosevic as its president had the intent to commit genocide would be extremely difficult . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic is still on the run " even if they rule serbia was involved in the war and that acts of genocide were committed you can say that was genocide committed by -lrb- bosnian serb army commander -rrb- ratko mladic , but it will be harder to say it was committed by milosevic , " international law expert heikelina verrijn stuart told afp . " the icj can rule that there was involvement of serbia in the war , that there were incidents of genocide , like the 1995 srebrenica massacre , but that involvement of belgrade in the genocide is not proven . " no jurisdiction ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bosnian muslim man prays at the grave of his father , who was killed during the war serbia had argued that the icj has no jurisdiction in the matter because the bosnian complaint was filed against the rump federal republic of yugoslavia -lrb- fry -rrb- in 1993 - later replaced by serbia and montenegro - which only became a un member in 2000 .
the icj only has jurisdiction over un member states . serbia had also said a ruling against it would be unjust and had left a lasting black mark on the nation , which overthrew wartime leader milosevic in 2000 . dw staff / afp -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de serbia rejects un plan for kosovo serbia 's newly elected parliament has overwhelmingly voted against a un plan on the future of its breakaway province of kosovo as a violation of the country 's territorial integrity .

eu commission president jose barroso said sunday that the 27-member union had to move on taking climate control steps and position itself as the world leader in the fight against further damage to the environment . in an interview with german tabloid bild am sonntag , barroso said that the upcoming eu summit at the beginning of march would give state leaders an opportunity to take decisive steps regarding " one of the great global challenges of our time . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : barroso thinks it 's time to stop talking " we have talked for long enough - now we must act , " said barroso , who is planning on delivering a key note on climate policy in his home country portugal on monday . he called on members states to come to " clear-cut decisions about the corner stones of our future energy policy as 80 percent of all carbon gas emissions come from energy . " barroso added that the eu commission was committed to lower emissions by 30 percent by 2020 . " citizens want that these goals are really reached and we can not afford not to reach them , " he said . german calls for bulb ban bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will energy-efficient light bulbs -lrb- right -rrb- soon replace all conventional ones ?
german environment minister sigmar gabriel meanwhile came out in support of a ban against incandescent light bulbs .
the australian government announced last week that it plans to ban this type of light bulbs as a climate control measure . " europe can not really afford products that have an energy efficiency of five percent , such as incandescent light bulbs , " gabriel wrote to eu environmental commissioner stavros dimas , according to bild am sonntag . the german minister added that europe should introduce standards against energy-wasting products .
according to studies , some 25 million tons of carbon monoxide emissions could be prevented if old-fashioned light bulbs would be replaced with newer , energy-efficient models . dimas himself seems open to the idea . " we are testing whether an eu standard for environmentally-friendly light bulbs can be introduced , " dimas told german newsmagazine focus . dw staff -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de climate change : the clock is ticking the latest climate change report gives the world until 2020 to find a way of reversing global warming .

nicole renvert from berlin 's institute for international relations is the author of " changing values and interests . "
she told dw that germany and the us were drifting apart even before the rift over iraq . dw : how are germany and the us drifting apart ? nicole renvert : interests have shifted .
it 's not so much that our value systems differ , but we are pursuing other geo-political goals and we are also using different methods to reach these goals .
clearly , after the end of the cold war , the us became challenged in a different way to germany .
i think this realization came pretty late on both sides of the atlantic - that once you have changed goals and methods , you also have to change the way you interact . and why did this occur in such a small space of time ?
did sept .
11 and german reunification play a role ? i do n't think it did occur in short space of time .
i think basically the confrontation we saw in 2002 with the discussion about the intervention in iraq was just the tip of the iceberg .
i think the period after world war ii was an anomaly , when there was such a focus on western europe and particularly the relationship between germany and the us , which was seen as a model democracy .
after the end of the cold war we faced a period of normalization but then sept.11 changed many things , and one of these things was the way that germany and the us spoke to each other . to what extent is the media responsible for this ? the media has very short-lived dimensions .
sometimes it emphasizes tensions and sometimes it undermines long-standing relationships .
the relationship between germany and the us was never an easy one , and the media highlights it differently , at different times .
but now you get the impression this relationship has changed fundamentally , even though there have always been shifts and changes . how do things look now that angela merkel is chancellor and seems to be able to discuss topics with george w. bush and vladimir putin in a language they both seem to understand ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has helped thaw relations to the us i think she does a tremendous job .
i think everyone is extremely surprised and impressed by how she rose to this new role as a real leader - in a very good sense of the word - and i do think it is important to have a dialogue .
during the late 1990s we neglected the importance of dialogue at a very high political level , and i think she managed to revitalize it . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush and merkel hail new chapter in us-german relations german chancellor angela merkel emerged from talks with president george w. bush in washington friday to say that us-german relations were back on track and that they shared common ground on many issues , including iran .
-lrb- 13.01.2006 -rrb- will merkel improve us-german ties ?
dw-world readers this week commented on german chancellor angela merkel 's current visit to the united states and the chances for improved trans-atlantic ties .
they also discussed iran 's resumption of nuclear research .
-lrb- 12.01.2006 -rrb- promising washington more smiles and more help under chancellor merkel , berlin wants to strike a more upbeat tone in its relationship with washington , something analysts say that could be very beneficial to the bush administration .

those discussions are now over , and no more formal input from the member states is scheduled before a european summit in brussels on march 8-9 where the eu leaders will discuss the final text over dinner . some points already have unanimous backing .
everyone agrees that the berlin declaration should be short - two or three pages - and an easy read , unburdened by the kind of euro-babble , jargon and diplomatic subtleties that make so much of the eu 's output incomprehensible to the layperson . on top of that , the eu nations have agreed that the declaration should celebrate the peace and prosperity which the union has helped to construct since the dark days of world war ii . as ever , searching for a consensus the devil , as ever , is in the details . luxembourg prime minister jean-claude juncker stressed last week that he would like the euro currency to get a mention " as one of the great successes of european construction .

" what we want is a simple document which celebrates what has been achieved by all member states , " a downing street spokesman told afp .
" if particular member states are going to be upset about some things , it 's not very constructive ... it 's difficult to see how the euro would be relevant . " germany faces the same problem if it is thinking of mentioning the schengen visa-free travel zone within the eu , another project which london has not adopted . " if we 're speaking about the ' europe of citizens , ' what could be more concrete than the abolition of frontiers ? " asked juncker spokesman guy schueller .
is there a european social model ? the other red line is the idea of championing a ' european social model ' as prescribed by europe 's left wing , which wants to put a more human face on the bloc 's free trade and globalization tendencies .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : french and dutch voters created a quandary for backers of the constitution " the notion of a european social model appears unstoppable , " notably in a bid to rally a section of the french voters who rejected the eu 's proposed constitution at a 2005 referendum , said one european diplomat .

nicole renvert from berlin 's institute for international relations is the author of " changing values and interests . "
she told dw that germany and the us were drifting apart even before the rift over iraq . dw : how are germany and the us drifting apart ? nicole renvert : interests have shifted .
it 's not so much that our value systems differ , but we are pursuing other geo-political goals and we are also using different methods to reach these goals .
clearly , after the end of the cold war , the us became challenged in a different way to germany .
i think this realization came pretty late on both sides of the atlantic - that once you have changed goals and methods , you also have to change the way you interact . and why did this occur in such a small space of time ?
did sept .
11 and german reunification play a role ? i do n't think it did occur in short space of time .
i think basically the confrontation we saw in 2002 with the discussion about the intervention in iraq was just the tip of the iceberg .
i think the period after world war ii was an anomaly , when there was such a focus on western europe and particularly the relationship between germany and the us , which was seen as a model democracy .
after the end of the cold war we faced a period of normalization but then sept.11 changed many things , and one of these things was the way that germany and the us spoke to each other . to what extent is the media responsible for this ? the media has very short-lived dimensions .
sometimes it emphasizes tensions and sometimes it undermines long-standing relationships .
the relationship between germany and the us was never an easy one , and the media highlights it differently , at different times .
but now you get the impression this relationship has changed fundamentally , even though there have always been shifts and changes . how do things look now that angela merkel is chancellor and seems to be able to discuss topics with george w. bush and vladimir putin in a language they both seem to understand ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has helped thaw relations to the us i think she does a tremendous job .
i think everyone is extremely surprised and impressed by how she rose to this new role as a real leader - in a very good sense of the word - and i do think it is important to have a dialogue .
during the late 1990s we neglected the importance of dialogue at a very high political level , and i think she managed to revitalize it . dw staff -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bush and merkel hail new chapter in us-german relations german chancellor angela merkel emerged from talks with president george w. bush in washington friday to say that us-german relations were back on track and that they shared common ground on many issues , including iran .

the spacecraft was forced to switch from solar to battery power for even longer as it traversed a martian solar eclipse , esa said . " we lost the radio signal when rosetta moved behind mars , and it reappeared as expected 15 minutes later , " said esa spokeswoman elso montagnon . rosetta came within just 250 kilometers -lrb- 155 miles -rrb- of the red planet and used martian gravity to swing its course onward , as it pursues its looping mission around the solar system in what esa has called a game of " cosmic billiards . " the big suspense of this evening was the eclipse , " montagnon said . critical moment for a full 25 minutes mars completely shut the probe off from the light of the sun .
deprived of the energy it otherwise captures from two huge solar panels , it continued to speed along at 39,191 kilometers per hour functioning on battery power . " it was the first time since its launch that rosetta crossed an eclipse , " montagnon said .
" we could not be 100 percent sure that the batteries would be up to the job .
it was a fairly critical moment . " because the spacecraft was on the far side of mars , mission control were completely in the dark during the switchover from solar power .
the probe was not designed to run on battery power , whose primary function was to add stability after takeoff .

gmt , the agency -lrb- esa -rrb- said in a statement . " clouds are visible at the north polar cap of mars and at the morning ' limb ' -lrb- the outermost edge of a celestial body -rrb- , " esa said .
" a high altitude cloud is also visible . " passing mars , the craft " changed direction and then sped away from the red planet on a brand new path , continuing on a journey that will ultimately take it beyond jupiter 's orbit , " the agency said . more to come esa 's head of missions manfred warhaut said the fly-past of mars was the most delicate stage of the mission since its launch .
rosetta now heads for earth , where it is due to arrive in november for another dramatic fly-past .
rosetta is scheduled to hook up with comet churyumov-gerasimenko in 2014 after a voyage of 7.1 billion kilometers . " today we have reached another milestone on the way to finding an answer to questions such as whether life on earth began with the help of comets , " the agency 's director of science , david southwood , was quoted as saying in an esa statement .

not surprising , as poker is booming here .
the game has become hip and popular on tv .
but critics warn it could encourage gambling addiction . poker clubs are springing up like mushrooms across germany .
every week , poker tournaments take place in practically every urban area .
it 's a game almost everyone is familiar with , either from playing simple variants like draw poker or from any good old western . " the basics are there , so people quickly lose their inhibitions to play , " said michael körner , a poker commentator at germany 's leading sports channel dsf .
he said poker 's fascination is due to three elements of the game . " it 's about money , suspense and player types , which people can relate to , " körner said .
" you have the poker lout , the nice guy , the parvenu or the young wild one . " figures by the german poker players association show there are some 260,000 active poker players in germany - 90 percent of which are male .
sandra dellenbusch from rhinepoker in hilden said her poker school offered seminars for an average of 200 players per week . " a lot of them are young people , who are also interested in strategic computer games or chess , " dellenbusch said . televised poker is particularly appealing the worldwide poker boom began in the united states following the prestigious world series of poker in 2003 in las vegas .
chris moneymaker , an accountant from tennessee , won the first prize of $ 2.5 million after qualifying online for a spot .
the triumph sparked a wildfire of amateur players hoping for the big money . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the extreme poker tournament is held on ice fields in finland on this side of the atlantic , the european poker tour -lrb- ept -rrb- is a leading tournament .
the german open will take place at the casino hohensyburg in dortmund from march 8-11 .
it is the first ept event to be staged in germany and all ept tournaments are televised throughout europe . poker 's popularity is also due to this transformation into a spectator sport , said jo mainz , head of the poker division at casino hohensyburg . " we have really experienced a tsunami of poker here since it started showing on television , " mainz said . german comedian stefan raab is hosting five poker tournaments in his popular late night show " tv total " this year .
and dsf plans to broadcast 800 hours of poker by the end of 2008 .
it reaches an average of 200,000 viewers with each tournament . according to körner , poker on television is all the more fascinating , as cameras give viewers a head start in terms of information . " the viewer becomes omniscient and this lets him get very close to the game , " he said . " rampant gambling will lead to rampant social problems . " there is a dark side to the poker boom , though , according to the association for gambling addiction in herford . " poker is being marketed as a hip event , " said the association 's spokeswoman ilona füchtenschnieder .
in televised tournaments , dynamic young men sit at the tables .
this has freed the game from its dingy image of being played in the back rooms of grimy bars and increased enthusiasm for poker . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poker can become addictive , critics warn " but rampant gambling will lead to rampant social problems , " füchtenschnieder said .
" that 's as sure as night follows day . " poker 's popularity on television has also led to an increase in online gambling , turning people 's living rooms into gambling havens .
but in germany , gambling for money is only allowed in state-controlled casinos . " it is a legal vacuum and the government should decide whether to regulate it or not , " füchtenschnieder said . for dsf 's körner , the association 's criticism is unfounded . " poker is just like power , sex , alcohol or food , " körner said .
" too much is n't good .
no one is forcing you to bet your car . " james bond is boosting card sales bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : no one plays poker as cooly as daniel craig the poker boom in germany has already brought up one sure winner , though . eastern germany 's ass altenburger , the market leader in card manufacturing , brought out a playing card and poker set in casino quality when the latest james bond film " casino royale " hit the movie theaters last november .
bond , played by british actor daniel craig , has to defeat the bad guy this time in a high-stakes poker game . " there is no better advertising medium for playing cards at the moment than 007 , " said ass managing director peter warns . the next poker film " lucky you " with drew barrymore and robert duvall hits the theaters this summer .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 25.02.2007 eastern european countries jumping on organic wagon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic products are becoming increasingly popular in eastern europe last year , the us and the eu 's western countries accounted for 96 percent of world sales of organic products .
eastern european countries , however , are increasingly discovering the benefits of organics . the booming global organic market was worth an estimated 33 billion euros -lrb- $ 43 billion -rrb- in 2006 .
even though eastern european countries made up only a tiny portion of that market , the production of organic crops and goods in the region once known for its industrial assemblies and gray apartment blocks has been on a steady rise . thanks to increasing incomes and growing environmental awareness , domestic markets are starting to emerge in the region .
experts say that poland and the czech republic have the biggest internal markets for organic produce , followed by hungary . according to tom vaclavik , who runs a czech organic consulting company called green marketing , czech consumers bought an estimated 18 million euros worth of organic goods in 2006 .
this may be a drop in the ocean compared to germany - europe 's biggest organic market , which is worth 3.9 billion euros - but a threefold market growth could be expected within five years . " the demand is increasing incredibly , " vaclavik said .
" in the last two years , the market grew by combined 80 percent .
demand is really increasing , mainly in the large cities .
the media are also becoming more concerned about the quality of food production . " ripe for investment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand is outstripping supply as a result of the interest in organic products , domestic organic production has not been able to keep up with demand . " organic products are mainly coming from germany , the netherlands , italy , france and even the united kingdom , " vaclavik said .
" in the processed food area , i would say it could be 60 or even 70 percent that are imported . " this is a common story throughout eastern europe , where organic produce is mainly raw , such as cereals - wheat , rye and barley - as well as berries , some fruits and vegetables .
there is currently hardly any investment in the processing and manufacture of organic goods in the region . " i think the market is ripe for new investments and new products , " vaclavik said .
" the market is still in its initial phase of development , but it 's quite cheap to invest .
it will be more expensive in five years . " expansion of farmland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern european organic products may fill up the needs of western consumers as well the increasing eastern european domestic markets and the booming western european markets are also fuelling the expansion of organic farmland in eastern europe . in 2006 , the czech republic had around 280,000 hectares -lrb- 692,000 acres -rrb- under production , poland 220,000 hectares , and hungary 130,000 hectares - making these three countries the market leaders .
but there is reason to believe that organic production in other eastern european countries will pick up as well . " if you look at the western european markets , demand is outstripping supply in many areas , " vaclavik said .
" there are shortages of milk , meat and organic feed , which has to be produced somewhere .
i believe some of the new eu countries such as romania , bulgaria but also slovakia and the czech republic could produce organic products . " europe 's organic grain basket another important newcomer to the organic scene is ukraine .
with 240,000 hectares under production , it 's the second most important producer in eastern and central europe .
the vast majority of ukraine 's organic farms are large-scale - more than 3,000 hectares . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine has been exporting most of its organic grains according to eugene milovanov of the organic federation of ukraine , the production is still mainly limited to wheat for export . " ukraine is already developing as agricultural and organic agricultural country , " milovanov said .
" it was the grain basket of europe in old times , and it is now becoming the organic grain basket of europe . " " if you look closely at what is happening with demand in the netherlands , in germany and in the united kingdom - these countries have quite a big demand for grain , and a big shortage was already covered by ukrainian supplies this year . " milovanov says ukraine 's organic sector is being held back by the lack of legislation setting legal standards .
in 2004 , however , the government formed a working group to draft regulations , and it is hoped that the parliament will pass the law later this year . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german farmers ca n't keep up with organic demand as agriculture industry representatives concentrate on organic products at the annual " green week " trade fair in berlin , germany 's organic farmers are finding it impossible to keep up with growing consumer demand .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de food and drink -pipe- 25.02.2007 eastern european countries jumping on organic wagon großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : organic products are becoming increasingly popular in eastern europe last year , the us and the eu 's western countries accounted for 96 percent of world sales of organic products .
eastern european countries , however , are increasingly discovering the benefits of organics . the booming global organic market was worth an estimated 33 billion euros -lrb- $ 43 billion -rrb- in 2006 .
even though eastern european countries made up only a tiny portion of that market , the production of organic crops and goods in the region once known for its industrial assemblies and gray apartment blocks has been on a steady rise . thanks to increasing incomes and growing environmental awareness , domestic markets are starting to emerge in the region .
experts say that poland and the czech republic have the biggest internal markets for organic produce , followed by hungary . according to tom vaclavik , who runs a czech organic consulting company called green marketing , czech consumers bought an estimated 18 million euros worth of organic goods in 2006 .
this may be a drop in the ocean compared to germany - europe 's biggest organic market , which is worth 3.9 billion euros - but a threefold market growth could be expected within five years . " the demand is increasing incredibly , " vaclavik said .
" in the last two years , the market grew by combined 80 percent .
demand is really increasing , mainly in the large cities .
the media are also becoming more concerned about the quality of food production . " ripe for investment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand is outstripping supply as a result of the interest in organic products , domestic organic production has not been able to keep up with demand . " organic products are mainly coming from germany , the netherlands , italy , france and even the united kingdom , " vaclavik said .
" in the processed food area , i would say it could be 60 or even 70 percent that are imported . " this is a common story throughout eastern europe , where organic produce is mainly raw , such as cereals - wheat , rye and barley - as well as berries , some fruits and vegetables .
there is currently hardly any investment in the processing and manufacture of organic goods in the region . " i think the market is ripe for new investments and new products , " vaclavik said .
" the market is still in its initial phase of development , but it 's quite cheap to invest .
it will be more expensive in five years . " expansion of farmland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern european organic products may fill up the needs of western consumers as well the increasing eastern european domestic markets and the booming western european markets are also fuelling the expansion of organic farmland in eastern europe . in 2006 , the czech republic had around 280,000 hectares -lrb- 692,000 acres -rrb- under production , poland 220,000 hectares , and hungary 130,000 hectares - making these three countries the market leaders .
but there is reason to believe that organic production in other eastern european countries will pick up as well . " if you look at the western european markets , demand is outstripping supply in many areas , " vaclavik said .
" there are shortages of milk , meat and organic feed , which has to be produced somewhere .
i believe some of the new eu countries such as romania , bulgaria but also slovakia and the czech republic could produce organic products . " europe 's organic grain basket another important newcomer to the organic scene is ukraine .
with 240,000 hectares under production , it 's the second most important producer in eastern and central europe .
the vast majority of ukraine 's organic farms are large-scale - more than 3,000 hectares . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine has been exporting most of its organic grains according to eugene milovanov of the organic federation of ukraine , the production is still mainly limited to wheat for export . " ukraine is already developing as agricultural and organic agricultural country , " milovanov said .
" it was the grain basket of europe in old times , and it is now becoming the organic grain basket of europe . " " if you look closely at what is happening with demand in the netherlands , in germany and in the united kingdom - these countries have quite a big demand for grain , and a big shortage was already covered by ukrainian supplies this year . " milovanov says ukraine 's organic sector is being held back by the lack of legislation setting legal standards .
in 2004 , however , the government formed a working group to draft regulations , and it is hoped that the parliament will pass the law later this year . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german farmers ca n't keep up with organic demand as agriculture industry representatives concentrate on organic products at the annual " green week " trade fair in berlin , germany 's organic farmers are finding it impossible to keep up with growing consumer demand .

" the big suspense of this evening was the eclipse , " montagnon said . critical moment for a full 25 minutes mars completely shut the probe off from the light of the sun .

" the court finds that serbia has not committed genocide , " rosalyn higgins , the president of the international court of justice , said . in the same ruling , the court judged that the srebrenica massacre was an act of genocide , but one that " can not be attributable to the respondent -lrb- serbia -rrb- . "
the court ruled that other mass killings of bosnian muslims did not amount to genocide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icj judges in the hague the court added that although serbia had violated its obligations to bosnia because it did not try to prevent the massacre of 8,000 bosnian muslims , belgrade would not have to pay financial compensation . genocide was made an international crime under a 1948 treaty but no un court has ever given a ruling against an individual country .
bosnia has accused serbia of masterminding the widespread " ethnic cleansing " of bosnian muslims and croats during the 1992-95 war , saying it was similar to the extermination campaigns of the nazis in world war ii . the bosnian government had demanded reparations while serbia insisted the top un court has no jurisdiction in the matter .
monday 's ruling is final ; no appeal is possible . unique case the case was also unique in that it covered the whole of the war in bosnia .
the international criminal tribunal for the former yugoslavia -lrb- icty -rrb- , the un 's ad hoc war-crimes court , has handed down many verdicts relating to bosnia but they were limited to certain events or the guilt of key people . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : milosevic -lrb- center -rrb- in court the only trial that tackled the whole of the bosnian war and serbia 's involvement was that of former yugoslav president slobodan milosevic .
but it was never concluded since milosevic died last march before the proceedings ended . in hearings before the icj in february last year bosnia asked the court to conclude that the killings and rapes during the bosnian war were " international genocide " orchestrated by belgrade .
proving genocide requires establishing intent to destroy a group , in whole or in part , as well as demonstrating that genocidal acts took place . the trial was given evidence about events such as the massacre of muslims from the town of srebrenica near the end of the war .
after capturing the town , serb forces summarily killed some 8,000 men and boys who had try to flee .
the icty has already handed down two individual genocide convictions against serbian officers . hard to prove prior to the ruling , legal experts said that proving serbia as a state or milosevic as its president had the intent to commit genocide would be extremely difficult . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic is still on the run " even if they rule serbia was involved in the war and that acts of genocide were committed you can say that was genocide committed by -lrb- bosnian serb army commander -rrb- ratko mladic , but it will be harder to say it was committed by milosevic , " international law expert heikelina verrijn stuart told afp . " the icj can rule that there was involvement of serbia in the war , that there were incidents of genocide , like the 1995 srebrenica massacre , but that involvement of belgrade in the genocide is not proven . " no jurisdiction ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a bosnian muslim man prays at the grave of his father , who was killed during the war serbia had argued that the icj has no jurisdiction in the matter because the bosnian complaint was filed against the rump federal republic of yugoslavia -lrb- fry -rrb- in 1993 - later replaced by serbia and montenegro - which only became a un member in 2000 .

" the court finds that serbia has not committed genocide , " rosalyn higgins , the president of the international court of justice , said . in the same ruling , the court judged that the srebrenica massacre was an act of genocide , but one that " can not be attributable to the respondent -lrb- serbia -rrb- .

the court ruled that other mass killings of bosnian muslims did not amount to genocide . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : icj judges in the hague the court added that although serbia had violated its obligations to bosnia because it did not try to prevent the massacre of 8,000 bosnian muslims , belgrade would not have to pay financial compensation . genocide was made an international crime under a 1948 treaty but no un court has ever given a ruling against an individual country .
bosnia has accused serbia of masterminding the widespread " ethnic cleansing " of bosnian muslims and croats during the 1992-95 war , saying it was similar to the extermination campaigns of the nazis in world war ii . the bosnian government had demanded reparations while serbia insisted the top un court has no jurisdiction in the matter .

after capturing the town , serb forces summarily killed some 8,000 men and boys who had try to flee .
the icty has already handed down two individual genocide convictions against serbian officers . hard to prove prior to the ruling , legal experts said that proving serbia as a state or milosevic as its president had the intent to commit genocide would be extremely difficult . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mladic is still on the run " even if they rule serbia was involved in the war and that acts of genocide were committed you can say that was genocide committed by -lrb- bosnian serb army commander -rrb- ratko mladic , but it will be harder to say it was committed by milosevic , " international law expert heikelina verrijn stuart told afp .

eastern european countries , however , are increasingly discovering the benefits of organics . the booming global organic market was worth an estimated 33 billion euros -lrb- $ 43 billion -rrb- in 2006 .
even though eastern european countries made up only a tiny portion of that market , the production of organic crops and goods in the region once known for its industrial assemblies and gray apartment blocks has been on a steady rise . thanks to increasing incomes and growing environmental awareness , domestic markets are starting to emerge in the region .
experts say that poland and the czech republic have the biggest internal markets for organic produce , followed by hungary . according to tom vaclavik , who runs a czech organic consulting company called green marketing , czech consumers bought an estimated 18 million euros worth of organic goods in 2006 .
this may be a drop in the ocean compared to germany - europe 's biggest organic market , which is worth 3.9 billion euros - but a threefold market growth could be expected within five years . " the demand is increasing incredibly , " vaclavik said .
" in the last two years , the market grew by combined 80 percent .
demand is really increasing , mainly in the large cities .
the media are also becoming more concerned about the quality of food production . " ripe for investment bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demand is outstripping supply as a result of the interest in organic products , domestic organic production has not been able to keep up with demand . " organic products are mainly coming from germany , the netherlands , italy , france and even the united kingdom , " vaclavik said .
" in the processed food area , i would say it could be 60 or even 70 percent that are imported . " this is a common story throughout eastern europe , where organic produce is mainly raw , such as cereals - wheat , rye and barley - as well as berries , some fruits and vegetables .
there is currently hardly any investment in the processing and manufacture of organic goods in the region . " i think the market is ripe for new investments and new products , " vaclavik said .
" the market is still in its initial phase of development , but it 's quite cheap to invest .
it will be more expensive in five years . " expansion of farmland bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eastern european organic products may fill up the needs of western consumers as well the increasing eastern european domestic markets and the booming western european markets are also fuelling the expansion of organic farmland in eastern europe . in 2006 , the czech republic had around 280,000 hectares -lrb- 692,000 acres -rrb- under production , poland 220,000 hectares , and hungary 130,000 hectares - making these three countries the market leaders .
but there is reason to believe that organic production in other eastern european countries will pick up as well . " if you look at the western european markets , demand is outstripping supply in many areas , " vaclavik said .
" there are shortages of milk , meat and organic feed , which has to be produced somewhere .
i believe some of the new eu countries such as romania , bulgaria but also slovakia and the czech republic could produce organic products . " europe 's organic grain basket another important newcomer to the organic scene is ukraine .
with 240,000 hectares under production , it 's the second most important producer in eastern and central europe .
the vast majority of ukraine 's organic farms are large-scale - more than 3,000 hectares . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ukraine has been exporting most of its organic grains according to eugene milovanov of the organic federation of ukraine , the production is still mainly limited to wheat for export . " ukraine is already developing as agricultural and organic agricultural country , " milovanov said .
" it was the grain basket of europe in old times , and it is now becoming the organic grain basket of europe . " " if you look closely at what is happening with demand in the netherlands , in germany and in the united kingdom - these countries have quite a big demand for grain , and a big shortage was already covered by ukrainian supplies this year . " milovanov says ukraine 's organic sector is being held back by the lack of legislation setting legal standards .
in 2004 , however , the government formed a working group to draft regulations , and it is hoped that the parliament will pass the law later this year . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de dw-world : german farmers ca n't keep up with organic demand as agriculture industry representatives concentrate on organic products at the annual " green week " trade fair in berlin , germany 's organic farmers are finding it impossible to keep up with growing consumer demand .

the spacecraft was forced to switch from solar to battery power for even longer as it traversed a martian solar eclipse , esa said . " we lost the radio signal when rosetta moved behind mars , and it reappeared as expected 15 minutes later , " said esa spokeswoman elso montagnon . rosetta came within just 250 kilometers -lrb- 155 miles -rrb- of the red planet and used martian gravity to swing its course onward , as it pursues its looping mission around the solar system in what esa has called a game of " cosmic billiards . " the big suspense of this evening was the eclipse , " montagnon said . critical moment for a full 25 minutes mars completely shut the probe off from the light of the sun .
deprived of the energy it otherwise captures from two huge solar panels , it continued to speed along at 39,191 kilometers per hour functioning on battery power . " it was the first time since its launch that rosetta crossed an eclipse , " montagnon said .
" we could not be 100 percent sure that the batteries would be up to the job .
it was a fairly critical moment . " because the spacecraft was on the far side of mars , mission control were completely in the dark during the switchover from solar power .
the probe was not designed to run on battery power , whose primary function was to add stability after takeoff .

gmt , the agency -lrb- esa -rrb- said in a statement . " clouds are visible at the north polar cap of mars and at the morning ' limb ' -lrb- the outermost edge of a celestial body -rrb- , " esa said .
" a high altitude cloud is also visible . " passing mars , the craft " changed direction and then sped away from the red planet on a brand new path , continuing on a journey that will ultimately take it beyond jupiter 's orbit , " the agency said . more to come esa 's head of missions manfred warhaut said the fly-past of mars was the most delicate stage of the mission since its launch .
rosetta now heads for earth , where it is due to arrive in november for another dramatic fly-past .
rosetta is scheduled to hook up with comet churyumov-gerasimenko in 2014 after a voyage of 7.1 billion kilometers . " today we have reached another milestone on the way to finding an answer to questions such as whether life on earth began with the help of comets , " the agency 's director of science , david southwood , was quoted as saying in an esa statement .

one woman died in the crash near kendal on friday evening .
eight people were seriously hurt and remain in hospital .
the investigation is focusing on a set of points which the virgin trains pendolino ran across before derailing .
one rail expert said he had been told the points could have had loose bolts , and drew comparisons with the 2002 potters bar crash , which killed seven .
network rail , which is responsible for maintaining track , said engineers hoped to complete checks of between 600 and 700 sets of points by the end of the day .
how crash unfolded the checks are being made on sections of older tracks on which trains travel above 85mph .
points are where the line divides and the train is sent either to the left or to the right onto a different track .
rail expert christian wolmar told bbc news 24 he understood the circumstances of the crash were similar to those in the potters bar crash .
in that crash , in may 2002 , seven people died and 76 were injured when poorly maintained points derailed a train .
" from what i understand , they have found these points in a similar condition to those at potters bar , with some missing nuts and the stretcher bar , which keeps the rails properly apart , apparently loosened , " he said .
we are devastated by the death of our nan margaret jones , granddaughter of margaret masson who died family ' distraught ' mr wolmar said it was up to network rail to ensure that the points were properly maintained and that " things like loose bolts and nuts were tightened up regularly " .
he added : " but there is also the possibility that these nuts and bolts were maintained in the wrong way , or not sufficiently maintained , and that 's why they were in that condition . "
the chief executive of network rail , john armitt , acknowledged that there might have been a points failure .
he said the points were last serviced earlier this month .
contact numbers cumbria police helpline : 0800 056 0146 police family liaison centre : 0800 40 50 40 national rail enquiries : 08457 48 49 50 police said it was " little short of a miracle " that more people did not die in the accident .
jonathan duckworth , chairman of the paddington survivors group , told bbc radio five live he was also surprised so few people were seriously hurt .
" i think that 's a testimony really to the rolling stock and how design changes have made the rolling stock very much safer than it was say 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 years ago , " he said .
relatives of the woman who died - 84-year-old margaret masson , of glasgow - have spoken of their loss .
mrs masson 's daughter and son-in-law , margaret and richard langley , were hurt in the crash and are still in hospital .
her granddaughter margaret jones , 41 , said the family was " distraught " by events .
" we are devastated by the death of our nan and about mum and dad being so very poorly , " she said .
a total of 22 people were taken to three different hospitals after the accident .
dozens more people received minor injuries .
the power car is facing back down the track of the eight patients who were seriously injured , five are improving while three remain in a serious condition .
the driver of the train , iain black , suffered a broken collar bone and a broken bone in his neck , his union aslef has said .
he is expected to remain in hospital for about a month .
both the union and virgin boss sir richard branson said the former police officer , 46 , was " a hero " .
mr black had come around a corner , sir richard said , to find the line defective before the train started to leave the tracks .
" he 's carried on sitting in his carriage for nearly half a mile , running the train on the stone - he could have tried to get back and protect himself but he did n't , and he 's ended up quite badly injured . "
virgin trains said the line may not reopen to passengers services until during the week beginning 5 march .
in the meantime , train services from the south are terminating at lancaster and preston , while train services from the north are terminating at carlisle , and there is a replacement bus service between the two .
passengers who intend to travel on the west coast main line can check the latest information with national rail enquiries .

one woman died in the crash near kendal on friday evening .
eight people were seriously hurt and remain in hospital .
the investigation is focusing on a set of points which the virgin trains pendolino ran across before derailing .
one rail expert said he had been told the points could have had loose bolts , and drew comparisons with the 2002 potters bar crash , which killed seven .
network rail , which is responsible for maintaining track , said engineers hoped to complete checks of between 600 and 700 sets of points by the end of the day .
how crash unfolded the checks are being made on sections of older tracks on which trains travel above 85mph .
points are where the line divides and the train is sent either to the left or to the right onto a different track .
rail expert christian wolmar told bbc news 24 he understood the circumstances of the crash were similar to those in the potters bar crash .
in that crash , in may 2002 , seven people died and 76 were injured when poorly maintained points derailed a train .
" from what i understand , they have found these points in a similar condition to those at potters bar , with some missing nuts and the stretcher bar , which keeps the rails properly apart , apparently loosened , " he said .
we are devastated by the death of our nan margaret jones , granddaughter of margaret masson who died family ' distraught ' mr wolmar said it was up to network rail to ensure that the points were properly maintained and that " things like loose bolts and nuts were tightened up regularly " .
he added : " but there is also the possibility that these nuts and bolts were maintained in the wrong way , or not sufficiently maintained , and that 's why they were in that condition . "
the chief executive of network rail , john armitt , acknowledged that there might have been a points failure .
he said the points were last serviced earlier this month .

jonathan duckworth , chairman of the paddington survivors group , told bbc radio five live he was also surprised so few people were seriously hurt .
" i think that 's a testimony really to the rolling stock and how design changes have made the rolling stock very much safer than it was say 20 , 30 , 40 , 50 years ago , " he said .
relatives of the woman who died - 84-year-old margaret masson , of glasgow - have spoken of their loss .
mrs masson 's daughter and son-in-law , margaret and richard langley , were hurt in the crash and are still in hospital .
her granddaughter margaret jones , 41 , said the family was " distraught " by events .
" we are devastated by the death of our nan and about mum and dad being so very poorly , " she said .
a total of 22 people were taken to three different hospitals after the accident .
dozens more people received minor injuries .
the power car is facing back down the track of the eight patients who were seriously injured , five are improving while three remain in a serious condition .
the driver of the train , iain black , suffered a broken collar bone and a broken bone in his neck , his union aslef has said .
he is expected to remain in hospital for about a month .
both the union and virgin boss sir richard branson said the former police officer , 46 , was " a hero " .
mr black had come around a corner , sir richard said , to find the line defective before the train started to leave the tracks .
" he 's carried on sitting in his carriage for nearly half a mile , running the train on the stone - he could have tried to get back and protect himself but he did n't , and he 's ended up quite badly injured . "

one woman died in the crash near kendal on friday evening .
eight people were seriously hurt and remain in hospital .
the investigation is focusing on a set of points which the virgin trains pendolino ran across before derailing .
one rail expert said he had been told the points could have had loose bolts , and drew comparisons with the 2002 potters bar crash , which killed seven .
network rail , which is responsible for maintaining track , said engineers hoped to complete checks of between 600 and 700 sets of points by the end of the day .
how crash unfolded the checks are being made on sections of older tracks on which trains travel above 85mph .
points are where the line divides and the train is sent either to the left or to the right onto a different track .
rail expert christian wolmar told bbc news 24 he understood the circumstances of the crash were similar to those in the potters bar crash .
in that crash , in may 2002 , seven people died and 76 were injured when poorly maintained points derailed a train .

he added : " but there is also the possibility that these nuts and bolts were maintained in the wrong way , or not sufficiently maintained , and that 's why they were in that condition . "
the chief executive of network rail , john armitt , acknowledged that there might have been a points failure .
he said the points were last serviced earlier this month .

mrs masson 's daughter and son-in-law , margaret and richard langley , were hurt in the crash and are still in hospital .
her granddaughter margaret jones , 41 , said the family was " distraught " by events .

they have written to sports minister alun pugh urging funding .
in december mr pugh said he shared the vision put forward by the club and wrexham council to make the ground a " flagship facility " .
the welsh assembly government said no public investment in the project could be made without a business case .
the five ams - plaid cymru 's janet ryder , conservatives mark isherwood and brynle williams , liberal democrat eleanor burnham and forward wales ' john marek - want an urgent meeting with mr pugh and the racecourse 's owners as well as wrexham council .
the club and wrexham council asked for assembly government funding when they submitted plans for developing the racecourse into an international venue for sporting events , concerts and conferences last december .
detailed plan wrexham council has already granted outline planning permission for a multimillion-pound redevelopment scheme at the racecourse .
they said if the bid succeeded , the council believed the ground could be offered as a training facility for football teams in the 2012 olympics .
at the time mr pugh said he hoped a decision could be made in the new year , subject to a detailed business plan being put forward .
now the ams have expressed concern that after the initial public support , the plan appears to have stalled , and they are urging further public investment in the ground .
the politicians write : " the issue for us is simply that north wales must have an all-seater international stadium capable of hosting major sporting and cultural events .
" it is accepted that many events will go to the millennium stadium in cardiff , however , a ground of the size of wrexham -lrb- ie approx .
15,000 seats -rrb- must be completed to allow equity of access for such events for all of wales .
" it is not acceptable that the residents of north wales have to always travel to south wales nor is it acceptable that the north should have to ' make do with a stadium which still has a standing area , " the letter adds .
business case wrexham fc was bought by a consortium led by local businessman neville dickens last august at the end of a difficult period for the club .
the club went into administration in 2004 with debts of more than £ 4m , and was docked 10 points by the football league .
mr dickens has promised to plough any profits back into the club , and it is thought the stadium 's redevelopment is crucial to wrexham fc 's financial future .
a spokesperson for the assembly government said it was very supportive of the racecourse , " but we can not commitment on funding unless we receive a business case " .
" any request for public support which is made to the assembly has to be supported by a business case . "

they have written to sports minister alun pugh urging funding .
in december mr pugh said he shared the vision put forward by the club and wrexham council to make the ground a " flagship facility " .
the welsh assembly government said no public investment in the project could be made without a business case .
the five ams - plaid cymru 's janet ryder , conservatives mark isherwood and brynle williams , liberal democrat eleanor burnham and forward wales ' john marek - want an urgent meeting with mr pugh and the racecourse 's owners as well as wrexham council .
the club and wrexham council asked for assembly government funding when they submitted plans for developing the racecourse into an international venue for sporting events , concerts and conferences last december .
detailed plan wrexham council has already granted outline planning permission for a multimillion-pound redevelopment scheme at the racecourse .
they said if the bid succeeded , the council believed the ground could be offered as a training facility for football teams in the 2012 olympics .
at the time mr pugh said he hoped a decision could be made in the new year , subject to a detailed business plan being put forward .
now the ams have expressed concern that after the initial public support , the plan appears to have stalled , and they are urging further public investment in the ground .
the politicians write : " the issue for us is simply that north wales must have an all-seater international stadium capable of hosting major sporting and cultural events .
new owners took over the racecourse last summer " it is accepted that many events will go to the millennium stadium in cardiff , however , a ground of the size of wrexham -lrb- ie approx .
15,000 seats -rrb- must be completed to allow equity of access for such events for all of wales .
" it is not acceptable that the residents of north wales have to always travel to south wales nor is it acceptable that the north should have to ' make do with a stadium which still has a standing area , " the letter adds .
business case wrexham fc was bought by a consortium led by local businessman neville dickens last august at the end of a difficult period for the club .
the club went into administration in 2004 with debts of more than £ 4m , and was docked 10 points by the football league .
mr dickens has promised to plough any profits back into the club , and it is thought the stadium 's redevelopment is crucial to wrexham fc 's financial future .
a spokesperson for the assembly government said it was very supportive of the racecourse , " but we can not commitment on funding unless we receive a business case " .
" any request for public support which is made to the assembly has to be supported by a business case . "

the film picked up four awards - or razzies - for worst movie , worst actress for sharon stone , worst screenplay and also worst sequel .
little man , a comedy by the wayans brothers , collected three razzies , including the worst remake or rip-off .
m. night shyamalan was named worst director and worst supporting actor .
' no reason to exist ' basic instinct 2 is the sequel to the sex-thriller that made sharon stone a star in 1992 .
razzies founder john wilson said that although the actress still looked good in her late 40s , the film " had no reason to exist " .
" i mean , 14 years later - you have n't got michael douglas - why are you making this ? "

the aircraft spent three hours at london ashford airport -lrb- laa -rrb- in lydd on saturday flying circuits of the area to try to dispel objectors ' fears .
the jet is the type that will be used if the airport is granted planning permission for the expansion .
lydd airport action group is calling for a public inquiry into the plans .
airport managers said they had paid a five-figure sum to hire the boeing 737-300 series but it would be money well spent if it helped to demonstrate how well the airport can cope with modern passenger jets .
' wild claims ' they were fulfilling a pledge made last year at meetings with residents and folkestone and hythe mp michael howard .
laa spokesman robin gordon said the 737-300 was the noisiest of its marque .
" we have deliberately chosen the 737 with the noisiest engines so that people really understand this is the worst possible case for lydd , " he said .
protesters said watching the landing was " like waiting for a bomb to come and land on your property " .
" it is the industrialisation of romney marsh and that is why local people are so passionately opposed to this , " said peter carroll of keep the marsh alliance .
but supporters of the airport expansion say it would bring welcome jobs and an economic boost to the area .
protesters gathered to watch the plane fly over the marsh " i would be quite happy to see 30 flights a day it this is the level of the noise , " said tim compton of friends of lydd airport .
" it 's not too bad - i can live with that very easily . "
laa has submitted two planning applications to shepway district council .
one is for a new terminal building to handle up to 500,000 passengers a year - the equivalent of 10 flights a day - the other is for two runway extensions , together 444m -lrb- 1,456ft -rrb- in length .
a public consultation on the plans runs until 5 march .
lydd airport action group , which opposes the applications , has hired outside consultants to help prepare its response .
it claims the runway extension would allow the airport to increase passenger numbers to two million a year by 2015 .
residents are being urged to write to shepway council and the government office for the south east objecting to the planning applications and calling for a public inquiry .

lydd airport action group is calling for a public inquiry into the plans .
airport managers said they had paid a five-figure sum to hire the boeing 737-300 series but it would be money well spent if it helped to demonstrate how well the airport can cope with modern passenger jets .
' wild claims ' they were fulfilling a pledge made last year at meetings with residents and folkestone and hythe mp michael howard .
laa spokesman robin gordon said the 737-300 was the noisiest of its marque .
" we have deliberately chosen the 737 with the noisiest engines so that people really understand this is the worst possible case for lydd , " he said .
protesters said watching the landing was " like waiting for a bomb to come and land on your property " .
" it is the industrialisation of romney marsh and that is why local people are so passionately opposed to this , " said peter carroll of keep the marsh alliance .
but supporters of the airport expansion say it would bring welcome jobs and an economic boost to the area .
protesters gathered to watch the plane fly over the marsh " i would be quite happy to see 30 flights a day it this is the level of the noise , " said tim compton of friends of lydd airport .
" it 's not too bad - i can live with that very easily . "
laa has submitted two planning applications to shepway district council .
one is for a new terminal building to handle up to 500,000 passengers a year - the equivalent of 10 flights a day - the other is for two runway extensions , together 444m -lrb- 1,456ft -rrb- in length .
a public consultation on the plans runs until 5 march .
lydd airport action group , which opposes the applications , has hired outside consultants to help prepare its response .
it claims the runway extension would allow the airport to increase passenger numbers to two million a year by 2015 .
residents are being urged to write to shepway council and the government office for the south east objecting to the planning applications and calling for a public inquiry .
