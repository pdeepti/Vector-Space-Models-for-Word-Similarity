his talks with us president bush could alter the current state of trans-atlantic relations . while both french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel are traveling to washington this week with important business to discuss , it is sarkozy 's visit on tuesday , nov .
6 , with us president george w. bush that is generating the most interest on both sides of the atlantic . french-us relations , which for decades could be described as cordial at best , took a damaging turn in 2003 when sarkozy 's predecessor , jacques chirac , determinedly opposed the us-led invasion of iraq .
after chirac stepped down as president earlier this year , the temperature between the two nations - which had barely made it above tepid - began rising . us ties vital to france 's eu role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has made no secret of his admiration for the us " sarkozy has decided that french interests are best served by a closer alliance with washington , " said reginald dale , a trans-atlantic relations expert at the center for strategic and international studies in washington .
" sarkozy sees that france can not hope to regain its leadership of europe , which is his aim , if paris is always tagged as anti-american . " sarkozy is the most pro-american french leader in years and arrives in washington this week committed to showing the us that france has moved on from the bitterness caused by the divisions over iraq and that he is a committed european partner . sarkozy determined to be friend of us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and chirac 's falling-out still resonates in washington the french president has already laid the groundwork for a visit which is sure to be full of mutual praise , pledges of support , pumping handshakes and smiles . " the trial has started , i will be a friend of the americans , " the french president said two weeks ago .
" do we agree about everything ?
no , because in a family you can have disagreements .
but we are in the same family .
that is the truth of it . " however , the breakdown in relations under chirac is still fresh in american minds and it will take more than a few warm words to convince the white house of a significant shift in french policy . " washington is not yet sure that it completely trusts sarkozy and is worried by his frenetic hyperactivity , which sometimes makes him look almost unbalanced , " dale said .
" historically , the default mode in us-french relations has been one of abrasiveness and mutual suspicion , and it will take substantial , concrete results to dispel that suspicion . " shared iran stance overshadows differences while there is still tension between the two nations - sarkozy has criticized us environmental policies and the war in iraq - france and the us have found common ground on a number of pressing international issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's iran could face tougher sanctions iran is one subject is likely to top a number of bush 's meetings this week .
washington has leaned toward imposing stricter sanctions against tehran , and bush may find a strong supporter in france as sarkozy has been more willing to pressure iran on the nuclear issue than chirac was . that support could even lead to a shift in future discussions over the iranian nuclear program . sarkozy setting the agenda for europe " the fact that sarkozy arrives -lsb- before merkel on friday -rsb- could influence how subsequent talks on iran progress , " said sandra herbinger of the international transatlantic relations council .
" what he and bush discuss on iran will put huge pressure on those who follow , particularly merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel may have to follow sarkozy 's lead on iran " with france leading on this , germany will have to accept that it is not the only key partner for the united states in europe and that sarkozy 's is the lead europe will be encouraged to follow , " she added . analysts said that since gordon brown replaced tony blair as british prime minister , sarkozy has become a central player for washington , something the french president 's opponents have also noted . before moving into the elysee palace , sarkozy was accused by the socialist party as being " bush 's poodle " - a term often used by opposition politicians in the uk to describe blair .
since being elected , sarkozy has continued to face suspicion for his apparent desire to side with a deeply unpopular us president . " sarkozy can certainly strengthen french bonds with washington , though he will take care not to look subservient , but he can not hope to replace the ' special relationship ' between the us and britain , " dale said .
" and almost certainly does n't want to try . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a new european dawn is in the making in serbia . " " i have decided to initial the stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with serbia tomorrow here in brussels , " rehn told reporters on tuesday , upon the issuing of the bloc 's annual enlargement report . however , serbia must turn in alleged war criminals ratko mladic and radovan karadzic before the final signing could occur , rehn added .
prosecution of war crimes from the 1990s balkan conflict has remained a tenuous issue in eu dealings with several of the balkan states . the saa , which has been under negotiation since 2005 , provides a framework of mutual commitments on a wide range of political , trade and economic issues and is intended to culminate in eu membership negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian-serb general ratko mladic is wanted for war crimes committed in the 1990s serbia will be the third of the former yugoslav republics to enter into a stabilization and association agreement with the european union , following macedonia in 2004 and croatia in 2005 . in addition to serbia , albania , bosnia , and montenegro hope to be declared formal eu accession candidates in the coming years . the eu 's report , however , pointed out that has been " steady , though uneven progress in the western balkans -lrb- toward membership -rrb- and the region continues to face major challenges . "
the implementation of judicial reforms and the fight against corruption and organized crime are key areas that continue to need addressing , according to the report . croatia is likely to be next eu member the european commission also said in its annual report that croatia 's bid for eu membership is on track , but that more progress is needed . " the commission expects substantial progress ... in the course of the year ahead , provided that the country maintains the necessary reform momentum and meets the conditions , " the report said . improvement is particularly needed in the judicial and administrative reform , minority rights , refugee return and the restructuring of the steel and shipbuilding industries , according to the report .
the prosecution of war criminals was also emphasized . " many crimes remain unprosecuted , often due to a combination of a lack of evidence , unwillingness of witnesses to come forward and less than proactive approach of police and prosecutors , " the eu report said . croatia started accession talks with the bloc in 2005 , along with turkey , and , according to eu diplomats , is the only country likely to join in the next five years . eu slams rights situation in turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu particularly criticized turkey 's treatment of its kurdish minority turkey is progressing too slowly , said rehn on tuesday . " it 's simply not acceptable that writers , journalists and other citizens are persecuted in a european democracy for critically and non-violently expressing their opinions , " he said of the situation in turkey . the eu 's report did not go into detail on the current political and military tension between turkey and kurdish militants in iraq . after two years of accession talks , the country still has to improve minority rights , amend a law restricting the freedom of speech and press , normalize relations with cyprus and move ahead with other reforms before it can join the eu , according to the enlargement report . ankara on tuesday pledged to step up the pace of its reforms . " our commitment to completing our shortcomings and efficiently implementing the reforms on the ground is not decreasing - on the contrary it is increasing , " a foreign ministry statement said .
" we are determined to pursue reform until our country catches up with the highest levels of democracy and human rights . " turkey also said its accession process should not be " shaped in line with the preferences of the political leaders of some member states . " politicians in a number of european capitals , including paris and berlin , have come out against full membership for turkey in the 27-member bloc . while officially sticking to the european line of potential accession for turkey , german chancellor angela merkel has long said she is in favor of offering the country a " privileged partnership .

6 , eu justice commissioner franco frattini said europe " can not be complacent " against the threat of new attacks on the continent .

germany 's bad service in shops and administrative offices may be the bane of consumers , but it was a boon for crime prevention in one case .

the woman , surely drawing on what she knew best , even in a time of crisis , simply ignored the gun , the note and the man - completely . although he stood there for a while , her icy disregard soon disarmed him mentally .
he lost his nerve and fled , realizing that even with a gun , he had no chance against the teller 's steely attitude . police are still searching for the man , thought to be between 20 and 25 years of age .

the personnel behind the counter or desk generally seem to have trained in the fine art of negativity and , while often less than competent in their jobs , are world-class when it comes to avoiding eye contact , heaving big sighs when asked anything or becoming petulant when the customer does not have exact change . if customers have not erected psychological steel walls around themselves before encountering this wide-spread attitude , leaving a place of business can often be accompanied by tears or seething anger . one would-be bank robber , who it is assumed is familiar with germany 's service culture , thought the gun might be more powerful against the disposition , but he was oh-so-wrong . according to police , a young man entered a bank in the town of arnstadt , pistol in hand , and put a note in front of a teller that demanded cash .
the woman , surely drawing on what she knew best , even in a time of crisis , simply ignored the gun , the note and the man - completely . although he stood there for a while , her icy disregard soon disarmed him mentally .
he lost his nerve and fled , realizing that even with a gun , he had no chance against the teller 's steely attitude . police are still searching for the man , thought to be between 20 and 25 years of age .

earlier this week , eu anti-terror experts warned that more attacks by islamic extremists were likely .

he would like to see them implemented by the end of next year . storing of passenger data bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini wants to raise the standard of the eu 's anti-terror measures the most contentious of frattini 's plans is for eu countries to adopt airline security measures like those in the united states , which would include saving passenger data for up to 13 years and making the data available to law enforcement agents like police and customs officers , who may part of anti-terror activities or investigations . the data collected on passengers flying to or from non-eu member states would include the e-mail address and phone number of the passenger , ticket and travel agent information , and payment details , and would be provided 24 hours before departure . the scheme resembles a system put in place in the united states after the sept .

privacy advocates have heaped criticism on both the us system and the frattini 's plan . separate security proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu already hands over data on passengers flying to the us another of frattini 's security proposals includes eu governments treating as criminal offenses all public incitement to terrorism , as well as terrorist recruitment .
under the proposal , it would also be illegal to provide terrorist training information , particularly on the internet . " the internet serves ... as one of the principal boosters of the processes of radicalization and recruitment and also serves as a source of information on terrorist means and methods , thus functioning as a virtual training camp , " the proposal said . however , in an attempt to tone down criticism from civil liberties campaigners , frattini 's plan specifies that this new measure may not be used to restrict the dissemination of information for scientific , academic or reporting purposes . the civil liberties monitoring organization statewatch said the plans could potentially target simply for expressing a political opinion . " the wording of this definition is clearly likely to result in the criminalization of the expression of political views ... even if that expression does not in any way include the advocacy of terrorism to support those opinions , " it said in a statement .

that leaves an ever smaller fleet to fly soldiers to and from afghanistan . the handelsblatt quoted aviation industry sources as saying that corrosion and wear and tear have turned over half of germany 's transall planes into decrepit machinery .
the sources apparently said that it was becoming more difficult to locate spare parts for the planes , some of which are more than 40 years old . the paper also reported that a number of planes have been grounded due to rust problems and some are beyond repair . the german defense ministy has partially denied the report , the handelsblatt wrote . " unknown number " in repair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a transall at ramstein base in germany germany currently has 83 transall planes in deployment .
the defense ministry said that 70 percent of the planes are always ready for action , as nato dictates .
the ministry said that an " unknown number " of planes were currently undergoing repairs . germany had originally planned to replace the remaining transall planes with airbus ' new a400m model by 2014 , but that schedule may have to be revised due to recently announced delays in delivery . the german government has ordered 60 of the airbus models at a cost of 8.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.4 billion -rrb- . until they are delivered , the transalls remain the sole military transporters , and must run flights to the balkans and afghanistan .

his talks with us president bush could alter the current state of trans-atlantic relations . while both french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel are traveling to washington this week with important business to discuss , it is sarkozy 's visit on tuesday , nov .
6 , with us president george w. bush that is generating the most interest on both sides of the atlantic . french-us relations , which for decades could be described as cordial at best , took a damaging turn in 2003 when sarkozy 's predecessor , jacques chirac , determinedly opposed the us-led invasion of iraq .
after chirac stepped down as president earlier this year , the temperature between the two nations - which had barely made it above tepid - began rising . us ties vital to france 's eu role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has made no secret of his admiration for the us " sarkozy has decided that french interests are best served by a closer alliance with washington , " said reginald dale , a trans-atlantic relations expert at the center for strategic and international studies in washington .
" sarkozy sees that france can not hope to regain its leadership of europe , which is his aim , if paris is always tagged as anti-american . " sarkozy is the most pro-american french leader in years and arrives in washington this week committed to showing the us that france has moved on from the bitterness caused by the divisions over iraq and that he is a committed european partner . sarkozy determined to be friend of us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and chirac 's falling-out still resonates in washington the french president has already laid the groundwork for a visit which is sure to be full of mutual praise , pledges of support , pumping handshakes and smiles . " the trial has started , i will be a friend of the americans , " the french president said two weeks ago .
" do we agree about everything ?
no , because in a family you can have disagreements .
but we are in the same family .
that is the truth of it . " however , the breakdown in relations under chirac is still fresh in american minds and it will take more than a few warm words to convince the white house of a significant shift in french policy . " washington is not yet sure that it completely trusts sarkozy and is worried by his frenetic hyperactivity , which sometimes makes him look almost unbalanced , " dale said .
" historically , the default mode in us-french relations has been one of abrasiveness and mutual suspicion , and it will take substantial , concrete results to dispel that suspicion . " shared iran stance overshadows differences while there is still tension between the two nations - sarkozy has criticized us environmental policies and the war in iraq - france and the us have found common ground on a number of pressing international issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's iran could face tougher sanctions iran is one subject is likely to top a number of bush 's meetings this week .
washington has leaned toward imposing stricter sanctions against tehran , and bush may find a strong supporter in france as sarkozy has been more willing to pressure iran on the nuclear issue than chirac was . that support could even lead to a shift in future discussions over the iranian nuclear program . sarkozy setting the agenda for europe " the fact that sarkozy arrives -lsb- before merkel on friday -rsb- could influence how subsequent talks on iran progress , " said sandra herbinger of the international transatlantic relations council .
" what he and bush discuss on iran will put huge pressure on those who follow , particularly merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel may have to follow sarkozy 's lead on iran " with france leading on this , germany will have to accept that it is not the only key partner for the united states in europe and that sarkozy 's is the lead europe will be encouraged to follow , " she added . analysts said that since gordon brown replaced tony blair as british prime minister , sarkozy has become a central player for washington , something the french president 's opponents have also noted . before moving into the elysee palace , sarkozy was accused by the socialist party as being " bush 's poodle " - a term often used by opposition politicians in the uk to describe blair .
since being elected , sarkozy has continued to face suspicion for his apparent desire to side with a deeply unpopular us president . " sarkozy can certainly strengthen french bonds with washington , though he will take care not to look subservient , but he can not hope to replace the ' special relationship ' between the us and britain , " dale said .

the accusations have outraged the tennis world . the anonymous insider , speaking to german public broadcaster wdr , said that some professional tennis players had raked in more cash by engaging in game-rigging than they would have by winning the tournaments . he also claimed to have been offered a five-figure sum to act as a middleman in a betting affair . the association of tennis professionals -lrb- atp -rrb- is currently investigating a list of 140 allegedly fixed matches .
names of seven german tennis players were on the list , including two who intentionally lost matches , according to the anonymous informant . haas appeals to anonymous player bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tommy haas " it 's time people started naming names , " said successful german tennis pro tommy haas in response to the allegations , which he said may very well be true . " no one has ever approached me -lsb- about fixing a match -rsb- , " added haas , who 's played professionally for 11 years .
" i would have blown their cover .
only relentless openness can shed light on this mess . " he admitted , however , that it 's difficult to prove whether a player has intentionally lost a match or not . tennis scene responds to allegations anger , helplessness and disbelief have resonated from other corners of the professional tennis world as well . " i ca n't imagine that it 's true and that german players are really involved in illegal betting at tennis tournaments , " davis cup team leader patrik kühn told german news agency dpa on monday , nov .
5 . " criminal energy is everywhere , " commented george von waldenfels , head of the german tennis association -lrb- dtb -rrb- .
" but we as the dtb are n't necessarily capable of acting . " " we 're urgently waiting on sanctions from the apt , " added waldenfels . in light of the allegations , the apt warned on monday that players involved in fixing matches could face a life-long play ban if they do n't confess within two days . the current tennis scandal is n't the first time illegal betting accusations have been made in german professional sports .
soccer referee robert hoyzer was sentenced in december 2006 to nearly two and a half years in prison for fixing games for money . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a press release published on tuesday , nov .
6 on vattenfall 's web site , the scientists said that organizational and technical conditions at the two plants are such that safe running of the plants could resume . however , the panel also recommended a series of improved safety measures . vattenfall europe , one of the four big power generation companies operating in germany , said it would apply recommendations from the scientists to improve internal and public communications about safety . no apparent release of radiation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhardt hassa of vattenfall germany the panel of five scientists said no radiation had been released and that safety mechanisms were functioning correctly when a short-circuit hit brunsbüttel and the transformer at krümmel caught fire , according to dpa news agency . however , the panel also said that there were technical and communication problems among staff involving the emergency shutdown of the krümmel station .
the scientists recommended that staff be better trained . the power transformer destroyed in the fire at the krümmel station has meanwhile been replaced as well as faulty fastenings and cracked taps in the part of the station gutted by the fire . neither the krümmel reactor during the fire , nor the brunsbüttel reactor were damaged . reinhardt hassa , a member of vattenfall europe 's german board , said the two plants would likely not resume operations until early next year . germany has legislated the gradual phase-out of all its nuclear power stations by 2020 .
currently , electricity generated from nuclear power satisfies about a quarter of the country 's needs . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a new european dawn is in the making in serbia . " " i have decided to initial the stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with serbia tomorrow here in brussels , " rehn told reporters on tuesday , upon the issuing of the bloc 's annual enlargement report . however , serbia must turn in alleged war criminals ratko mladic and radovan karadzic before the final signing could occur , rehn added .
prosecution of war crimes from the 1990s balkan conflict has remained a tenuous issue in eu dealings with several of the balkan states . the saa , which has been under negotiation since 2005 , provides a framework of mutual commitments on a wide range of political , trade and economic issues and is intended to culminate in eu membership negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian-serb general ratko mladic is wanted for war crimes committed in the 1990s serbia will be the third of the former yugoslav republics to enter into a stabilization and association agreement with the european union , following macedonia in 2004 and croatia in 2005 . in addition to serbia , albania , bosnia , and montenegro hope to be declared formal eu accession candidates in the coming years . the eu 's report , however , pointed out that has been " steady , though uneven progress in the western balkans -lrb- toward membership -rrb- and the region continues to face major challenges . "
the implementation of judicial reforms and the fight against corruption and organized crime are key areas that continue to need addressing , according to the report . croatia is likely to be next eu member the european commission also said in its annual report that croatia 's bid for eu membership is on track , but that more progress is needed . " the commission expects substantial progress ... in the course of the year ahead , provided that the country maintains the necessary reform momentum and meets the conditions , " the report said . improvement is particularly needed in the judicial and administrative reform , minority rights , refugee return and the restructuring of the steel and shipbuilding industries , according to the report .
the prosecution of war criminals was also emphasized . " many crimes remain unprosecuted , often due to a combination of a lack of evidence , unwillingness of witnesses to come forward and less than proactive approach of police and prosecutors , " the eu report said . croatia started accession talks with the bloc in 2005 , along with turkey , and , according to eu diplomats , is the only country likely to join in the next five years . eu slams rights situation in turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu particularly criticized turkey 's treatment of its kurdish minority turkey is progressing too slowly , said rehn on tuesday . " it 's simply not acceptable that writers , journalists and other citizens are persecuted in a european democracy for critically and non-violently expressing their opinions , " he said of the situation in turkey . the eu 's report did not go into detail on the current political and military tension between turkey and kurdish militants in iraq . after two years of accession talks , the country still has to improve minority rights , amend a law restricting the freedom of speech and press , normalize relations with cyprus and move ahead with other reforms before it can join the eu , according to the enlargement report . ankara on tuesday pledged to step up the pace of its reforms . " our commitment to completing our shortcomings and efficiently implementing the reforms on the ground is not decreasing - on the contrary it is increasing , " a foreign ministry statement said .
" we are determined to pursue reform until our country catches up with the highest levels of democracy and human rights . " turkey also said its accession process should not be " shaped in line with the preferences of the political leaders of some member states . " politicians in a number of european capitals , including paris and berlin , have come out against full membership for turkey in the 27-member bloc . while officially sticking to the european line of potential accession for turkey , german chancellor angela merkel has long said she is in favor of offering the country a " privileged partnership .

6 , to overcome rifts with neighbors germany and russia and restore trust in warsaw that has been strained by the defeated conservatives . at a news conference organized for poland 's foreign press corps , donald tusk addressed several issues that will be at the top of his foreign agenda as he takes office , including repairing strained ties berlin and brussels . " poland 's priorities in its relations with its neighbors and with the european union have remained stable since 1989 , " tusk told reporters .
" the past two years did not really change these priorities but the way of doing things was not very effective in achieving poland 's goals . " tusk 's civic platform beat the ruling law and justice party of identical twins president lech kaczynski and prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski in a snap election on oct .
21 , ending two years of conservative rule . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , right , hands his resignation documents to his twin brother president lech kaczynski the fact that tusk held such a conference is seen by many as a sign of his intention to change the status quo : neither of the kaczynskis ever held such an event . jaroslaw kaczynski resigned on monday and lech kaczynski , whose presidential term runs until 2010 , is set to appoint tusk as prime minister by the end of the week . the kaczynskis had a reputation for quarreling with fellow leaders of the 27-nation eu - notably germany , as the twins revived the specter of world war ii to accuse berlin of trying to dominate europe .
the brothers argued they were simply defending poland 's interests in the eu , which warsaw had joined in 2004 . get along with the neighbors tusk said mending fences with germany would be a key goal in the early days of his government . " i would like relations to get back to the level that we saw in the early 1990s , when the treaties were signed and symbolic meetings took place , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk , left , takes an oath during the first session of the new polish parliament he was referring to accords which fixed the polish-german frontier , and landmark talks between then german chancellor helmut kohl and polish prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki , who was the first pole to hold the position after the fall of communism in 1989 . " relations between poland and germany do n't need a radical breakthrough , but rather an increase in mutual trust , " said tusk , a member of poland 's kashubian minority over whose baltic coast territory poles and germans had battled for centuries . the kaczynskis had fiercely opposed germany 's plans to establish a documentation center focusing on the germans who were expelled from eastern europe , and notably poland , after the region 's borders were changed after world war ii . tusk signaled his openness to the plan : " the center should be based on historical truth .
a reasonable commemoration of the expellees will have the approval of the government , " he said . new eu attitude fellow eu leaders barely disguised their relief last month at the conservatives ' defeat , and tusk also reaffirmed that he wants to repair relations with the rest of the bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is hoping for a 180-degree turn from poland " we are the most pro-european party in poland , " said tusk , who is to meet european commission president jose manuel barroso in warsaw on thursday . the polish prime minister in waiting also looked east said he also wanted to repair frosty ties with russia , pledging " an effort to build trust on both sides . " differences between warsaw and moscow have caused " more tension than necessary " over the past two years , tusk said .
but he added russia should still accept that poland has friendly ties with the former soviet republics of ukraine and georgia , whose pro-western leaders have fallen foul of moscow . us missile shield tusk also signaled a change of tone in relations with the united states , reaffirming that warsaw plans to pull polish troops out of iraq next year and would drive a harder bargain in talks on locating missiles in poland as part of a planned us defense shield . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel and the kaczynskis had their differences " if we are to increase us security , we should expect a financial contribution to increase polish security , " he said . but poland 's decision on the missile shield is likely to upset at least one set of leaders he said he want to warm up to .
while the us has said a base in poland is essential to the shield 's operations , several eu countries have expressed concerns over the plan and russia is vehemently against it . " if we decide that missile defense will unambiguously increase poland 's security , then we will be open to negotiations , " tusk said , keeping his options open . later tuesday , tusk met with president kaczynski for talks that focused on poland 's future coalition government and missile defense negotiations with the us .
tusk played down any differences on missile defense between himself and the president , who plays a large role in poland 's foreign policy . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a new european dawn is in the making in serbia . " " i have decided to initial the stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with serbia tomorrow here in brussels , " rehn told reporters on tuesday , upon the issuing of the bloc 's annual enlargement report . however , serbia must turn in alleged war criminals ratko mladic and radovan karadzic before the final signing could occur , rehn added .
prosecution of war crimes from the 1990s balkan conflict has remained a tenuous issue in eu dealings with several of the balkan states . the saa , which has been under negotiation since 2005 , provides a framework of mutual commitments on a wide range of political , trade and economic issues and is intended to culminate in eu membership negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian-serb general ratko mladic is wanted for war crimes committed in the 1990s serbia will be the third of the former yugoslav republics to enter into a stabilization and association agreement with the european union , following macedonia in 2004 and croatia in 2005 . in addition to serbia , albania , bosnia , and montenegro hope to be declared formal eu accession candidates in the coming years . the eu 's report , however , pointed out that has been " steady , though uneven progress in the western balkans -lrb- toward membership -rrb- and the region continues to face major challenges . "
the implementation of judicial reforms and the fight against corruption and organized crime are key areas that continue to need addressing , according to the report . croatia is likely to be next eu member the european commission also said in its annual report that croatia 's bid for eu membership is on track , but that more progress is needed . " the commission expects substantial progress ... in the course of the year ahead , provided that the country maintains the necessary reform momentum and meets the conditions , " the report said . improvement is particularly needed in the judicial and administrative reform , minority rights , refugee return and the restructuring of the steel and shipbuilding industries , according to the report .
the prosecution of war criminals was also emphasized . " many crimes remain unprosecuted , often due to a combination of a lack of evidence , unwillingness of witnesses to come forward and less than proactive approach of police and prosecutors , " the eu report said . croatia started accession talks with the bloc in 2005 , along with turkey , and , according to eu diplomats , is the only country likely to join in the next five years . eu slams rights situation in turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu particularly criticized turkey 's treatment of its kurdish minority turkey is progressing too slowly , said rehn on tuesday . " it 's simply not acceptable that writers , journalists and other citizens are persecuted in a european democracy for critically and non-violently expressing their opinions , " he said of the situation in turkey . the eu 's report did not go into detail on the current political and military tension between turkey and kurdish militants in iraq . after two years of accession talks , the country still has to improve minority rights , amend a law restricting the freedom of speech and press , normalize relations with cyprus and move ahead with other reforms before it can join the eu , according to the enlargement report . ankara on tuesday pledged to step up the pace of its reforms . " our commitment to completing our shortcomings and efficiently implementing the reforms on the ground is not decreasing - on the contrary it is increasing , " a foreign ministry statement said .
" we are determined to pursue reform until our country catches up with the highest levels of democracy and human rights . " turkey also said its accession process should not be " shaped in line with the preferences of the political leaders of some member states . " politicians in a number of european capitals , including paris and berlin , have come out against full membership for turkey in the 27-member bloc . while officially sticking to the european line of potential accession for turkey , german chancellor angela merkel has long said she is in favor of offering the country a " privileged partnership .

germany 's bad service in shops and administrative offices may be the bane of consumers , but it was a boon for crime prevention in one case .
a bank robber who met the icy attitude of a teller turned tail and fled . entering a german shop or office is often an exercise in steeling oneself up for the worst .
the personnel behind the counter or desk generally seem to have trained in the fine art of negativity and , while often less than competent in their jobs , are world-class when it comes to avoiding eye contact , heaving big sighs when asked anything or becoming petulant when the customer does not have exact change . if customers have not erected psychological steel walls around themselves before encountering this wide-spread attitude , leaving a place of business can often be accompanied by tears or seething anger . one would-be bank robber , who it is assumed is familiar with germany 's service culture , thought the gun might be more powerful against the disposition , but he was oh-so-wrong . according to police , a young man entered a bank in the town of arnstadt , pistol in hand , and put a note in front of a teller that demanded cash .
the woman , surely drawing on what she knew best , even in a time of crisis , simply ignored the gun , the note and the man - completely . although he stood there for a while , her icy disregard soon disarmed him mentally .
he lost his nerve and fled , realizing that even with a gun , he had no chance against the teller 's steely attitude . police are still searching for the man , thought to be between 20 and 25 years of age .
he is no doubt still shaking for that sub-zero blast of bad customer service , but on the positive side , it might have turned him off a future life of crime . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the personnel behind the counter or desk generally seem to have trained in the fine art of negativity and , while often less than competent in their jobs , are world-class when it comes to avoiding eye contact , heaving big sighs when asked anything or becoming petulant when the customer does not have exact change . if customers have not erected psychological steel walls around themselves before encountering this wide-spread attitude , leaving a place of business can often be accompanied by tears or seething anger . one would-be bank robber , who it is assumed is familiar with germany 's service culture , thought the gun might be more powerful against the disposition , but he was oh-so-wrong . according to police , a young man entered a bank in the town of arnstadt , pistol in hand , and put a note in front of a teller that demanded cash .
the woman , surely drawing on what she knew best , even in a time of crisis , simply ignored the gun , the note and the man - completely . although he stood there for a while , her icy disregard soon disarmed him mentally .
he lost his nerve and fled , realizing that even with a gun , he had no chance against the teller 's steely attitude . police are still searching for the man , thought to be between 20 and 25 years of age .

germany 's bad service in shops and administrative offices may be the bane of consumers , but it was a boon for crime prevention in one case .
a bank robber who met the icy attitude of a teller turned tail and fled . entering a german shop or office is often an exercise in steeling oneself up for the worst .
the personnel behind the counter or desk generally seem to have trained in the fine art of negativity and , while often less than competent in their jobs , are world-class when it comes to avoiding eye contact , heaving big sighs when asked anything or becoming petulant when the customer does not have exact change . if customers have not erected psychological steel walls around themselves before encountering this wide-spread attitude , leaving a place of business can often be accompanied by tears or seething anger . one would-be bank robber , who it is assumed is familiar with germany 's service culture , thought the gun might be more powerful against the disposition , but he was oh-so-wrong . according to police , a young man entered a bank in the town of arnstadt , pistol in hand , and put a note in front of a teller that demanded cash .
the woman , surely drawing on what she knew best , even in a time of crisis , simply ignored the gun , the note and the man - completely . although he stood there for a while , her icy disregard soon disarmed him mentally .
he lost his nerve and fled , realizing that even with a gun , he had no chance against the teller 's steely attitude . police are still searching for the man , thought to be between 20 and 25 years of age .
he is no doubt still shaking for that sub-zero blast of bad customer service , but on the positive side , it might have turned him off a future life of crime . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

in a press release published on tuesday , nov .
6 on vattenfall 's web site , the scientists said that organizational and technical conditions at the two plants are such that safe running of the plants could resume . however , the panel also recommended a series of improved safety measures . vattenfall europe , one of the four big power generation companies operating in germany , said it would apply recommendations from the scientists to improve internal and public communications about safety . no apparent release of radiation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhardt hassa of vattenfall germany the panel of five scientists said no radiation had been released and that safety mechanisms were functioning correctly when a short-circuit hit brunsbüttel and the transformer at krümmel caught fire , according to dpa news agency . however , the panel also said that there were technical and communication problems among staff involving the emergency shutdown of the krümmel station .
the scientists recommended that staff be better trained . the power transformer destroyed in the fire at the krümmel station has meanwhile been replaced as well as faulty fastenings and cracked taps in the part of the station gutted by the fire . neither the krümmel reactor during the fire , nor the brunsbüttel reactor were damaged . reinhardt hassa , a member of vattenfall europe 's german board , said the two plants would likely not resume operations until early next year . germany has legislated the gradual phase-out of all its nuclear power stations by 2020 .

his talks with us president bush could alter the current state of trans-atlantic relations . while both french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel are traveling to washington this week with important business to discuss , it is sarkozy 's visit on tuesday , nov .
6 , with us president george w. bush that is generating the most interest on both sides of the atlantic . french-us relations , which for decades could be described as cordial at best , took a damaging turn in 2003 when sarkozy 's predecessor , jacques chirac , determinedly opposed the us-led invasion of iraq .
after chirac stepped down as president earlier this year , the temperature between the two nations - which had barely made it above tepid - began rising . us ties vital to france 's eu role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has made no secret of his admiration for the us " sarkozy has decided that french interests are best served by a closer alliance with washington , " said reginald dale , a trans-atlantic relations expert at the center for strategic and international studies in washington .
" sarkozy sees that france can not hope to regain its leadership of europe , which is his aim , if paris is always tagged as anti-american . " sarkozy is the most pro-american french leader in years and arrives in washington this week committed to showing the us that france has moved on from the bitterness caused by the divisions over iraq and that he is a committed european partner . sarkozy determined to be friend of us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and chirac 's falling-out still resonates in washington the french president has already laid the groundwork for a visit which is sure to be full of mutual praise , pledges of support , pumping handshakes and smiles . " the trial has started , i will be a friend of the americans , " the french president said two weeks ago .
" do we agree about everything ?
no , because in a family you can have disagreements .
but we are in the same family .
that is the truth of it . " however , the breakdown in relations under chirac is still fresh in american minds and it will take more than a few warm words to convince the white house of a significant shift in french policy . " washington is not yet sure that it completely trusts sarkozy and is worried by his frenetic hyperactivity , which sometimes makes him look almost unbalanced , " dale said .
" historically , the default mode in us-french relations has been one of abrasiveness and mutual suspicion , and it will take substantial , concrete results to dispel that suspicion . " shared iran stance overshadows differences while there is still tension between the two nations - sarkozy has criticized us environmental policies and the war in iraq - france and the us have found common ground on a number of pressing international issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's iran could face tougher sanctions iran is one subject is likely to top a number of bush 's meetings this week .
washington has leaned toward imposing stricter sanctions against tehran , and bush may find a strong supporter in france as sarkozy has been more willing to pressure iran on the nuclear issue than chirac was . that support could even lead to a shift in future discussions over the iranian nuclear program . sarkozy setting the agenda for europe " the fact that sarkozy arrives -lsb- before merkel on friday -rsb- could influence how subsequent talks on iran progress , " said sandra herbinger of the international transatlantic relations council .
" what he and bush discuss on iran will put huge pressure on those who follow , particularly merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel may have to follow sarkozy 's lead on iran " with france leading on this , germany will have to accept that it is not the only key partner for the united states in europe and that sarkozy 's is the lead europe will be encouraged to follow , " she added . analysts said that since gordon brown replaced tony blair as british prime minister , sarkozy has become a central player for washington , something the french president 's opponents have also noted . before moving into the elysee palace , sarkozy was accused by the socialist party as being " bush 's poodle " - a term often used by opposition politicians in the uk to describe blair .
since being elected , sarkozy has continued to face suspicion for his apparent desire to side with a deeply unpopular us president . " sarkozy can certainly strengthen french bonds with washington , though he will take care not to look subservient , but he can not hope to replace the ' special relationship ' between the us and britain , " dale said .

in a press release published on tuesday , nov .
6 on vattenfall 's web site , the scientists said that organizational and technical conditions at the two plants are such that safe running of the plants could resume . however , the panel also recommended a series of improved safety measures . vattenfall europe , one of the four big power generation companies operating in germany , said it would apply recommendations from the scientists to improve internal and public communications about safety . no apparent release of radiation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhardt hassa of vattenfall germany the panel of five scientists said no radiation had been released and that safety mechanisms were functioning correctly when a short-circuit hit brunsbüttel and the transformer at krümmel caught fire , according to dpa news agency . however , the panel also said that there were technical and communication problems among staff involving the emergency shutdown of the krümmel station .
the scientists recommended that staff be better trained . the power transformer destroyed in the fire at the krümmel station has meanwhile been replaced as well as faulty fastenings and cracked taps in the part of the station gutted by the fire . neither the krümmel reactor during the fire , nor the brunsbüttel reactor were damaged . reinhardt hassa , a member of vattenfall europe 's german board , said the two plants would likely not resume operations until early next year . germany has legislated the gradual phase-out of all its nuclear power stations by 2020 .
currently , electricity generated from nuclear power satisfies about a quarter of the country 's needs . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

since being elected , sarkozy has continued to face suspicion for his apparent desire to side with a deeply unpopular us president . " sarkozy can certainly strengthen french bonds with washington , though he will take care not to look subservient , but he can not hope to replace the ' special relationship ' between the us and britain , " dale said .

germany 's bad service in shops and administrative offices may be the bane of consumers , but it was a boon for crime prevention in one case .
a bank robber who met the icy attitude of a teller turned tail and fled . entering a german shop or office is often an exercise in steeling oneself up for the worst .
the personnel behind the counter or desk generally seem to have trained in the fine art of negativity and , while often less than competent in their jobs , are world-class when it comes to avoiding eye contact , heaving big sighs when asked anything or becoming petulant when the customer does not have exact change . if customers have not erected psychological steel walls around themselves before encountering this wide-spread attitude , leaving a place of business can often be accompanied by tears or seething anger . one would-be bank robber , who it is assumed is familiar with germany 's service culture , thought the gun might be more powerful against the disposition , but he was oh-so-wrong . according to police , a young man entered a bank in the town of arnstadt , pistol in hand , and put a note in front of a teller that demanded cash .
the woman , surely drawing on what she knew best , even in a time of crisis , simply ignored the gun , the note and the man - completely . although he stood there for a while , her icy disregard soon disarmed him mentally .
he lost his nerve and fled , realizing that even with a gun , he had no chance against the teller 's steely attitude . police are still searching for the man , thought to be between 20 and 25 years of age .
he is no doubt still shaking for that sub-zero blast of bad customer service , but on the positive side , it might have turned him off a future life of crime . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the ministry said that an " unknown number " of planes were currently undergoing repairs . germany had originally planned to replace the remaining transall planes with airbus ' new a400m model by 2014 , but that schedule may have to be revised due to recently announced delays in delivery . the german government has ordered 60 of the airbus models at a cost of 8.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.4 billion -rrb- . until they are delivered , the transalls remain the sole military transporters , and must run flights to the balkans and afghanistan .

in a press release published on tuesday , nov .
6 on vattenfall 's web site , the scientists said that organizational and technical conditions at the two plants are such that safe running of the plants could resume . however , the panel also recommended a series of improved safety measures . vattenfall europe , one of the four big power generation companies operating in germany , said it would apply recommendations from the scientists to improve internal and public communications about safety . no apparent release of radiation bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : reinhardt hassa of vattenfall germany the panel of five scientists said no radiation had been released and that safety mechanisms were functioning correctly when a short-circuit hit brunsbüttel and the transformer at krümmel caught fire , according to dpa news agency . however , the panel also said that there were technical and communication problems among staff involving the emergency shutdown of the krümmel station .
the scientists recommended that staff be better trained . the power transformer destroyed in the fire at the krümmel station has meanwhile been replaced as well as faulty fastenings and cracked taps in the part of the station gutted by the fire . neither the krümmel reactor during the fire , nor the brunsbüttel reactor were damaged . reinhardt hassa , a member of vattenfall europe 's german board , said the two plants would likely not resume operations until early next year . germany has legislated the gradual phase-out of all its nuclear power stations by 2020 .

in a press release published on tuesday , nov .

the scientists recommended that staff be better trained . the power transformer destroyed in the fire at the krümmel station has meanwhile been replaced as well as faulty fastenings and cracked taps in the part of the station gutted by the fire . neither the krümmel reactor during the fire , nor the brunsbüttel reactor were damaged . reinhardt hassa , a member of vattenfall europe 's german board , said the two plants would likely not resume operations until early next year . germany has legislated the gradual phase-out of all its nuclear power stations by 2020 .

the accusations have outraged the tennis world . the anonymous insider , speaking to german public broadcaster wdr , said that some professional tennis players had raked in more cash by engaging in game-rigging than they would have by winning the tournaments . he also claimed to have been offered a five-figure sum to act as a middleman in a betting affair . the association of tennis professionals -lrb- atp -rrb- is currently investigating a list of 140 allegedly fixed matches .

" i would have blown their cover .
only relentless openness can shed light on this mess . " he admitted , however , that it 's difficult to prove whether a player has intentionally lost a match or not . tennis scene responds to allegations anger , helplessness and disbelief have resonated from other corners of the professional tennis world as well . " i ca n't imagine that it 's true and that german players are really involved in illegal betting at tennis tournaments , " davis cup team leader patrik kühn told german news agency dpa on monday , nov .

" but we as the dtb are n't necessarily capable of acting . " " we 're urgently waiting on sanctions from the apt , " added waldenfels . in light of the allegations , the apt warned on monday that players involved in fixing matches could face a life-long play ban if they do n't confess within two days . the current tennis scandal is n't the first time illegal betting accusations have been made in german professional sports .

prosecution of war crimes from the 1990s balkan conflict has remained a tenuous issue in eu dealings with several of the balkan states . the saa , which has been under negotiation since 2005 , provides a framework of mutual commitments on a wide range of political , trade and economic issues and is intended to culminate in eu membership negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian-serb general ratko mladic is wanted for war crimes committed in the 1990s serbia will be the third of the former yugoslav republics to enter into a stabilization and association agreement with the european union , following macedonia in 2004 and croatia in 2005 . in addition to serbia , albania , bosnia , and montenegro hope to be declared formal eu accession candidates in the coming years . the eu 's report , however , pointed out that has been " steady , though uneven progress in the western balkans -lrb- toward membership -rrb- and the region continues to face major challenges . "
the implementation of judicial reforms and the fight against corruption and organized crime are key areas that continue to need addressing , according to the report . croatia is likely to be next eu member the european commission also said in its annual report that croatia 's bid for eu membership is on track , but that more progress is needed . " the commission expects substantial progress ... in the course of the year ahead , provided that the country maintains the necessary reform momentum and meets the conditions , " the report said . improvement is particularly needed in the judicial and administrative reform , minority rights , refugee return and the restructuring of the steel and shipbuilding industries , according to the report .
the prosecution of war criminals was also emphasized . " many crimes remain unprosecuted , often due to a combination of a lack of evidence , unwillingness of witnesses to come forward and less than proactive approach of police and prosecutors , " the eu report said . croatia started accession talks with the bloc in 2005 , along with turkey , and , according to eu diplomats , is the only country likely to join in the next five years . eu slams rights situation in turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu particularly criticized turkey 's treatment of its kurdish minority turkey is progressing too slowly , said rehn on tuesday . " it 's simply not acceptable that writers , journalists and other citizens are persecuted in a european democracy for critically and non-violently expressing their opinions , " he said of the situation in turkey . the eu 's report did not go into detail on the current political and military tension between turkey and kurdish militants in iraq . after two years of accession talks , the country still has to improve minority rights , amend a law restricting the freedom of speech and press , normalize relations with cyprus and move ahead with other reforms before it can join the eu , according to the enlargement report . ankara on tuesday pledged to step up the pace of its reforms . " our commitment to completing our shortcomings and efficiently implementing the reforms on the ground is not decreasing - on the contrary it is increasing , " a foreign ministry statement said .
" we are determined to pursue reform until our country catches up with the highest levels of democracy and human rights . " turkey also said its accession process should not be " shaped in line with the preferences of the political leaders of some member states . " politicians in a number of european capitals , including paris and berlin , have come out against full membership for turkey in the 27-member bloc . while officially sticking to the european line of potential accession for turkey , german chancellor angela merkel has long said she is in favor of offering the country a " privileged partnership .

" a new european dawn is in the making in serbia . " " i have decided to initial the stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with serbia tomorrow here in brussels , " rehn told reporters on tuesday , upon the issuing of the bloc 's annual enlargement report . however , serbia must turn in alleged war criminals ratko mladic and radovan karadzic before the final signing could occur , rehn added .
prosecution of war crimes from the 1990s balkan conflict has remained a tenuous issue in eu dealings with several of the balkan states . the saa , which has been under negotiation since 2005 , provides a framework of mutual commitments on a wide range of political , trade and economic issues and is intended to culminate in eu membership negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian-serb general ratko mladic is wanted for war crimes committed in the 1990s serbia will be the third of the former yugoslav republics to enter into a stabilization and association agreement with the european union , following macedonia in 2004 and croatia in 2005 . in addition to serbia , albania , bosnia , and montenegro hope to be declared formal eu accession candidates in the coming years . the eu 's report , however , pointed out that has been " steady , though uneven progress in the western balkans -lrb- toward membership -rrb- and the region continues to face major challenges . "
the implementation of judicial reforms and the fight against corruption and organized crime are key areas that continue to need addressing , according to the report . croatia is likely to be next eu member the european commission also said in its annual report that croatia 's bid for eu membership is on track , but that more progress is needed . " the commission expects substantial progress ... in the course of the year ahead , provided that the country maintains the necessary reform momentum and meets the conditions , " the report said . improvement is particularly needed in the judicial and administrative reform , minority rights , refugee return and the restructuring of the steel and shipbuilding industries , according to the report .
the prosecution of war criminals was also emphasized . " many crimes remain unprosecuted , often due to a combination of a lack of evidence , unwillingness of witnesses to come forward and less than proactive approach of police and prosecutors , " the eu report said . croatia started accession talks with the bloc in 2005 , along with turkey , and , according to eu diplomats , is the only country likely to join in the next five years . eu slams rights situation in turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu particularly criticized turkey 's treatment of its kurdish minority turkey is progressing too slowly , said rehn on tuesday . " it 's simply not acceptable that writers , journalists and other citizens are persecuted in a european democracy for critically and non-violently expressing their opinions , " he said of the situation in turkey . the eu 's report did not go into detail on the current political and military tension between turkey and kurdish militants in iraq . after two years of accession talks , the country still has to improve minority rights , amend a law restricting the freedom of speech and press , normalize relations with cyprus and move ahead with other reforms before it can join the eu , according to the enlargement report . ankara on tuesday pledged to step up the pace of its reforms . " our commitment to completing our shortcomings and efficiently implementing the reforms on the ground is not decreasing - on the contrary it is increasing , " a foreign ministry statement said .
" we are determined to pursue reform until our country catches up with the highest levels of democracy and human rights . " turkey also said its accession process should not be " shaped in line with the preferences of the political leaders of some member states . " politicians in a number of european capitals , including paris and berlin , have come out against full membership for turkey in the 27-member bloc . while officially sticking to the european line of potential accession for turkey , german chancellor angela merkel has long said she is in favor of offering the country a " privileged partnership .

earlier this week , eu anti-terror experts warned that more attacks by islamic extremists were likely . " terrorists will strike whenever , wherever and with whatever means to make the most impact , " the commissioner said . to counter the threat , frattini has proposed new anti-terror measures that range from criminalizing the incitement of violence on the internet and the recruitment volunteers for attacks , to collecting data from airline passengers flying into the 27-member eu bloc . frattini said his proposals , which would have to be unanimously approved by eu governments to become law , were necessary to safeguard citizens .
he would like to see them implemented by the end of next year . storing of passenger data bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini wants to raise the standard of the eu 's anti-terror measures the most contentious of frattini 's plans is for eu countries to adopt airline security measures like those in the united states , which would include saving passenger data for up to 13 years and making the data available to law enforcement agents like police and customs officers , who may part of anti-terror activities or investigations . the data collected on passengers flying to or from non-eu member states would include the e-mail address and phone number of the passenger , ticket and travel agent information , and payment details , and would be provided 24 hours before departure . the scheme resembles a system put in place in the united states after the sept .

privacy advocates have heaped criticism on both the us system and the frattini 's plan . separate security proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu already hands over data on passengers flying to the us another of frattini 's security proposals includes eu governments treating as criminal offenses all public incitement to terrorism , as well as terrorist recruitment .
under the proposal , it would also be illegal to provide terrorist training information , particularly on the internet . " the internet serves ... as one of the principal boosters of the processes of radicalization and recruitment and also serves as a source of information on terrorist means and methods , thus functioning as a virtual training camp , " the proposal said . however , in an attempt to tone down criticism from civil liberties campaigners , frattini 's plan specifies that this new measure may not be used to restrict the dissemination of information for scientific , academic or reporting purposes . the civil liberties monitoring organization statewatch said the plans could potentially target simply for expressing a political opinion . " the wording of this definition is clearly likely to result in the criminalization of the expression of political views ... even if that expression does not in any way include the advocacy of terrorism to support those opinions , " it said in a statement .

that leaves an ever smaller fleet to fly soldiers to and from afghanistan . the handelsblatt quoted aviation industry sources as saying that corrosion and wear and tear have turned over half of germany 's transall planes into decrepit machinery .
the sources apparently said that it was becoming more difficult to locate spare parts for the planes , some of which are more than 40 years old . the paper also reported that a number of planes have been grounded due to rust problems and some are beyond repair . the german defense ministy has partially denied the report , the handelsblatt wrote . " unknown number " in repair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a transall at ramstein base in germany germany currently has 83 transall planes in deployment .
the defense ministry said that 70 percent of the planes are always ready for action , as nato dictates .
the ministry said that an " unknown number " of planes were currently undergoing repairs . germany had originally planned to replace the remaining transall planes with airbus ' new a400m model by 2014 , but that schedule may have to be revised due to recently announced delays in delivery . the german government has ordered 60 of the airbus models at a cost of 8.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.4 billion -rrb- . until they are delivered , the transalls remain the sole military transporters , and must run flights to the balkans and afghanistan .

germany 's bad service in shops and administrative offices may be the bane of consumers , but it was a boon for crime prevention in one case .
a bank robber who met the icy attitude of a teller turned tail and fled . entering a german shop or office is often an exercise in steeling oneself up for the worst .
the personnel behind the counter or desk generally seem to have trained in the fine art of negativity and , while often less than competent in their jobs , are world-class when it comes to avoiding eye contact , heaving big sighs when asked anything or becoming petulant when the customer does not have exact change . if customers have not erected psychological steel walls around themselves before encountering this wide-spread attitude , leaving a place of business can often be accompanied by tears or seething anger . one would-be bank robber , who it is assumed is familiar with germany 's service culture , thought the gun might be more powerful against the disposition , but he was oh-so-wrong . according to police , a young man entered a bank in the town of arnstadt , pistol in hand , and put a note in front of a teller that demanded cash .
the woman , surely drawing on what she knew best , even in a time of crisis , simply ignored the gun , the note and the man - completely . although he stood there for a while , her icy disregard soon disarmed him mentally .
he lost his nerve and fled , realizing that even with a gun , he had no chance against the teller 's steely attitude . police are still searching for the man , thought to be between 20 and 25 years of age .

the accusations have outraged the tennis world . the anonymous insider , speaking to german public broadcaster wdr , said that some professional tennis players had raked in more cash by engaging in game-rigging than they would have by winning the tournaments . he also claimed to have been offered a five-figure sum to act as a middleman in a betting affair . the association of tennis professionals -lrb- atp -rrb- is currently investigating a list of 140 allegedly fixed matches .
names of seven german tennis players were on the list , including two who intentionally lost matches , according to the anonymous informant . haas appeals to anonymous player bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tommy haas " it 's time people started naming names , " said successful german tennis pro tommy haas in response to the allegations , which he said may very well be true . " no one has ever approached me -lsb- about fixing a match -rsb- , " added haas , who 's played professionally for 11 years .
" i would have blown their cover .
only relentless openness can shed light on this mess . " he admitted , however , that it 's difficult to prove whether a player has intentionally lost a match or not . tennis scene responds to allegations anger , helplessness and disbelief have resonated from other corners of the professional tennis world as well . " i ca n't imagine that it 's true and that german players are really involved in illegal betting at tennis tournaments , " davis cup team leader patrik kühn told german news agency dpa on monday , nov .
5 . " criminal energy is everywhere , " commented george von waldenfels , head of the german tennis association -lrb- dtb -rrb- .
" but we as the dtb are n't necessarily capable of acting . " " we 're urgently waiting on sanctions from the apt , " added waldenfels . in light of the allegations , the apt warned on monday that players involved in fixing matches could face a life-long play ban if they do n't confess within two days . the current tennis scandal is n't the first time illegal betting accusations have been made in german professional sports .

earlier this week , eu anti-terror experts warned that more attacks by islamic extremists were likely . " terrorists will strike whenever , wherever and with whatever means to make the most impact , " the commissioner said . to counter the threat , frattini has proposed new anti-terror measures that range from criminalizing the incitement of violence on the internet and the recruitment volunteers for attacks , to collecting data from airline passengers flying into the 27-member eu bloc . frattini said his proposals , which would have to be unanimously approved by eu governments to become law , were necessary to safeguard citizens .
he would like to see them implemented by the end of next year . storing of passenger data bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini wants to raise the standard of the eu 's anti-terror measures the most contentious of frattini 's plans is for eu countries to adopt airline security measures like those in the united states , which would include saving passenger data for up to 13 years and making the data available to law enforcement agents like police and customs officers , who may part of anti-terror activities or investigations . the data collected on passengers flying to or from non-eu member states would include the e-mail address and phone number of the passenger , ticket and travel agent information , and payment details , and would be provided 24 hours before departure . the scheme resembles a system put in place in the united states after the sept .
11 terror attacks , and the eu , in july , agreed to relinquish personal data about passengers flying to the united states .
privacy advocates have heaped criticism on both the us system and the frattini 's plan . separate security proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu already hands over data on passengers flying to the us another of frattini 's security proposals includes eu governments treating as criminal offenses all public incitement to terrorism , as well as terrorist recruitment .
under the proposal , it would also be illegal to provide terrorist training information , particularly on the internet . " the internet serves ... as one of the principal boosters of the processes of radicalization and recruitment and also serves as a source of information on terrorist means and methods , thus functioning as a virtual training camp , " the proposal said . however , in an attempt to tone down criticism from civil liberties campaigners , frattini 's plan specifies that this new measure may not be used to restrict the dissemination of information for scientific , academic or reporting purposes . the civil liberties monitoring organization statewatch said the plans could potentially target simply for expressing a political opinion . " the wording of this definition is clearly likely to result in the criminalization of the expression of political views ... even if that expression does not in any way include the advocacy of terrorism to support those opinions , " it said in a statement .
" this proposal could even be counter-productive , radicalizing others who share those beliefs and increasing rather than decreasing the number of violent terrorists in the eu .

" a new european dawn is in the making in serbia . " " i have decided to initial the stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with serbia tomorrow here in brussels , " rehn told reporters on tuesday , upon the issuing of the bloc 's annual enlargement report . however , serbia must turn in alleged war criminals ratko mladic and radovan karadzic before the final signing could occur , rehn added .
prosecution of war crimes from the 1990s balkan conflict has remained a tenuous issue in eu dealings with several of the balkan states . the saa , which has been under negotiation since 2005 , provides a framework of mutual commitments on a wide range of political , trade and economic issues and is intended to culminate in eu membership negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian-serb general ratko mladic is wanted for war crimes committed in the 1990s serbia will be the third of the former yugoslav republics to enter into a stabilization and association agreement with the european union , following macedonia in 2004 and croatia in 2005 . in addition to serbia , albania , bosnia , and montenegro hope to be declared formal eu accession candidates in the coming years . the eu 's report , however , pointed out that has been " steady , though uneven progress in the western balkans -lrb- toward membership -rrb- and the region continues to face major challenges . "
the implementation of judicial reforms and the fight against corruption and organized crime are key areas that continue to need addressing , according to the report . croatia is likely to be next eu member the european commission also said in its annual report that croatia 's bid for eu membership is on track , but that more progress is needed . " the commission expects substantial progress ... in the course of the year ahead , provided that the country maintains the necessary reform momentum and meets the conditions , " the report said . improvement is particularly needed in the judicial and administrative reform , minority rights , refugee return and the restructuring of the steel and shipbuilding industries , according to the report .
the prosecution of war criminals was also emphasized . " many crimes remain unprosecuted , often due to a combination of a lack of evidence , unwillingness of witnesses to come forward and less than proactive approach of police and prosecutors , " the eu report said . croatia started accession talks with the bloc in 2005 , along with turkey , and , according to eu diplomats , is the only country likely to join in the next five years . eu slams rights situation in turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu particularly criticized turkey 's treatment of its kurdish minority turkey is progressing too slowly , said rehn on tuesday . " it 's simply not acceptable that writers , journalists and other citizens are persecuted in a european democracy for critically and non-violently expressing their opinions , " he said of the situation in turkey . the eu 's report did not go into detail on the current political and military tension between turkey and kurdish militants in iraq . after two years of accession talks , the country still has to improve minority rights , amend a law restricting the freedom of speech and press , normalize relations with cyprus and move ahead with other reforms before it can join the eu , according to the enlargement report . ankara on tuesday pledged to step up the pace of its reforms . " our commitment to completing our shortcomings and efficiently implementing the reforms on the ground is not decreasing - on the contrary it is increasing , " a foreign ministry statement said .
" we are determined to pursue reform until our country catches up with the highest levels of democracy and human rights . " turkey also said its accession process should not be " shaped in line with the preferences of the political leaders of some member states . " politicians in a number of european capitals , including paris and berlin , have come out against full membership for turkey in the 27-member bloc . while officially sticking to the european line of potential accession for turkey , german chancellor angela merkel has long said she is in favor of offering the country a " privileged partnership .

the accusations have outraged the tennis world . the anonymous insider , speaking to german public broadcaster wdr , said that some professional tennis players had raked in more cash by engaging in game-rigging than they would have by winning the tournaments . he also claimed to have been offered a five-figure sum to act as a middleman in a betting affair . the association of tennis professionals -lrb- atp -rrb- is currently investigating a list of 140 allegedly fixed matches .
names of seven german tennis players were on the list , including two who intentionally lost matches , according to the anonymous informant . haas appeals to anonymous player bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tommy haas " it 's time people started naming names , " said successful german tennis pro tommy haas in response to the allegations , which he said may very well be true . " no one has ever approached me -lsb- about fixing a match -rsb- , " added haas , who 's played professionally for 11 years .
" i would have blown their cover .
only relentless openness can shed light on this mess . " he admitted , however , that it 's difficult to prove whether a player has intentionally lost a match or not . tennis scene responds to allegations anger , helplessness and disbelief have resonated from other corners of the professional tennis world as well . " i ca n't imagine that it 's true and that german players are really involved in illegal betting at tennis tournaments , " davis cup team leader patrik kühn told german news agency dpa on monday , nov .
5 . " criminal energy is everywhere , " commented george von waldenfels , head of the german tennis association -lrb- dtb -rrb- .
" but we as the dtb are n't necessarily capable of acting . " " we 're urgently waiting on sanctions from the apt , " added waldenfels . in light of the allegations , the apt warned on monday that players involved in fixing matches could face a life-long play ban if they do n't confess within two days . the current tennis scandal is n't the first time illegal betting accusations have been made in german professional sports .
soccer referee robert hoyzer was sentenced in december 2006 to nearly two and a half years in prison for fixing games for money . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a new european dawn is in the making in serbia . " " i have decided to initial the stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with serbia tomorrow here in brussels , " rehn told reporters on tuesday , upon the issuing of the bloc 's annual enlargement report . however , serbia must turn in alleged war criminals ratko mladic and radovan karadzic before the final signing could occur , rehn added .
prosecution of war crimes from the 1990s balkan conflict has remained a tenuous issue in eu dealings with several of the balkan states . the saa , which has been under negotiation since 2005 , provides a framework of mutual commitments on a wide range of political , trade and economic issues and is intended to culminate in eu membership negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian-serb general ratko mladic is wanted for war crimes committed in the 1990s serbia will be the third of the former yugoslav republics to enter into a stabilization and association agreement with the european union , following macedonia in 2004 and croatia in 2005 . in addition to serbia , albania , bosnia , and montenegro hope to be declared formal eu accession candidates in the coming years . the eu 's report , however , pointed out that has been " steady , though uneven progress in the western balkans -lrb- toward membership -rrb- and the region continues to face major challenges . "
the implementation of judicial reforms and the fight against corruption and organized crime are key areas that continue to need addressing , according to the report . croatia is likely to be next eu member the european commission also said in its annual report that croatia 's bid for eu membership is on track , but that more progress is needed . " the commission expects substantial progress ... in the course of the year ahead , provided that the country maintains the necessary reform momentum and meets the conditions , " the report said . improvement is particularly needed in the judicial and administrative reform , minority rights , refugee return and the restructuring of the steel and shipbuilding industries , according to the report .
the prosecution of war criminals was also emphasized . " many crimes remain unprosecuted , often due to a combination of a lack of evidence , unwillingness of witnesses to come forward and less than proactive approach of police and prosecutors , " the eu report said . croatia started accession talks with the bloc in 2005 , along with turkey , and , according to eu diplomats , is the only country likely to join in the next five years . eu slams rights situation in turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu particularly criticized turkey 's treatment of its kurdish minority turkey is progressing too slowly , said rehn on tuesday . " it 's simply not acceptable that writers , journalists and other citizens are persecuted in a european democracy for critically and non-violently expressing their opinions , " he said of the situation in turkey . the eu 's report did not go into detail on the current political and military tension between turkey and kurdish militants in iraq . after two years of accession talks , the country still has to improve minority rights , amend a law restricting the freedom of speech and press , normalize relations with cyprus and move ahead with other reforms before it can join the eu , according to the enlargement report . ankara on tuesday pledged to step up the pace of its reforms . " our commitment to completing our shortcomings and efficiently implementing the reforms on the ground is not decreasing - on the contrary it is increasing , " a foreign ministry statement said .
" we are determined to pursue reform until our country catches up with the highest levels of democracy and human rights . " turkey also said its accession process should not be " shaped in line with the preferences of the political leaders of some member states . " politicians in a number of european capitals , including paris and berlin , have come out against full membership for turkey in the 27-member bloc . while officially sticking to the european line of potential accession for turkey , german chancellor angela merkel has long said she is in favor of offering the country a " privileged partnership .

" relations between poland and germany do n't need a radical breakthrough , but rather an increase in mutual trust , " said tusk , a member of poland 's kashubian minority over whose baltic coast territory poles and germans had battled for centuries . the kaczynskis had fiercely opposed germany 's plans to establish a documentation center focusing on the germans who were expelled from eastern europe , and notably poland , after the region 's borders were changed after world war ii . tusk signaled his openness to the plan : " the center should be based on historical truth .
a reasonable commemoration of the expellees will have the approval of the government , " he said . new eu attitude fellow eu leaders barely disguised their relief last month at the conservatives ' defeat , and tusk also reaffirmed that he wants to repair relations with the rest of the bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is hoping for a 180-degree turn from poland " we are the most pro-european party in poland , " said tusk , who is to meet european commission president jose manuel barroso in warsaw on thursday . the polish prime minister in waiting also looked east said he also wanted to repair frosty ties with russia , pledging " an effort to build trust on both sides . " differences between warsaw and moscow have caused " more tension than necessary " over the past two years , tusk said .

while the us has said a base in poland is essential to the shield 's operations , several eu countries have expressed concerns over the plan and russia is vehemently against it . " if we decide that missile defense will unambiguously increase poland 's security , then we will be open to negotiations , " tusk said , keeping his options open . later tuesday , tusk met with president kaczynski for talks that focused on poland 's future coalition government and missile defense negotiations with the us .
tusk played down any differences on missile defense between himself and the president , who plays a large role in poland 's foreign policy . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" relations between poland and germany do n't need a radical breakthrough , but rather an increase in mutual trust , " said tusk , a member of poland 's kashubian minority over whose baltic coast territory poles and germans had battled for centuries . the kaczynskis had fiercely opposed germany 's plans to establish a documentation center focusing on the germans who were expelled from eastern europe , and notably poland , after the region 's borders were changed after world war ii . tusk signaled his openness to the plan : " the center should be based on historical truth .
a reasonable commemoration of the expellees will have the approval of the government , " he said . new eu attitude fellow eu leaders barely disguised their relief last month at the conservatives ' defeat , and tusk also reaffirmed that he wants to repair relations with the rest of the bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is hoping for a 180-degree turn from poland " we are the most pro-european party in poland , " said tusk , who is to meet european commission president jose manuel barroso in warsaw on thursday . the polish prime minister in waiting also looked east said he also wanted to repair frosty ties with russia , pledging " an effort to build trust on both sides . " differences between warsaw and moscow have caused " more tension than necessary " over the past two years , tusk said .
but he added russia should still accept that poland has friendly ties with the former soviet republics of ukraine and georgia , whose pro-western leaders have fallen foul of moscow . us missile shield tusk also signaled a change of tone in relations with the united states , reaffirming that warsaw plans to pull polish troops out of iraq next year and would drive a harder bargain in talks on locating missiles in poland as part of a planned us defense shield . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel and the kaczynskis had their differences " if we are to increase us security , we should expect a financial contribution to increase polish security , " he said . but poland 's decision on the missile shield is likely to upset at least one set of leaders he said he want to warm up to .
while the us has said a base in poland is essential to the shield 's operations , several eu countries have expressed concerns over the plan and russia is vehemently against it . " if we decide that missile defense will unambiguously increase poland 's security , then we will be open to negotiations , " tusk said , keeping his options open . later tuesday , tusk met with president kaczynski for talks that focused on poland 's future coalition government and missile defense negotiations with the us .
tusk played down any differences on missile defense between himself and the president , who plays a large role in poland 's foreign policy . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6 , eu justice commissioner franco frattini said europe " can not be complacent " against the threat of new attacks on the continent .
earlier this week , eu anti-terror experts warned that more attacks by islamic extremists were likely . " terrorists will strike whenever , wherever and with whatever means to make the most impact , " the commissioner said . to counter the threat , frattini has proposed new anti-terror measures that range from criminalizing the incitement of violence on the internet and the recruitment volunteers for attacks , to collecting data from airline passengers flying into the 27-member eu bloc . frattini said his proposals , which would have to be unanimously approved by eu governments to become law , were necessary to safeguard citizens .
he would like to see them implemented by the end of next year . storing of passenger data bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : frattini wants to raise the standard of the eu 's anti-terror measures the most contentious of frattini 's plans is for eu countries to adopt airline security measures like those in the united states , which would include saving passenger data for up to 13 years and making the data available to law enforcement agents like police and customs officers , who may part of anti-terror activities or investigations . the data collected on passengers flying to or from non-eu member states would include the e-mail address and phone number of the passenger , ticket and travel agent information , and payment details , and would be provided 24 hours before departure . the scheme resembles a system put in place in the united states after the sept .
11 terror attacks , and the eu , in july , agreed to relinquish personal data about passengers flying to the united states .
privacy advocates have heaped criticism on both the us system and the frattini 's plan . separate security proposal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu already hands over data on passengers flying to the us another of frattini 's security proposals includes eu governments treating as criminal offenses all public incitement to terrorism , as well as terrorist recruitment .
under the proposal , it would also be illegal to provide terrorist training information , particularly on the internet . " the internet serves ... as one of the principal boosters of the processes of radicalization and recruitment and also serves as a source of information on terrorist means and methods , thus functioning as a virtual training camp , " the proposal said . however , in an attempt to tone down criticism from civil liberties campaigners , frattini 's plan specifies that this new measure may not be used to restrict the dissemination of information for scientific , academic or reporting purposes . the civil liberties monitoring organization statewatch said the plans could potentially target simply for expressing a political opinion . " the wording of this definition is clearly likely to result in the criminalization of the expression of political views ... even if that expression does not in any way include the advocacy of terrorism to support those opinions , " it said in a statement .
" this proposal could even be counter-productive , radicalizing others who share those beliefs and increasing rather than decreasing the number of violent terrorists in the eu .

the accusations have outraged the tennis world . the anonymous insider , speaking to german public broadcaster wdr , said that some professional tennis players had raked in more cash by engaging in game-rigging than they would have by winning the tournaments . he also claimed to have been offered a five-figure sum to act as a middleman in a betting affair . the association of tennis professionals -lrb- atp -rrb- is currently investigating a list of 140 allegedly fixed matches .
names of seven german tennis players were on the list , including two who intentionally lost matches , according to the anonymous informant . haas appeals to anonymous player bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : tommy haas " it 's time people started naming names , " said successful german tennis pro tommy haas in response to the allegations , which he said may very well be true . " no one has ever approached me -lsb- about fixing a match -rsb- , " added haas , who 's played professionally for 11 years .
" i would have blown their cover .
only relentless openness can shed light on this mess . " he admitted , however , that it 's difficult to prove whether a player has intentionally lost a match or not . tennis scene responds to allegations anger , helplessness and disbelief have resonated from other corners of the professional tennis world as well . " i ca n't imagine that it 's true and that german players are really involved in illegal betting at tennis tournaments , " davis cup team leader patrik kühn told german news agency dpa on monday , nov .

" but we as the dtb are n't necessarily capable of acting .

his talks with us president bush could alter the current state of trans-atlantic relations . while both french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel are traveling to washington this week with important business to discuss , it is sarkozy 's visit on tuesday , nov .
6 , with us president george w. bush that is generating the most interest on both sides of the atlantic . french-us relations , which for decades could be described as cordial at best , took a damaging turn in 2003 when sarkozy 's predecessor , jacques chirac , determinedly opposed the us-led invasion of iraq .
after chirac stepped down as president earlier this year , the temperature between the two nations - which had barely made it above tepid - began rising . us ties vital to france 's eu role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has made no secret of his admiration for the us " sarkozy has decided that french interests are best served by a closer alliance with washington , " said reginald dale , a trans-atlantic relations expert at the center for strategic and international studies in washington .
" sarkozy sees that france can not hope to regain its leadership of europe , which is his aim , if paris is always tagged as anti-american . " sarkozy is the most pro-american french leader in years and arrives in washington this week committed to showing the us that france has moved on from the bitterness caused by the divisions over iraq and that he is a committed european partner . sarkozy determined to be friend of us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and chirac 's falling-out still resonates in washington the french president has already laid the groundwork for a visit which is sure to be full of mutual praise , pledges of support , pumping handshakes and smiles . " the trial has started , i will be a friend of the americans , " the french president said two weeks ago .
" do we agree about everything ?
no , because in a family you can have disagreements .
but we are in the same family .
that is the truth of it . " however , the breakdown in relations under chirac is still fresh in american minds and it will take more than a few warm words to convince the white house of a significant shift in french policy . " washington is not yet sure that it completely trusts sarkozy and is worried by his frenetic hyperactivity , which sometimes makes him look almost unbalanced , " dale said .
" historically , the default mode in us-french relations has been one of abrasiveness and mutual suspicion , and it will take substantial , concrete results to dispel that suspicion . " shared iran stance overshadows differences while there is still tension between the two nations - sarkozy has criticized us environmental policies and the war in iraq - france and the us have found common ground on a number of pressing international issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's iran could face tougher sanctions iran is one subject is likely to top a number of bush 's meetings this week .
washington has leaned toward imposing stricter sanctions against tehran , and bush may find a strong supporter in france as sarkozy has been more willing to pressure iran on the nuclear issue than chirac was . that support could even lead to a shift in future discussions over the iranian nuclear program . sarkozy setting the agenda for europe " the fact that sarkozy arrives -lsb- before merkel on friday -rsb- could influence how subsequent talks on iran progress , " said sandra herbinger of the international transatlantic relations council .
" what he and bush discuss on iran will put huge pressure on those who follow , particularly merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel may have to follow sarkozy 's lead on iran " with france leading on this , germany will have to accept that it is not the only key partner for the united states in europe and that sarkozy 's is the lead europe will be encouraged to follow , " she added . analysts said that since gordon brown replaced tony blair as british prime minister , sarkozy has become a central player for washington , something the french president 's opponents have also noted . before moving into the elysee palace , sarkozy was accused by the socialist party as being " bush 's poodle " - a term often used by opposition politicians in the uk to describe blair .
since being elected , sarkozy has continued to face suspicion for his apparent desire to side with a deeply unpopular us president . " sarkozy can certainly strengthen french bonds with washington , though he will take care not to look subservient , but he can not hope to replace the ' special relationship ' between the us and britain , " dale said .

his talks with us president bush could alter the current state of trans-atlantic relations . while both french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel are traveling to washington this week with important business to discuss , it is sarkozy 's visit on tuesday , nov .
6 , with us president george w. bush that is generating the most interest on both sides of the atlantic . french-us relations , which for decades could be described as cordial at best , took a damaging turn in 2003 when sarkozy 's predecessor , jacques chirac , determinedly opposed the us-led invasion of iraq .
after chirac stepped down as president earlier this year , the temperature between the two nations - which had barely made it above tepid - began rising . us ties vital to france 's eu role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has made no secret of his admiration for the us " sarkozy has decided that french interests are best served by a closer alliance with washington , " said reginald dale , a trans-atlantic relations expert at the center for strategic and international studies in washington .
" sarkozy sees that france can not hope to regain its leadership of europe , which is his aim , if paris is always tagged as anti-american . " sarkozy is the most pro-american french leader in years and arrives in washington this week committed to showing the us that france has moved on from the bitterness caused by the divisions over iraq and that he is a committed european partner . sarkozy determined to be friend of us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and chirac 's falling-out still resonates in washington the french president has already laid the groundwork for a visit which is sure to be full of mutual praise , pledges of support , pumping handshakes and smiles . " the trial has started , i will be a friend of the americans , " the french president said two weeks ago .
" do we agree about everything ?
no , because in a family you can have disagreements .
but we are in the same family .
that is the truth of it . " however , the breakdown in relations under chirac is still fresh in american minds and it will take more than a few warm words to convince the white house of a significant shift in french policy . " washington is not yet sure that it completely trusts sarkozy and is worried by his frenetic hyperactivity , which sometimes makes him look almost unbalanced , " dale said .
" historically , the default mode in us-french relations has been one of abrasiveness and mutual suspicion , and it will take substantial , concrete results to dispel that suspicion . " shared iran stance overshadows differences while there is still tension between the two nations - sarkozy has criticized us environmental policies and the war in iraq - france and the us have found common ground on a number of pressing international issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's iran could face tougher sanctions iran is one subject is likely to top a number of bush 's meetings this week .
washington has leaned toward imposing stricter sanctions against tehran , and bush may find a strong supporter in france as sarkozy has been more willing to pressure iran on the nuclear issue than chirac was . that support could even lead to a shift in future discussions over the iranian nuclear program . sarkozy setting the agenda for europe " the fact that sarkozy arrives -lsb- before merkel on friday -rsb- could influence how subsequent talks on iran progress , " said sandra herbinger of the international transatlantic relations council .
" what he and bush discuss on iran will put huge pressure on those who follow , particularly merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel may have to follow sarkozy 's lead on iran " with france leading on this , germany will have to accept that it is not the only key partner for the united states in europe and that sarkozy 's is the lead europe will be encouraged to follow , " she added . analysts said that since gordon brown replaced tony blair as british prime minister , sarkozy has become a central player for washington , something the french president 's opponents have also noted . before moving into the elysee palace , sarkozy was accused by the socialist party as being " bush 's poodle " - a term often used by opposition politicians in the uk to describe blair .
since being elected , sarkozy has continued to face suspicion for his apparent desire to side with a deeply unpopular us president . " sarkozy can certainly strengthen french bonds with washington , though he will take care not to look subservient , but he can not hope to replace the ' special relationship ' between the us and britain , " dale said .
" and almost certainly does n't want to try . " nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" a new european dawn is in the making in serbia . " " i have decided to initial the stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with serbia tomorrow here in brussels , " rehn told reporters on tuesday , upon the issuing of the bloc 's annual enlargement report . however , serbia must turn in alleged war criminals ratko mladic and radovan karadzic before the final signing could occur , rehn added .
prosecution of war crimes from the 1990s balkan conflict has remained a tenuous issue in eu dealings with several of the balkan states . the saa , which has been under negotiation since 2005 , provides a framework of mutual commitments on a wide range of political , trade and economic issues and is intended to culminate in eu membership negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian-serb general ratko mladic is wanted for war crimes committed in the 1990s serbia will be the third of the former yugoslav republics to enter into a stabilization and association agreement with the european union , following macedonia in 2004 and croatia in 2005 . in addition to serbia , albania , bosnia , and montenegro hope to be declared formal eu accession candidates in the coming years . the eu 's report , however , pointed out that has been " steady , though uneven progress in the western balkans -lrb- toward membership -rrb- and the region continues to face major challenges . "
the implementation of judicial reforms and the fight against corruption and organized crime are key areas that continue to need addressing , according to the report . croatia is likely to be next eu member the european commission also said in its annual report that croatia 's bid for eu membership is on track , but that more progress is needed . " the commission expects substantial progress ... in the course of the year ahead , provided that the country maintains the necessary reform momentum and meets the conditions , " the report said . improvement is particularly needed in the judicial and administrative reform , minority rights , refugee return and the restructuring of the steel and shipbuilding industries , according to the report .
the prosecution of war criminals was also emphasized . " many crimes remain unprosecuted , often due to a combination of a lack of evidence , unwillingness of witnesses to come forward and less than proactive approach of police and prosecutors , " the eu report said . croatia started accession talks with the bloc in 2005 , along with turkey , and , according to eu diplomats , is the only country likely to join in the next five years . eu slams rights situation in turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu particularly criticized turkey 's treatment of its kurdish minority turkey is progressing too slowly , said rehn on tuesday . " it 's simply not acceptable that writers , journalists and other citizens are persecuted in a european democracy for critically and non-violently expressing their opinions , " he said of the situation in turkey . the eu 's report did not go into detail on the current political and military tension between turkey and kurdish militants in iraq . after two years of accession talks , the country still has to improve minority rights , amend a law restricting the freedom of speech and press , normalize relations with cyprus and move ahead with other reforms before it can join the eu , according to the enlargement report . ankara on tuesday pledged to step up the pace of its reforms . " our commitment to completing our shortcomings and efficiently implementing the reforms on the ground is not decreasing - on the contrary it is increasing , " a foreign ministry statement said .
" we are determined to pursue reform until our country catches up with the highest levels of democracy and human rights . " turkey also said its accession process should not be " shaped in line with the preferences of the political leaders of some member states . " politicians in a number of european capitals , including paris and berlin , have come out against full membership for turkey in the 27-member bloc . while officially sticking to the european line of potential accession for turkey , german chancellor angela merkel has long said she is in favor of offering the country a " privileged partnership .

germany 's bad service in shops and administrative offices may be the bane of consumers , but it was a boon for crime prevention in one case .
a bank robber who met the icy attitude of a teller turned tail and fled . entering a german shop or office is often an exercise in steeling oneself up for the worst .
the personnel behind the counter or desk generally seem to have trained in the fine art of negativity and , while often less than competent in their jobs , are world-class when it comes to avoiding eye contact , heaving big sighs when asked anything or becoming petulant when the customer does not have exact change . if customers have not erected psychological steel walls around themselves before encountering this wide-spread attitude , leaving a place of business can often be accompanied by tears or seething anger . one would-be bank robber , who it is assumed is familiar with germany 's service culture , thought the gun might be more powerful against the disposition , but he was oh-so-wrong . according to police , a young man entered a bank in the town of arnstadt , pistol in hand , and put a note in front of a teller that demanded cash .
the woman , surely drawing on what she knew best , even in a time of crisis , simply ignored the gun , the note and the man - completely . although he stood there for a while , her icy disregard soon disarmed him mentally .
he lost his nerve and fled , realizing that even with a gun , he had no chance against the teller 's steely attitude . police are still searching for the man , thought to be between 20 and 25 years of age .

the personnel behind the counter or desk generally seem to have trained in the fine art of negativity and , while often less than competent in their jobs , are world-class when it comes to avoiding eye contact , heaving big sighs when asked anything or becoming petulant when the customer does not have exact change . if customers have not erected psychological steel walls around themselves before encountering this wide-spread attitude , leaving a place of business can often be accompanied by tears or seething anger . one would-be bank robber , who it is assumed is familiar with germany 's service culture , thought the gun might be more powerful against the disposition , but he was oh-so-wrong . according to police , a young man entered a bank in the town of arnstadt , pistol in hand , and put a note in front of a teller that demanded cash .
the woman , surely drawing on what she knew best , even in a time of crisis , simply ignored the gun , the note and the man - completely . although he stood there for a while , her icy disregard soon disarmed him mentally .
he lost his nerve and fled , realizing that even with a gun , he had no chance against the teller 's steely attitude . police are still searching for the man , thought to be between 20 and 25 years of age .
he is no doubt still shaking for that sub-zero blast of bad customer service , but on the positive side , it might have turned him off a future life of crime . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

6 , to overcome rifts with neighbors germany and russia and restore trust in warsaw that has been strained by the defeated conservatives . at a news conference organized for poland 's foreign press corps , donald tusk addressed several issues that will be at the top of his foreign agenda as he takes office , including repairing strained ties berlin and brussels . " poland 's priorities in its relations with its neighbors and with the european union have remained stable since 1989 , " tusk told reporters .
" the past two years did not really change these priorities but the way of doing things was not very effective in achieving poland 's goals . " tusk 's civic platform beat the ruling law and justice party of identical twins president lech kaczynski and prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski in a snap election on oct .
21 , ending two years of conservative rule . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , right , hands his resignation documents to his twin brother president lech kaczynski the fact that tusk held such a conference is seen by many as a sign of his intention to change the status quo : neither of the kaczynskis ever held such an event . jaroslaw kaczynski resigned on monday and lech kaczynski , whose presidential term runs until 2010 , is set to appoint tusk as prime minister by the end of the week . the kaczynskis had a reputation for quarreling with fellow leaders of the 27-nation eu - notably germany , as the twins revived the specter of world war ii to accuse berlin of trying to dominate europe .
the brothers argued they were simply defending poland 's interests in the eu , which warsaw had joined in 2004 . get along with the neighbors tusk said mending fences with germany would be a key goal in the early days of his government . " i would like relations to get back to the level that we saw in the early 1990s , when the treaties were signed and symbolic meetings took place , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk , left , takes an oath during the first session of the new polish parliament he was referring to accords which fixed the polish-german frontier , and landmark talks between then german chancellor helmut kohl and polish prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki , who was the first pole to hold the position after the fall of communism in 1989 . " relations between poland and germany do n't need a radical breakthrough , but rather an increase in mutual trust , " said tusk , a member of poland 's kashubian minority over whose baltic coast territory poles and germans had battled for centuries . the kaczynskis had fiercely opposed germany 's plans to establish a documentation center focusing on the germans who were expelled from eastern europe , and notably poland , after the region 's borders were changed after world war ii . tusk signaled his openness to the plan : " the center should be based on historical truth .
a reasonable commemoration of the expellees will have the approval of the government , " he said . new eu attitude fellow eu leaders barely disguised their relief last month at the conservatives ' defeat , and tusk also reaffirmed that he wants to repair relations with the rest of the bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is hoping for a 180-degree turn from poland " we are the most pro-european party in poland , " said tusk , who is to meet european commission president jose manuel barroso in warsaw on thursday . the polish prime minister in waiting also looked east said he also wanted to repair frosty ties with russia , pledging " an effort to build trust on both sides . " differences between warsaw and moscow have caused " more tension than necessary " over the past two years , tusk said .
but he added russia should still accept that poland has friendly ties with the former soviet republics of ukraine and georgia , whose pro-western leaders have fallen foul of moscow . us missile shield tusk also signaled a change of tone in relations with the united states , reaffirming that warsaw plans to pull polish troops out of iraq next year and would drive a harder bargain in talks on locating missiles in poland as part of a planned us defense shield . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel and the kaczynskis had their differences " if we are to increase us security , we should expect a financial contribution to increase polish security , " he said . but poland 's decision on the missile shield is likely to upset at least one set of leaders he said he want to warm up to .
while the us has said a base in poland is essential to the shield 's operations , several eu countries have expressed concerns over the plan and russia is vehemently against it . " if we decide that missile defense will unambiguously increase poland 's security , then we will be open to negotiations , " tusk said , keeping his options open . later tuesday , tusk met with president kaczynski for talks that focused on poland 's future coalition government and missile defense negotiations with the us .
tusk played down any differences on missile defense between himself and the president , who plays a large role in poland 's foreign policy . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

his talks with us president bush could alter the current state of trans-atlantic relations . while both french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel are traveling to washington this week with important business to discuss , it is sarkozy 's visit on tuesday , nov .
6 , with us president george w. bush that is generating the most interest on both sides of the atlantic . french-us relations , which for decades could be described as cordial at best , took a damaging turn in 2003 when sarkozy 's predecessor , jacques chirac , determinedly opposed the us-led invasion of iraq .
after chirac stepped down as president earlier this year , the temperature between the two nations - which had barely made it above tepid - began rising . us ties vital to france 's eu role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has made no secret of his admiration for the us " sarkozy has decided that french interests are best served by a closer alliance with washington , " said reginald dale , a trans-atlantic relations expert at the center for strategic and international studies in washington .
" sarkozy sees that france can not hope to regain its leadership of europe , which is his aim , if paris is always tagged as anti-american . " sarkozy is the most pro-american french leader in years and arrives in washington this week committed to showing the us that france has moved on from the bitterness caused by the divisions over iraq and that he is a committed european partner . sarkozy determined to be friend of us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and chirac 's falling-out still resonates in washington the french president has already laid the groundwork for a visit which is sure to be full of mutual praise , pledges of support , pumping handshakes and smiles . " the trial has started , i will be a friend of the americans , " the french president said two weeks ago .
" do we agree about everything ?
no , because in a family you can have disagreements .
but we are in the same family .
that is the truth of it . " however , the breakdown in relations under chirac is still fresh in american minds and it will take more than a few warm words to convince the white house of a significant shift in french policy . " washington is not yet sure that it completely trusts sarkozy and is worried by his frenetic hyperactivity , which sometimes makes him look almost unbalanced , " dale said .
" historically , the default mode in us-french relations has been one of abrasiveness and mutual suspicion , and it will take substantial , concrete results to dispel that suspicion . " shared iran stance overshadows differences while there is still tension between the two nations - sarkozy has criticized us environmental policies and the war in iraq - france and the us have found common ground on a number of pressing international issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's iran could face tougher sanctions iran is one subject is likely to top a number of bush 's meetings this week .
washington has leaned toward imposing stricter sanctions against tehran , and bush may find a strong supporter in france as sarkozy has been more willing to pressure iran on the nuclear issue than chirac was . that support could even lead to a shift in future discussions over the iranian nuclear program . sarkozy setting the agenda for europe " the fact that sarkozy arrives -lsb- before merkel on friday -rsb- could influence how subsequent talks on iran progress , " said sandra herbinger of the international transatlantic relations council .
" what he and bush discuss on iran will put huge pressure on those who follow , particularly merkel . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel may have to follow sarkozy 's lead on iran " with france leading on this , germany will have to accept that it is not the only key partner for the united states in europe and that sarkozy 's is the lead europe will be encouraged to follow , " she added . analysts said that since gordon brown replaced tony blair as british prime minister , sarkozy has become a central player for washington , something the french president 's opponents have also noted . before moving into the elysee palace , sarkozy was accused by the socialist party as being " bush 's poodle " - a term often used by opposition politicians in the uk to describe blair .
since being elected , sarkozy has continued to face suspicion for his apparent desire to side with a deeply unpopular us president . " sarkozy can certainly strengthen french bonds with washington , though he will take care not to look subservient , but he can not hope to replace the ' special relationship ' between the us and britain , " dale said .

" a new european dawn is in the making in serbia . " " i have decided to initial the stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with serbia tomorrow here in brussels , " rehn told reporters on tuesday , upon the issuing of the bloc 's annual enlargement report . however , serbia must turn in alleged war criminals ratko mladic and radovan karadzic before the final signing could occur , rehn added .
prosecution of war crimes from the 1990s balkan conflict has remained a tenuous issue in eu dealings with several of the balkan states . the saa , which has been under negotiation since 2005 , provides a framework of mutual commitments on a wide range of political , trade and economic issues and is intended to culminate in eu membership negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian-serb general ratko mladic is wanted for war crimes committed in the 1990s serbia will be the third of the former yugoslav republics to enter into a stabilization and association agreement with the european union , following macedonia in 2004 and croatia in 2005 . in addition to serbia , albania , bosnia , and montenegro hope to be declared formal eu accession candidates in the coming years . the eu 's report , however , pointed out that has been " steady , though uneven progress in the western balkans -lrb- toward membership -rrb- and the region continues to face major challenges . "
the implementation of judicial reforms and the fight against corruption and organized crime are key areas that continue to need addressing , according to the report . croatia is likely to be next eu member the european commission also said in its annual report that croatia 's bid for eu membership is on track , but that more progress is needed . " the commission expects substantial progress ... in the course of the year ahead , provided that the country maintains the necessary reform momentum and meets the conditions , " the report said . improvement is particularly needed in the judicial and administrative reform , minority rights , refugee return and the restructuring of the steel and shipbuilding industries , according to the report .
the prosecution of war criminals was also emphasized . " many crimes remain unprosecuted , often due to a combination of a lack of evidence , unwillingness of witnesses to come forward and less than proactive approach of police and prosecutors , " the eu report said . croatia started accession talks with the bloc in 2005 , along with turkey , and , according to eu diplomats , is the only country likely to join in the next five years . eu slams rights situation in turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu particularly criticized turkey 's treatment of its kurdish minority turkey is progressing too slowly , said rehn on tuesday . " it 's simply not acceptable that writers , journalists and other citizens are persecuted in a european democracy for critically and non-violently expressing their opinions , " he said of the situation in turkey . the eu 's report did not go into detail on the current political and military tension between turkey and kurdish militants in iraq . after two years of accession talks , the country still has to improve minority rights , amend a law restricting the freedom of speech and press , normalize relations with cyprus and move ahead with other reforms before it can join the eu , according to the enlargement report . ankara on tuesday pledged to step up the pace of its reforms . " our commitment to completing our shortcomings and efficiently implementing the reforms on the ground is not decreasing - on the contrary it is increasing , " a foreign ministry statement said .
" we are determined to pursue reform until our country catches up with the highest levels of democracy and human rights . " turkey also said its accession process should not be " shaped in line with the preferences of the political leaders of some member states . " politicians in a number of european capitals , including paris and berlin , have come out against full membership for turkey in the 27-member bloc . while officially sticking to the european line of potential accession for turkey , german chancellor angela merkel has long said she is in favor of offering the country a " privileged partnership .

germany 's bad service in shops and administrative offices may be the bane of consumers , but it was a boon for crime prevention in one case .
a bank robber who met the icy attitude of a teller turned tail and fled . entering a german shop or office is often an exercise in steeling oneself up for the worst .
the personnel behind the counter or desk generally seem to have trained in the fine art of negativity and , while often less than competent in their jobs , are world-class when it comes to avoiding eye contact , heaving big sighs when asked anything or becoming petulant when the customer does not have exact change . if customers have not erected psychological steel walls around themselves before encountering this wide-spread attitude , leaving a place of business can often be accompanied by tears or seething anger . one would-be bank robber , who it is assumed is familiar with germany 's service culture , thought the gun might be more powerful against the disposition , but he was oh-so-wrong . according to police , a young man entered a bank in the town of arnstadt , pistol in hand , and put a note in front of a teller that demanded cash .
the woman , surely drawing on what she knew best , even in a time of crisis , simply ignored the gun , the note and the man - completely . although he stood there for a while , her icy disregard soon disarmed him mentally .
he lost his nerve and fled , realizing that even with a gun , he had no chance against the teller 's steely attitude . police are still searching for the man , thought to be between 20 and 25 years of age .

6 , to overcome rifts with neighbors germany and russia and restore trust in warsaw that has been strained by the defeated conservatives . at a news conference organized for poland 's foreign press corps , donald tusk addressed several issues that will be at the top of his foreign agenda as he takes office , including repairing strained ties berlin and brussels . " poland 's priorities in its relations with its neighbors and with the european union have remained stable since 1989 , " tusk told reporters .
" the past two years did not really change these priorities but the way of doing things was not very effective in achieving poland 's goals . " tusk 's civic platform beat the ruling law and justice party of identical twins president lech kaczynski and prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski in a snap election on oct .
21 , ending two years of conservative rule . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : prime minister jaroslaw kaczynski , right , hands his resignation documents to his twin brother president lech kaczynski the fact that tusk held such a conference is seen by many as a sign of his intention to change the status quo : neither of the kaczynskis ever held such an event . jaroslaw kaczynski resigned on monday and lech kaczynski , whose presidential term runs until 2010 , is set to appoint tusk as prime minister by the end of the week . the kaczynskis had a reputation for quarreling with fellow leaders of the 27-nation eu - notably germany , as the twins revived the specter of world war ii to accuse berlin of trying to dominate europe .
the brothers argued they were simply defending poland 's interests in the eu , which warsaw had joined in 2004 . get along with the neighbors tusk said mending fences with germany would be a key goal in the early days of his government . " i would like relations to get back to the level that we saw in the early 1990s , when the treaties were signed and symbolic meetings took place , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : donald tusk , left , takes an oath during the first session of the new polish parliament he was referring to accords which fixed the polish-german frontier , and landmark talks between then german chancellor helmut kohl and polish prime minister tadeusz mazowiecki , who was the first pole to hold the position after the fall of communism in 1989 . " relations between poland and germany do n't need a radical breakthrough , but rather an increase in mutual trust , " said tusk , a member of poland 's kashubian minority over whose baltic coast territory poles and germans had battled for centuries . the kaczynskis had fiercely opposed germany 's plans to establish a documentation center focusing on the germans who were expelled from eastern europe , and notably poland , after the region 's borders were changed after world war ii . tusk signaled his openness to the plan : " the center should be based on historical truth .
a reasonable commemoration of the expellees will have the approval of the government , " he said . new eu attitude fellow eu leaders barely disguised their relief last month at the conservatives ' defeat , and tusk also reaffirmed that he wants to repair relations with the rest of the bloc . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu is hoping for a 180-degree turn from poland " we are the most pro-european party in poland , " said tusk , who is to meet european commission president jose manuel barroso in warsaw on thursday . the polish prime minister in waiting also looked east said he also wanted to repair frosty ties with russia , pledging " an effort to build trust on both sides . " differences between warsaw and moscow have caused " more tension than necessary " over the past two years , tusk said .
but he added russia should still accept that poland has friendly ties with the former soviet republics of ukraine and georgia , whose pro-western leaders have fallen foul of moscow . us missile shield tusk also signaled a change of tone in relations with the united states , reaffirming that warsaw plans to pull polish troops out of iraq next year and would drive a harder bargain in talks on locating missiles in poland as part of a planned us defense shield . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chancellor merkel and the kaczynskis had their differences " if we are to increase us security , we should expect a financial contribution to increase polish security , " he said . but poland 's decision on the missile shield is likely to upset at least one set of leaders he said he want to warm up to .
while the us has said a base in poland is essential to the shield 's operations , several eu countries have expressed concerns over the plan and russia is vehemently against it . " if we decide that missile defense will unambiguously increase poland 's security , then we will be open to negotiations , " tusk said , keeping his options open . later tuesday , tusk met with president kaczynski for talks that focused on poland 's future coalition government and missile defense negotiations with the us .
tusk played down any differences on missile defense between himself and the president , who plays a large role in poland 's foreign policy . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the wording of this definition is clearly likely to result in the criminalization of the expression of political views ... even if that expression does not in any way include the advocacy of terrorism to support those opinions , " it said in a statement .
" this proposal could even be counter-productive , radicalizing others who share those beliefs and increasing rather than decreasing the number of violent terrorists in the eu .

" a new european dawn is in the making in serbia . " " i have decided to initial the stabilization and association agreement -lrb- saa -rrb- with serbia tomorrow here in brussels , " rehn told reporters on tuesday , upon the issuing of the bloc 's annual enlargement report . however , serbia must turn in alleged war criminals ratko mladic and radovan karadzic before the final signing could occur , rehn added .
prosecution of war crimes from the 1990s balkan conflict has remained a tenuous issue in eu dealings with several of the balkan states . the saa , which has been under negotiation since 2005 , provides a framework of mutual commitments on a wide range of political , trade and economic issues and is intended to culminate in eu membership negotiations . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bosnian-serb general ratko mladic is wanted for war crimes committed in the 1990s serbia will be the third of the former yugoslav republics to enter into a stabilization and association agreement with the european union , following macedonia in 2004 and croatia in 2005 . in addition to serbia , albania , bosnia , and montenegro hope to be declared formal eu accession candidates in the coming years . the eu 's report , however , pointed out that has been " steady , though uneven progress in the western balkans -lrb- toward membership -rrb- and the region continues to face major challenges . "
the implementation of judicial reforms and the fight against corruption and organized crime are key areas that continue to need addressing , according to the report . croatia is likely to be next eu member the european commission also said in its annual report that croatia 's bid for eu membership is on track , but that more progress is needed . " the commission expects substantial progress ... in the course of the year ahead , provided that the country maintains the necessary reform momentum and meets the conditions , " the report said . improvement is particularly needed in the judicial and administrative reform , minority rights , refugee return and the restructuring of the steel and shipbuilding industries , according to the report .
the prosecution of war criminals was also emphasized . " many crimes remain unprosecuted , often due to a combination of a lack of evidence , unwillingness of witnesses to come forward and less than proactive approach of police and prosecutors , " the eu report said . croatia started accession talks with the bloc in 2005 , along with turkey , and , according to eu diplomats , is the only country likely to join in the next five years . eu slams rights situation in turkey bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu particularly criticized turkey 's treatment of its kurdish minority turkey is progressing too slowly , said rehn on tuesday . " it 's simply not acceptable that writers , journalists and other citizens are persecuted in a european democracy for critically and non-violently expressing their opinions , " he said of the situation in turkey . the eu 's report did not go into detail on the current political and military tension between turkey and kurdish militants in iraq . after two years of accession talks , the country still has to improve minority rights , amend a law restricting the freedom of speech and press , normalize relations with cyprus and move ahead with other reforms before it can join the eu , according to the enlargement report . ankara on tuesday pledged to step up the pace of its reforms . " our commitment to completing our shortcomings and efficiently implementing the reforms on the ground is not decreasing - on the contrary it is increasing , " a foreign ministry statement said .
" we are determined to pursue reform until our country catches up with the highest levels of democracy and human rights . " turkey also said its accession process should not be " shaped in line with the preferences of the political leaders of some member states . " politicians in a number of european capitals , including paris and berlin , have come out against full membership for turkey in the 27-member bloc . while officially sticking to the european line of potential accession for turkey , german chancellor angela merkel has long said she is in favor of offering the country a " privileged partnership .

that leaves an ever smaller fleet to fly soldiers to and from afghanistan . the handelsblatt quoted aviation industry sources as saying that corrosion and wear and tear have turned over half of germany 's transall planes into decrepit machinery .
the sources apparently said that it was becoming more difficult to locate spare parts for the planes , some of which are more than 40 years old . the paper also reported that a number of planes have been grounded due to rust problems and some are beyond repair . the german defense ministy has partially denied the report , the handelsblatt wrote . " unknown number " in repair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a transall at ramstein base in germany germany currently has 83 transall planes in deployment .
the defense ministry said that 70 percent of the planes are always ready for action , as nato dictates .
the ministry said that an " unknown number " of planes were currently undergoing repairs . germany had originally planned to replace the remaining transall planes with airbus ' new a400m model by 2014 , but that schedule may have to be revised due to recently announced delays in delivery . the german government has ordered 60 of the airbus models at a cost of 8.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.4 billion -rrb- . until they are delivered , the transalls remain the sole military transporters , and must run flights to the balkans and afghanistan .

his talks with us president bush could alter the current state of trans-atlantic relations . while both french president nicolas sarkozy and german chancellor angela merkel are traveling to washington this week with important business to discuss , it is sarkozy 's visit on tuesday , nov .
6 , with us president george w. bush that is generating the most interest on both sides of the atlantic . french-us relations , which for decades could be described as cordial at best , took a damaging turn in 2003 when sarkozy 's predecessor , jacques chirac , determinedly opposed the us-led invasion of iraq .
after chirac stepped down as president earlier this year , the temperature between the two nations - which had barely made it above tepid - began rising . us ties vital to france 's eu role bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : sarkozy has made no secret of his admiration for the us " sarkozy has decided that french interests are best served by a closer alliance with washington , " said reginald dale , a trans-atlantic relations expert at the center for strategic and international studies in washington .
" sarkozy sees that france can not hope to regain its leadership of europe , which is his aim , if paris is always tagged as anti-american . " sarkozy is the most pro-american french leader in years and arrives in washington this week committed to showing the us that france has moved on from the bitterness caused by the divisions over iraq and that he is a committed european partner . sarkozy determined to be friend of us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bush and chirac 's falling-out still resonates in washington the french president has already laid the groundwork for a visit which is sure to be full of mutual praise , pledges of support , pumping handshakes and smiles . " the trial has started , i will be a friend of the americans , " the french president said two weeks ago .
" do we agree about everything ?
no , because in a family you can have disagreements .
but we are in the same family .
that is the truth of it . " however , the breakdown in relations under chirac is still fresh in american minds and it will take more than a few warm words to convince the white house of a significant shift in french policy . " washington is not yet sure that it completely trusts sarkozy and is worried by his frenetic hyperactivity , which sometimes makes him look almost unbalanced , " dale said .
" historically , the default mode in us-french relations has been one of abrasiveness and mutual suspicion , and it will take substantial , concrete results to dispel that suspicion . " shared iran stance overshadows differences while there is still tension between the two nations - sarkozy has criticized us environmental policies and the war in iraq - france and the us have found common ground on a number of pressing international issues . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ahmadinejad 's iran could face tougher sanctions iran is one subject is likely to top a number of bush 's meetings this week .

since being elected , sarkozy has continued to face suspicion for his apparent desire to side with a deeply unpopular us president .

that leaves an ever smaller fleet to fly soldiers to and from afghanistan . the handelsblatt quoted aviation industry sources as saying that corrosion and wear and tear have turned over half of germany 's transall planes into decrepit machinery .
the sources apparently said that it was becoming more difficult to locate spare parts for the planes , some of which are more than 40 years old . the paper also reported that a number of planes have been grounded due to rust problems and some are beyond repair . the german defense ministy has partially denied the report , the handelsblatt wrote . " unknown number " in repair bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a transall at ramstein base in germany germany currently has 83 transall planes in deployment .
the defense ministry said that 70 percent of the planes are always ready for action , as nato dictates .
the ministry said that an " unknown number " of planes were currently undergoing repairs . germany had originally planned to replace the remaining transall planes with airbus ' new a400m model by 2014 , but that schedule may have to be revised due to recently announced delays in delivery . the german government has ordered 60 of the airbus models at a cost of 8.6 billion euros -lrb- $ 12.4 billion -rrb- . until they are delivered , the transalls remain the sole military transporters , and must run flights to the balkans and afghanistan .

current ultraviolet light laser treatments can kill micro-organisms - but can not be used in humans as they would also damage cells in the body .
but using infrared femtosecond lasers with carefully selected wavelengths , a us team targeted viruses and bacteria without harming other cells .
the arizona research is reported in the journal of physics : condensed matters .
the technology is called impulsive stimulated raman scattering -lrb- isrs -rrb- .
it produces lethal vibrations in the protein coat of micro-organisms , thereby destroying them .
the effect of the vibrations is similar to that of high-pitched noise shattering glass .
however , the line of attack can be perfected so that the proteins which coat human cells remain unaffected .
so far experiments have been done on e. coli bacterial cells , tobacco mosaic virus cells , as well as human and hamster cells .
after several attempts , the researchers found a level which " inactivates both viruses and bacteria while leaving sensitive materials such as mammalian cells unharmed " .
lead researcher professor kong-thon tsen , of arizona state university , said : " the research so far suggests that isrs will be ready for use in disinfection and could provide treatments against some of the worst , often drug-resistant , bacterial and viral pathogens . "

current ultraviolet light laser treatments can kill micro-organisms - but can not be used in humans as they would also damage cells in the body .
but using infrared femtosecond lasers with carefully selected wavelengths , a us team targeted viruses and bacteria without harming other cells .
the arizona research is reported in the journal of physics : condensed matters .
the technology is called impulsive stimulated raman scattering -lrb- isrs -rrb- .
it produces lethal vibrations in the protein coat of micro-organisms , thereby destroying them .
the effect of the vibrations is similar to that of high-pitched noise shattering glass .
however , the line of attack can be perfected so that the proteins which coat human cells remain unaffected .
so far experiments have been done on e. coli bacterial cells , tobacco mosaic virus cells , as well as human and hamster cells .
after several attempts , the researchers found a level which " inactivates both viruses and bacteria while leaving sensitive materials such as mammalian cells unharmed " .

she is in hiding - wanted by the israeli authorities for being an illegal immigrant , and by the criminal gangs who brought her here to sell her into prostitution .
marina - not her real name - was lured to israel by human traffickers .
during the height of the phenomenon , from the beginning of the 1990s to the early years of 2000 , an estimated 3,000 women a year were brought to israel on the false promise of jobs and a better way of life .
" when i was in the ukraine , i had a difficult life , " said marina , who came to israel in 1999 at the age of 33 after answering a newspaper advertisement offering the opportunity to study abroad .
" i was taken to an apartment in ashkelon , and other women there told me i was now in prostitution .
i became hysterical , but a guy starting hitting me and then others there raped me .
" i was then taken to a place where they sold me - just sold me ! " she said , recalling how she was locked in a windowless basement for a month , drank water from a toilet and was deprived of food .

last year , the united nations named israel as one of the main destinations in the world for trafficked women ; it has also consistently appeared as an offender in the annual us state department 's trafficking in persons -lrb- tip -rrb- report .
while this year 's report said israel was making " significant efforts " to eliminate trafficking , it said it still does not " fully comply with the minimum standards " to do so .
like marina , some trafficked women are brought into the country legally , while others are smuggled by bedouins across the border from egypt .
in all cases , the traffickers - as many as 20 in the chain from recruitment to sale - take away the women 's passports before selling them on to pimps .
sometimes the women are subjected to degrading human auctions , where they are stripped , examined and sold for $ 8,000- $ 10,000 .
sanctions threat prostitution in israel is legal , but pimping and maintaining a brothel are not .
the law however is not widely enforced and few brothels are closed down .
brothels are illegal in israel , but many still operate openly in tel aviv 's neve shaanan district for instance , just a short walk from the city 's five-star tourist hotels , brothels masquerading as massage parlours , saunas and even internet cafes , fill the side streets .
one such place even operates opposite the local police station .
there are bars on windows and heavily-built men guard the doors , which are only opened to let customers in and out .
inside , groups of sullen-looking women sit in dimly-lit rooms , waiting for their next client .
foreign women fetch the highest prices , with trafficked women forced to work up to 18 hours a day .
for years , the absence of anti-trafficking laws in israel meant such activity - less risky and often more profitable than trafficking drugs or arms - went unchecked .
" during the first 10 years of trafficking , israel did absolutely nothing , " said nomi levenkron , of the migrant workers ' hotline , an ngo which helps trafficked women and puts pressure on the state to act .
in 2003 we used to find women who were being raped , jailed and under a great amount of violence .
in 2007 , the situation is completely different .
raanan caspi israeli anti-trafficking police chief " women were trafficked into israel - the first case we uncovered was in 1992 - and not much really happened , " she said .
" occasionally traffickers were brought to trial , but the victims were arrested as well , they were forced to testify , and then they were deported . "
in 2000 , trafficking for sexual exploitation was made a crime but the punishments were light and its implementation was poor , ngos say .
it was only after repeated criticism of israel by the united states - and the threat of sanctions - that authorities began to act .
investigations into suspected traffickers increased , stiff jail terms were handed down and israel 's borders were tightened against people smuggling .
changing tactics campaigners say things began to change for the better in 2004 , when the government opened a shelter in north tel aviv for women who had been trafficked for sex .
it marked a change in the way the state perceived them - as victims of a crime rather than accomplices .
there are some 30 women at the maggan shelter - most from former soviet states , but also five from china .
for years , israel treated trafficked women as criminals " when they come here they are in a bad condition , " said rinat davidovich , the shelter 's director .
" most have sexual diseases and some have hepatitis and even tuberculosis .
they also have problems going to sleep because they remember what used to happen to them at night , " she said .
" it 's very hard and it 's a long procedure to start to help and treat them . "
police say their actions have led to a significant drop in the number of women now being trafficked into israel for sex - hundreds , rather than thousands , a year - and they say the women 's working environment has improved too .
" there is a significant change in the conditions that the women are being held in , " said anti-trafficking police chief raanan caspi .
" in 2003 we used to find women who were being raped , incarcerated and suffering violence .
in 2007 , the situation is completely different - they get paid in most cases and the conditions that they 're in are much more humane . "
now most trafficking occurs through what people like to call discreet apartments and escort agencies yedida wolfe task force on human trafficking but the true picture might not be so clear-cut .
campaigners say increased police activity has also had an adverse effect .
instead of operating openly in brothels , traffickers have become more discreet , plying their trade in private apartments and escort agencies , making the practice more difficult to detect .
" we 've been keeping tabs on trends , in terms of , for instance , prices of exploitative services , " said yedida wolfe , of the task force on human trafficking .
" those prices have not gone up , which leads us to believe that the supply of victims has not gone down .
" while government officials are saying that their efforts have drastically cut the number of victims in the country , the ngos on the scene really do n't feel that 's true . "
israel might well have turned a corner in its fight against the traffickers , but the battle is far from won .

last year , the united nations named israel as one of the main destinations in the world for trafficked women ; it has also consistently appeared as an offender in the annual us state department 's trafficking in persons -lrb- tip -rrb- report .
while this year 's report said israel was making " significant efforts " to eliminate trafficking , it said it still does not " fully comply with the minimum standards " to do so .
like marina , some trafficked women are brought into the country legally , while others are smuggled by bedouins across the border from egypt .
in all cases , the traffickers - as many as 20 in the chain from recruitment to sale - take away the women 's passports before selling them on to pimps .
sometimes the women are subjected to degrading human auctions , where they are stripped , examined and sold for $ 8,000- $ 10,000 .
sanctions threat prostitution in israel is legal , but pimping and maintaining a brothel are not .
the law however is not widely enforced and few brothels are closed down .
brothels are illegal in israel , but many still operate openly in tel aviv 's neve shaanan district for instance , just a short walk from the city 's five-star tourist hotels , brothels masquerading as massage parlours , saunas and even internet cafes , fill the side streets .
one such place even operates opposite the local police station .
there are bars on windows and heavily-built men guard the doors , which are only opened to let customers in and out .
inside , groups of sullen-looking women sit in dimly-lit rooms , waiting for their next client .
foreign women fetch the highest prices , with trafficked women forced to work up to 18 hours a day .
for years , the absence of anti-trafficking laws in israel meant such activity - less risky and often more profitable than trafficking drugs or arms - went unchecked .
" during the first 10 years of trafficking , israel did absolutely nothing , " said nomi levenkron , of the migrant workers ' hotline , an ngo which helps trafficked women and puts pressure on the state to act .
in 2003 we used to find women who were being raped , jailed and under a great amount of violence .
in 2007 , the situation is completely different .
raanan caspi israeli anti-trafficking police chief " women were trafficked into israel - the first case we uncovered was in 1992 - and not much really happened , " she said .
" occasionally traffickers were brought to trial , but the victims were arrested as well , they were forced to testify , and then they were deported . "
in 2000 , trafficking for sexual exploitation was made a crime but the punishments were light and its implementation was poor , ngos say .
it was only after repeated criticism of israel by the united states - and the threat of sanctions - that authorities began to act .
investigations into suspected traffickers increased , stiff jail terms were handed down and israel 's borders were tightened against people smuggling .
changing tactics campaigners say things began to change for the better in 2004 , when the government opened a shelter in north tel aviv for women who had been trafficked for sex .
it marked a change in the way the state perceived them - as victims of a crime rather than accomplices .
there are some 30 women at the maggan shelter - most from former soviet states , but also five from china .
for years , israel treated trafficked women as criminals " when they come here they are in a bad condition , " said rinat davidovich , the shelter 's director .
" most have sexual diseases and some have hepatitis and even tuberculosis .
they also have problems going to sleep because they remember what used to happen to them at night , " she said .
" it 's very hard and it 's a long procedure to start to help and treat them . "
police say their actions have led to a significant drop in the number of women now being trafficked into israel for sex - hundreds , rather than thousands , a year - and they say the women 's working environment has improved too .
" there is a significant change in the conditions that the women are being held in , " said anti-trafficking police chief raanan caspi .
" in 2003 we used to find women who were being raped , incarcerated and suffering violence .
in 2007 , the situation is completely different - they get paid in most cases and the conditions that they 're in are much more humane . "
now most trafficking occurs through what people like to call discreet apartments and escort agencies yedida wolfe task force on human trafficking but the true picture might not be so clear-cut .
campaigners say increased police activity has also had an adverse effect .
instead of operating openly in brothels , traffickers have become more discreet , plying their trade in private apartments and escort agencies , making the practice more difficult to detect .
" we 've been keeping tabs on trends , in terms of , for instance , prices of exploitative services , " said yedida wolfe , of the task force on human trafficking .
" those prices have not gone up , which leads us to believe that the supply of victims has not gone down .
" while government officials are saying that their efforts have drastically cut the number of victims in the country , the ngos on the scene really do n't feel that 's true . "
israel might well have turned a corner in its fight against the traffickers , but the battle is far from won .

she is in hiding - wanted by the israeli authorities for being an illegal immigrant , and by the criminal gangs who brought her here to sell her into prostitution .
marina - not her real name - was lured to israel by human traffickers .
during the height of the phenomenon , from the beginning of the 1990s to the early years of 2000 , an estimated 3,000 women a year were brought to israel on the false promise of jobs and a better way of life .
" when i was in the ukraine , i had a difficult life , " said marina , who came to israel in 1999 at the age of 33 after answering a newspaper advertisement offering the opportunity to study abroad .
" i was taken to an apartment in ashkelon , and other women there told me i was now in prostitution .
i became hysterical , but a guy starting hitting me and then others there raped me .
" i was then taken to a place where they sold me - just sold me ! " she said , recalling how she was locked in a windowless basement for a month , drank water from a toilet and was deprived of food .
main origins of women trafficked to israel russia moldova ukraine uzbekistan belarus us state department trafficking in persons report 2007 -lsb- 22mb -rsb- most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need adobe reader download the reader here that part of her ordeal only ended when she managed to escape , but the physical and mental scars remain .
last year , the united nations named israel as one of the main destinations in the world for trafficked women ; it has also consistently appeared as an offender in the annual us state department 's trafficking in persons -lrb- tip -rrb- report .
while this year 's report said israel was making " significant efforts " to eliminate trafficking , it said it still does not " fully comply with the minimum standards " to do so .
like marina , some trafficked women are brought into the country legally , while others are smuggled by bedouins across the border from egypt .
in all cases , the traffickers - as many as 20 in the chain from recruitment to sale - take away the women 's passports before selling them on to pimps .
sometimes the women are subjected to degrading human auctions , where they are stripped , examined and sold for $ 8,000- $ 10,000 .
sanctions threat prostitution in israel is legal , but pimping and maintaining a brothel are not .
the law however is not widely enforced and few brothels are closed down .
brothels are illegal in israel , but many still operate openly in tel aviv 's neve shaanan district for instance , just a short walk from the city 's five-star tourist hotels , brothels masquerading as massage parlours , saunas and even internet cafes , fill the side streets .
one such place even operates opposite the local police station .
there are bars on windows and heavily-built men guard the doors , which are only opened to let customers in and out .
inside , groups of sullen-looking women sit in dimly-lit rooms , waiting for their next client .
foreign women fetch the highest prices , with trafficked women forced to work up to 18 hours a day .
for years , the absence of anti-trafficking laws in israel meant such activity - less risky and often more profitable than trafficking drugs or arms - went unchecked .
" during the first 10 years of trafficking , israel did absolutely nothing , " said nomi levenkron , of the migrant workers ' hotline , an ngo which helps trafficked women and puts pressure on the state to act .
in 2003 we used to find women who were being raped , jailed and under a great amount of violence .
in 2007 , the situation is completely different .
raanan caspi israeli anti-trafficking police chief " women were trafficked into israel - the first case we uncovered was in 1992 - and not much really happened , " she said .
" occasionally traffickers were brought to trial , but the victims were arrested as well , they were forced to testify , and then they were deported . "
in 2000 , trafficking for sexual exploitation was made a crime but the punishments were light and its implementation was poor , ngos say .
it was only after repeated criticism of israel by the united states - and the threat of sanctions - that authorities began to act .
investigations into suspected traffickers increased , stiff jail terms were handed down and israel 's borders were tightened against people smuggling .
changing tactics campaigners say things began to change for the better in 2004 , when the government opened a shelter in north tel aviv for women who had been trafficked for sex .
it marked a change in the way the state perceived them - as victims of a crime rather than accomplices .
there are some 30 women at the maggan shelter - most from former soviet states , but also five from china .
for years , israel treated trafficked women as criminals " when they come here they are in a bad condition , " said rinat davidovich , the shelter 's director .
" most have sexual diseases and some have hepatitis and even tuberculosis .
they also have problems going to sleep because they remember what used to happen to them at night , " she said .
" it 's very hard and it 's a long procedure to start to help and treat them . "
police say their actions have led to a significant drop in the number of women now being trafficked into israel for sex - hundreds , rather than thousands , a year - and they say the women 's working environment has improved too .
" there is a significant change in the conditions that the women are being held in , " said anti-trafficking police chief raanan caspi .

mr hicks and co-owner george gillett took over when plans for the stadium were well advanced and wanted to satisfy themselves that it was right for the club and the fans .
community windfall about £ 5m of european money had been set aside for a new community partnership centre at the stadium .

a petition seeking such zones is being delivered to downing street by children whose siblings died in crashes .
the government said progress had been made in reducing casualties .
children aged from five to 15 were surveyed by brake in the uk as part of national road safety week .
the youngsters delivering the petition to downing street will be joined by children who have been injured in crashes .
' a disgrace ' brake chief executive mary williams said tv campaigns and local authority measures were not enough .

david jones 's daughter , natalie , from bury in greater manchester , died after she was hit by a car travelling at 61mph in a 30mph zone .
he told bbc radio five live that lower speed limits would help reduce deaths .

road safety minister jim fitzpatrick said child road casualties had fallen dramatically since the 1990s , but " still far too many children are killed or injured on our roads " .
he said the government had introduced a child road safety strategy earlier this year to tackle the problem .
" we are continuing to make progress at reducing casualties across the board , but clearly there is no acceptable level , " mr fitzpatrick said .
brake is also running an online road safety survey seeking parents ' views on what should be done to reduce child road death and injury .

the youngsters delivering the petition to downing street will be joined by children who have been injured in crashes .
' a disgrace ' brake chief executive mary williams said tv campaigns and local authority measures were not enough .
" in a civilised society it is a disgrace that we allow children to die on roads , " ms williams said . "
if a child 's hit at 20 , there 's a good chance they 'll survive ; hit at 40 , they 're nearly dead every time " david jones , whose daughter natalie was killed in a road crash " we will not rest until there are statutory 20mph safety zones around all communities .
this will stop deaths and transform communities . "
david jones 's daughter , natalie , from bury in greater manchester , died after she was hit by a car travelling at 61mph in a 30mph zone .
he told bbc radio five live that lower speed limits would help reduce deaths .
" if a child 's hit at 20 , there 's a good chance they 'll survive ; hit at 40 , they 're nearly dead every time , " mr jones said .
chelsea warner was hit along with two teenage friends outside her school in north london .
speaking before joining the group at downing street , she said : " it was the most frightening thing you can imagine .
one man 's decision to drive dangerously changed our lives forever . "
road safety minister jim fitzpatrick said child road casualties had fallen dramatically since the 1990s , but " still far too many children are killed or injured on our roads " .
he said the government had introduced a child road safety strategy earlier this year to tackle the problem .
" we are continuing to make progress at reducing casualties across the board , but clearly there is no acceptable level , " mr fitzpatrick said .
brake is also running an online road safety survey seeking parents ' views on what should be done to reduce child road death and injury .

the psni is one of 20 police forces involved in an investigation into an italian-based website which sold home-made videos of sex abuse .
already , 92 people have already been detained across eight countries .
the films were mainly produced in ukraine , belgium and the netherlands and most of the victims were ukrainian .
twenty-three children aged between nine and 16 who were shown being abused have been identified .
according to the european police force , europol , the network created videos tailor-made to order of children being abused and sold them to 2,500 customers in 19 countries .
the arrests included not only the network 's operators but also its clients who viewed the explicit images .
europol analyst menno hagemeijer said they had tracked down large numbers of people who had paid to see the videos and photos .
he said pictures were found of children being forced to hold a piece of paper with the name of a ring member .
in the republic of ireland , five searches were carried out during the summer and a number of seized computers are undergoing forensic examination .
the investigation began in july 2006 , when police in australia found a video on the internet showing an adult abusing two young girls .
the girls were identified by police in belgium and the offender , their father , was arrested .
he in turn led investigators to the producer of the video , an italian man who operated in belgium and the netherlands but also owned a studio in ukraine .

andrew marr : now the turnaround in the conservative party 's fortunes coincided with the return to a more traditional emphasis and message , the issues of immigration and europe and taxation .
precisely the ones where david cameron had tried to avoid earlier in his leadership , seem to have given the party a second wind .
now , on immigration the conservatives have called for a grown-up conversation , traditionally difficult area for the party , it 's certainly been brought into focus by one newspaper report this morning in which a conservative candidate suggests that enoch powell was right .
george osborne , shadow chancellor , thank you for coming in to join us .
now , mr. hastilow , if his comments are as reported , and they are after all in an article he 's written , so i presume they are .
what 's his status in the conservative party ?
george osborne : well i do n't agree with what he said .
he 's going to have a meeting later today with our party chairman , my colleague caroline spelman .
he 'll have to explain himself and it will also be explained to him , that candidates of any party , conservative , labour , liberal democrat , have to exercise great caution in the language they use about immigration .
we do need controlled immigration , the conservative party has several policies that would make sure that immigration is controlled , but the debate has to be conducted in a reasonable way , with moderate use of language .
and by the way , this applies to everyone .
this applies to the government itself and the use of figures , and they 've got themselves into a mess this week on this .
it applies to senior politicians .
i think for example phrases like " british jobs for british workers " are particularly nasty and are trying to play to a particular chord .
and of course candidates whether it 's mr. hastilow or anyone else , should be careful in the use of language they have used .
andrew marr : so , he 's not going to be a conservative candidate for much longer , judging by everything you 've just said ?
george osborne : well i 'm not going to pre-judge the meeting he has later today with the party chairman .
andrew marr : ok .
all right .
staying on the immigration issue nonetheless , david cameron and yourself have said there 's too much immigration in this country .
and the figure was going to be , has gone up from something like 47,000 , it 's up to 700,000-800,000 net , at the moment .
do you have a view on where between those two figures the correct amount of immigration should be ?
i mean how much less do you want to see ?
george osborne : well we have a view that immigration should be substantially lower than it is at the moment .
but we are not putting a precise figure on it for exactly the reason we 've just discussed on the previous interview you had with peter hain .
we 're not going to use arbitrary figures , we think it should be substantially lower , and we 've set out the way that that can be achieved .
i mean , by the way , this is in the context of demographic change , a growth in the population of the united kingdom caused by immigration , but also caused by higher birth rates and increased life expectancy .
all of which puts pressure on public services , on schools and hospitals and our transport system , and so on .
so in the context of that we think immigration should be substantially lower .
now there are certain elements of immigration which we can not control , for legal reasons / andrew marr : from the eu ?
george osborne : for example from the eu .
however we can ensure that new eu countries that join have transition arrangements and we proposed this for bulgaria and romania , and i 'm delighted the government have followed our lead on that .
but there is also non-eu economic migration and that can be controlled , and we would set an annual limit which would be agreed amongst , for example , the local authorities , talk to business organisations and so on .
and that is an element where the government can exercise control and indeed can enforce that control through a border police .
andrew marr : so , despite the moderate language and the care all round that does mean fewer black and asian people coming into this country , does n't it ?
george osborne : well i do n't accept it 's a race issue at all .
indeed trevor phillips , the new head of the equality commission said that david cameron 's speech had been the first time he had heard for a long time the politician managed to de-racialise the issue .
and of course we are talking about people coming from outside the eu , and that includes plenty of countries where the population , such as the united states , include people who are white .
so i do n't accept this is a racial issue at all .
and indeed i think it 's very important when we talk about these things that we do n't let it drift into issues of race , that we talk stick on the numbers and the facts and on issues of demographic change .
andrew marr : it 's just a question of logic , is n't it though ?
if there 's a flow coming in from the eu which you can do nothing about and there 's a flow coming in from outside the eu , overwhelmingly from the new commonwealth , which you can do something about , then the number of black and asian people coming to this country is going to be quite a lot less .
i mean it 's just logic is n't it ?
george osborne : i do n't want to pick you up on your use of figures , but when you said it overwhelmingly comes from the new commonwealth , if you 're talking about economic migration from outside the eu , part of it comes from the so-called new commonwealth like the asian subcontinent , part of it comes from the old commonwealth , so called , like australia , south africa , new zealand , united states , you 're talking about a very old commonwealth , and part of it comes from none of those countries .
so , in other words , you 've got to be extremely careful , it is not the case that the overwhelming majority comes from the new commonwealth .
andrew marr : when i was talking to peter hain just now , and i asked him whether he thought an extra ten million people in this country was acceptable , he would n't give me an answer .
do you think that 's something that we can look forward to as a tolerable increase and is it historically unprecedented increase and a very large one , but perhaps we could manage it , perhaps we ca n't .
what 's your view ?
george osborne : i think it is too much , so i am prepared to answer that question .
there are some things of course i ca n't do anything about , and nor would i want to do anything about - increased birthrate , increased life expectancy , a good thing for all of us as individuals .
but in terms of migration and immigration into this country , of course an open economy like britain will have levels of immigration and levels of emigration and that 's part of being part of a global world .
but as i 've just said , i think the level of immigration is too high and needs to be substantially reduced .
so we would have an impact on those population figures .
andrew marr : let 's turn to other aspects of the political scene at the moment .
you were credited with what you said on inheritance tax , and so forth , have been one of the factors which pushed gordon brown off an election just about now .
do you have more shots in your locker like that ?
because after all , whether you like it or not , the inheritance tax issue has been taken up by the government , so has the question of non-domiciled taxpayers .
and , you know , 18 months ' time , two years ' time , this will all be old history .
george osborne : well i mean , can i answer that in two parts .
first of all i do n't put down the change in the conservative party 's fortunes entirely to my speech at the party conference , or what we said on inheritance tax .
or indeed to the team effort at the conference , because it was n't just me .
william hague , liam fox , david davis , all made very powerful contributions .
and the of course there was david cameron 's fantastic speech at the end .
but i do n't think we would have had that success if we had not done the work over 18 months in changing the conservative party .
so that when i speak about taxation people know it is rooted in a framework of economic stability and properly funded public services .
i mean , going forward , yes , we have plenty of ideas and not just on taxation but other areas of the economy , because we want to make sure that britain competes in this global economy i 've just been talking about .
and of course there are issues around making our business tax system competitive .
at the moment it 's becoming more uncompetitive because of the increase in capital gains tax , and personal taxation too .
so we will talk about these things , no doubt perhaps on these chairs , in the coming months .
andrew marr : maybe those foundations were terribly important , or maybe you 're just digging a hole in the wrong field .
and the minute you return to tax , immigration and europe your fortunes took off again .
george osborne : well first of all we did n't just talk about those issues , by any means .
if you went to our party conference , indeed you were there , you will have heard us talking about the health service , the education system and so on .
andrew marr : it 's just interesting because when they came back up again so did your opinion poll position .
george osborne : but if you look at what i said on tax , i did not offer an unfunded tax cut .
i did n't say i was going to be cutting public services in order to pay for a cut in inheritance tax .
i actually made sure it was matched by a tax increase elsewhere on non-domicile taxpayers .
and i also set it in the context of economic stability .
and by the way , when i started talking about economic stability two years ago on programmes such as this , people said why are you raising that issue ?
well now as we see the world facing a period of great economic instability people can see that the british economic policy needs to be rooted in stability .
and everything we say on tax , public spending , or anything else , will be set against that context .
andrew marr : is the short-term outlook bleak , economically ?
george osborne : well i think there are many worrying signs out there for the global economy .
and not least the news we 're getting from various big american investment banks at the moment , including something we might hear today .
i think the big question for britain is are we prepared for what might be rainy days ahead ?
andrew marr : so you think the banking crisis is not over ?
george osborne : i do n't think the banking crisis is over , as is clear by the announcement from merill lynch and news we might hear in the future .
there is still a big unresolved question of what happens to northern rock , and the money that is now racking up on the bank of england 's balance sheet .
i think the question for britain is " are we well prepared " and at the moment we have the highest budget deficit in europe .
there was a report earlier this week that said we 're becoming a less competitive economy .
and so the answer is we are not well prepared and i do n't think , frankly , the chancellor of the exchequer , alastair darling , has either the vision or at the moment the authority to provide that leadership through this difficult time .
and i think he needs to improve his act .
andrew marr : so what it suggests , what that suggests , is that you believe we need to see spending cut back or taxation increased to get us over what you just described ?
george osborne : well i think you need to set a path for public expenditure over an economic cycle that shows the proceeds of growth , so we tackle the borrowing problem .
i think you need a more competitive tax system .
andrew marr : i 'm sorry , if i could just interrupt you , i 'm talking about the potential crisis we 're facing now , what needs to be done now to deal with that ?
george osborne : well what needs to be done now is we need a more competitive tax system .
let me take one very specific issue .
at the moment , next april , the government is planning an 80 % increase in the capital gains tax that businesses pay .
i think that is crazy , given the current economic conditions .
so it is precisely the kind of thing we should be encouraging - capital gain , risk-taking , entrepreneurship , in difficult economic times , not penalising it with an 80 % tax increase .
andrew marr : all right .
george osborne , thank you very much indeed for coming in .

and of course candidates whether it 's mr. hastilow or anyone else , should be careful in the use of language they have used .
andrew marr : so , he 's not going to be a conservative candidate for much longer , judging by everything you 've just said ?
george osborne : well i 'm not going to pre-judge the meeting he has later today with the party chairman .
andrew marr : ok .
all right .
staying on the immigration issue nonetheless , david cameron and yourself have said there 's too much immigration in this country .
and the figure was going to be , has gone up from something like 47,000 , it 's up to 700,000-800,000 net , at the moment .
do you have a view on where between those two figures the correct amount of immigration should be ?
i mean how much less do you want to see ?
george osborne : well we have a view that immigration should be substantially lower than it is at the moment .
but we are not putting a precise figure on it for exactly the reason we 've just discussed on the previous interview you had with peter hain .
we 're not going to use arbitrary figures , we think it should be substantially lower , and we 've set out the way that that can be achieved .
i mean , by the way , this is in the context of demographic change , a growth in the population of the united kingdom caused by immigration , but also caused by higher birth rates and increased life expectancy .
all of which puts pressure on public services , on schools and hospitals and our transport system , and so on .
so in the context of that we think immigration should be substantially lower .
now there are certain elements of immigration which we can not control , for legal reasons / andrew marr : from the eu ?
george osborne : for example from the eu .
however we can ensure that new eu countries that join have transition arrangements and we proposed this for bulgaria and romania , and i 'm delighted the government have followed our lead on that .
but there is also non-eu economic migration and that can be controlled , and we would set an annual limit which would be agreed amongst , for example , the local authorities , talk to business organisations and so on .
and that is an element where the government can exercise control and indeed can enforce that control through a border police .
andrew marr : so , despite the moderate language and the care all round that does mean fewer black and asian people coming into this country , does n't it ?
george osborne : well i do n't accept it 's a race issue at all .
indeed trevor phillips , the new head of the equality commission said that david cameron 's speech had been the first time he had heard for a long time the politician managed to de-racialise the issue .
and of course we are talking about people coming from outside the eu , and that includes plenty of countries where the population , such as the united states , include people who are white .
so i do n't accept this is a racial issue at all .
and indeed i think it 's very important when we talk about these things that we do n't let it drift into issues of race , that we talk stick on the numbers and the facts and on issues of demographic change .
andrew marr : it 's just a question of logic , is n't it though ?
if there 's a flow coming in from the eu which you can do nothing about and there 's a flow coming in from outside the eu , overwhelmingly from the new commonwealth , which you can do something about , then the number of black and asian people coming to this country is going to be quite a lot less .
i mean it 's just logic is n't it ?
george osborne : i do n't want to pick you up on your use of figures , but when you said it overwhelmingly comes from the new commonwealth , if you 're talking about economic migration from outside the eu , part of it comes from the so-called new commonwealth like the asian subcontinent , part of it comes from the old commonwealth , so called , like australia , south africa , new zealand , united states , you 're talking about a very old commonwealth , and part of it comes from none of those countries .
so , in other words , you 've got to be extremely careful , it is not the case that the overwhelming majority comes from the new commonwealth .
andrew marr : when i was talking to peter hain just now , and i asked him whether he thought an extra ten million people in this country was acceptable , he would n't give me an answer .
do you think that 's something that we can look forward to as a tolerable increase and is it historically unprecedented increase and a very large one , but perhaps we could manage it , perhaps we ca n't .
what 's your view ?
george osborne : i think it is too much , so i am prepared to answer that question .
there are some things of course i ca n't do anything about , and nor would i want to do anything about - increased birthrate , increased life expectancy , a good thing for all of us as individuals .
but in terms of migration and immigration into this country , of course an open economy like britain will have levels of immigration and levels of emigration and that 's part of being part of a global world .
but as i 've just said , i think the level of immigration is too high and needs to be substantially reduced .
so we would have an impact on those population figures .
andrew marr : let 's turn to other aspects of the political scene at the moment .
you were credited with what you said on inheritance tax , and so forth , have been one of the factors which pushed gordon brown off an election just about now .
do you have more shots in your locker like that ?
because after all , whether you like it or not , the inheritance tax issue has been taken up by the government , so has the question of non-domiciled taxpayers .
and , you know , 18 months ' time , two years ' time , this will all be old history .
george osborne : well i mean , can i answer that in two parts .
first of all i do n't put down the change in the conservative party 's fortunes entirely to my speech at the party conference , or what we said on inheritance tax .
or indeed to the team effort at the conference , because it was n't just me .
william hague , liam fox , david davis , all made very powerful contributions .
and the of course there was david cameron 's fantastic speech at the end .
but i do n't think we would have had that success if we had not done the work over 18 months in changing the conservative party .
so that when i speak about taxation people know it is rooted in a framework of economic stability and properly funded public services .
i mean , going forward , yes , we have plenty of ideas and not just on taxation but other areas of the economy , because we want to make sure that britain competes in this global economy i 've just been talking about .
and of course there are issues around making our business tax system competitive .
at the moment it 's becoming more uncompetitive because of the increase in capital gains tax , and personal taxation too .
so we will talk about these things , no doubt perhaps on these chairs , in the coming months .
andrew marr : maybe those foundations were terribly important , or maybe you 're just digging a hole in the wrong field .
and the minute you return to tax , immigration and europe your fortunes took off again .
george osborne : well first of all we did n't just talk about those issues , by any means .
if you went to our party conference , indeed you were there , you will have heard us talking about the health service , the education system and so on .
andrew marr : it 's just interesting because when they came back up again so did your opinion poll position .
george osborne : but if you look at what i said on tax , i did not offer an unfunded tax cut .
i did n't say i was going to be cutting public services in order to pay for a cut in inheritance tax .
i actually made sure it was matched by a tax increase elsewhere on non-domicile taxpayers .
and i also set it in the context of economic stability .
and by the way , when i started talking about economic stability two years ago on programmes such as this , people said why are you raising that issue ?
well now as we see the world facing a period of great economic instability people can see that the british economic policy needs to be rooted in stability .
and everything we say on tax , public spending , or anything else , will be set against that context .
andrew marr : is the short-term outlook bleak , economically ?
george osborne : well i think there are many worrying signs out there for the global economy .
and not least the news we 're getting from various big american investment banks at the moment , including something we might hear today .
i think the big question for britain is are we prepared for what might be rainy days ahead ?
andrew marr : so you think the banking crisis is not over ?
george osborne : i do n't think the banking crisis is over , as is clear by the announcement from merill lynch and news we might hear in the future .
there is still a big unresolved question of what happens to northern rock , and the money that is now racking up on the bank of england 's balance sheet .
i think the question for britain is " are we well prepared " and at the moment we have the highest budget deficit in europe .
there was a report earlier this week that said we 're becoming a less competitive economy .
and so the answer is we are not well prepared and i do n't think , frankly , the chancellor of the exchequer , alastair darling , has either the vision or at the moment the authority to provide that leadership through this difficult time .
and i think he needs to improve his act .
andrew marr : so what it suggests , what that suggests , is that you believe we need to see spending cut back or taxation increased to get us over what you just described ?
george osborne : well i think you need to set a path for public expenditure over an economic cycle that shows the proceeds of growth , so we tackle the borrowing problem .
i think you need a more competitive tax system .
andrew marr : i 'm sorry , if i could just interrupt you , i 'm talking about the potential crisis we 're facing now , what needs to be done now to deal with that ?
george osborne : well what needs to be done now is we need a more competitive tax system .
let me take one very specific issue .
at the moment , next april , the government is planning an 80 % increase in the capital gains tax that businesses pay .
i think that is crazy , given the current economic conditions .
so it is precisely the kind of thing we should be encouraging - capital gain , risk-taking , entrepreneurship , in difficult economic times , not penalising it with an 80 % tax increase .
andrew marr : all right .
george osborne , thank you very much indeed for coming in .

democracy live last updated : tuesday , 6 november 2007 , 08:47 gmt e-mail this to a friend printable version immigrant issues on sunday 04 november andrew marr interviewed george osborne mp , shadow chancellor please note " the andrew marr show " must be credited if any part of this transcript is used .
george osborne mp andrew marr : now the turnaround in the conservative party 's fortunes coincided with the return to a more traditional emphasis and message , the issues of immigration and europe and taxation .
precisely the ones where david cameron had tried to avoid earlier in his leadership , seem to have given the party a second wind .
now , on immigration the conservatives have called for a grown-up conversation , traditionally difficult area for the party , it 's certainly been brought into focus by one newspaper report this morning in which a conservative candidate suggests that enoch powell was right .
george osborne , shadow chancellor , thank you for coming in to join us .
now , mr. hastilow , if his comments are as reported , and they are after all in an article he 's written , so i presume they are .
what 's his status in the conservative party ?
george osborne : well i do n't agree with what he said .
he 's going to have a meeting later today with our party chairman , my colleague caroline spelman .
he 'll have to explain himself and it will also be explained to him , that candidates of any party , conservative , labour , liberal democrat , have to exercise great caution in the language they use about immigration .
we do need controlled immigration , the conservative party has several policies that would make sure that immigration is controlled , but the debate has to be conducted in a reasonable way , with moderate use of language .
and by the way , this applies to everyone .
this applies to the government itself and the use of figures , and they 've got themselves into a mess this week on this .
it applies to senior politicians .
i think for example phrases like " british jobs for british workers " are particularly nasty and are trying to play to a particular chord .
and of course candidates whether it 's mr. hastilow or anyone else , should be careful in the use of language they have used .

william hague , liam fox , david davis , all made very powerful contributions .
and the of course there was david cameron 's fantastic speech at the end .
but i do n't think we would have had that success if we had not done the work over 18 months in changing the conservative party .
so that when i speak about taxation people know it is rooted in a framework of economic stability and properly funded public services .
i mean , going forward , yes , we have plenty of ideas and not just on taxation but other areas of the economy , because we want to make sure that britain competes in this global economy i 've just been talking about .
and of course there are issues around making our business tax system competitive .
at the moment it 's becoming more uncompetitive because of the increase in capital gains tax , and personal taxation too .
so we will talk about these things , no doubt perhaps on these chairs , in the coming months .
andrew marr : maybe those foundations were terribly important , or maybe you 're just digging a hole in the wrong field .
and the minute you return to tax , immigration and europe your fortunes took off again .
george osborne : well first of all we did n't just talk about those issues , by any means .
if you went to our party conference , indeed you were there , you will have heard us talking about the health service , the education system and so on .
andrew marr : it 's just interesting because when they came back up again so did your opinion poll position .
george osborne : but if you look at what i said on tax , i did not offer an unfunded tax cut .
i did n't say i was going to be cutting public services in order to pay for a cut in inheritance tax .
i actually made sure it was matched by a tax increase elsewhere on non-domicile taxpayers .
and i also set it in the context of economic stability .
and by the way , when i started talking about economic stability two years ago on programmes such as this , people said why are you raising that issue ?
well now as we see the world facing a period of great economic instability people can see that the british economic policy needs to be rooted in stability .
and everything we say on tax , public spending , or anything else , will be set against that context .
andrew marr : is the short-term outlook bleak , economically ?
george osborne : well i think there are many worrying signs out there for the global economy .
and not least the news we 're getting from various big american investment banks at the moment , including something we might hear today .
i think the big question for britain is are we prepared for what might be rainy days ahead ?
andrew marr : so you think the banking crisis is not over ?
george osborne : i do n't think the banking crisis is over , as is clear by the announcement from merill lynch and news we might hear in the future .
there is still a big unresolved question of what happens to northern rock , and the money that is now racking up on the bank of england 's balance sheet .
i think the question for britain is " are we well prepared " and at the moment we have the highest budget deficit in europe .
there was a report earlier this week that said we 're becoming a less competitive economy .
and so the answer is we are not well prepared and i do n't think , frankly , the chancellor of the exchequer , alastair darling , has either the vision or at the moment the authority to provide that leadership through this difficult time .
and i think he needs to improve his act .
andrew marr : so what it suggests , what that suggests , is that you believe we need to see spending cut back or taxation increased to get us over what you just described ?
george osborne : well i think you need to set a path for public expenditure over an economic cycle that shows the proceeds of growth , so we tackle the borrowing problem .
i think you need a more competitive tax system .
andrew marr : i 'm sorry , if i could just interrupt you , i 'm talking about the potential crisis we 're facing now , what needs to be done now to deal with that ?
george osborne : well what needs to be done now is we need a more competitive tax system .
let me take one very specific issue .
at the moment , next april , the government is planning an 80 % increase in the capital gains tax that businesses pay .
i think that is crazy , given the current economic conditions .
so it is precisely the kind of thing we should be encouraging - capital gain , risk-taking , entrepreneurship , in difficult economic times , not penalising it with an 80 % tax increase .
andrew marr : all right .
george osborne , thank you very much indeed for coming in .

democracy live last updated : tuesday , 6 november 2007 , 08:47 gmt e-mail this to a friend printable version immigrant issues on sunday 04 november andrew marr interviewed george osborne mp , shadow chancellor please note " the andrew marr show " must be credited if any part of this transcript is used .
george osborne mp andrew marr : now the turnaround in the conservative party 's fortunes coincided with the return to a more traditional emphasis and message , the issues of immigration and europe and taxation .
precisely the ones where david cameron had tried to avoid earlier in his leadership , seem to have given the party a second wind .
now , on immigration the conservatives have called for a grown-up conversation , traditionally difficult area for the party , it 's certainly been brought into focus by one newspaper report this morning in which a conservative candidate suggests that enoch powell was right .
george osborne , shadow chancellor , thank you for coming in to join us .
now , mr. hastilow , if his comments are as reported , and they are after all in an article he 's written , so i presume they are .
what 's his status in the conservative party ?
george osborne : well i do n't agree with what he said .
he 's going to have a meeting later today with our party chairman , my colleague caroline spelman .
he 'll have to explain himself and it will also be explained to him , that candidates of any party , conservative , labour , liberal democrat , have to exercise great caution in the language they use about immigration .
we do need controlled immigration , the conservative party has several policies that would make sure that immigration is controlled , but the debate has to be conducted in a reasonable way , with moderate use of language .
and by the way , this applies to everyone .
this applies to the government itself and the use of figures , and they 've got themselves into a mess this week on this .
it applies to senior politicians .
i think for example phrases like " british jobs for british workers " are particularly nasty and are trying to play to a particular chord .
and of course candidates whether it 's mr. hastilow or anyone else , should be careful in the use of language they have used .
andrew marr : so , he 's not going to be a conservative candidate for much longer , judging by everything you 've just said ?
george osborne : well i 'm not going to pre-judge the meeting he has later today with the party chairman .
andrew marr : ok .
all right .
staying on the immigration issue nonetheless , david cameron and yourself have said there 's too much immigration in this country .
and the figure was going to be , has gone up from something like 47,000 , it 's up to 700,000-800,000 net , at the moment .
do you have a view on where between those two figures the correct amount of immigration should be ?
i mean how much less do you want to see ?
george osborne : well we have a view that immigration should be substantially lower than it is at the moment .
but we are not putting a precise figure on it for exactly the reason we 've just discussed on the previous interview you had with peter hain .
we 're not going to use arbitrary figures , we think it should be substantially lower , and we 've set out the way that that can be achieved .
i mean , by the way , this is in the context of demographic change , a growth in the population of the united kingdom caused by immigration , but also caused by higher birth rates and increased life expectancy .
all of which puts pressure on public services , on schools and hospitals and our transport system , and so on .
so in the context of that we think immigration should be substantially lower .
now there are certain elements of immigration which we can not control , for legal reasons / andrew marr : from the eu ?
george osborne : for example from the eu .
however we can ensure that new eu countries that join have transition arrangements and we proposed this for bulgaria and romania , and i 'm delighted the government have followed our lead on that .
but there is also non-eu economic migration and that can be controlled , and we would set an annual limit which would be agreed amongst , for example , the local authorities , talk to business organisations and so on .
and that is an element where the government can exercise control and indeed can enforce that control through a border police .
andrew marr : so , despite the moderate language and the care all round that does mean fewer black and asian people coming into this country , does n't it ?
george osborne : well i do n't accept it 's a race issue at all .
indeed trevor phillips , the new head of the equality commission said that david cameron 's speech had been the first time he had heard for a long time the politician managed to de-racialise the issue .
and of course we are talking about people coming from outside the eu , and that includes plenty of countries where the population , such as the united states , include people who are white .
so i do n't accept this is a racial issue at all .
and indeed i think it 's very important when we talk about these things that we do n't let it drift into issues of race , that we talk stick on the numbers and the facts and on issues of demographic change .
andrew marr : it 's just a question of logic , is n't it though ?
if there 's a flow coming in from the eu which you can do nothing about and there 's a flow coming in from outside the eu , overwhelmingly from the new commonwealth , which you can do something about , then the number of black and asian people coming to this country is going to be quite a lot less .
i mean it 's just logic is n't it ?
george osborne : i do n't want to pick you up on your use of figures , but when you said it overwhelmingly comes from the new commonwealth , if you 're talking about economic migration from outside the eu , part of it comes from the so-called new commonwealth like the asian subcontinent , part of it comes from the old commonwealth , so called , like australia , south africa , new zealand , united states , you 're talking about a very old commonwealth , and part of it comes from none of those countries .
so , in other words , you 've got to be extremely careful , it is not the case that the overwhelming majority comes from the new commonwealth .
andrew marr : when i was talking to peter hain just now , and i asked him whether he thought an extra ten million people in this country was acceptable , he would n't give me an answer .
do you think that 's something that we can look forward to as a tolerable increase and is it historically unprecedented increase and a very large one , but perhaps we could manage it , perhaps we ca n't .
what 's your view ?
george osborne : i think it is too much , so i am prepared to answer that question .
there are some things of course i ca n't do anything about , and nor would i want to do anything about - increased birthrate , increased life expectancy , a good thing for all of us as individuals .
but in terms of migration and immigration into this country , of course an open economy like britain will have levels of immigration and levels of emigration and that 's part of being part of a global world .
but as i 've just said , i think the level of immigration is too high and needs to be substantially reduced .
so we would have an impact on those population figures .
andrew marr : let 's turn to other aspects of the political scene at the moment .
you were credited with what you said on inheritance tax , and so forth , have been one of the factors which pushed gordon brown off an election just about now .
do you have more shots in your locker like that ?
because after all , whether you like it or not , the inheritance tax issue has been taken up by the government , so has the question of non-domiciled taxpayers .
and , you know , 18 months ' time , two years ' time , this will all be old history .
george osborne : well i mean , can i answer that in two parts .
first of all i do n't put down the change in the conservative party 's fortunes entirely to my speech at the party conference , or what we said on inheritance tax .
or indeed to the team effort at the conference , because it was n't just me .
william hague , liam fox , david davis , all made very powerful contributions .
and the of course there was david cameron 's fantastic speech at the end .

democracy live last updated : tuesday , 6 november 2007 , 08:47 gmt e-mail this to a friend printable version immigrant issues on sunday 04 november andrew marr interviewed george osborne mp , shadow chancellor please note " the andrew marr show " must be credited if any part of this transcript is used .
george osborne mp andrew marr : now the turnaround in the conservative party 's fortunes coincided with the return to a more traditional emphasis and message , the issues of immigration and europe and taxation .
precisely the ones where david cameron had tried to avoid earlier in his leadership , seem to have given the party a second wind .
now , on immigration the conservatives have called for a grown-up conversation , traditionally difficult area for the party , it 's certainly been brought into focus by one newspaper report this morning in which a conservative candidate suggests that enoch powell was right .
george osborne , shadow chancellor , thank you for coming in to join us .
now , mr. hastilow , if his comments are as reported , and they are after all in an article he 's written , so i presume they are .
what 's his status in the conservative party ?
george osborne : well i do n't agree with what he said .
he 's going to have a meeting later today with our party chairman , my colleague caroline spelman .
he 'll have to explain himself and it will also be explained to him , that candidates of any party , conservative , labour , liberal democrat , have to exercise great caution in the language they use about immigration .
we do need controlled immigration , the conservative party has several policies that would make sure that immigration is controlled , but the debate has to be conducted in a reasonable way , with moderate use of language .
and by the way , this applies to everyone .
this applies to the government itself and the use of figures , and they 've got themselves into a mess this week on this .
it applies to senior politicians .
i think for example phrases like " british jobs for british workers " are particularly nasty and are trying to play to a particular chord .
and of course candidates whether it 's mr. hastilow or anyone else , should be careful in the use of language they have used .
andrew marr : so , he 's not going to be a conservative candidate for much longer , judging by everything you 've just said ?
george osborne : well i 'm not going to pre-judge the meeting he has later today with the party chairman .
andrew marr : ok .
all right .
staying on the immigration issue nonetheless , david cameron and yourself have said there 's too much immigration in this country .
and the figure was going to be , has gone up from something like 47,000 , it 's up to 700,000-800,000 net , at the moment .
do you have a view on where between those two figures the correct amount of immigration should be ?
i mean how much less do you want to see ?
george osborne : well we have a view that immigration should be substantially lower than it is at the moment .
but we are not putting a precise figure on it for exactly the reason we 've just discussed on the previous interview you had with peter hain .
we 're not going to use arbitrary figures , we think it should be substantially lower , and we 've set out the way that that can be achieved .
i mean , by the way , this is in the context of demographic change , a growth in the population of the united kingdom caused by immigration , but also caused by higher birth rates and increased life expectancy .
all of which puts pressure on public services , on schools and hospitals and our transport system , and so on .
so in the context of that we think immigration should be substantially lower .
now there are certain elements of immigration which we can not control , for legal reasons / andrew marr : from the eu ?
george osborne : for example from the eu .
however we can ensure that new eu countries that join have transition arrangements and we proposed this for bulgaria and romania , and i 'm delighted the government have followed our lead on that .
but there is also non-eu economic migration and that can be controlled , and we would set an annual limit which would be agreed amongst , for example , the local authorities , talk to business organisations and so on .
and that is an element where the government can exercise control and indeed can enforce that control through a border police .
andrew marr : so , despite the moderate language and the care all round that does mean fewer black and asian people coming into this country , does n't it ?
george osborne : well i do n't accept it 's a race issue at all .
indeed trevor phillips , the new head of the equality commission said that david cameron 's speech had been the first time he had heard for a long time the politician managed to de-racialise the issue .
and of course we are talking about people coming from outside the eu , and that includes plenty of countries where the population , such as the united states , include people who are white .
so i do n't accept this is a racial issue at all .
and indeed i think it 's very important when we talk about these things that we do n't let it drift into issues of race , that we talk stick on the numbers and the facts and on issues of demographic change .
andrew marr : it 's just a question of logic , is n't it though ?
if there 's a flow coming in from the eu which you can do nothing about and there 's a flow coming in from outside the eu , overwhelmingly from the new commonwealth , which you can do something about , then the number of black and asian people coming to this country is going to be quite a lot less .
i mean it 's just logic is n't it ?
george osborne : i do n't want to pick you up on your use of figures , but when you said it overwhelmingly comes from the new commonwealth , if you 're talking about economic migration from outside the eu , part of it comes from the so-called new commonwealth like the asian subcontinent , part of it comes from the old commonwealth , so called , like australia , south africa , new zealand , united states , you 're talking about a very old commonwealth , and part of it comes from none of those countries .
so , in other words , you 've got to be extremely careful , it is not the case that the overwhelming majority comes from the new commonwealth .
andrew marr : when i was talking to peter hain just now , and i asked him whether he thought an extra ten million people in this country was acceptable , he would n't give me an answer .
do you think that 's something that we can look forward to as a tolerable increase and is it historically unprecedented increase and a very large one , but perhaps we could manage it , perhaps we ca n't .
what 's your view ?
george osborne : i think it is too much , so i am prepared to answer that question .
there are some things of course i ca n't do anything about , and nor would i want to do anything about - increased birthrate , increased life expectancy , a good thing for all of us as individuals .
but in terms of migration and immigration into this country , of course an open economy like britain will have levels of immigration and levels of emigration and that 's part of being part of a global world .
but as i 've just said , i think the level of immigration is too high and needs to be substantially reduced .
so we would have an impact on those population figures .
andrew marr : let 's turn to other aspects of the political scene at the moment .
you were credited with what you said on inheritance tax , and so forth , have been one of the factors which pushed gordon brown off an election just about now .
do you have more shots in your locker like that ?
because after all , whether you like it or not , the inheritance tax issue has been taken up by the government , so has the question of non-domiciled taxpayers .
and , you know , 18 months ' time , two years ' time , this will all be old history .
george osborne : well i mean , can i answer that in two parts .
first of all i do n't put down the change in the conservative party 's fortunes entirely to my speech at the party conference , or what we said on inheritance tax .
or indeed to the team effort at the conference , because it was n't just me .
william hague , liam fox , david davis , all made very powerful contributions .
and the of course there was david cameron 's fantastic speech at the end .
but i do n't think we would have had that success if we had not done the work over 18 months in changing the conservative party .
so that when i speak about taxation people know it is rooted in a framework of economic stability and properly funded public services .
i mean , going forward , yes , we have plenty of ideas and not just on taxation but other areas of the economy , because we want to make sure that britain competes in this global economy i 've just been talking about .
and of course there are issues around making our business tax system competitive .
at the moment it 's becoming more uncompetitive because of the increase in capital gains tax , and personal taxation too .
so we will talk about these things , no doubt perhaps on these chairs , in the coming months .
andrew marr : maybe those foundations were terribly important , or maybe you 're just digging a hole in the wrong field .
and the minute you return to tax , immigration and europe your fortunes took off again .
george osborne : well first of all we did n't just talk about those issues , by any means .
if you went to our party conference , indeed you were there , you will have heard us talking about the health service , the education system and so on .
andrew marr : it 's just interesting because when they came back up again so did your opinion poll position .
george osborne : but if you look at what i said on tax , i did not offer an unfunded tax cut .
i did n't say i was going to be cutting public services in order to pay for a cut in inheritance tax .
i actually made sure it was matched by a tax increase elsewhere on non-domicile taxpayers .
and i also set it in the context of economic stability .
and by the way , when i started talking about economic stability two years ago on programmes such as this , people said why are you raising that issue ?
well now as we see the world facing a period of great economic instability people can see that the british economic policy needs to be rooted in stability .
and everything we say on tax , public spending , or anything else , will be set against that context .
andrew marr : is the short-term outlook bleak , economically ?
george osborne : well i think there are many worrying signs out there for the global economy .
and not least the news we 're getting from various big american investment banks at the moment , including something we might hear today .
i think the big question for britain is are we prepared for what might be rainy days ahead ?
andrew marr : so you think the banking crisis is not over ?
george osborne : i do n't think the banking crisis is over , as is clear by the announcement from merill lynch and news we might hear in the future .
there is still a big unresolved question of what happens to northern rock , and the money that is now racking up on the bank of england 's balance sheet .
i think the question for britain is " are we well prepared " and at the moment we have the highest budget deficit in europe .
there was a report earlier this week that said we 're becoming a less competitive economy .
and so the answer is we are not well prepared and i do n't think , frankly , the chancellor of the exchequer , alastair darling , has either the vision or at the moment the authority to provide that leadership through this difficult time .
and i think he needs to improve his act .
andrew marr : so what it suggests , what that suggests , is that you believe we need to see spending cut back or taxation increased to get us over what you just described ?
george osborne : well i think you need to set a path for public expenditure over an economic cycle that shows the proceeds of growth , so we tackle the borrowing problem .
i think you need a more competitive tax system .
andrew marr : i 'm sorry , if i could just interrupt you , i 'm talking about the potential crisis we 're facing now , what needs to be done now to deal with that ?
george osborne : well what needs to be done now is we need a more competitive tax system .
let me take one very specific issue .
at the moment , next april , the government is planning an 80 % increase in the capital gains tax that businesses pay .
i think that is crazy , given the current economic conditions .
so it is precisely the kind of thing we should be encouraging - capital gain , risk-taking , entrepreneurship , in difficult economic times , not penalising it with an 80 % tax increase .
andrew marr : all right .
george osborne , thank you very much indeed for coming in .

indeed trevor phillips , the new head of the equality commission said that david cameron 's speech had been the first time he had heard for a long time the politician managed to de-racialise the issue .
and of course we are talking about people coming from outside the eu , and that includes plenty of countries where the population , such as the united states , include people who are white .
so i do n't accept this is a racial issue at all .
and indeed i think it 's very important when we talk about these things that we do n't let it drift into issues of race , that we talk stick on the numbers and the facts and on issues of demographic change .
andrew marr : it 's just a question of logic , is n't it though ?
if there 's a flow coming in from the eu which you can do nothing about and there 's a flow coming in from outside the eu , overwhelmingly from the new commonwealth , which you can do something about , then the number of black and asian people coming to this country is going to be quite a lot less .
i mean it 's just logic is n't it ?
george osborne : i do n't want to pick you up on your use of figures , but when you said it overwhelmingly comes from the new commonwealth , if you 're talking about economic migration from outside the eu , part of it comes from the so-called new commonwealth like the asian subcontinent , part of it comes from the old commonwealth , so called , like australia , south africa , new zealand , united states , you 're talking about a very old commonwealth , and part of it comes from none of those countries .
so , in other words , you 've got to be extremely careful , it is not the case that the overwhelming majority comes from the new commonwealth .
andrew marr : when i was talking to peter hain just now , and i asked him whether he thought an extra ten million people in this country was acceptable , he would n't give me an answer .
do you think that 's something that we can look forward to as a tolerable increase and is it historically unprecedented increase and a very large one , but perhaps we could manage it , perhaps we ca n't .
what 's your view ?
george osborne : i think it is too much , so i am prepared to answer that question .
there are some things of course i ca n't do anything about , and nor would i want to do anything about - increased birthrate , increased life expectancy , a good thing for all of us as individuals .
but in terms of migration and immigration into this country , of course an open economy like britain will have levels of immigration and levels of emigration and that 's part of being part of a global world .
but as i 've just said , i think the level of immigration is too high and needs to be substantially reduced .
so we would have an impact on those population figures .
andrew marr : let 's turn to other aspects of the political scene at the moment .
you were credited with what you said on inheritance tax , and so forth , have been one of the factors which pushed gordon brown off an election just about now .
do you have more shots in your locker like that ?
because after all , whether you like it or not , the inheritance tax issue has been taken up by the government , so has the question of non-domiciled taxpayers .
and , you know , 18 months ' time , two years ' time , this will all be old history .
george osborne : well i mean , can i answer that in two parts .
first of all i do n't put down the change in the conservative party 's fortunes entirely to my speech at the party conference , or what we said on inheritance tax .
or indeed to the team effort at the conference , because it was n't just me .
william hague , liam fox , david davis , all made very powerful contributions .
and the of course there was david cameron 's fantastic speech at the end .
but i do n't think we would have had that success if we had not done the work over 18 months in changing the conservative party .
so that when i speak about taxation people know it is rooted in a framework of economic stability and properly funded public services .
i mean , going forward , yes , we have plenty of ideas and not just on taxation but other areas of the economy , because we want to make sure that britain competes in this global economy i 've just been talking about .
and of course there are issues around making our business tax system competitive .
at the moment it 's becoming more uncompetitive because of the increase in capital gains tax , and personal taxation too .
so we will talk about these things , no doubt perhaps on these chairs , in the coming months .
andrew marr : maybe those foundations were terribly important , or maybe you 're just digging a hole in the wrong field .
and the minute you return to tax , immigration and europe your fortunes took off again .
george osborne : well first of all we did n't just talk about those issues , by any means .
if you went to our party conference , indeed you were there , you will have heard us talking about the health service , the education system and so on .
andrew marr : it 's just interesting because when they came back up again so did your opinion poll position .
george osborne : but if you look at what i said on tax , i did not offer an unfunded tax cut .
i did n't say i was going to be cutting public services in order to pay for a cut in inheritance tax .
i actually made sure it was matched by a tax increase elsewhere on non-domicile taxpayers .
and i also set it in the context of economic stability .
and by the way , when i started talking about economic stability two years ago on programmes such as this , people said why are you raising that issue ?
well now as we see the world facing a period of great economic instability people can see that the british economic policy needs to be rooted in stability .
and everything we say on tax , public spending , or anything else , will be set against that context .
andrew marr : is the short-term outlook bleak , economically ?
george osborne : well i think there are many worrying signs out there for the global economy .
and not least the news we 're getting from various big american investment banks at the moment , including something we might hear today .
i think the big question for britain is are we prepared for what might be rainy days ahead ?
andrew marr : so you think the banking crisis is not over ?
george osborne : i do n't think the banking crisis is over , as is clear by the announcement from merill lynch and news we might hear in the future .
there is still a big unresolved question of what happens to northern rock , and the money that is now racking up on the bank of england 's balance sheet .
i think the question for britain is " are we well prepared " and at the moment we have the highest budget deficit in europe .
there was a report earlier this week that said we 're becoming a less competitive economy .
and so the answer is we are not well prepared and i do n't think , frankly , the chancellor of the exchequer , alastair darling , has either the vision or at the moment the authority to provide that leadership through this difficult time .
and i think he needs to improve his act .
andrew marr : so what it suggests , what that suggests , is that you believe we need to see spending cut back or taxation increased to get us over what you just described ?
george osborne : well i think you need to set a path for public expenditure over an economic cycle that shows the proceeds of growth , so we tackle the borrowing problem .
i think you need a more competitive tax system .
andrew marr : i 'm sorry , if i could just interrupt you , i 'm talking about the potential crisis we 're facing now , what needs to be done now to deal with that ?
george osborne : well what needs to be done now is we need a more competitive tax system .
let me take one very specific issue .
at the moment , next april , the government is planning an 80 % increase in the capital gains tax that businesses pay .
i think that is crazy , given the current economic conditions .
so it is precisely the kind of thing we should be encouraging - capital gain , risk-taking , entrepreneurship , in difficult economic times , not penalising it with an 80 % tax increase .
andrew marr : all right .
george osborne , thank you very much indeed for coming in .

democracy live last updated : tuesday , 6 november 2007 , 08:47 gmt e-mail this to a friend printable version immigrant issues on sunday 04 november andrew marr interviewed george osborne mp , shadow chancellor please note " the andrew marr show " must be credited if any part of this transcript is used .
george osborne mp andrew marr : now the turnaround in the conservative party 's fortunes coincided with the return to a more traditional emphasis and message , the issues of immigration and europe and taxation .
precisely the ones where david cameron had tried to avoid earlier in his leadership , seem to have given the party a second wind .
now , on immigration the conservatives have called for a grown-up conversation , traditionally difficult area for the party , it 's certainly been brought into focus by one newspaper report this morning in which a conservative candidate suggests that enoch powell was right .
george osborne , shadow chancellor , thank you for coming in to join us .
now , mr. hastilow , if his comments are as reported , and they are after all in an article he 's written , so i presume they are .
what 's his status in the conservative party ?
george osborne : well i do n't agree with what he said .
he 's going to have a meeting later today with our party chairman , my colleague caroline spelman .
he 'll have to explain himself and it will also be explained to him , that candidates of any party , conservative , labour , liberal democrat , have to exercise great caution in the language they use about immigration .
we do need controlled immigration , the conservative party has several policies that would make sure that immigration is controlled , but the debate has to be conducted in a reasonable way , with moderate use of language .
and by the way , this applies to everyone .
this applies to the government itself and the use of figures , and they 've got themselves into a mess this week on this .
it applies to senior politicians .
i think for example phrases like " british jobs for british workers " are particularly nasty and are trying to play to a particular chord .
and of course candidates whether it 's mr. hastilow or anyone else , should be careful in the use of language they have used .
andrew marr : so , he 's not going to be a conservative candidate for much longer , judging by everything you 've just said ?
george osborne : well i 'm not going to pre-judge the meeting he has later today with the party chairman .
andrew marr : ok .
all right .
staying on the immigration issue nonetheless , david cameron and yourself have said there 's too much immigration in this country .
and the figure was going to be , has gone up from something like 47,000 , it 's up to 700,000-800,000 net , at the moment .
do you have a view on where between those two figures the correct amount of immigration should be ?
i mean how much less do you want to see ?
george osborne : well we have a view that immigration should be substantially lower than it is at the moment .
but we are not putting a precise figure on it for exactly the reason we 've just discussed on the previous interview you had with peter hain .
we 're not going to use arbitrary figures , we think it should be substantially lower , and we 've set out the way that that can be achieved .
i mean , by the way , this is in the context of demographic change , a growth in the population of the united kingdom caused by immigration , but also caused by higher birth rates and increased life expectancy .
all of which puts pressure on public services , on schools and hospitals and our transport system , and so on .
so in the context of that we think immigration should be substantially lower .
now there are certain elements of immigration which we can not control , for legal reasons / andrew marr : from the eu ?
george osborne : for example from the eu .
however we can ensure that new eu countries that join have transition arrangements and we proposed this for bulgaria and romania , and i 'm delighted the government have followed our lead on that .
but there is also non-eu economic migration and that can be controlled , and we would set an annual limit which would be agreed amongst , for example , the local authorities , talk to business organisations and so on .
and that is an element where the government can exercise control and indeed can enforce that control through a border police .
andrew marr : so , despite the moderate language and the care all round that does mean fewer black and asian people coming into this country , does n't it ?
george osborne : well i do n't accept it 's a race issue at all .
indeed trevor phillips , the new head of the equality commission said that david cameron 's speech had been the first time he had heard for a long time the politician managed to de-racialise the issue .
and of course we are talking about people coming from outside the eu , and that includes plenty of countries where the population , such as the united states , include people who are white .
