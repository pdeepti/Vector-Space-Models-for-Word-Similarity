" it is apparent that the -lrb- british -rrb- sanctions are aimed at politicizing the litvinenko affair , " he added .
" this is a direct path to confrontation . " eu could be pulled into fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has promised to respond to the expulsion gruschko also said he hoped the european union would have " enough common sense " as to not allow itself to become an instrument in the affair . but the eu is likely to be pulled into any dispute between a member state and russia , according to luxemburg 's foreign minister jean asselborn . " naturally we are showing our solidarity with another eu member , but you also have to have the right to question certain steps , " asselborn told financial times deutschland , adding that he wondered if the dispute could have been settled using " silent , diplomatic channels .

the commission has said it favors the introduction of the genetically modified potato - which includes genes that make it resistant to antibiotics - since it will only be used for starch production and as animal feed .
" it will not enter the nutritional chain , " said a commission spokeswoman .
if the commission goes ahead with the authorization , it will be the first time since 1998 that a genetically engineered plant is given permission for large-scale cultivation in the eu .
however , the commission decision could take some time .
but international environmental group greenpeace said an eu go-ahead for cultivation of the potato would amount to allowing controversial genetically modified crops to enter the eu " through the back door . "

other states , including britain , favor the move .
greenpeace has called on governments to reject the potato , which has been developed by german chemical company basf , saying it poses significant risks to health and the environment .
eu rules demand that genes which may have adverse effects on human health and the environment should be phased out .
however , the european food safety authority has given a positive opinion on the basf-developed potato , saying its antibiotic resistance genes do not pose a " relevant " risk to human health or the environment .
greenpeace has warned that the genetically engineered potato did not undergo full risk assessment including its effect on biodiversity .

british prosecutors had requested that andrei lugovoi , a former kgb officer , be extradited to face trial in britain for litvinenko 's murder , which russia rejected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstators in moscow demanding zakayev 's extradition in 2004 " the new british prime minister has declared war on russia - a diplomatic one , " the pro-kremlin daily izvestia wrote , adding that russian courts were still waiting for british authorities to extradite oligarch boris berezovsky and chechen rebel leader ahmed zakayev .
" in russia there are ongoing criminal investigations against them but the british consider them ' politically persecuted kremlin opponents . ' ... it wo n't be long before an ' appropriate response ' from moscow -lsb- comes -rsb- .
but what does britain need a ' second front ' for when it has n't finished dealing with the terrorists who have declared a jihad against it ? " kommersant daily agreed .
" great britain and russia have begun a diplomatic war , " warning that " moscow 's reaction , judging from yesterday 's emotional commentary from russian officials , will be even more violent . " british newspapers sided with prime minister gordon brown 's government . " what choice have we ? " asked the daily mail .
" by refusing to extradite andrei lugovoi to face trial , -lsb- russian -rsb- president vladimir putin has committed an outrage that demands punishment ...
as it is , the new prime minister has come up with sanctions that will present putin with real difficulties in his dealings with the west .
mr. brown has faced his serious test as an international statesman - and passed it with ease . " the times also applauded the government 's decision , noting that " the key issue was what steps could be taken that were both measured and appropriate .
those announced yesterday were right .
britain will suffer , and cynics may argue that today 's measures are futile and counter-productive .
but they send a signal to all those who would silence their critics abroad : britain will protect those on its soil and can not overlook murder for the sake of diplomatic convenience . " similarly , the guardian said it was " reasonable " to expect russia to amend its constitution to allow for the extradition of its citizens , which is currently prohibited .
" if russia is seeking to integrate itself into the world business community , if it seeks for its citizens greater freedom of movement and fewer visa restrictions , if it seeks to cooperate in the fight against international terrorism , it has also got to live by the rules that most other european states subject themselves to , " the paper 's editorial read .
" confrontation is in no one 's interest .
but nor is letting freelance murders take place on the streets of london . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin already said that there will be consequences after the extraditions but a few british papers also cautioned that the expulsions may lead to serious consequences . " the government should not be surprised if sanctions are extended to british companies in russia , " wrote the daily telegraph . the sun chimed in , adding that britain would have to secure public declarations of support from its allies in what it described as " the biggest test for european nerve since the cold war ... we have learned in two -lsb- world wars -rsb- not to appease bullies ...
we need a clear signal from our allies that britain will not face this threat alone . " article compiled from wire reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

british prosecutors had requested that andrei lugovoi , a former kgb officer , be extradited to face trial in britain for litvinenko 's murder , which russia rejected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstators in moscow demanding zakayev 's extradition in 2004 " the new british prime minister has declared war on russia - a diplomatic one , " the pro-kremlin daily izvestia wrote , adding that russian courts were still waiting for british authorities to extradite oligarch boris berezovsky and chechen rebel leader ahmed zakayev .
" in russia there are ongoing criminal investigations against them but the british consider them ' politically persecuted kremlin opponents . ' ... it wo n't be long before an ' appropriate response ' from moscow -lsb- comes -rsb- .
but what does britain need a ' second front ' for when it has n't finished dealing with the terrorists who have declared a jihad against it ? " kommersant daily agreed .
" great britain and russia have begun a diplomatic war , " warning that " moscow 's reaction , judging from yesterday 's emotional commentary from russian officials , will be even more violent . " british newspapers sided with prime minister gordon brown 's government . " what choice have we ? " asked the daily mail .
" by refusing to extradite andrei lugovoi to face trial , -lsb- russian -rsb- president vladimir putin has committed an outrage that demands punishment ...
as it is , the new prime minister has come up with sanctions that will present putin with real difficulties in his dealings with the west .
mr. brown has faced his serious test as an international statesman - and passed it with ease . " the times also applauded the government 's decision , noting that " the key issue was what steps could be taken that were both measured and appropriate .
those announced yesterday were right .
britain will suffer , and cynics may argue that today 's measures are futile and counter-productive .
but they send a signal to all those who would silence their critics abroad : britain will protect those on its soil and can not overlook murder for the sake of diplomatic convenience . " similarly , the guardian said it was " reasonable " to expect russia to amend its constitution to allow for the extradition of its citizens , which is currently prohibited .
" if russia is seeking to integrate itself into the world business community , if it seeks for its citizens greater freedom of movement and fewer visa restrictions , if it seeks to cooperate in the fight against international terrorism , it has also got to live by the rules that most other european states subject themselves to , " the paper 's editorial read .

" bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin already said that there will be consequences after the extraditions but a few british papers also cautioned that the expulsions may lead to serious consequences . " the government should not be surprised if sanctions are extended to british companies in russia , " wrote the daily telegraph . the sun chimed in , adding that britain would have to secure public declarations of support from its allies in what it described as " the biggest test for european nerve since the cold war ... we have learned in two -lsb- world wars -rsb- not to appease bullies ...

british prosecutors had requested that andrei lugovoi , a former kgb officer , be extradited to face trial in britain for litvinenko 's murder , which russia rejected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstators in moscow demanding zakayev 's extradition in 2004 " the new british prime minister has declared war on russia - a diplomatic one , " the pro-kremlin daily izvestia wrote , adding that russian courts were still waiting for british authorities to extradite oligarch boris berezovsky and chechen rebel leader ahmed zakayev .
" in russia there are ongoing criminal investigations against them but the british consider them ' politically persecuted kremlin opponents . ' ... it wo n't be long before an ' appropriate response ' from moscow -lsb- comes -rsb- .
but what does britain need a ' second front ' for when it has n't finished dealing with the terrorists who have declared a jihad against it ? " kommersant daily agreed .
" great britain and russia have begun a diplomatic war , " warning that " moscow 's reaction , judging from yesterday 's emotional commentary from russian officials , will be even more violent . " british newspapers sided with prime minister gordon brown 's government . " what choice have we ? " asked the daily mail .
" by refusing to extradite andrei lugovoi to face trial , -lsb- russian -rsb- president vladimir putin has committed an outrage that demands punishment ...
as it is , the new prime minister has come up with sanctions that will present putin with real difficulties in his dealings with the west .
mr. brown has faced his serious test as an international statesman - and passed it with ease . " the times also applauded the government 's decision , noting that " the key issue was what steps could be taken that were both measured and appropriate .
those announced yesterday were right .
britain will suffer , and cynics may argue that today 's measures are futile and counter-productive .
but they send a signal to all those who would silence their critics abroad : britain will protect those on its soil and can not overlook murder for the sake of diplomatic convenience . " similarly , the guardian said it was " reasonable " to expect russia to amend its constitution to allow for the extradition of its citizens , which is currently prohibited .
" if russia is seeking to integrate itself into the world business community , if it seeks for its citizens greater freedom of movement and fewer visa restrictions , if it seeks to cooperate in the fight against international terrorism , it has also got to live by the rules that most other european states subject themselves to , " the paper 's editorial read .
" confrontation is in no one 's interest .
but nor is letting freelance murders take place on the streets of london . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin already said that there will be consequences after the extraditions but a few british papers also cautioned that the expulsions may lead to serious consequences .

belgrade has said it would give special autonomy to kosovo , but rejects full independence . un secretary general ban ki-moon , fearing that kosovo 's albanians would unilaterally declare independence , urged them on monday to instead let the security council settle the issue . in addition to kosovo , merkel and kostunica also discussed bilateral relations and the stabilization and security agreement that serbia hopes to have in place with the european union in october as a prelude towards full eu membership . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is apparent that the -lrb- british -rrb- sanctions are aimed at politicizing the litvinenko affair , " he added .
" this is a direct path to confrontation . " eu could be pulled into fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has promised to respond to the expulsion gruschko also said he hoped the european union would have " enough common sense " as to not allow itself to become an instrument in the affair . but the eu is likely to be pulled into any dispute between a member state and russia , according to luxemburg 's foreign minister jean asselborn . " naturally we are showing our solidarity with another eu member , but you also have to have the right to question certain steps , " asselborn told financial times deutschland , adding that he wondered if the dispute could have been settled using " silent , diplomatic channels . " german chancellor angela merkel gave her support to brown 's decision to expel the russians , who are rumored to be part of the embassy 's intelligence unit . " the decisions have been made after very careful consideration of the facts at hand in the united kingdom , " she said monday night after meeting with brown , who made berlin his first foreign stop as britain 's prime minister .
" we hope that this phase will be overcome as quickly as possible and that one can continue along the lines of having a very good cooperation , which is after all what you want with russia . " the french foreign ministry allow issued a statement tuesday calling for moscow to " constructively answer the british request . " uk also refused to extradite russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has demanded britain extradite chechen leader ahmed zakayev miliband told parliament monday there was a " significant body of evidence " of lugovoi 's involvement in the litvinenko murder , but russia has refused to extradite him to face trial in britain . according to the british public prosecutor , ex-kgb officer lugovoi is said to have killed former russian agent litvinenko by poisoning him with radioactive polonium-210 in november 2006 .
lugovoi has denied involvement in the case . the russian government condemned the diplomats ' expulsion as " provocative " and " immoral " and said it would have " the most serious consequences for russian-british relations as a whole . " grushko added that britain has refused to extradite 21 russians living in the uk and offered asylum to some of them . " if russia acted in the same manner as london , over 80 diplomats would have been expelled from the british embassy to russia , " grushko said business ties unlikely to be hurt both the british and russian governments emphasized that they did not anticipate their countries ' economic relationship to suffer due to the political confrontation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stop to energy deliveries damage both russia and the uk " we do not expect our disappointment with the russian authorities about the litvinenko case to affect the economic sphere , " british ambassador to russia tony brenton told reporters .
" indeed we expect british-russian economic ties to continue to grow . " grushko said that moscow would take international business interests into account when formulating its as yet unannounced response to the russian diplomats ' expulsion . " we will fully take into account the interests of ordinary citizens , tourists , participants in cultural and scientific exchanges and business circles , " he said .
" we do not want them to suffer because of london 's political actions . " russia , which has used its vast energy resources as a political instrument to limit fuel supplies to its neighbors in the past , would benefit little from such action with britain as the uk is one of the largest investors in russian energy markets and pumped nearly 4 billion euros into the branch last year , according to a report in britain 's times newspaper . a spokesman for britain 's foreign office said no retaliation by russia would be justified . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 17.07.2007 " this is the acid test for climate and energy policy " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel wants new climate and energy laws for germany by the end of the year german environment minister sigmar gabriel spoke to dw-tv about the environmental successes of germany 's eu and g8 presidencies , the need for a new kyoto protocol and problems at german nuclear power plants . dw-tv : mr. gabriel , at the european union summit earlier this year , the german chancellor reached a breakthrough on climate and energy policy in the eu .
the deal would see renewable energy sources making up 20 percent of europe 's energy by 2020 - a relatively ambitious goal . at the g8 summit in heiligendamm , the chancellor also managed to convince us president george w. bush to take on the problem of climate change .
it was clear before germany took over the rotating presidency of the eu that climate protection would be an important topic .
but , to be honest , did you expect these somewhat surprisingly positive results ? sigmar gabriel : yes .
that became clear in the meetings of the environment council that were held before the eu summit .
we all agreed on one position in the eu , but of course it is still a great success .
it was only possible because the heads of state and government got personally involved .
if meetings were only between environment ministers , then we would never have had the power to make sweeping changes .
climate change and energy policy is more than just an environmental issue .
it 's security , stability and economic policy .
the leaders realize this now and this is a great success for germany 's term as president of the eu .
it 's also been a success for the grand coalition in germany , for its climate and energy policy . but the real test lies ahead .
the promises made at heiligendamm now have to be fulfilled .
the un climate conference in bali in december is the next step to replace the kyoto protocol .
that runs out in 2012 and it is important that countries like china , india and the us show more willingness to take part in climate protection .
do you think it will be a success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel manage to work her magic with bush again ?
george bush has said that he will take part in the discussions , but he has not made any clear statements on the goals .
it 's a bit like the neil armstrong quote : it might be a giant leap for the americans - but only a small step for mankind .
we have to get a mandate for negotiation in bali .
then we will spend two years working out the new treaty .
the kyoto protocol ends in 2012 .
between 2009 and 2012 , we have to get the new treaty ratified across the world .
in germany we have to get it passed by the 16 federal states .
that takes time .
so you can just imagine how long it will take for the whole world .
we will need two years after the negotiations to get it passed by parliaments .
we have to have a new treaty ready to come into effect by jan 1 . , 2013 , that provides far more climate protection than the kyoto protocol .
it is of course also necessary that the international community backs the new treaty .
the countries that are responsible for climate change - the industrialized nations , and that includes europe and germany - have to show that you can have economic growth and increased energy efficiency . this is why we have to pass new climate and energy laws in germany by the end of the year .
the german chancellor not only has to convince seven federal states to pass these laws .
she also has to convince the state premiers from her own conservative block , which seems increasingly difficult .
we have worked well together with chancellor merkel and then we see our efforts undermined by conservative leaders .
we ca n't let this happen .
we ca n't demand that other countries participate and then do too little ourselves .
this is the acid test for climate and energy policy - we will see whether federal states run by conservatives block or pass the new laws . two weeks ago there was a meeting about this in the chancellery .
it was decided , against the will of german industry , to increase energy efficiency by 3 percent annually .
currently it 's only 1 percent .
those are pretty ambitious targets and german industry says it ca n't afford to do it .
how realistic is this goal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy consumption continues to be a touchy subject in germany i never understood the fact that industry was against these plans .
surely it 's in their interests to reduce energy costs .
when energy prices rise then it is prudent to reduce energy consumption .
by the way , our energy efficiency currently increases at a rate of 1.7 percent .
in times of economic growth energy efficiency also improves because plants become more efficient .
people buy new cars , which are more efficient .
so even without doing anything energy efficiency has risen to just under 2 percent .
now industry has to keep its promises and increase combined heat and power generation .
we will introduce new laws because they have not lived up to their promises .
we will do more on the consumer side - electrical goods will use less power , buildings will be better insulated .
for all that we will provide extra subsidies . the disputes between you and certain parts of industry in germany are often quite vocal .
there were press reports of comments you made - for example you said the actions of basf ceo hambrecht reminded you of business stalinism .
you were then accused of being an ecological bolshevik .
does it do any good to deal with each other in this way ? no , it does n't .
but sometimes you have to talk straight .
if business leaders say they will only continue to talk to the government when it does what they say , then i have to tell them to look at the constitution .
all state authority comes from the people through elections .
this is not about special interests , it 's about the good of the people .
i can understand that certain parts of german industry are annoyed that we are now putting more pressure on them to do what they promised in the first place but never actually did .
they pledged to reduce co2 emissions by 20 tons by 2005 .
the reality is 30 million tons extra were emitted , although high energy users like the chemical , steel , and aluminum industries actually cut co2 emissions .
but the energy industry itself increased emissions .
so you ca n't just simply speak of german industry as a whole . let 's stay on the topic of the power companies .
vattenfall , a swedish energy giant , had incidents recently at two nuclear plants in the north of germany .
without saying too much , let 's say that the information given by the company was questionable .
as a social democrat , does that give you more reason to stick by plans , or even increase pressure , to phase out nuclear energy in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the krümmel nuclear power plant has been shut down for the time being first of all , it shows that old power stations have risks .
it makes sense to close old nuclear power plants sooner and let newer power plants run longer .
this is because of the age and not necessarily because of the company that runs them , or the workers .
i 'm convinced that they are doing their jobs as well as possible .
the nuclear power law also states that old plants should close first .
but the energy companies want to do the opposite .
the reason is simple .
these old power plants have been completely paid off , so they make one million euros -lrb- $ 1.37 million -rrb- more profit a day than the newer plants .
but safety comes first . they have to close down the older plants and we will keep a strict eye on the plants that had incidents recently .
the krümmel plant will not be restarted until all problems have been solved .
this is particularly true of the communication problems .
vattenfall has finally agreed to let us talk directly to the people in charge at the time of the incidents .
we 're not out to get them .
we just want to find out how it happened so that we know how to react the next time and check other plants for similar dangers . we want to talk to the workers behind closed doors and we wo n't be holding any one person accountable .
i 'm sure they all tried to do their best .
but mistakes were made and we have to find out which ones . dw-tv 's jens thurau interviewed sigmar gabriel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the commission has said it favors the introduction of the genetically modified potato - which includes genes that make it resistant to antibiotics - since it will only be used for starch production and as animal feed .
" it will not enter the nutritional chain , " said a commission spokeswoman .
if the commission goes ahead with the authorization , it will be the first time since 1998 that a genetically engineered plant is given permission for large-scale cultivation in the eu .
however , the commission decision could take some time .
but international environmental group greenpeace said an eu go-ahead for cultivation of the potato would amount to allowing controversial genetically modified crops to enter the eu " through the back door . "
made in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists worry that gm potatoes interfere with the food chain italy and austria are leading the group of eu states which oppose the cultivation of genetically modified crops in the bloc .
other states , including britain , favor the move .
greenpeace has called on governments to reject the potato , which has been developed by german chemical company basf , saying it poses significant risks to health and the environment .
eu rules demand that genes which may have adverse effects on human health and the environment should be phased out .
however , the european food safety authority has given a positive opinion on the basf-developed potato , saying its antibiotic resistance genes do not pose a " relevant " risk to human health or the environment .
greenpeace has warned that the genetically engineered potato did not undergo full risk assessment including its effect on biodiversity .
the organization also said the potato could contaminate the food chain . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is apparent that the -lrb- british -rrb- sanctions are aimed at politicizing the litvinenko affair , " he added .
" this is a direct path to confrontation . " eu could be pulled into fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has promised to respond to the expulsion gruschko also said he hoped the european union would have " enough common sense " as to not allow itself to become an instrument in the affair . but the eu is likely to be pulled into any dispute between a member state and russia , according to luxemburg 's foreign minister jean asselborn . " naturally we are showing our solidarity with another eu member , but you also have to have the right to question certain steps , " asselborn told financial times deutschland , adding that he wondered if the dispute could have been settled using " silent , diplomatic channels . " german chancellor angela merkel gave her support to brown 's decision to expel the russians , who are rumored to be part of the embassy 's intelligence unit . " the decisions have been made after very careful consideration of the facts at hand in the united kingdom , " she said monday night after meeting with brown , who made berlin his first foreign stop as britain 's prime minister .
" we hope that this phase will be overcome as quickly as possible and that one can continue along the lines of having a very good cooperation , which is after all what you want with russia . " the french foreign ministry allow issued a statement tuesday calling for moscow to " constructively answer the british request . " uk also refused to extradite russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has demanded britain extradite chechen leader ahmed zakayev miliband told parliament monday there was a " significant body of evidence " of lugovoi 's involvement in the litvinenko murder , but russia has refused to extradite him to face trial in britain . according to the british public prosecutor , ex-kgb officer lugovoi is said to have killed former russian agent litvinenko by poisoning him with radioactive polonium-210 in november 2006 .
lugovoi has denied involvement in the case . the russian government condemned the diplomats ' expulsion as " provocative " and " immoral " and said it would have " the most serious consequences for russian-british relations as a whole . " grushko added that britain has refused to extradite 21 russians living in the uk and offered asylum to some of them . " if russia acted in the same manner as london , over 80 diplomats would have been expelled from the british embassy to russia , " grushko said business ties unlikely to be hurt both the british and russian governments emphasized that they did not anticipate their countries ' economic relationship to suffer due to the political confrontation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stop to energy deliveries damage both russia and the uk " we do not expect our disappointment with the russian authorities about the litvinenko case to affect the economic sphere , " british ambassador to russia tony brenton told reporters .
" indeed we expect british-russian economic ties to continue to grow . " grushko said that moscow would take international business interests into account when formulating its as yet unannounced response to the russian diplomats ' expulsion . " we will fully take into account the interests of ordinary citizens , tourists , participants in cultural and scientific exchanges and business circles , " he said .
" we do not want them to suffer because of london 's political actions . " russia , which has used its vast energy resources as a political instrument to limit fuel supplies to its neighbors in the past , would benefit little from such action with britain as the uk is one of the largest investors in russian energy markets and pumped nearly 4 billion euros into the branch last year , according to a report in britain 's times newspaper . a spokesman for britain 's foreign office said no retaliation by russia would be justified . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

british prosecutors had requested that andrei lugovoi , a former kgb officer , be extradited to face trial in britain for litvinenko 's murder , which russia rejected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstators in moscow demanding zakayev 's extradition in 2004 " the new british prime minister has declared war on russia - a diplomatic one , " the pro-kremlin daily izvestia wrote , adding that russian courts were still waiting for british authorities to extradite oligarch boris berezovsky and chechen rebel leader ahmed zakayev .
" in russia there are ongoing criminal investigations against them but the british consider them ' politically persecuted kremlin opponents . ' ... it wo n't be long before an ' appropriate response ' from moscow -lsb- comes -rsb- .
but what does britain need a ' second front ' for when it has n't finished dealing with the terrorists who have declared a jihad against it ? " kommersant daily agreed .
" great britain and russia have begun a diplomatic war , " warning that " moscow 's reaction , judging from yesterday 's emotional commentary from russian officials , will be even more violent . " british newspapers sided with prime minister gordon brown 's government . " what choice have we ? " asked the daily mail .
" by refusing to extradite andrei lugovoi to face trial , -lsb- russian -rsb- president vladimir putin has committed an outrage that demands punishment ...
as it is , the new prime minister has come up with sanctions that will present putin with real difficulties in his dealings with the west .
mr. brown has faced his serious test as an international statesman - and passed it with ease . " the times also applauded the government 's decision , noting that " the key issue was what steps could be taken that were both measured and appropriate .
those announced yesterday were right .
britain will suffer , and cynics may argue that today 's measures are futile and counter-productive .
but they send a signal to all those who would silence their critics abroad : britain will protect those on its soil and can not overlook murder for the sake of diplomatic convenience . " similarly , the guardian said it was " reasonable " to expect russia to amend its constitution to allow for the extradition of its citizens , which is currently prohibited .
" if russia is seeking to integrate itself into the world business community , if it seeks for its citizens greater freedom of movement and fewer visa restrictions , if it seeks to cooperate in the fight against international terrorism , it has also got to live by the rules that most other european states subject themselves to , " the paper 's editorial read .
" confrontation is in no one 's interest .
but nor is letting freelance murders take place on the streets of london . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin already said that there will be consequences after the extraditions but a few british papers also cautioned that the expulsions may lead to serious consequences . " the government should not be surprised if sanctions are extended to british companies in russia , " wrote the daily telegraph . the sun chimed in , adding that britain would have to secure public declarations of support from its allies in what it described as " the biggest test for european nerve since the cold war ... we have learned in two -lsb- world wars -rsb- not to appease bullies ...

the commission has said it favors the introduction of the genetically modified potato - which includes genes that make it resistant to antibiotics - since it will only be used for starch production and as animal feed .
" it will not enter the nutritional chain , " said a commission spokeswoman .
if the commission goes ahead with the authorization , it will be the first time since 1998 that a genetically engineered plant is given permission for large-scale cultivation in the eu .
however , the commission decision could take some time .
but international environmental group greenpeace said an eu go-ahead for cultivation of the potato would amount to allowing controversial genetically modified crops to enter the eu " through the back door . "
made in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists worry that gm potatoes interfere with the food chain italy and austria are leading the group of eu states which oppose the cultivation of genetically modified crops in the bloc .
other states , including britain , favor the move .
greenpeace has called on governments to reject the potato , which has been developed by german chemical company basf , saying it poses significant risks to health and the environment .
eu rules demand that genes which may have adverse effects on human health and the environment should be phased out .
however , the european food safety authority has given a positive opinion on the basf-developed potato , saying its antibiotic resistance genes do not pose a " relevant " risk to human health or the environment .
greenpeace has warned that the genetically engineered potato did not undergo full risk assessment including its effect on biodiversity .
the organization also said the potato could contaminate the food chain . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal would see renewable energy sources making up 20 percent of europe 's energy by 2020 - a relatively ambitious goal . at the g8 summit in heiligendamm , the chancellor also managed to convince us president george w. bush to take on the problem of climate change .
it was clear before germany took over the rotating presidency of the eu that climate protection would be an important topic .
but , to be honest , did you expect these somewhat surprisingly positive results ? sigmar gabriel : yes .
that became clear in the meetings of the environment council that were held before the eu summit .
we all agreed on one position in the eu , but of course it is still a great success .
it was only possible because the heads of state and government got personally involved .
if meetings were only between environment ministers , then we would never have had the power to make sweeping changes .
climate change and energy policy is more than just an environmental issue .
it 's security , stability and economic policy .
the leaders realize this now and this is a great success for germany 's term as president of the eu .
it 's also been a success for the grand coalition in germany , for its climate and energy policy . but the real test lies ahead .
the promises made at heiligendamm now have to be fulfilled .
the un climate conference in bali in december is the next step to replace the kyoto protocol .
that runs out in 2012 and it is important that countries like china , india and the us show more willingness to take part in climate protection .
do you think it will be a success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel manage to work her magic with bush again ?
george bush has said that he will take part in the discussions , but he has not made any clear statements on the goals .
it 's a bit like the neil armstrong quote : it might be a giant leap for the americans - but only a small step for mankind .
we have to get a mandate for negotiation in bali .
then we will spend two years working out the new treaty .
the kyoto protocol ends in 2012 .
between 2009 and 2012 , we have to get the new treaty ratified across the world .
in germany we have to get it passed by the 16 federal states .
that takes time .
so you can just imagine how long it will take for the whole world .
we will need two years after the negotiations to get it passed by parliaments .
we have to have a new treaty ready to come into effect by jan 1 . , 2013 , that provides far more climate protection than the kyoto protocol .
it is of course also necessary that the international community backs the new treaty .
the countries that are responsible for climate change - the industrialized nations , and that includes europe and germany - have to show that you can have economic growth and increased energy efficiency . this is why we have to pass new climate and energy laws in germany by the end of the year .
the german chancellor not only has to convince seven federal states to pass these laws .
she also has to convince the state premiers from her own conservative block , which seems increasingly difficult .
we have worked well together with chancellor merkel and then we see our efforts undermined by conservative leaders .
we ca n't let this happen .
we ca n't demand that other countries participate and then do too little ourselves .
this is the acid test for climate and energy policy - we will see whether federal states run by conservatives block or pass the new laws . two weeks ago there was a meeting about this in the chancellery .
it was decided , against the will of german industry , to increase energy efficiency by 3 percent annually .
currently it 's only 1 percent .
those are pretty ambitious targets and german industry says it ca n't afford to do it .
how realistic is this goal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy consumption continues to be a touchy subject in germany i never understood the fact that industry was against these plans .
surely it 's in their interests to reduce energy costs .
when energy prices rise then it is prudent to reduce energy consumption .
by the way , our energy efficiency currently increases at a rate of 1.7 percent .
in times of economic growth energy efficiency also improves because plants become more efficient .
people buy new cars , which are more efficient .
so even without doing anything energy efficiency has risen to just under 2 percent .
now industry has to keep its promises and increase combined heat and power generation .
we will introduce new laws because they have not lived up to their promises .
we will do more on the consumer side - electrical goods will use less power , buildings will be better insulated .
for all that we will provide extra subsidies . the disputes between you and certain parts of industry in germany are often quite vocal .
there were press reports of comments you made - for example you said the actions of basf ceo hambrecht reminded you of business stalinism .
you were then accused of being an ecological bolshevik .
does it do any good to deal with each other in this way ? no , it does n't .
but sometimes you have to talk straight .
if business leaders say they will only continue to talk to the government when it does what they say , then i have to tell them to look at the constitution .
all state authority comes from the people through elections .
this is not about special interests , it 's about the good of the people .
i can understand that certain parts of german industry are annoyed that we are now putting more pressure on them to do what they promised in the first place but never actually did .
they pledged to reduce co2 emissions by 20 tons by 2005 .
the reality is 30 million tons extra were emitted , although high energy users like the chemical , steel , and aluminum industries actually cut co2 emissions .
but the energy industry itself increased emissions .
so you ca n't just simply speak of german industry as a whole . let 's stay on the topic of the power companies .
vattenfall , a swedish energy giant , had incidents recently at two nuclear plants in the north of germany .
without saying too much , let 's say that the information given by the company was questionable .
as a social democrat , does that give you more reason to stick by plans , or even increase pressure , to phase out nuclear energy in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the krümmel nuclear power plant has been shut down for the time being first of all , it shows that old power stations have risks .
it makes sense to close old nuclear power plants sooner and let newer power plants run longer .
this is because of the age and not necessarily because of the company that runs them , or the workers .
i 'm convinced that they are doing their jobs as well as possible .
the nuclear power law also states that old plants should close first .
but the energy companies want to do the opposite .
the reason is simple .
these old power plants have been completely paid off , so they make one million euros -lrb- $ 1.37 million -rrb- more profit a day than the newer plants .
but safety comes first . they have to close down the older plants and we will keep a strict eye on the plants that had incidents recently .
the krümmel plant will not be restarted until all problems have been solved .
this is particularly true of the communication problems .
vattenfall has finally agreed to let us talk directly to the people in charge at the time of the incidents .
we 're not out to get them .
we just want to find out how it happened so that we know how to react the next time and check other plants for similar dangers . we want to talk to the workers behind closed doors and we wo n't be holding any one person accountable .
i 'm sure they all tried to do their best .
but mistakes were made and we have to find out which ones . dw-tv 's jens thurau interviewed sigmar gabriel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

those are pretty ambitious targets and german industry says it ca n't afford to do it .
how realistic is this goal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy consumption continues to be a touchy subject in germany i never understood the fact that industry was against these plans .
surely it 's in their interests to reduce energy costs .
when energy prices rise then it is prudent to reduce energy consumption .
by the way , our energy efficiency currently increases at a rate of 1.7 percent .
in times of economic growth energy efficiency also improves because plants become more efficient .
people buy new cars , which are more efficient .
so even without doing anything energy efficiency has risen to just under 2 percent .
now industry has to keep its promises and increase combined heat and power generation .
we will introduce new laws because they have not lived up to their promises .
we will do more on the consumer side - electrical goods will use less power , buildings will be better insulated .
for all that we will provide extra subsidies . the disputes between you and certain parts of industry in germany are often quite vocal .
there were press reports of comments you made - for example you said the actions of basf ceo hambrecht reminded you of business stalinism .
you were then accused of being an ecological bolshevik .
does it do any good to deal with each other in this way ? no , it does n't .
but sometimes you have to talk straight .
if business leaders say they will only continue to talk to the government when it does what they say , then i have to tell them to look at the constitution .
all state authority comes from the people through elections .
this is not about special interests , it 's about the good of the people .
i can understand that certain parts of german industry are annoyed that we are now putting more pressure on them to do what they promised in the first place but never actually did .
they pledged to reduce co2 emissions by 20 tons by 2005 .
the reality is 30 million tons extra were emitted , although high energy users like the chemical , steel , and aluminum industries actually cut co2 emissions .
but the energy industry itself increased emissions .
so you ca n't just simply speak of german industry as a whole . let 's stay on the topic of the power companies .
vattenfall , a swedish energy giant , had incidents recently at two nuclear plants in the north of germany .
without saying too much , let 's say that the information given by the company was questionable .
as a social democrat , does that give you more reason to stick by plans , or even increase pressure , to phase out nuclear energy in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the krümmel nuclear power plant has been shut down for the time being first of all , it shows that old power stations have risks .
it makes sense to close old nuclear power plants sooner and let newer power plants run longer .
this is because of the age and not necessarily because of the company that runs them , or the workers .
i 'm convinced that they are doing their jobs as well as possible .
the nuclear power law also states that old plants should close first .
but the energy companies want to do the opposite .
the reason is simple .
these old power plants have been completely paid off , so they make one million euros -lrb- $ 1.37 million -rrb- more profit a day than the newer plants .
but safety comes first . they have to close down the older plants and we will keep a strict eye on the plants that had incidents recently .
the krümmel plant will not be restarted until all problems have been solved .
this is particularly true of the communication problems .
vattenfall has finally agreed to let us talk directly to the people in charge at the time of the incidents .
we 're not out to get them .
we just want to find out how it happened so that we know how to react the next time and check other plants for similar dangers . we want to talk to the workers behind closed doors and we wo n't be holding any one person accountable .

the deal would see renewable energy sources making up 20 percent of europe 's energy by 2020 - a relatively ambitious goal . at the g8 summit in heiligendamm , the chancellor also managed to convince us president george w. bush to take on the problem of climate change .
it was clear before germany took over the rotating presidency of the eu that climate protection would be an important topic .
but , to be honest , did you expect these somewhat surprisingly positive results ? sigmar gabriel : yes .
that became clear in the meetings of the environment council that were held before the eu summit .
we all agreed on one position in the eu , but of course it is still a great success .
it was only possible because the heads of state and government got personally involved .
if meetings were only between environment ministers , then we would never have had the power to make sweeping changes .
climate change and energy policy is more than just an environmental issue .
it 's security , stability and economic policy .
the leaders realize this now and this is a great success for germany 's term as president of the eu .
it 's also been a success for the grand coalition in germany , for its climate and energy policy . but the real test lies ahead .
the promises made at heiligendamm now have to be fulfilled .
the un climate conference in bali in december is the next step to replace the kyoto protocol .
that runs out in 2012 and it is important that countries like china , india and the us show more willingness to take part in climate protection .
do you think it will be a success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel manage to work her magic with bush again ?
george bush has said that he will take part in the discussions , but he has not made any clear statements on the goals .
it 's a bit like the neil armstrong quote : it might be a giant leap for the americans - but only a small step for mankind .
we have to get a mandate for negotiation in bali .
then we will spend two years working out the new treaty .
the kyoto protocol ends in 2012 .
between 2009 and 2012 , we have to get the new treaty ratified across the world .
in germany we have to get it passed by the 16 federal states .
that takes time .
so you can just imagine how long it will take for the whole world .
we will need two years after the negotiations to get it passed by parliaments .
we have to have a new treaty ready to come into effect by jan 1 . , 2013 , that provides far more climate protection than the kyoto protocol .
it is of course also necessary that the international community backs the new treaty .
the countries that are responsible for climate change - the industrialized nations , and that includes europe and germany - have to show that you can have economic growth and increased energy efficiency . this is why we have to pass new climate and energy laws in germany by the end of the year .
the german chancellor not only has to convince seven federal states to pass these laws .
she also has to convince the state premiers from her own conservative block , which seems increasingly difficult .
we have worked well together with chancellor merkel and then we see our efforts undermined by conservative leaders .
we ca n't let this happen .
we ca n't demand that other countries participate and then do too little ourselves .
this is the acid test for climate and energy policy - we will see whether federal states run by conservatives block or pass the new laws . two weeks ago there was a meeting about this in the chancellery .
it was decided , against the will of german industry , to increase energy efficiency by 3 percent annually .
currently it 's only 1 percent .
those are pretty ambitious targets and german industry says it ca n't afford to do it .

" it is apparent that the -lrb- british -rrb- sanctions are aimed at politicizing the litvinenko affair , " he added .
" this is a direct path to confrontation . " eu could be pulled into fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has promised to respond to the expulsion gruschko also said he hoped the european union would have " enough common sense " as to not allow itself to become an instrument in the affair . but the eu is likely to be pulled into any dispute between a member state and russia , according to luxemburg 's foreign minister jean asselborn . " naturally we are showing our solidarity with another eu member , but you also have to have the right to question certain steps , " asselborn told financial times deutschland , adding that he wondered if the dispute could have been settled using " silent , diplomatic channels . " german chancellor angela merkel gave her support to brown 's decision to expel the russians , who are rumored to be part of the embassy 's intelligence unit . " the decisions have been made after very careful consideration of the facts at hand in the united kingdom , " she said monday night after meeting with brown , who made berlin his first foreign stop as britain 's prime minister .

lugovoi has denied involvement in the case . the russian government condemned the diplomats ' expulsion as " provocative " and " immoral " and said it would have " the most serious consequences for russian-british relations as a whole . " grushko added that britain has refused to extradite 21 russians living in the uk and offered asylum to some of them . " if russia acted in the same manner as london , over 80 diplomats would have been expelled from the british embassy to russia , " grushko said business ties unlikely to be hurt both the british and russian governments emphasized that they did not anticipate their countries ' economic relationship to suffer due to the political confrontation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stop to energy deliveries damage both russia and the uk " we do not expect our disappointment with the russian authorities about the litvinenko case to affect the economic sphere , " british ambassador to russia tony brenton told reporters .

" grushko said that moscow would take international business interests into account when formulating its as yet unannounced response to the russian diplomats ' expulsion . " we will fully take into account the interests of ordinary citizens , tourists , participants in cultural and scientific exchanges and business circles , " he said .
" we do not want them to suffer because of london 's political actions . " russia , which has used its vast energy resources as a political instrument to limit fuel supplies to its neighbors in the past , would benefit little from such action with britain as the uk is one of the largest investors in russian energy markets and pumped nearly 4 billion euros into the branch last year , according to a report in britain 's times newspaper . a spokesman for britain 's foreign office said no retaliation by russia would be justified . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bulgaria wants the six , now facing life imprisonment , to be transferred to sofia . " the high judicial council decided to commute the death sentences against the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor to life-imprisonment terms , " the council said in a brief statement on tuesday . the decision was greeted with relief by the eu and the us even as critics say they would have liked the medics , who say they are innocent , to be pardoned . bulgaria said it would ask libya to transfer the six medics to sofia . " this decision is a big step ...
for us the case will end once they come back to bulgaria , " foreign minister ivailo kalfin told reporters .
he said the decision of libya 's high judicial council to commute the death sentences to life imprisonment allowed sofia to use an agreement with tripoli on exchange of prisoners and request the transfer of the five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor , who has received bulgarian citizenship . " tomorrow morning we will start working on implementing the transfer of the medics , " kalfin said . sussanah sherkin , deputy director of physicians for human rights said she hoped the medics would be pardoned . " we can only hope in the hours ahead a pardon will be issued and this ordeal will be over , " she said . " the entire world is watching this processs and we are very hopeful given all of the engagement of world leaders , human rights groups and the bulgarians in this case . " relatives of hiv children drop death sentence demand libya 's decision followed news that relatives of the libyan hiv-infected children had agreed to drop their demand that five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor , all of whom were convicted in december , be executed . " we have notified in writing that the families have relinquished their demand for the execution " of the six medics , idriss lagha , the head of the libyan-based association for the families of hiv-infected children , told the associated press . lagha said the families had renounced asking for the death of the medics because they had received all the compensation money they were due under a settlement reached last week .
" all the families have received their cash transfer , one million dollars for each infection , " lagha told ap . earlier , libya had said it had given checks to more than 50 percent of the families whose children were killed by the aids virus . medics say they are innocent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the high judiciary council is the last place the medics can appeal their sentence the nurses , who have been in jail since 1999 , maintain their innocence and have said they confessed to the accusations under torture . foreign experts familiar with libya have blamed the country 's poor health care system and unhygienic conditions for the infections that have led to 56 children 's deaths , prompting widespread anger in libya . the victims ' families have said the case was part of a western attempt to undermine muslims and libya .

" i do hope that the high judicial council today would come out with a ruling and i do hope of course for clemency for the bulgarian nurses and the palestinian medic , " she told reporters in brussels earlier . the european commission , however , has rejected claims that it played a political role in the deal , though it has committed 2.5 million euros to the compensation fund that was created by tripoli and sofia in 2005 . article compiled with wire reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal would see renewable energy sources making up 20 percent of europe 's energy by 2020 - a relatively ambitious goal . at the g8 summit in heiligendamm , the chancellor also managed to convince us president george w. bush to take on the problem of climate change .
it was clear before germany took over the rotating presidency of the eu that climate protection would be an important topic .
but , to be honest , did you expect these somewhat surprisingly positive results ? sigmar gabriel : yes .
that became clear in the meetings of the environment council that were held before the eu summit .
we all agreed on one position in the eu , but of course it is still a great success .
it was only possible because the heads of state and government got personally involved .
if meetings were only between environment ministers , then we would never have had the power to make sweeping changes .
climate change and energy policy is more than just an environmental issue .
it 's security , stability and economic policy .
the leaders realize this now and this is a great success for germany 's term as president of the eu .
it 's also been a success for the grand coalition in germany , for its climate and energy policy . but the real test lies ahead .
the promises made at heiligendamm now have to be fulfilled .
the un climate conference in bali in december is the next step to replace the kyoto protocol .
that runs out in 2012 and it is important that countries like china , india and the us show more willingness to take part in climate protection .
do you think it will be a success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel manage to work her magic with bush again ?
george bush has said that he will take part in the discussions , but he has not made any clear statements on the goals .
it 's a bit like the neil armstrong quote : it might be a giant leap for the americans - but only a small step for mankind .
we have to get a mandate for negotiation in bali .
then we will spend two years working out the new treaty .
the kyoto protocol ends in 2012 .
between 2009 and 2012 , we have to get the new treaty ratified across the world .
in germany we have to get it passed by the 16 federal states .
that takes time .
so you can just imagine how long it will take for the whole world .
we will need two years after the negotiations to get it passed by parliaments .
we have to have a new treaty ready to come into effect by jan 1 . , 2013 , that provides far more climate protection than the kyoto protocol .
it is of course also necessary that the international community backs the new treaty .
the countries that are responsible for climate change - the industrialized nations , and that includes europe and germany - have to show that you can have economic growth and increased energy efficiency . this is why we have to pass new climate and energy laws in germany by the end of the year .
the german chancellor not only has to convince seven federal states to pass these laws .
she also has to convince the state premiers from her own conservative block , which seems increasingly difficult .
we have worked well together with chancellor merkel and then we see our efforts undermined by conservative leaders .
we ca n't let this happen .
we ca n't demand that other countries participate and then do too little ourselves .
this is the acid test for climate and energy policy - we will see whether federal states run by conservatives block or pass the new laws . two weeks ago there was a meeting about this in the chancellery .
it was decided , against the will of german industry , to increase energy efficiency by 3 percent annually .
currently it 's only 1 percent .
those are pretty ambitious targets and german industry says it ca n't afford to do it .
how realistic is this goal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy consumption continues to be a touchy subject in germany i never understood the fact that industry was against these plans .
surely it 's in their interests to reduce energy costs .
when energy prices rise then it is prudent to reduce energy consumption .
by the way , our energy efficiency currently increases at a rate of 1.7 percent .
in times of economic growth energy efficiency also improves because plants become more efficient .
people buy new cars , which are more efficient .
so even without doing anything energy efficiency has risen to just under 2 percent .
now industry has to keep its promises and increase combined heat and power generation .
we will introduce new laws because they have not lived up to their promises .
we will do more on the consumer side - electrical goods will use less power , buildings will be better insulated .
for all that we will provide extra subsidies . the disputes between you and certain parts of industry in germany are often quite vocal .
there were press reports of comments you made - for example you said the actions of basf ceo hambrecht reminded you of business stalinism .
you were then accused of being an ecological bolshevik .
does it do any good to deal with each other in this way ? no , it does n't .
but sometimes you have to talk straight .
if business leaders say they will only continue to talk to the government when it does what they say , then i have to tell them to look at the constitution .
all state authority comes from the people through elections .
this is not about special interests , it 's about the good of the people .
i can understand that certain parts of german industry are annoyed that we are now putting more pressure on them to do what they promised in the first place but never actually did .
they pledged to reduce co2 emissions by 20 tons by 2005 .
the reality is 30 million tons extra were emitted , although high energy users like the chemical , steel , and aluminum industries actually cut co2 emissions .
but the energy industry itself increased emissions .
so you ca n't just simply speak of german industry as a whole . let 's stay on the topic of the power companies .
vattenfall , a swedish energy giant , had incidents recently at two nuclear plants in the north of germany .
without saying too much , let 's say that the information given by the company was questionable .
as a social democrat , does that give you more reason to stick by plans , or even increase pressure , to phase out nuclear energy in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the krümmel nuclear power plant has been shut down for the time being first of all , it shows that old power stations have risks .
it makes sense to close old nuclear power plants sooner and let newer power plants run longer .
this is because of the age and not necessarily because of the company that runs them , or the workers .
i 'm convinced that they are doing their jobs as well as possible .
the nuclear power law also states that old plants should close first .
but the energy companies want to do the opposite .
the reason is simple .
these old power plants have been completely paid off , so they make one million euros -lrb- $ 1.37 million -rrb- more profit a day than the newer plants .
but safety comes first . they have to close down the older plants and we will keep a strict eye on the plants that had incidents recently .
the krümmel plant will not be restarted until all problems have been solved .
this is particularly true of the communication problems .
vattenfall has finally agreed to let us talk directly to the people in charge at the time of the incidents .
we 're not out to get them .
we just want to find out how it happened so that we know how to react the next time and check other plants for similar dangers . we want to talk to the workers behind closed doors and we wo n't be holding any one person accountable .
i 'm sure they all tried to do their best .
but mistakes were made and we have to find out which ones . dw-tv 's jens thurau interviewed sigmar gabriel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the commission has said it favors the introduction of the genetically modified potato - which includes genes that make it resistant to antibiotics - since it will only be used for starch production and as animal feed .
" it will not enter the nutritional chain , " said a commission spokeswoman .
if the commission goes ahead with the authorization , it will be the first time since 1998 that a genetically engineered plant is given permission for large-scale cultivation in the eu .
however , the commission decision could take some time .
but international environmental group greenpeace said an eu go-ahead for cultivation of the potato would amount to allowing controversial genetically modified crops to enter the eu " through the back door . "
made in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists worry that gm potatoes interfere with the food chain italy and austria are leading the group of eu states which oppose the cultivation of genetically modified crops in the bloc .
other states , including britain , favor the move .
greenpeace has called on governments to reject the potato , which has been developed by german chemical company basf , saying it poses significant risks to health and the environment .
eu rules demand that genes which may have adverse effects on human health and the environment should be phased out .
however , the european food safety authority has given a positive opinion on the basf-developed potato , saying its antibiotic resistance genes do not pose a " relevant " risk to human health or the environment .
greenpeace has warned that the genetically engineered potato did not undergo full risk assessment including its effect on biodiversity .
the organization also said the potato could contaminate the food chain . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the decisions have been made after very careful consideration of the facts at hand in the united kingdom , " she said monday night after meeting with brown , who made berlin his first foreign stop as britain 's prime minister .
" we hope that this phase will be overcome as quickly as possible and that one can continue along the lines of having a very good cooperation , which is after all what you want with russia . " the french foreign ministry allow issued a statement tuesday calling for moscow to " constructively answer the british request .

lugovoi has denied involvement in the case . the russian government condemned the diplomats ' expulsion as " provocative " and " immoral " and said it would have " the most serious consequences for russian-british relations as a whole . " grushko added that britain has refused to extradite 21 russians living in the uk and offered asylum to some of them . " if russia acted in the same manner as london , over 80 diplomats would have been expelled from the british embassy to russia , " grushko said business ties unlikely to be hurt both the british and russian governments emphasized that they did not anticipate their countries ' economic relationship to suffer due to the political confrontation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stop to energy deliveries damage both russia and the uk " we do not expect our disappointment with the russian authorities about the litvinenko case to affect the economic sphere , " british ambassador to russia tony brenton told reporters .
" indeed we expect british-russian economic ties to continue to grow . " grushko said that moscow would take international business interests into account when formulating its as yet unannounced response to the russian diplomats ' expulsion . " we will fully take into account the interests of ordinary citizens , tourists , participants in cultural and scientific exchanges and business circles , " he said .
" we do not want them to suffer because of london 's political actions . " russia , which has used its vast energy resources as a political instrument to limit fuel supplies to its neighbors in the past , would benefit little from such action with britain as the uk is one of the largest investors in russian energy markets and pumped nearly 4 billion euros into the branch last year , according to a report in britain 's times newspaper . a spokesman for britain 's foreign office said no retaliation by russia would be justified . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

belgrade has said it would give special autonomy to kosovo , but rejects full independence . un secretary general ban ki-moon , fearing that kosovo 's albanians would unilaterally declare independence , urged them on monday to instead let the security council settle the issue . in addition to kosovo , merkel and kostunica also discussed bilateral relations and the stabilization and security agreement that serbia hopes to have in place with the european union in october as a prelude towards full eu membership . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the commission has said it favors the introduction of the genetically modified potato - which includes genes that make it resistant to antibiotics - since it will only be used for starch production and as animal feed .
" it will not enter the nutritional chain , " said a commission spokeswoman .
if the commission goes ahead with the authorization , it will be the first time since 1998 that a genetically engineered plant is given permission for large-scale cultivation in the eu .
however , the commission decision could take some time .
but international environmental group greenpeace said an eu go-ahead for cultivation of the potato would amount to allowing controversial genetically modified crops to enter the eu " through the back door . "
made in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists worry that gm potatoes interfere with the food chain italy and austria are leading the group of eu states which oppose the cultivation of genetically modified crops in the bloc .
other states , including britain , favor the move .
greenpeace has called on governments to reject the potato , which has been developed by german chemical company basf , saying it poses significant risks to health and the environment .
eu rules demand that genes which may have adverse effects on human health and the environment should be phased out .
however , the european food safety authority has given a positive opinion on the basf-developed potato , saying its antibiotic resistance genes do not pose a " relevant " risk to human health or the environment .
greenpeace has warned that the genetically engineered potato did not undergo full risk assessment including its effect on biodiversity .
the organization also said the potato could contaminate the food chain . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is apparent that the -lrb- british -rrb- sanctions are aimed at politicizing the litvinenko affair , " he added .
" this is a direct path to confrontation . " eu could be pulled into fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has promised to respond to the expulsion gruschko also said he hoped the european union would have " enough common sense " as to not allow itself to become an instrument in the affair . but the eu is likely to be pulled into any dispute between a member state and russia , according to luxemburg 's foreign minister jean asselborn . " naturally we are showing our solidarity with another eu member , but you also have to have the right to question certain steps , " asselborn told financial times deutschland , adding that he wondered if the dispute could have been settled using " silent , diplomatic channels . " german chancellor angela merkel gave her support to brown 's decision to expel the russians , who are rumored to be part of the embassy 's intelligence unit . " the decisions have been made after very careful consideration of the facts at hand in the united kingdom , " she said monday night after meeting with brown , who made berlin his first foreign stop as britain 's prime minister .
" we hope that this phase will be overcome as quickly as possible and that one can continue along the lines of having a very good cooperation , which is after all what you want with russia . " the french foreign ministry allow issued a statement tuesday calling for moscow to " constructively answer the british request . " uk also refused to extradite russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has demanded britain extradite chechen leader ahmed zakayev miliband told parliament monday there was a " significant body of evidence " of lugovoi 's involvement in the litvinenko murder , but russia has refused to extradite him to face trial in britain . according to the british public prosecutor , ex-kgb officer lugovoi is said to have killed former russian agent litvinenko by poisoning him with radioactive polonium-210 in november 2006 .
lugovoi has denied involvement in the case . the russian government condemned the diplomats ' expulsion as " provocative " and " immoral " and said it would have " the most serious consequences for russian-british relations as a whole . " grushko added that britain has refused to extradite 21 russians living in the uk and offered asylum to some of them . " if russia acted in the same manner as london , over 80 diplomats would have been expelled from the british embassy to russia , " grushko said business ties unlikely to be hurt both the british and russian governments emphasized that they did not anticipate their countries ' economic relationship to suffer due to the political confrontation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stop to energy deliveries damage both russia and the uk " we do not expect our disappointment with the russian authorities about the litvinenko case to affect the economic sphere , " british ambassador to russia tony brenton told reporters .
" indeed we expect british-russian economic ties to continue to grow . " grushko said that moscow would take international business interests into account when formulating its as yet unannounced response to the russian diplomats ' expulsion . " we will fully take into account the interests of ordinary citizens , tourists , participants in cultural and scientific exchanges and business circles , " he said .
" we do not want them to suffer because of london 's political actions . " russia , which has used its vast energy resources as a political instrument to limit fuel supplies to its neighbors in the past , would benefit little from such action with britain as the uk is one of the largest investors in russian energy markets and pumped nearly 4 billion euros into the branch last year , according to a report in britain 's times newspaper . a spokesman for britain 's foreign office said no retaliation by russia would be justified . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

british prosecutors had requested that andrei lugovoi , a former kgb officer , be extradited to face trial in britain for litvinenko 's murder , which russia rejected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstators in moscow demanding zakayev 's extradition in 2004 " the new british prime minister has declared war on russia - a diplomatic one , " the pro-kremlin daily izvestia wrote , adding that russian courts were still waiting for british authorities to extradite oligarch boris berezovsky and chechen rebel leader ahmed zakayev .
" in russia there are ongoing criminal investigations against them but the british consider them ' politically persecuted kremlin opponents . ' ... it wo n't be long before an ' appropriate response ' from moscow -lsb- comes -rsb- .
but what does britain need a ' second front ' for when it has n't finished dealing with the terrorists who have declared a jihad against it ? " kommersant daily agreed .
" great britain and russia have begun a diplomatic war , " warning that " moscow 's reaction , judging from yesterday 's emotional commentary from russian officials , will be even more violent . " british newspapers sided with prime minister gordon brown 's government . " what choice have we ? " asked the daily mail .
" by refusing to extradite andrei lugovoi to face trial , -lsb- russian -rsb- president vladimir putin has committed an outrage that demands punishment ...
as it is , the new prime minister has come up with sanctions that will present putin with real difficulties in his dealings with the west .
mr. brown has faced his serious test as an international statesman - and passed it with ease . " the times also applauded the government 's decision , noting that " the key issue was what steps could be taken that were both measured and appropriate .
those announced yesterday were right .
britain will suffer , and cynics may argue that today 's measures are futile and counter-productive .
but they send a signal to all those who would silence their critics abroad : britain will protect those on its soil and can not overlook murder for the sake of diplomatic convenience . " similarly , the guardian said it was " reasonable " to expect russia to amend its constitution to allow for the extradition of its citizens , which is currently prohibited .
" if russia is seeking to integrate itself into the world business community , if it seeks for its citizens greater freedom of movement and fewer visa restrictions , if it seeks to cooperate in the fight against international terrorism , it has also got to live by the rules that most other european states subject themselves to , " the paper 's editorial read .
" confrontation is in no one 's interest .
but nor is letting freelance murders take place on the streets of london . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin already said that there will be consequences after the extraditions but a few british papers also cautioned that the expulsions may lead to serious consequences . " the government should not be surprised if sanctions are extended to british companies in russia , " wrote the daily telegraph . the sun chimed in , adding that britain would have to secure public declarations of support from its allies in what it described as " the biggest test for european nerve since the cold war ... we have learned in two -lsb- world wars -rsb- not to appease bullies ...

british prosecutors had requested that andrei lugovoi , a former kgb officer , be extradited to face trial in britain for litvinenko 's murder , which russia rejected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstators in moscow demanding zakayev 's extradition in 2004 " the new british prime minister has declared war on russia - a diplomatic one , " the pro-kremlin daily izvestia wrote , adding that russian courts were still waiting for british authorities to extradite oligarch boris berezovsky and chechen rebel leader ahmed zakayev .
" in russia there are ongoing criminal investigations against them but the british consider them ' politically persecuted kremlin opponents . ' ... it wo n't be long before an ' appropriate response ' from moscow -lsb- comes -rsb- .
but what does britain need a ' second front ' for when it has n't finished dealing with the terrorists who have declared a jihad against it ? " kommersant daily agreed .
" great britain and russia have begun a diplomatic war , " warning that " moscow 's reaction , judging from yesterday 's emotional commentary from russian officials , will be even more violent . " british newspapers sided with prime minister gordon brown 's government . " what choice have we ? " asked the daily mail .
" by refusing to extradite andrei lugovoi to face trial , -lsb- russian -rsb- president vladimir putin has committed an outrage that demands punishment ...
as it is , the new prime minister has come up with sanctions that will present putin with real difficulties in his dealings with the west .
mr. brown has faced his serious test as an international statesman - and passed it with ease . " the times also applauded the government 's decision , noting that " the key issue was what steps could be taken that were both measured and appropriate .
those announced yesterday were right .
britain will suffer , and cynics may argue that today 's measures are futile and counter-productive .
but they send a signal to all those who would silence their critics abroad : britain will protect those on its soil and can not overlook murder for the sake of diplomatic convenience . " similarly , the guardian said it was " reasonable " to expect russia to amend its constitution to allow for the extradition of its citizens , which is currently prohibited .
" if russia is seeking to integrate itself into the world business community , if it seeks for its citizens greater freedom of movement and fewer visa restrictions , if it seeks to cooperate in the fight against international terrorism , it has also got to live by the rules that most other european states subject themselves to , " the paper 's editorial read .
" confrontation is in no one 's interest .
but nor is letting freelance murders take place on the streets of london . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin already said that there will be consequences after the extraditions but a few british papers also cautioned that the expulsions may lead to serious consequences . " the government should not be surprised if sanctions are extended to british companies in russia , " wrote the daily telegraph . the sun chimed in , adding that britain would have to secure public declarations of support from its allies in what it described as " the biggest test for european nerve since the cold war ... we have learned in two -lsb- world wars -rsb- not to appease bullies ...
we need a clear signal from our allies that britain will not face this threat alone . " article compiled from wire reports -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

bulgaria wants the six , now facing life imprisonment , to be transferred to sofia . " the high judicial council decided to commute the death sentences against the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor to life-imprisonment terms , " the council said in a brief statement on tuesday . the decision was greeted with relief by the eu and the us even as critics say they would have liked the medics , who say they are innocent , to be pardoned . bulgaria said it would ask libya to transfer the six medics to sofia . " this decision is a big step ...
for us the case will end once they come back to bulgaria , " foreign minister ivailo kalfin told reporters .
he said the decision of libya 's high judicial council to commute the death sentences to life imprisonment allowed sofia to use an agreement with tripoli on exchange of prisoners and request the transfer of the five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor , who has received bulgarian citizenship . " tomorrow morning we will start working on implementing the transfer of the medics , " kalfin said . sussanah sherkin , deputy director of physicians for human rights said she hoped the medics would be pardoned . " we can only hope in the hours ahead a pardon will be issued and this ordeal will be over , " she said . " the entire world is watching this processs and we are very hopeful given all of the engagement of world leaders , human rights groups and the bulgarians in this case . " relatives of hiv children drop death sentence demand libya 's decision followed news that relatives of the libyan hiv-infected children had agreed to drop their demand that five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor , all of whom were convicted in december , be executed . " we have notified in writing that the families have relinquished their demand for the execution " of the six medics , idriss lagha , the head of the libyan-based association for the families of hiv-infected children , told the associated press . lagha said the families had renounced asking for the death of the medics because they had received all the compensation money they were due under a settlement reached last week .
" all the families have received their cash transfer , one million dollars for each infection , " lagha told ap . earlier , libya had said it had given checks to more than 50 percent of the families whose children were killed by the aids virus . medics say they are innocent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the high judiciary council is the last place the medics can appeal their sentence the nurses , who have been in jail since 1999 , maintain their innocence and have said they confessed to the accusations under torture . foreign experts familiar with libya have blamed the country 's poor health care system and unhygienic conditions for the infections that have led to 56 children 's deaths , prompting widespread anger in libya . the victims ' families have said the case was part of a western attempt to undermine muslims and libya .
bildunterschrift : thousands of bulgarians have supported their countrymen about $ 1 million per family the deal that pushed the council to commute the sentences calls for over $ 400 million -lrb- 290 million euros -rrb- to be given to at least 426 children infected with the aids causing hiv virus , according to the gadhafi foundation which has worked to resolve the case that has been a strain on libya 's relations with the european union and united states for the last eight years . eu external relations commissioner benita ferrero-waldner said tuesday she was still hoping for the medics ' release . " i do hope that the high judicial council today would come out with a ruling and i do hope of course for clemency for the bulgarian nurses and the palestinian medic , " she told reporters in brussels earlier . the european commission , however , has rejected claims that it played a political role in the deal , though it has committed 2.5 million euros to the compensation fund that was created by tripoli and sofia in 2005 . article compiled with wire reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the commission has said it favors the introduction of the genetically modified potato - which includes genes that make it resistant to antibiotics - since it will only be used for starch production and as animal feed .
" it will not enter the nutritional chain , " said a commission spokeswoman .
if the commission goes ahead with the authorization , it will be the first time since 1998 that a genetically engineered plant is given permission for large-scale cultivation in the eu .
however , the commission decision could take some time .
but international environmental group greenpeace said an eu go-ahead for cultivation of the potato would amount to allowing controversial genetically modified crops to enter the eu " through the back door . "
made in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists worry that gm potatoes interfere with the food chain italy and austria are leading the group of eu states which oppose the cultivation of genetically modified crops in the bloc .
other states , including britain , favor the move .
greenpeace has called on governments to reject the potato , which has been developed by german chemical company basf , saying it poses significant risks to health and the environment .
eu rules demand that genes which may have adverse effects on human health and the environment should be phased out .
however , the european food safety authority has given a positive opinion on the basf-developed potato , saying its antibiotic resistance genes do not pose a " relevant " risk to human health or the environment .
greenpeace has warned that the genetically engineered potato did not undergo full risk assessment including its effect on biodiversity .
the organization also said the potato could contaminate the food chain . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the commission has said it favors the introduction of the genetically modified potato - which includes genes that make it resistant to antibiotics - since it will only be used for starch production and as animal feed .
" it will not enter the nutritional chain , " said a commission spokeswoman .
if the commission goes ahead with the authorization , it will be the first time since 1998 that a genetically engineered plant is given permission for large-scale cultivation in the eu .
however , the commission decision could take some time .

greenpeace has called on governments to reject the potato , which has been developed by german chemical company basf , saying it poses significant risks to health and the environment .
eu rules demand that genes which may have adverse effects on human health and the environment should be phased out .
however , the european food safety authority has given a positive opinion on the basf-developed potato , saying its antibiotic resistance genes do not pose a " relevant " risk to human health or the environment .

" it is apparent that the -lrb- british -rrb- sanctions are aimed at politicizing the litvinenko affair , " he added .
" this is a direct path to confrontation . " eu could be pulled into fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has promised to respond to the expulsion gruschko also said he hoped the european union would have " enough common sense " as to not allow itself to become an instrument in the affair . but the eu is likely to be pulled into any dispute between a member state and russia , according to luxemburg 's foreign minister jean asselborn . " naturally we are showing our solidarity with another eu member , but you also have to have the right to question certain steps , " asselborn told financial times deutschland , adding that he wondered if the dispute could have been settled using " silent , diplomatic channels . " german chancellor angela merkel gave her support to brown 's decision to expel the russians , who are rumored to be part of the embassy 's intelligence unit . " the decisions have been made after very careful consideration of the facts at hand in the united kingdom , " she said monday night after meeting with brown , who made berlin his first foreign stop as britain 's prime minister .
" we hope that this phase will be overcome as quickly as possible and that one can continue along the lines of having a very good cooperation , which is after all what you want with russia . " the french foreign ministry allow issued a statement tuesday calling for moscow to " constructively answer the british request .

lugovoi has denied involvement in the case . the russian government condemned the diplomats ' expulsion as " provocative " and " immoral " and said it would have " the most serious consequences for russian-british relations as a whole . " grushko added that britain has refused to extradite 21 russians living in the uk and offered asylum to some of them . " if russia acted in the same manner as london , over 80 diplomats would have been expelled from the british embassy to russia , " grushko said business ties unlikely to be hurt both the british and russian governments emphasized that they did not anticipate their countries ' economic relationship to suffer due to the political confrontation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stop to energy deliveries damage both russia and the uk " we do not expect our disappointment with the russian authorities about the litvinenko case to affect the economic sphere , " british ambassador to russia tony brenton told reporters .

" grushko said that moscow would take international business interests into account when formulating its as yet unannounced response to the russian diplomats ' expulsion . " we will fully take into account the interests of ordinary citizens , tourists , participants in cultural and scientific exchanges and business circles , " he said .
" we do not want them to suffer because of london 's political actions . " russia , which has used its vast energy resources as a political instrument to limit fuel supplies to its neighbors in the past , would benefit little from such action with britain as the uk is one of the largest investors in russian energy markets and pumped nearly 4 billion euros into the branch last year , according to a report in britain 's times newspaper . a spokesman for britain 's foreign office said no retaliation by russia would be justified . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

british prosecutors had requested that andrei lugovoi , a former kgb officer , be extradited to face trial in britain for litvinenko 's murder , which russia rejected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstators in moscow demanding zakayev 's extradition in 2004 " the new british prime minister has declared war on russia - a diplomatic one , " the pro-kremlin daily izvestia wrote , adding that russian courts were still waiting for british authorities to extradite oligarch boris berezovsky and chechen rebel leader ahmed zakayev .
" in russia there are ongoing criminal investigations against them but the british consider them ' politically persecuted kremlin opponents . ' ... it wo n't be long before an ' appropriate response ' from moscow -lsb- comes -rsb- .

" british newspapers sided with prime minister gordon brown 's government . " what choice have we ? " asked the daily mail .
" by refusing to extradite andrei lugovoi to face trial , -lsb- russian -rsb- president vladimir putin has committed an outrage that demands punishment ...
as it is , the new prime minister has come up with sanctions that will present putin with real difficulties in his dealings with the west .
mr. brown has faced his serious test as an international statesman - and passed it with ease . " the times also applauded the government 's decision , noting that " the key issue was what steps could be taken that were both measured and appropriate .
those announced yesterday were right .
britain will suffer , and cynics may argue that today 's measures are futile and counter-productive .
but they send a signal to all those who would silence their critics abroad : britain will protect those on its soil and can not overlook murder for the sake of diplomatic convenience .

" if russia is seeking to integrate itself into the world business community , if it seeks for its citizens greater freedom of movement and fewer visa restrictions , if it seeks to cooperate in the fight against international terrorism , it has also got to live by the rules that most other european states subject themselves to , " the paper 's editorial read .

bulgaria wants the six , now facing life imprisonment , to be transferred to sofia . " the high judicial council decided to commute the death sentences against the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor to life-imprisonment terms , " the council said in a brief statement on tuesday . the decision was greeted with relief by the eu and the us even as critics say they would have liked the medics , who say they are innocent , to be pardoned . bulgaria said it would ask libya to transfer the six medics to sofia . " this decision is a big step ...
for us the case will end once they come back to bulgaria , " foreign minister ivailo kalfin told reporters .
he said the decision of libya 's high judicial council to commute the death sentences to life imprisonment allowed sofia to use an agreement with tripoli on exchange of prisoners and request the transfer of the five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor , who has received bulgarian citizenship . " tomorrow morning we will start working on implementing the transfer of the medics , " kalfin said . sussanah sherkin , deputy director of physicians for human rights said she hoped the medics would be pardoned .

" we have notified in writing that the families have relinquished their demand for the execution " of the six medics , idriss lagha , the head of the libyan-based association for the families of hiv-infected children , told the associated press . lagha said the families had renounced asking for the death of the medics because they had received all the compensation money they were due under a settlement reached last week .
" all the families have received their cash transfer , one million dollars for each infection , " lagha told ap . earlier , libya had said it had given checks to more than 50 percent of the families whose children were killed by the aids virus . medics say they are innocent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the high judiciary council is the last place the medics can appeal their sentence the nurses , who have been in jail since 1999 , maintain their innocence and have said they confessed to the accusations under torture . foreign experts familiar with libya have blamed the country 's poor health care system and unhygienic conditions for the infections that have led to 56 children 's deaths , prompting widespread anger in libya . the victims ' families have said the case was part of a western attempt to undermine muslims and libya .

" i do hope that the high judicial council today would come out with a ruling and i do hope of course for clemency for the bulgarian nurses and the palestinian medic , " she told reporters in brussels earlier . the european commission , however , has rejected claims that it played a political role in the deal , though it has committed 2.5 million euros to the compensation fund that was created by tripoli and sofia in 2005 . article compiled with wire reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal would see renewable energy sources making up 20 percent of europe 's energy by 2020 - a relatively ambitious goal . at the g8 summit in heiligendamm , the chancellor also managed to convince us president george w. bush to take on the problem of climate change .
it was clear before germany took over the rotating presidency of the eu that climate protection would be an important topic .
but , to be honest , did you expect these somewhat surprisingly positive results ? sigmar gabriel : yes .
that became clear in the meetings of the environment council that were held before the eu summit .
we all agreed on one position in the eu , but of course it is still a great success .
it was only possible because the heads of state and government got personally involved .
if meetings were only between environment ministers , then we would never have had the power to make sweeping changes .
climate change and energy policy is more than just an environmental issue .
it 's security , stability and economic policy .
the leaders realize this now and this is a great success for germany 's term as president of the eu .
it 's also been a success for the grand coalition in germany , for its climate and energy policy . but the real test lies ahead .
the promises made at heiligendamm now have to be fulfilled .
the un climate conference in bali in december is the next step to replace the kyoto protocol .
that runs out in 2012 and it is important that countries like china , india and the us show more willingness to take part in climate protection .
do you think it will be a success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel manage to work her magic with bush again ?
george bush has said that he will take part in the discussions , but he has not made any clear statements on the goals .
it 's a bit like the neil armstrong quote : it might be a giant leap for the americans - but only a small step for mankind .
we have to get a mandate for negotiation in bali .
then we will spend two years working out the new treaty .
the kyoto protocol ends in 2012 .
between 2009 and 2012 , we have to get the new treaty ratified across the world .
in germany we have to get it passed by the 16 federal states .
that takes time .
so you can just imagine how long it will take for the whole world .
we will need two years after the negotiations to get it passed by parliaments .
we have to have a new treaty ready to come into effect by jan 1 . , 2013 , that provides far more climate protection than the kyoto protocol .
it is of course also necessary that the international community backs the new treaty .
the countries that are responsible for climate change - the industrialized nations , and that includes europe and germany - have to show that you can have economic growth and increased energy efficiency . this is why we have to pass new climate and energy laws in germany by the end of the year .
the german chancellor not only has to convince seven federal states to pass these laws .
she also has to convince the state premiers from her own conservative block , which seems increasingly difficult .
we have worked well together with chancellor merkel and then we see our efforts undermined by conservative leaders .
we ca n't let this happen .
we ca n't demand that other countries participate and then do too little ourselves .
this is the acid test for climate and energy policy - we will see whether federal states run by conservatives block or pass the new laws . two weeks ago there was a meeting about this in the chancellery .
it was decided , against the will of german industry , to increase energy efficiency by 3 percent annually .
currently it 's only 1 percent .
those are pretty ambitious targets and german industry says it ca n't afford to do it .
how realistic is this goal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy consumption continues to be a touchy subject in germany i never understood the fact that industry was against these plans .
surely it 's in their interests to reduce energy costs .
when energy prices rise then it is prudent to reduce energy consumption .
by the way , our energy efficiency currently increases at a rate of 1.7 percent .
in times of economic growth energy efficiency also improves because plants become more efficient .
people buy new cars , which are more efficient .
so even without doing anything energy efficiency has risen to just under 2 percent .
now industry has to keep its promises and increase combined heat and power generation .
we will introduce new laws because they have not lived up to their promises .
we will do more on the consumer side - electrical goods will use less power , buildings will be better insulated .
for all that we will provide extra subsidies . the disputes between you and certain parts of industry in germany are often quite vocal .
there were press reports of comments you made - for example you said the actions of basf ceo hambrecht reminded you of business stalinism .
you were then accused of being an ecological bolshevik .
does it do any good to deal with each other in this way ? no , it does n't .
but sometimes you have to talk straight .
if business leaders say they will only continue to talk to the government when it does what they say , then i have to tell them to look at the constitution .
all state authority comes from the people through elections .
this is not about special interests , it 's about the good of the people .
i can understand that certain parts of german industry are annoyed that we are now putting more pressure on them to do what they promised in the first place but never actually did .
they pledged to reduce co2 emissions by 20 tons by 2005 .
the reality is 30 million tons extra were emitted , although high energy users like the chemical , steel , and aluminum industries actually cut co2 emissions .
but the energy industry itself increased emissions .
so you ca n't just simply speak of german industry as a whole . let 's stay on the topic of the power companies .
vattenfall , a swedish energy giant , had incidents recently at two nuclear plants in the north of germany .
without saying too much , let 's say that the information given by the company was questionable .
as a social democrat , does that give you more reason to stick by plans , or even increase pressure , to phase out nuclear energy in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the krümmel nuclear power plant has been shut down for the time being first of all , it shows that old power stations have risks .
it makes sense to close old nuclear power plants sooner and let newer power plants run longer .
this is because of the age and not necessarily because of the company that runs them , or the workers .
i 'm convinced that they are doing their jobs as well as possible .
the nuclear power law also states that old plants should close first .
but the energy companies want to do the opposite .
the reason is simple .
these old power plants have been completely paid off , so they make one million euros -lrb- $ 1.37 million -rrb- more profit a day than the newer plants .
but safety comes first . they have to close down the older plants and we will keep a strict eye on the plants that had incidents recently .
the krümmel plant will not be restarted until all problems have been solved .
this is particularly true of the communication problems .
vattenfall has finally agreed to let us talk directly to the people in charge at the time of the incidents .
we 're not out to get them .
we just want to find out how it happened so that we know how to react the next time and check other plants for similar dangers . we want to talk to the workers behind closed doors and we wo n't be holding any one person accountable .
i 'm sure they all tried to do their best .

british prosecutors had requested that andrei lugovoi , a former kgb officer , be extradited to face trial in britain for litvinenko 's murder , which russia rejected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstators in moscow demanding zakayev 's extradition in 2004 " the new british prime minister has declared war on russia - a diplomatic one , " the pro-kremlin daily izvestia wrote , adding that russian courts were still waiting for british authorities to extradite oligarch boris berezovsky and chechen rebel leader ahmed zakayev .
" in russia there are ongoing criminal investigations against them but the british consider them ' politically persecuted kremlin opponents . ' ... it wo n't be long before an ' appropriate response ' from moscow -lsb- comes -rsb- .
but what does britain need a ' second front ' for when it has n't finished dealing with the terrorists who have declared a jihad against it ? " kommersant daily agreed .
" great britain and russia have begun a diplomatic war , " warning that " moscow 's reaction , judging from yesterday 's emotional commentary from russian officials , will be even more violent . " british newspapers sided with prime minister gordon brown 's government . " what choice have we ? " asked the daily mail .
" by refusing to extradite andrei lugovoi to face trial , -lsb- russian -rsb- president vladimir putin has committed an outrage that demands punishment ...
as it is , the new prime minister has come up with sanctions that will present putin with real difficulties in his dealings with the west .
mr. brown has faced his serious test as an international statesman - and passed it with ease . " the times also applauded the government 's decision , noting that " the key issue was what steps could be taken that were both measured and appropriate .
those announced yesterday were right .
britain will suffer , and cynics may argue that today 's measures are futile and counter-productive .
but they send a signal to all those who would silence their critics abroad : britain will protect those on its soil and can not overlook murder for the sake of diplomatic convenience . " similarly , the guardian said it was " reasonable " to expect russia to amend its constitution to allow for the extradition of its citizens , which is currently prohibited .
" if russia is seeking to integrate itself into the world business community , if it seeks for its citizens greater freedom of movement and fewer visa restrictions , if it seeks to cooperate in the fight against international terrorism , it has also got to live by the rules that most other european states subject themselves to , " the paper 's editorial read .
" confrontation is in no one 's interest .
but nor is letting freelance murders take place on the streets of london . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin already said that there will be consequences after the extraditions but a few british papers also cautioned that the expulsions may lead to serious consequences . " the government should not be surprised if sanctions are extended to british companies in russia , " wrote the daily telegraph . the sun chimed in , adding that britain would have to secure public declarations of support from its allies in what it described as " the biggest test for european nerve since the cold war ... we have learned in two -lsb- world wars -rsb- not to appease bullies ...

the commission has said it favors the introduction of the genetically modified potato - which includes genes that make it resistant to antibiotics - since it will only be used for starch production and as animal feed .
" it will not enter the nutritional chain , " said a commission spokeswoman .
if the commission goes ahead with the authorization , it will be the first time since 1998 that a genetically engineered plant is given permission for large-scale cultivation in the eu .
however , the commission decision could take some time .
but international environmental group greenpeace said an eu go-ahead for cultivation of the potato would amount to allowing controversial genetically modified crops to enter the eu " through the back door . "
made in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists worry that gm potatoes interfere with the food chain italy and austria are leading the group of eu states which oppose the cultivation of genetically modified crops in the bloc .
other states , including britain , favor the move .
greenpeace has called on governments to reject the potato , which has been developed by german chemical company basf , saying it poses significant risks to health and the environment .
eu rules demand that genes which may have adverse effects on human health and the environment should be phased out .
however , the european food safety authority has given a positive opinion on the basf-developed potato , saying its antibiotic resistance genes do not pose a " relevant " risk to human health or the environment .
greenpeace has warned that the genetically engineered potato did not undergo full risk assessment including its effect on biodiversity .
the organization also said the potato could contaminate the food chain . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal would see renewable energy sources making up 20 percent of europe 's energy by 2020 - a relatively ambitious goal . at the g8 summit in heiligendamm , the chancellor also managed to convince us president george w. bush to take on the problem of climate change .
it was clear before germany took over the rotating presidency of the eu that climate protection would be an important topic .
but , to be honest , did you expect these somewhat surprisingly positive results ? sigmar gabriel : yes .
that became clear in the meetings of the environment council that were held before the eu summit .
we all agreed on one position in the eu , but of course it is still a great success .
it was only possible because the heads of state and government got personally involved .
if meetings were only between environment ministers , then we would never have had the power to make sweeping changes .
climate change and energy policy is more than just an environmental issue .
it 's security , stability and economic policy .
the leaders realize this now and this is a great success for germany 's term as president of the eu .
it 's also been a success for the grand coalition in germany , for its climate and energy policy . but the real test lies ahead .
the promises made at heiligendamm now have to be fulfilled .
the un climate conference in bali in december is the next step to replace the kyoto protocol .
that runs out in 2012 and it is important that countries like china , india and the us show more willingness to take part in climate protection .
do you think it will be a success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel manage to work her magic with bush again ?
george bush has said that he will take part in the discussions , but he has not made any clear statements on the goals .
it 's a bit like the neil armstrong quote : it might be a giant leap for the americans - but only a small step for mankind .
we have to get a mandate for negotiation in bali .
then we will spend two years working out the new treaty .
the kyoto protocol ends in 2012 .
between 2009 and 2012 , we have to get the new treaty ratified across the world .
in germany we have to get it passed by the 16 federal states .
that takes time .
so you can just imagine how long it will take for the whole world .
we will need two years after the negotiations to get it passed by parliaments .
we have to have a new treaty ready to come into effect by jan 1 . , 2013 , that provides far more climate protection than the kyoto protocol .
it is of course also necessary that the international community backs the new treaty .
the countries that are responsible for climate change - the industrialized nations , and that includes europe and germany - have to show that you can have economic growth and increased energy efficiency . this is why we have to pass new climate and energy laws in germany by the end of the year .
the german chancellor not only has to convince seven federal states to pass these laws .
she also has to convince the state premiers from her own conservative block , which seems increasingly difficult .
we have worked well together with chancellor merkel and then we see our efforts undermined by conservative leaders .
we ca n't let this happen .
we ca n't demand that other countries participate and then do too little ourselves .
this is the acid test for climate and energy policy - we will see whether federal states run by conservatives block or pass the new laws . two weeks ago there was a meeting about this in the chancellery .
it was decided , against the will of german industry , to increase energy efficiency by 3 percent annually .
currently it 's only 1 percent .
those are pretty ambitious targets and german industry says it ca n't afford to do it .
how realistic is this goal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy consumption continues to be a touchy subject in germany i never understood the fact that industry was against these plans .
surely it 's in their interests to reduce energy costs .
when energy prices rise then it is prudent to reduce energy consumption .
by the way , our energy efficiency currently increases at a rate of 1.7 percent .
in times of economic growth energy efficiency also improves because plants become more efficient .
people buy new cars , which are more efficient .
so even without doing anything energy efficiency has risen to just under 2 percent .
now industry has to keep its promises and increase combined heat and power generation .
we will introduce new laws because they have not lived up to their promises .
we will do more on the consumer side - electrical goods will use less power , buildings will be better insulated .
for all that we will provide extra subsidies . the disputes between you and certain parts of industry in germany are often quite vocal .
there were press reports of comments you made - for example you said the actions of basf ceo hambrecht reminded you of business stalinism .
you were then accused of being an ecological bolshevik .
does it do any good to deal with each other in this way ? no , it does n't .
but sometimes you have to talk straight .
if business leaders say they will only continue to talk to the government when it does what they say , then i have to tell them to look at the constitution .

belgrade has said it would give special autonomy to kosovo , but rejects full independence . un secretary general ban ki-moon , fearing that kosovo 's albanians would unilaterally declare independence , urged them on monday to instead let the security council settle the issue . in addition to kosovo , merkel and kostunica also discussed bilateral relations and the stabilization and security agreement that serbia hopes to have in place with the european union in october as a prelude towards full eu membership . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal would see renewable energy sources making up 20 percent of europe 's energy by 2020 - a relatively ambitious goal . at the g8 summit in heiligendamm , the chancellor also managed to convince us president george w. bush to take on the problem of climate change .
it was clear before germany took over the rotating presidency of the eu that climate protection would be an important topic .
but , to be honest , did you expect these somewhat surprisingly positive results ? sigmar gabriel : yes .
that became clear in the meetings of the environment council that were held before the eu summit .
we all agreed on one position in the eu , but of course it is still a great success .
it was only possible because the heads of state and government got personally involved .
if meetings were only between environment ministers , then we would never have had the power to make sweeping changes .
climate change and energy policy is more than just an environmental issue .
it 's security , stability and economic policy .
the leaders realize this now and this is a great success for germany 's term as president of the eu .
it 's also been a success for the grand coalition in germany , for its climate and energy policy . but the real test lies ahead .
the promises made at heiligendamm now have to be fulfilled .
the un climate conference in bali in december is the next step to replace the kyoto protocol .
that runs out in 2012 and it is important that countries like china , india and the us show more willingness to take part in climate protection .
do you think it will be a success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel manage to work her magic with bush again ?
george bush has said that he will take part in the discussions , but he has not made any clear statements on the goals .
it 's a bit like the neil armstrong quote : it might be a giant leap for the americans - but only a small step for mankind .
we have to get a mandate for negotiation in bali .
then we will spend two years working out the new treaty .
the kyoto protocol ends in 2012 .
between 2009 and 2012 , we have to get the new treaty ratified across the world .
in germany we have to get it passed by the 16 federal states .
that takes time .
so you can just imagine how long it will take for the whole world .
we will need two years after the negotiations to get it passed by parliaments .
we have to have a new treaty ready to come into effect by jan 1 . , 2013 , that provides far more climate protection than the kyoto protocol .
it is of course also necessary that the international community backs the new treaty .
the countries that are responsible for climate change - the industrialized nations , and that includes europe and germany - have to show that you can have economic growth and increased energy efficiency . this is why we have to pass new climate and energy laws in germany by the end of the year .
the german chancellor not only has to convince seven federal states to pass these laws .
she also has to convince the state premiers from her own conservative block , which seems increasingly difficult .
we have worked well together with chancellor merkel and then we see our efforts undermined by conservative leaders .
we ca n't let this happen .
we ca n't demand that other countries participate and then do too little ourselves .
this is the acid test for climate and energy policy - we will see whether federal states run by conservatives block or pass the new laws . two weeks ago there was a meeting about this in the chancellery .
it was decided , against the will of german industry , to increase energy efficiency by 3 percent annually .
currently it 's only 1 percent .
those are pretty ambitious targets and german industry says it ca n't afford to do it .
how realistic is this goal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy consumption continues to be a touchy subject in germany i never understood the fact that industry was against these plans .
surely it 's in their interests to reduce energy costs .
when energy prices rise then it is prudent to reduce energy consumption .
by the way , our energy efficiency currently increases at a rate of 1.7 percent .
in times of economic growth energy efficiency also improves because plants become more efficient .
people buy new cars , which are more efficient .
so even without doing anything energy efficiency has risen to just under 2 percent .
now industry has to keep its promises and increase combined heat and power generation .
we will introduce new laws because they have not lived up to their promises .
we will do more on the consumer side - electrical goods will use less power , buildings will be better insulated .
for all that we will provide extra subsidies . the disputes between you and certain parts of industry in germany are often quite vocal .
there were press reports of comments you made - for example you said the actions of basf ceo hambrecht reminded you of business stalinism .
you were then accused of being an ecological bolshevik .
does it do any good to deal with each other in this way ? no , it does n't .
but sometimes you have to talk straight .
if business leaders say they will only continue to talk to the government when it does what they say , then i have to tell them to look at the constitution .
all state authority comes from the people through elections .
this is not about special interests , it 's about the good of the people .
i can understand that certain parts of german industry are annoyed that we are now putting more pressure on them to do what they promised in the first place but never actually did .
they pledged to reduce co2 emissions by 20 tons by 2005 .
the reality is 30 million tons extra were emitted , although high energy users like the chemical , steel , and aluminum industries actually cut co2 emissions .
but the energy industry itself increased emissions .
so you ca n't just simply speak of german industry as a whole . let 's stay on the topic of the power companies .
vattenfall , a swedish energy giant , had incidents recently at two nuclear plants in the north of germany .
without saying too much , let 's say that the information given by the company was questionable .
as a social democrat , does that give you more reason to stick by plans , or even increase pressure , to phase out nuclear energy in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the krümmel nuclear power plant has been shut down for the time being first of all , it shows that old power stations have risks .
it makes sense to close old nuclear power plants sooner and let newer power plants run longer .
this is because of the age and not necessarily because of the company that runs them , or the workers .
i 'm convinced that they are doing their jobs as well as possible .
the nuclear power law also states that old plants should close first .
but the energy companies want to do the opposite .
the reason is simple .
these old power plants have been completely paid off , so they make one million euros -lrb- $ 1.37 million -rrb- more profit a day than the newer plants .
but safety comes first . they have to close down the older plants and we will keep a strict eye on the plants that had incidents recently .
the krümmel plant will not be restarted until all problems have been solved .
this is particularly true of the communication problems .
vattenfall has finally agreed to let us talk directly to the people in charge at the time of the incidents .
we 're not out to get them .
we just want to find out how it happened so that we know how to react the next time and check other plants for similar dangers . we want to talk to the workers behind closed doors and we wo n't be holding any one person accountable .
i 'm sure they all tried to do their best .
but mistakes were made and we have to find out which ones . dw-tv 's jens thurau interviewed sigmar gabriel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the commission has said it favors the introduction of the genetically modified potato - which includes genes that make it resistant to antibiotics - since it will only be used for starch production and as animal feed .
" it will not enter the nutritional chain , " said a commission spokeswoman .
if the commission goes ahead with the authorization , it will be the first time since 1998 that a genetically engineered plant is given permission for large-scale cultivation in the eu .
however , the commission decision could take some time .

bulgaria wants the six , now facing life imprisonment , to be transferred to sofia . " the high judicial council decided to commute the death sentences against the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor to life-imprisonment terms , " the council said in a brief statement on tuesday . the decision was greeted with relief by the eu and the us even as critics say they would have liked the medics , who say they are innocent , to be pardoned . bulgaria said it would ask libya to transfer the six medics to sofia . " this decision is a big step ...
for us the case will end once they come back to bulgaria , " foreign minister ivailo kalfin told reporters .
he said the decision of libya 's high judicial council to commute the death sentences to life imprisonment allowed sofia to use an agreement with tripoli on exchange of prisoners and request the transfer of the five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor , who has received bulgarian citizenship . " tomorrow morning we will start working on implementing the transfer of the medics , " kalfin said . sussanah sherkin , deputy director of physicians for human rights said she hoped the medics would be pardoned . " we can only hope in the hours ahead a pardon will be issued and this ordeal will be over , " she said .

" relatives of hiv children drop death sentence demand libya 's decision followed news that relatives of the libyan hiv-infected children had agreed to drop their demand that five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor , all of whom were convicted in december , be executed . " we have notified in writing that the families have relinquished their demand for the execution " of the six medics , idriss lagha , the head of the libyan-based association for the families of hiv-infected children , told the associated press . lagha said the families had renounced asking for the death of the medics because they had received all the compensation money they were due under a settlement reached last week .
" all the families have received their cash transfer , one million dollars for each infection , " lagha told ap . earlier , libya had said it had given checks to more than 50 percent of the families whose children were killed by the aids virus . medics say they are innocent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the high judiciary council is the last place the medics can appeal their sentence the nurses , who have been in jail since 1999 , maintain their innocence and have said they confessed to the accusations under torture . foreign experts familiar with libya have blamed the country 's poor health care system and unhygienic conditions for the infections that have led to 56 children 's deaths , prompting widespread anger in libya . the victims ' families have said the case was part of a western attempt to undermine muslims and libya .

" i do hope that the high judicial council today would come out with a ruling and i do hope of course for clemency for the bulgarian nurses and the palestinian medic , " she told reporters in brussels earlier . the european commission , however , has rejected claims that it played a political role in the deal , though it has committed 2.5 million euros to the compensation fund that was created by tripoli and sofia in 2005 . article compiled with wire reports -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal would see renewable energy sources making up 20 percent of europe 's energy by 2020 - a relatively ambitious goal . at the g8 summit in heiligendamm , the chancellor also managed to convince us president george w. bush to take on the problem of climate change .
it was clear before germany took over the rotating presidency of the eu that climate protection would be an important topic .
but , to be honest , did you expect these somewhat surprisingly positive results ? sigmar gabriel : yes .
that became clear in the meetings of the environment council that were held before the eu summit .
we all agreed on one position in the eu , but of course it is still a great success .
it was only possible because the heads of state and government got personally involved .
if meetings were only between environment ministers , then we would never have had the power to make sweeping changes .
climate change and energy policy is more than just an environmental issue .
it 's security , stability and economic policy .
the leaders realize this now and this is a great success for germany 's term as president of the eu .
it 's also been a success for the grand coalition in germany , for its climate and energy policy . but the real test lies ahead .
the promises made at heiligendamm now have to be fulfilled .
the un climate conference in bali in december is the next step to replace the kyoto protocol .
that runs out in 2012 and it is important that countries like china , india and the us show more willingness to take part in climate protection .
do you think it will be a success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel manage to work her magic with bush again ?
george bush has said that he will take part in the discussions , but he has not made any clear statements on the goals .
it 's a bit like the neil armstrong quote : it might be a giant leap for the americans - but only a small step for mankind .
we have to get a mandate for negotiation in bali .
then we will spend two years working out the new treaty .
the kyoto protocol ends in 2012 .
between 2009 and 2012 , we have to get the new treaty ratified across the world .
in germany we have to get it passed by the 16 federal states .
that takes time .
so you can just imagine how long it will take for the whole world .
we will need two years after the negotiations to get it passed by parliaments .
we have to have a new treaty ready to come into effect by jan 1 . , 2013 , that provides far more climate protection than the kyoto protocol .
it is of course also necessary that the international community backs the new treaty .
the countries that are responsible for climate change - the industrialized nations , and that includes europe and germany - have to show that you can have economic growth and increased energy efficiency . this is why we have to pass new climate and energy laws in germany by the end of the year .
the german chancellor not only has to convince seven federal states to pass these laws .
she also has to convince the state premiers from her own conservative block , which seems increasingly difficult .
we have worked well together with chancellor merkel and then we see our efforts undermined by conservative leaders .
we ca n't let this happen .
we ca n't demand that other countries participate and then do too little ourselves .
this is the acid test for climate and energy policy - we will see whether federal states run by conservatives block or pass the new laws . two weeks ago there was a meeting about this in the chancellery .
it was decided , against the will of german industry , to increase energy efficiency by 3 percent annually .
currently it 's only 1 percent .
those are pretty ambitious targets and german industry says it ca n't afford to do it .
how realistic is this goal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy consumption continues to be a touchy subject in germany i never understood the fact that industry was against these plans .
surely it 's in their interests to reduce energy costs .
when energy prices rise then it is prudent to reduce energy consumption .
by the way , our energy efficiency currently increases at a rate of 1.7 percent .
in times of economic growth energy efficiency also improves because plants become more efficient .
people buy new cars , which are more efficient .
so even without doing anything energy efficiency has risen to just under 2 percent .
now industry has to keep its promises and increase combined heat and power generation .
we will introduce new laws because they have not lived up to their promises .
we will do more on the consumer side - electrical goods will use less power , buildings will be better insulated .
for all that we will provide extra subsidies . the disputes between you and certain parts of industry in germany are often quite vocal .
there were press reports of comments you made - for example you said the actions of basf ceo hambrecht reminded you of business stalinism .
you were then accused of being an ecological bolshevik .
does it do any good to deal with each other in this way ? no , it does n't .
but sometimes you have to talk straight .
if business leaders say they will only continue to talk to the government when it does what they say , then i have to tell them to look at the constitution .
all state authority comes from the people through elections .
this is not about special interests , it 's about the good of the people .
i can understand that certain parts of german industry are annoyed that we are now putting more pressure on them to do what they promised in the first place but never actually did .
they pledged to reduce co2 emissions by 20 tons by 2005 .
the reality is 30 million tons extra were emitted , although high energy users like the chemical , steel , and aluminum industries actually cut co2 emissions .
but the energy industry itself increased emissions .
so you ca n't just simply speak of german industry as a whole . let 's stay on the topic of the power companies .
vattenfall , a swedish energy giant , had incidents recently at two nuclear plants in the north of germany .
without saying too much , let 's say that the information given by the company was questionable .
as a social democrat , does that give you more reason to stick by plans , or even increase pressure , to phase out nuclear energy in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the krümmel nuclear power plant has been shut down for the time being first of all , it shows that old power stations have risks .
it makes sense to close old nuclear power plants sooner and let newer power plants run longer .
this is because of the age and not necessarily because of the company that runs them , or the workers .
i 'm convinced that they are doing their jobs as well as possible .
the nuclear power law also states that old plants should close first .
but the energy companies want to do the opposite .
the reason is simple .
these old power plants have been completely paid off , so they make one million euros -lrb- $ 1.37 million -rrb- more profit a day than the newer plants .
but safety comes first . they have to close down the older plants and we will keep a strict eye on the plants that had incidents recently .
the krümmel plant will not be restarted until all problems have been solved .
this is particularly true of the communication problems .
vattenfall has finally agreed to let us talk directly to the people in charge at the time of the incidents .
we 're not out to get them .
we just want to find out how it happened so that we know how to react the next time and check other plants for similar dangers . we want to talk to the workers behind closed doors and we wo n't be holding any one person accountable .
i 'm sure they all tried to do their best .
but mistakes were made and we have to find out which ones . dw-tv 's jens thurau interviewed sigmar gabriel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the commission has said it favors the introduction of the genetically modified potato - which includes genes that make it resistant to antibiotics - since it will only be used for starch production and as animal feed .
" it will not enter the nutritional chain , " said a commission spokeswoman .
if the commission goes ahead with the authorization , it will be the first time since 1998 that a genetically engineered plant is given permission for large-scale cultivation in the eu .
however , the commission decision could take some time .
but international environmental group greenpeace said an eu go-ahead for cultivation of the potato would amount to allowing controversial genetically modified crops to enter the eu " through the back door . "

greenpeace has called on governments to reject the potato , which has been developed by german chemical company basf , saying it poses significant risks to health and the environment .
eu rules demand that genes which may have adverse effects on human health and the environment should be phased out .
however , the european food safety authority has given a positive opinion on the basf-developed potato , saying its antibiotic resistance genes do not pose a " relevant " risk to human health or the environment .

the commission has said it favors the introduction of the genetically modified potato - which includes genes that make it resistant to antibiotics - since it will only be used for starch production and as animal feed .
" it will not enter the nutritional chain , " said a commission spokeswoman .
if the commission goes ahead with the authorization , it will be the first time since 1998 that a genetically engineered plant is given permission for large-scale cultivation in the eu .
however , the commission decision could take some time .
but international environmental group greenpeace said an eu go-ahead for cultivation of the potato would amount to allowing controversial genetically modified crops to enter the eu " through the back door . "
made in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists worry that gm potatoes interfere with the food chain italy and austria are leading the group of eu states which oppose the cultivation of genetically modified crops in the bloc .
other states , including britain , favor the move .
greenpeace has called on governments to reject the potato , which has been developed by german chemical company basf , saying it poses significant risks to health and the environment .
eu rules demand that genes which may have adverse effects on human health and the environment should be phased out .
however , the european food safety authority has given a positive opinion on the basf-developed potato , saying its antibiotic resistance genes do not pose a " relevant " risk to human health or the environment .
greenpeace has warned that the genetically engineered potato did not undergo full risk assessment including its effect on biodiversity .
the organization also said the potato could contaminate the food chain . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 17.07.2007 " this is the acid test for climate and energy policy " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel wants new climate and energy laws for germany by the end of the year german environment minister sigmar gabriel spoke to dw-tv about the environmental successes of germany 's eu and g8 presidencies , the need for a new kyoto protocol and problems at german nuclear power plants . dw-tv : mr. gabriel , at the european union summit earlier this year , the german chancellor reached a breakthrough on climate and energy policy in the eu .
the deal would see renewable energy sources making up 20 percent of europe 's energy by 2020 - a relatively ambitious goal . at the g8 summit in heiligendamm , the chancellor also managed to convince us president george w. bush to take on the problem of climate change .
it was clear before germany took over the rotating presidency of the eu that climate protection would be an important topic .
but , to be honest , did you expect these somewhat surprisingly positive results ? sigmar gabriel : yes .
that became clear in the meetings of the environment council that were held before the eu summit .
we all agreed on one position in the eu , but of course it is still a great success .
it was only possible because the heads of state and government got personally involved .
if meetings were only between environment ministers , then we would never have had the power to make sweeping changes .
climate change and energy policy is more than just an environmental issue .
it 's security , stability and economic policy .
the leaders realize this now and this is a great success for germany 's term as president of the eu .
it 's also been a success for the grand coalition in germany , for its climate and energy policy . but the real test lies ahead .
the promises made at heiligendamm now have to be fulfilled .
the un climate conference in bali in december is the next step to replace the kyoto protocol .
that runs out in 2012 and it is important that countries like china , india and the us show more willingness to take part in climate protection .
do you think it will be a success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel manage to work her magic with bush again ?
george bush has said that he will take part in the discussions , but he has not made any clear statements on the goals .
it 's a bit like the neil armstrong quote : it might be a giant leap for the americans - but only a small step for mankind .
we have to get a mandate for negotiation in bali .
then we will spend two years working out the new treaty .
the kyoto protocol ends in 2012 .
between 2009 and 2012 , we have to get the new treaty ratified across the world .
in germany we have to get it passed by the 16 federal states .
that takes time .
so you can just imagine how long it will take for the whole world .
we will need two years after the negotiations to get it passed by parliaments .
we have to have a new treaty ready to come into effect by jan 1 . , 2013 , that provides far more climate protection than the kyoto protocol .
it is of course also necessary that the international community backs the new treaty .
the countries that are responsible for climate change - the industrialized nations , and that includes europe and germany - have to show that you can have economic growth and increased energy efficiency . this is why we have to pass new climate and energy laws in germany by the end of the year .
the german chancellor not only has to convince seven federal states to pass these laws .
she also has to convince the state premiers from her own conservative block , which seems increasingly difficult .
we have worked well together with chancellor merkel and then we see our efforts undermined by conservative leaders .
we ca n't let this happen .
we ca n't demand that other countries participate and then do too little ourselves .
this is the acid test for climate and energy policy - we will see whether federal states run by conservatives block or pass the new laws . two weeks ago there was a meeting about this in the chancellery .
it was decided , against the will of german industry , to increase energy efficiency by 3 percent annually .
currently it 's only 1 percent .
those are pretty ambitious targets and german industry says it ca n't afford to do it .
how realistic is this goal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy consumption continues to be a touchy subject in germany i never understood the fact that industry was against these plans .
surely it 's in their interests to reduce energy costs .
when energy prices rise then it is prudent to reduce energy consumption .
by the way , our energy efficiency currently increases at a rate of 1.7 percent .
in times of economic growth energy efficiency also improves because plants become more efficient .
people buy new cars , which are more efficient .
so even without doing anything energy efficiency has risen to just under 2 percent .
now industry has to keep its promises and increase combined heat and power generation .
we will introduce new laws because they have not lived up to their promises .
we will do more on the consumer side - electrical goods will use less power , buildings will be better insulated .
for all that we will provide extra subsidies . the disputes between you and certain parts of industry in germany are often quite vocal .
there were press reports of comments you made - for example you said the actions of basf ceo hambrecht reminded you of business stalinism .
you were then accused of being an ecological bolshevik .
does it do any good to deal with each other in this way ? no , it does n't .
but sometimes you have to talk straight .
if business leaders say they will only continue to talk to the government when it does what they say , then i have to tell them to look at the constitution .
all state authority comes from the people through elections .
this is not about special interests , it 's about the good of the people .
i can understand that certain parts of german industry are annoyed that we are now putting more pressure on them to do what they promised in the first place but never actually did .
they pledged to reduce co2 emissions by 20 tons by 2005 .
the reality is 30 million tons extra were emitted , although high energy users like the chemical , steel , and aluminum industries actually cut co2 emissions .
but the energy industry itself increased emissions .
so you ca n't just simply speak of german industry as a whole . let 's stay on the topic of the power companies .
vattenfall , a swedish energy giant , had incidents recently at two nuclear plants in the north of germany .
without saying too much , let 's say that the information given by the company was questionable .
as a social democrat , does that give you more reason to stick by plans , or even increase pressure , to phase out nuclear energy in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the krümmel nuclear power plant has been shut down for the time being first of all , it shows that old power stations have risks .
it makes sense to close old nuclear power plants sooner and let newer power plants run longer .
this is because of the age and not necessarily because of the company that runs them , or the workers .
i 'm convinced that they are doing their jobs as well as possible .
the nuclear power law also states that old plants should close first .
but the energy companies want to do the opposite .
the reason is simple .
these old power plants have been completely paid off , so they make one million euros -lrb- $ 1.37 million -rrb- more profit a day than the newer plants .
but safety comes first . they have to close down the older plants and we will keep a strict eye on the plants that had incidents recently .
the krümmel plant will not be restarted until all problems have been solved .
this is particularly true of the communication problems .
vattenfall has finally agreed to let us talk directly to the people in charge at the time of the incidents .
we 're not out to get them .
we just want to find out how it happened so that we know how to react the next time and check other plants for similar dangers . we want to talk to the workers behind closed doors and we wo n't be holding any one person accountable .
i 'm sure they all tried to do their best .
but mistakes were made and we have to find out which ones . dw-tv 's jens thurau interviewed sigmar gabriel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

it was clear before germany took over the rotating presidency of the eu that climate protection would be an important topic .
but , to be honest , did you expect these somewhat surprisingly positive results ? sigmar gabriel : yes .
that became clear in the meetings of the environment council that were held before the eu summit .
we all agreed on one position in the eu , but of course it is still a great success .
it was only possible because the heads of state and government got personally involved .
if meetings were only between environment ministers , then we would never have had the power to make sweeping changes .
climate change and energy policy is more than just an environmental issue .
it 's security , stability and economic policy .
the leaders realize this now and this is a great success for germany 's term as president of the eu .
it 's also been a success for the grand coalition in germany , for its climate and energy policy . but the real test lies ahead .
the promises made at heiligendamm now have to be fulfilled .
the un climate conference in bali in december is the next step to replace the kyoto protocol .
that runs out in 2012 and it is important that countries like china , india and the us show more willingness to take part in climate protection .
do you think it will be a success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel manage to work her magic with bush again ?
george bush has said that he will take part in the discussions , but he has not made any clear statements on the goals .
it 's a bit like the neil armstrong quote : it might be a giant leap for the americans - but only a small step for mankind .
we have to get a mandate for negotiation in bali .
then we will spend two years working out the new treaty .
the kyoto protocol ends in 2012 .
between 2009 and 2012 , we have to get the new treaty ratified across the world .
in germany we have to get it passed by the 16 federal states .
that takes time .
so you can just imagine how long it will take for the whole world .
we will need two years after the negotiations to get it passed by parliaments .
we have to have a new treaty ready to come into effect by jan 1 . , 2013 , that provides far more climate protection than the kyoto protocol .
it is of course also necessary that the international community backs the new treaty .
the countries that are responsible for climate change - the industrialized nations , and that includes europe and germany - have to show that you can have economic growth and increased energy efficiency . this is why we have to pass new climate and energy laws in germany by the end of the year .
the german chancellor not only has to convince seven federal states to pass these laws .
she also has to convince the state premiers from her own conservative block , which seems increasingly difficult .
we have worked well together with chancellor merkel and then we see our efforts undermined by conservative leaders .
we ca n't let this happen .
we ca n't demand that other countries participate and then do too little ourselves .
this is the acid test for climate and energy policy - we will see whether federal states run by conservatives block or pass the new laws . two weeks ago there was a meeting about this in the chancellery .
it was decided , against the will of german industry , to increase energy efficiency by 3 percent annually .
currently it 's only 1 percent .
those are pretty ambitious targets and german industry says it ca n't afford to do it .
how realistic is this goal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy consumption continues to be a touchy subject in germany i never understood the fact that industry was against these plans .
surely it 's in their interests to reduce energy costs .
when energy prices rise then it is prudent to reduce energy consumption .
by the way , our energy efficiency currently increases at a rate of 1.7 percent .
in times of economic growth energy efficiency also improves because plants become more efficient .
people buy new cars , which are more efficient .
so even without doing anything energy efficiency has risen to just under 2 percent .
now industry has to keep its promises and increase combined heat and power generation .
we will introduce new laws because they have not lived up to their promises .
we will do more on the consumer side - electrical goods will use less power , buildings will be better insulated .
for all that we will provide extra subsidies . the disputes between you and certain parts of industry in germany are often quite vocal .
there were press reports of comments you made - for example you said the actions of basf ceo hambrecht reminded you of business stalinism .
you were then accused of being an ecological bolshevik .
does it do any good to deal with each other in this way ? no , it does n't .
but sometimes you have to talk straight .
if business leaders say they will only continue to talk to the government when it does what they say , then i have to tell them to look at the constitution .
all state authority comes from the people through elections .
this is not about special interests , it 's about the good of the people .
i can understand that certain parts of german industry are annoyed that we are now putting more pressure on them to do what they promised in the first place but never actually did .
they pledged to reduce co2 emissions by 20 tons by 2005 .
the reality is 30 million tons extra were emitted , although high energy users like the chemical , steel , and aluminum industries actually cut co2 emissions .
but the energy industry itself increased emissions .
so you ca n't just simply speak of german industry as a whole . let 's stay on the topic of the power companies .
vattenfall , a swedish energy giant , had incidents recently at two nuclear plants in the north of germany .
without saying too much , let 's say that the information given by the company was questionable .
as a social democrat , does that give you more reason to stick by plans , or even increase pressure , to phase out nuclear energy in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the krümmel nuclear power plant has been shut down for the time being first of all , it shows that old power stations have risks .
it makes sense to close old nuclear power plants sooner and let newer power plants run longer .
this is because of the age and not necessarily because of the company that runs them , or the workers .
i 'm convinced that they are doing their jobs as well as possible .
the nuclear power law also states that old plants should close first .
but the energy companies want to do the opposite .
the reason is simple .
these old power plants have been completely paid off , so they make one million euros -lrb- $ 1.37 million -rrb- more profit a day than the newer plants .
but safety comes first . they have to close down the older plants and we will keep a strict eye on the plants that had incidents recently .
the krümmel plant will not be restarted until all problems have been solved .
this is particularly true of the communication problems .
vattenfall has finally agreed to let us talk directly to the people in charge at the time of the incidents .
we 're not out to get them .
we just want to find out how it happened so that we know how to react the next time and check other plants for similar dangers . we want to talk to the workers behind closed doors and we wo n't be holding any one person accountable .
i 'm sure they all tried to do their best .

the commission has said it favors the introduction of the genetically modified potato - which includes genes that make it resistant to antibiotics - since it will only be used for starch production and as animal feed .
" it will not enter the nutritional chain , " said a commission spokeswoman .
if the commission goes ahead with the authorization , it will be the first time since 1998 that a genetically engineered plant is given permission for large-scale cultivation in the eu .
however , the commission decision could take some time .
but international environmental group greenpeace said an eu go-ahead for cultivation of the potato would amount to allowing controversial genetically modified crops to enter the eu " through the back door . "
made in germany bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : environmentalists worry that gm potatoes interfere with the food chain italy and austria are leading the group of eu states which oppose the cultivation of genetically modified crops in the bloc .
other states , including britain , favor the move .
greenpeace has called on governments to reject the potato , which has been developed by german chemical company basf , saying it poses significant risks to health and the environment .
eu rules demand that genes which may have adverse effects on human health and the environment should be phased out .
however , the european food safety authority has given a positive opinion on the basf-developed potato , saying its antibiotic resistance genes do not pose a " relevant " risk to human health or the environment .
greenpeace has warned that the genetically engineered potato did not undergo full risk assessment including its effect on biodiversity .
the organization also said the potato could contaminate the food chain . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

british prosecutors had requested that andrei lugovoi , a former kgb officer , be extradited to face trial in britain for litvinenko 's murder , which russia rejected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstators in moscow demanding zakayev 's extradition in 2004 " the new british prime minister has declared war on russia - a diplomatic one , " the pro-kremlin daily izvestia wrote , adding that russian courts were still waiting for british authorities to extradite oligarch boris berezovsky and chechen rebel leader ahmed zakayev .
" in russia there are ongoing criminal investigations against them but the british consider them ' politically persecuted kremlin opponents . ' ... it wo n't be long before an ' appropriate response ' from moscow -lsb- comes -rsb- .
but what does britain need a ' second front ' for when it has n't finished dealing with the terrorists who have declared a jihad against it ? " kommersant daily agreed .
" great britain and russia have begun a diplomatic war , " warning that " moscow 's reaction , judging from yesterday 's emotional commentary from russian officials , will be even more violent . " british newspapers sided with prime minister gordon brown 's government . " what choice have we ? " asked the daily mail .
" by refusing to extradite andrei lugovoi to face trial , -lsb- russian -rsb- president vladimir putin has committed an outrage that demands punishment ...
as it is , the new prime minister has come up with sanctions that will present putin with real difficulties in his dealings with the west .
mr. brown has faced his serious test as an international statesman - and passed it with ease . " the times also applauded the government 's decision , noting that " the key issue was what steps could be taken that were both measured and appropriate .
those announced yesterday were right .
britain will suffer , and cynics may argue that today 's measures are futile and counter-productive .
but they send a signal to all those who would silence their critics abroad : britain will protect those on its soil and can not overlook murder for the sake of diplomatic convenience . " similarly , the guardian said it was " reasonable " to expect russia to amend its constitution to allow for the extradition of its citizens , which is currently prohibited .
" if russia is seeking to integrate itself into the world business community , if it seeks for its citizens greater freedom of movement and fewer visa restrictions , if it seeks to cooperate in the fight against international terrorism , it has also got to live by the rules that most other european states subject themselves to , " the paper 's editorial read .
" confrontation is in no one 's interest .
but nor is letting freelance murders take place on the streets of london . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin already said that there will be consequences after the extraditions but a few british papers also cautioned that the expulsions may lead to serious consequences . " the government should not be surprised if sanctions are extended to british companies in russia , " wrote the daily telegraph . the sun chimed in , adding that britain would have to secure public declarations of support from its allies in what it described as " the biggest test for european nerve since the cold war ... we have learned in two -lsb- world wars -rsb- not to appease bullies ...

british prosecutors had requested that andrei lugovoi , a former kgb officer , be extradited to face trial in britain for litvinenko 's murder , which russia rejected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstators in moscow demanding zakayev 's extradition in 2004 " the new british prime minister has declared war on russia - a diplomatic one , " the pro-kremlin daily izvestia wrote , adding that russian courts were still waiting for british authorities to extradite oligarch boris berezovsky and chechen rebel leader ahmed zakayev .
" in russia there are ongoing criminal investigations against them but the british consider them ' politically persecuted kremlin opponents . ' ... it wo n't be long before an ' appropriate response ' from moscow -lsb- comes -rsb- .
but what does britain need a ' second front ' for when it has n't finished dealing with the terrorists who have declared a jihad against it ? " kommersant daily agreed .
" great britain and russia have begun a diplomatic war , " warning that " moscow 's reaction , judging from yesterday 's emotional commentary from russian officials , will be even more violent . " british newspapers sided with prime minister gordon brown 's government . " what choice have we ? " asked the daily mail .
" by refusing to extradite andrei lugovoi to face trial , -lsb- russian -rsb- president vladimir putin has committed an outrage that demands punishment ...
as it is , the new prime minister has come up with sanctions that will present putin with real difficulties in his dealings with the west .
mr. brown has faced his serious test as an international statesman - and passed it with ease . " the times also applauded the government 's decision , noting that " the key issue was what steps could be taken that were both measured and appropriate .
those announced yesterday were right .
britain will suffer , and cynics may argue that today 's measures are futile and counter-productive .
but they send a signal to all those who would silence their critics abroad : britain will protect those on its soil and can not overlook murder for the sake of diplomatic convenience . " similarly , the guardian said it was " reasonable " to expect russia to amend its constitution to allow for the extradition of its citizens , which is currently prohibited .
" if russia is seeking to integrate itself into the world business community , if it seeks for its citizens greater freedom of movement and fewer visa restrictions , if it seeks to cooperate in the fight against international terrorism , it has also got to live by the rules that most other european states subject themselves to , " the paper 's editorial read .
" confrontation is in no one 's interest .
but nor is letting freelance murders take place on the streets of london . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin already said that there will be consequences after the extraditions but a few british papers also cautioned that the expulsions may lead to serious consequences . " the government should not be surprised if sanctions are extended to british companies in russia , " wrote the daily telegraph . the sun chimed in , adding that britain would have to secure public declarations of support from its allies in what it described as " the biggest test for european nerve since the cold war ... we have learned in two -lsb- world wars -rsb- not to appease bullies ...

the commission has said it favors the introduction of the genetically modified potato - which includes genes that make it resistant to antibiotics - since it will only be used for starch production and as animal feed .
" it will not enter the nutritional chain , " said a commission spokeswoman .
if the commission goes ahead with the authorization , it will be the first time since 1998 that a genetically engineered plant is given permission for large-scale cultivation in the eu .
however , the commission decision could take some time .
but international environmental group greenpeace said an eu go-ahead for cultivation of the potato would amount to allowing controversial genetically modified crops to enter the eu " through the back door . "

greenpeace has called on governments to reject the potato , which has been developed by german chemical company basf , saying it poses significant risks to health and the environment .
eu rules demand that genes which may have adverse effects on human health and the environment should be phased out .
however , the european food safety authority has given a positive opinion on the basf-developed potato , saying its antibiotic resistance genes do not pose a " relevant " risk to human health or the environment .
greenpeace has warned that the genetically engineered potato did not undergo full risk assessment including its effect on biodiversity .

the deal would see renewable energy sources making up 20 percent of europe 's energy by 2020 - a relatively ambitious goal . at the g8 summit in heiligendamm , the chancellor also managed to convince us president george w. bush to take on the problem of climate change .
it was clear before germany took over the rotating presidency of the eu that climate protection would be an important topic .
but , to be honest , did you expect these somewhat surprisingly positive results ? sigmar gabriel : yes .
that became clear in the meetings of the environment council that were held before the eu summit .
we all agreed on one position in the eu , but of course it is still a great success .
it was only possible because the heads of state and government got personally involved .
if meetings were only between environment ministers , then we would never have had the power to make sweeping changes .
climate change and energy policy is more than just an environmental issue .
it 's security , stability and economic policy .
the leaders realize this now and this is a great success for germany 's term as president of the eu .
it 's also been a success for the grand coalition in germany , for its climate and energy policy . but the real test lies ahead .
the promises made at heiligendamm now have to be fulfilled .
the un climate conference in bali in december is the next step to replace the kyoto protocol .
that runs out in 2012 and it is important that countries like china , india and the us show more willingness to take part in climate protection .
do you think it will be a success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel manage to work her magic with bush again ?
george bush has said that he will take part in the discussions , but he has not made any clear statements on the goals .
it 's a bit like the neil armstrong quote : it might be a giant leap for the americans - but only a small step for mankind .
we have to get a mandate for negotiation in bali .
then we will spend two years working out the new treaty .
the kyoto protocol ends in 2012 .
between 2009 and 2012 , we have to get the new treaty ratified across the world .
in germany we have to get it passed by the 16 federal states .
that takes time .
so you can just imagine how long it will take for the whole world .
we will need two years after the negotiations to get it passed by parliaments .
we have to have a new treaty ready to come into effect by jan 1 . , 2013 , that provides far more climate protection than the kyoto protocol .
it is of course also necessary that the international community backs the new treaty .
the countries that are responsible for climate change - the industrialized nations , and that includes europe and germany - have to show that you can have economic growth and increased energy efficiency . this is why we have to pass new climate and energy laws in germany by the end of the year .
the german chancellor not only has to convince seven federal states to pass these laws .
she also has to convince the state premiers from her own conservative block , which seems increasingly difficult .
we have worked well together with chancellor merkel and then we see our efforts undermined by conservative leaders .
we ca n't let this happen .
we ca n't demand that other countries participate and then do too little ourselves .
this is the acid test for climate and energy policy - we will see whether federal states run by conservatives block or pass the new laws . two weeks ago there was a meeting about this in the chancellery .
it was decided , against the will of german industry , to increase energy efficiency by 3 percent annually .
currently it 's only 1 percent .
those are pretty ambitious targets and german industry says it ca n't afford to do it .
how realistic is this goal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy consumption continues to be a touchy subject in germany i never understood the fact that industry was against these plans .
surely it 's in their interests to reduce energy costs .
when energy prices rise then it is prudent to reduce energy consumption .
by the way , our energy efficiency currently increases at a rate of 1.7 percent .
in times of economic growth energy efficiency also improves because plants become more efficient .
people buy new cars , which are more efficient .
so even without doing anything energy efficiency has risen to just under 2 percent .
now industry has to keep its promises and increase combined heat and power generation .
we will introduce new laws because they have not lived up to their promises .
we will do more on the consumer side - electrical goods will use less power , buildings will be better insulated .
for all that we will provide extra subsidies . the disputes between you and certain parts of industry in germany are often quite vocal .
there were press reports of comments you made - for example you said the actions of basf ceo hambrecht reminded you of business stalinism .
you were then accused of being an ecological bolshevik .
does it do any good to deal with each other in this way ? no , it does n't .
but sometimes you have to talk straight .
if business leaders say they will only continue to talk to the government when it does what they say , then i have to tell them to look at the constitution .
all state authority comes from the people through elections .
this is not about special interests , it 's about the good of the people .
i can understand that certain parts of german industry are annoyed that we are now putting more pressure on them to do what they promised in the first place but never actually did .
they pledged to reduce co2 emissions by 20 tons by 2005 .
the reality is 30 million tons extra were emitted , although high energy users like the chemical , steel , and aluminum industries actually cut co2 emissions .
but the energy industry itself increased emissions .
so you ca n't just simply speak of german industry as a whole . let 's stay on the topic of the power companies .
vattenfall , a swedish energy giant , had incidents recently at two nuclear plants in the north of germany .
without saying too much , let 's say that the information given by the company was questionable .
as a social democrat , does that give you more reason to stick by plans , or even increase pressure , to phase out nuclear energy in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the krümmel nuclear power plant has been shut down for the time being first of all , it shows that old power stations have risks .
it makes sense to close old nuclear power plants sooner and let newer power plants run longer .
this is because of the age and not necessarily because of the company that runs them , or the workers .
i 'm convinced that they are doing their jobs as well as possible .
the nuclear power law also states that old plants should close first .
but the energy companies want to do the opposite .
the reason is simple .
these old power plants have been completely paid off , so they make one million euros -lrb- $ 1.37 million -rrb- more profit a day than the newer plants .
but safety comes first . they have to close down the older plants and we will keep a strict eye on the plants that had incidents recently .
the krümmel plant will not be restarted until all problems have been solved .
this is particularly true of the communication problems .
vattenfall has finally agreed to let us talk directly to the people in charge at the time of the incidents .
we 're not out to get them .
we just want to find out how it happened so that we know how to react the next time and check other plants for similar dangers . we want to talk to the workers behind closed doors and we wo n't be holding any one person accountable .
i 'm sure they all tried to do their best .
but mistakes were made and we have to find out which ones . dw-tv 's jens thurau interviewed sigmar gabriel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

that runs out in 2012 and it is important that countries like china , india and the us show more willingness to take part in climate protection .
do you think it will be a success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel manage to work her magic with bush again ?
george bush has said that he will take part in the discussions , but he has not made any clear statements on the goals .
it 's a bit like the neil armstrong quote : it might be a giant leap for the americans - but only a small step for mankind .
we have to get a mandate for negotiation in bali .
then we will spend two years working out the new treaty .
the kyoto protocol ends in 2012 .
between 2009 and 2012 , we have to get the new treaty ratified across the world .
in germany we have to get it passed by the 16 federal states .
that takes time .
so you can just imagine how long it will take for the whole world .
we will need two years after the negotiations to get it passed by parliaments .
we have to have a new treaty ready to come into effect by jan 1 . , 2013 , that provides far more climate protection than the kyoto protocol .
it is of course also necessary that the international community backs the new treaty .
the countries that are responsible for climate change - the industrialized nations , and that includes europe and germany - have to show that you can have economic growth and increased energy efficiency . this is why we have to pass new climate and energy laws in germany by the end of the year .
the german chancellor not only has to convince seven federal states to pass these laws .
she also has to convince the state premiers from her own conservative block , which seems increasingly difficult .
we have worked well together with chancellor merkel and then we see our efforts undermined by conservative leaders .
we ca n't let this happen .
we ca n't demand that other countries participate and then do too little ourselves .
this is the acid test for climate and energy policy - we will see whether federal states run by conservatives block or pass the new laws . two weeks ago there was a meeting about this in the chancellery .
it was decided , against the will of german industry , to increase energy efficiency by 3 percent annually .
currently it 's only 1 percent .
those are pretty ambitious targets and german industry says it ca n't afford to do it .
how realistic is this goal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy consumption continues to be a touchy subject in germany i never understood the fact that industry was against these plans .
surely it 's in their interests to reduce energy costs .
when energy prices rise then it is prudent to reduce energy consumption .
by the way , our energy efficiency currently increases at a rate of 1.7 percent .
in times of economic growth energy efficiency also improves because plants become more efficient .
people buy new cars , which are more efficient .
so even without doing anything energy efficiency has risen to just under 2 percent .
now industry has to keep its promises and increase combined heat and power generation .
we will introduce new laws because they have not lived up to their promises .
we will do more on the consumer side - electrical goods will use less power , buildings will be better insulated .
for all that we will provide extra subsidies . the disputes between you and certain parts of industry in germany are often quite vocal .
there were press reports of comments you made - for example you said the actions of basf ceo hambrecht reminded you of business stalinism .
you were then accused of being an ecological bolshevik .
does it do any good to deal with each other in this way ? no , it does n't .
but sometimes you have to talk straight .
if business leaders say they will only continue to talk to the government when it does what they say , then i have to tell them to look at the constitution .
all state authority comes from the people through elections .
this is not about special interests , it 's about the good of the people .
i can understand that certain parts of german industry are annoyed that we are now putting more pressure on them to do what they promised in the first place but never actually did .
they pledged to reduce co2 emissions by 20 tons by 2005 .
the reality is 30 million tons extra were emitted , although high energy users like the chemical , steel , and aluminum industries actually cut co2 emissions .
but the energy industry itself increased emissions .
so you ca n't just simply speak of german industry as a whole . let 's stay on the topic of the power companies .
vattenfall , a swedish energy giant , had incidents recently at two nuclear plants in the north of germany .
without saying too much , let 's say that the information given by the company was questionable .
as a social democrat , does that give you more reason to stick by plans , or even increase pressure , to phase out nuclear energy in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the krümmel nuclear power plant has been shut down for the time being first of all , it shows that old power stations have risks .
it makes sense to close old nuclear power plants sooner and let newer power plants run longer .
this is because of the age and not necessarily because of the company that runs them , or the workers .
i 'm convinced that they are doing their jobs as well as possible .
the nuclear power law also states that old plants should close first .
but the energy companies want to do the opposite .
the reason is simple .
these old power plants have been completely paid off , so they make one million euros -lrb- $ 1.37 million -rrb- more profit a day than the newer plants .
but safety comes first . they have to close down the older plants and we will keep a strict eye on the plants that had incidents recently .
the krümmel plant will not be restarted until all problems have been solved .
this is particularly true of the communication problems .
vattenfall has finally agreed to let us talk directly to the people in charge at the time of the incidents .
we 're not out to get them .
we just want to find out how it happened so that we know how to react the next time and check other plants for similar dangers . we want to talk to the workers behind closed doors and we wo n't be holding any one person accountable .
i 'm sure they all tried to do their best .

the deal would see renewable energy sources making up 20 percent of europe 's energy by 2020 - a relatively ambitious goal . at the g8 summit in heiligendamm , the chancellor also managed to convince us president george w. bush to take on the problem of climate change .
it was clear before germany took over the rotating presidency of the eu that climate protection would be an important topic .
but , to be honest , did you expect these somewhat surprisingly positive results ? sigmar gabriel : yes .
that became clear in the meetings of the environment council that were held before the eu summit .
we all agreed on one position in the eu , but of course it is still a great success .
it was only possible because the heads of state and government got personally involved .
if meetings were only between environment ministers , then we would never have had the power to make sweeping changes .
climate change and energy policy is more than just an environmental issue .
it 's security , stability and economic policy .
the leaders realize this now and this is a great success for germany 's term as president of the eu .
it 's also been a success for the grand coalition in germany , for its climate and energy policy . but the real test lies ahead .

the deal would see renewable energy sources making up 20 percent of europe 's energy by 2020 - a relatively ambitious goal . at the g8 summit in heiligendamm , the chancellor also managed to convince us president george w. bush to take on the problem of climate change .
it was clear before germany took over the rotating presidency of the eu that climate protection would be an important topic .
but , to be honest , did you expect these somewhat surprisingly positive results ? sigmar gabriel : yes .
that became clear in the meetings of the environment council that were held before the eu summit .
we all agreed on one position in the eu , but of course it is still a great success .
it was only possible because the heads of state and government got personally involved .
if meetings were only between environment ministers , then we would never have had the power to make sweeping changes .
climate change and energy policy is more than just an environmental issue .
it 's security , stability and economic policy .
the leaders realize this now and this is a great success for germany 's term as president of the eu .
it 's also been a success for the grand coalition in germany , for its climate and energy policy . but the real test lies ahead .
the promises made at heiligendamm now have to be fulfilled .
the un climate conference in bali in december is the next step to replace the kyoto protocol .
that runs out in 2012 and it is important that countries like china , india and the us show more willingness to take part in climate protection .
do you think it will be a success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel manage to work her magic with bush again ?
george bush has said that he will take part in the discussions , but he has not made any clear statements on the goals .
it 's a bit like the neil armstrong quote : it might be a giant leap for the americans - but only a small step for mankind .
we have to get a mandate for negotiation in bali .
then we will spend two years working out the new treaty .
the kyoto protocol ends in 2012 .
between 2009 and 2012 , we have to get the new treaty ratified across the world .
in germany we have to get it passed by the 16 federal states .
that takes time .
so you can just imagine how long it will take for the whole world .
we will need two years after the negotiations to get it passed by parliaments .
we have to have a new treaty ready to come into effect by jan 1 . , 2013 , that provides far more climate protection than the kyoto protocol .
it is of course also necessary that the international community backs the new treaty .
the countries that are responsible for climate change - the industrialized nations , and that includes europe and germany - have to show that you can have economic growth and increased energy efficiency . this is why we have to pass new climate and energy laws in germany by the end of the year .
the german chancellor not only has to convince seven federal states to pass these laws .
she also has to convince the state premiers from her own conservative block , which seems increasingly difficult .
we have worked well together with chancellor merkel and then we see our efforts undermined by conservative leaders .
we ca n't let this happen .
we ca n't demand that other countries participate and then do too little ourselves .
this is the acid test for climate and energy policy - we will see whether federal states run by conservatives block or pass the new laws . two weeks ago there was a meeting about this in the chancellery .
it was decided , against the will of german industry , to increase energy efficiency by 3 percent annually .
currently it 's only 1 percent .
those are pretty ambitious targets and german industry says it ca n't afford to do it .
how realistic is this goal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy consumption continues to be a touchy subject in germany i never understood the fact that industry was against these plans .
surely it 's in their interests to reduce energy costs .
when energy prices rise then it is prudent to reduce energy consumption .
by the way , our energy efficiency currently increases at a rate of 1.7 percent .
in times of economic growth energy efficiency also improves because plants become more efficient .
people buy new cars , which are more efficient .
so even without doing anything energy efficiency has risen to just under 2 percent .
now industry has to keep its promises and increase combined heat and power generation .
we will introduce new laws because they have not lived up to their promises .
we will do more on the consumer side - electrical goods will use less power , buildings will be better insulated .
for all that we will provide extra subsidies . the disputes between you and certain parts of industry in germany are often quite vocal .
there were press reports of comments you made - for example you said the actions of basf ceo hambrecht reminded you of business stalinism .
you were then accused of being an ecological bolshevik .
does it do any good to deal with each other in this way ? no , it does n't .
but sometimes you have to talk straight .
if business leaders say they will only continue to talk to the government when it does what they say , then i have to tell them to look at the constitution .
all state authority comes from the people through elections .
this is not about special interests , it 's about the good of the people .
i can understand that certain parts of german industry are annoyed that we are now putting more pressure on them to do what they promised in the first place but never actually did .
they pledged to reduce co2 emissions by 20 tons by 2005 .
the reality is 30 million tons extra were emitted , although high energy users like the chemical , steel , and aluminum industries actually cut co2 emissions .
but the energy industry itself increased emissions .
so you ca n't just simply speak of german industry as a whole . let 's stay on the topic of the power companies .
vattenfall , a swedish energy giant , had incidents recently at two nuclear plants in the north of germany .
without saying too much , let 's say that the information given by the company was questionable .
as a social democrat , does that give you more reason to stick by plans , or even increase pressure , to phase out nuclear energy in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the krümmel nuclear power plant has been shut down for the time being first of all , it shows that old power stations have risks .
it makes sense to close old nuclear power plants sooner and let newer power plants run longer .
this is because of the age and not necessarily because of the company that runs them , or the workers .
i 'm convinced that they are doing their jobs as well as possible .
the nuclear power law also states that old plants should close first .
but the energy companies want to do the opposite .
the reason is simple .
these old power plants have been completely paid off , so they make one million euros -lrb- $ 1.37 million -rrb- more profit a day than the newer plants .
but safety comes first . they have to close down the older plants and we will keep a strict eye on the plants that had incidents recently .
the krümmel plant will not be restarted until all problems have been solved .
this is particularly true of the communication problems .
vattenfall has finally agreed to let us talk directly to the people in charge at the time of the incidents .
we 're not out to get them .
we just want to find out how it happened so that we know how to react the next time and check other plants for similar dangers . we want to talk to the workers behind closed doors and we wo n't be holding any one person accountable .
i 'm sure they all tried to do their best .
but mistakes were made and we have to find out which ones . dw-tv 's jens thurau interviewed sigmar gabriel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is apparent that the -lrb- british -rrb- sanctions are aimed at politicizing the litvinenko affair , " he added .
" this is a direct path to confrontation . " eu could be pulled into fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has promised to respond to the expulsion gruschko also said he hoped the european union would have " enough common sense " as to not allow itself to become an instrument in the affair . but the eu is likely to be pulled into any dispute between a member state and russia , according to luxemburg 's foreign minister jean asselborn . " naturally we are showing our solidarity with another eu member , but you also have to have the right to question certain steps , " asselborn told financial times deutschland , adding that he wondered if the dispute could have been settled using " silent , diplomatic channels . " german chancellor angela merkel gave her support to brown 's decision to expel the russians , who are rumored to be part of the embassy 's intelligence unit . " the decisions have been made after very careful consideration of the facts at hand in the united kingdom , " she said monday night after meeting with brown , who made berlin his first foreign stop as britain 's prime minister .
" we hope that this phase will be overcome as quickly as possible and that one can continue along the lines of having a very good cooperation , which is after all what you want with russia . " the french foreign ministry allow issued a statement tuesday calling for moscow to " constructively answer the british request . " uk also refused to extradite russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has demanded britain extradite chechen leader ahmed zakayev miliband told parliament monday there was a " significant body of evidence " of lugovoi 's involvement in the litvinenko murder , but russia has refused to extradite him to face trial in britain . according to the british public prosecutor , ex-kgb officer lugovoi is said to have killed former russian agent litvinenko by poisoning him with radioactive polonium-210 in november 2006 .
lugovoi has denied involvement in the case . the russian government condemned the diplomats ' expulsion as " provocative " and " immoral " and said it would have " the most serious consequences for russian-british relations as a whole . " grushko added that britain has refused to extradite 21 russians living in the uk and offered asylum to some of them . " if russia acted in the same manner as london , over 80 diplomats would have been expelled from the british embassy to russia , " grushko said business ties unlikely to be hurt both the british and russian governments emphasized that they did not anticipate their countries ' economic relationship to suffer due to the political confrontation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stop to energy deliveries damage both russia and the uk " we do not expect our disappointment with the russian authorities about the litvinenko case to affect the economic sphere , " british ambassador to russia tony brenton told reporters .
" indeed we expect british-russian economic ties to continue to grow . " grushko said that moscow would take international business interests into account when formulating its as yet unannounced response to the russian diplomats ' expulsion .

the deal would see renewable energy sources making up 20 percent of europe 's energy by 2020 - a relatively ambitious goal . at the g8 summit in heiligendamm , the chancellor also managed to convince us president george w. bush to take on the problem of climate change .
it was clear before germany took over the rotating presidency of the eu that climate protection would be an important topic .
but , to be honest , did you expect these somewhat surprisingly positive results ? sigmar gabriel : yes .
that became clear in the meetings of the environment council that were held before the eu summit .
we all agreed on one position in the eu , but of course it is still a great success .
it was only possible because the heads of state and government got personally involved .
if meetings were only between environment ministers , then we would never have had the power to make sweeping changes .
climate change and energy policy is more than just an environmental issue .
it 's security , stability and economic policy .
the leaders realize this now and this is a great success for germany 's term as president of the eu .
it 's also been a success for the grand coalition in germany , for its climate and energy policy . but the real test lies ahead .
the promises made at heiligendamm now have to be fulfilled .
the un climate conference in bali in december is the next step to replace the kyoto protocol .
that runs out in 2012 and it is important that countries like china , india and the us show more willingness to take part in climate protection .
do you think it will be a success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel manage to work her magic with bush again ?
george bush has said that he will take part in the discussions , but he has not made any clear statements on the goals .
it 's a bit like the neil armstrong quote : it might be a giant leap for the americans - but only a small step for mankind .
we have to get a mandate for negotiation in bali .
then we will spend two years working out the new treaty .
the kyoto protocol ends in 2012 .
between 2009 and 2012 , we have to get the new treaty ratified across the world .
in germany we have to get it passed by the 16 federal states .
that takes time .
so you can just imagine how long it will take for the whole world .
we will need two years after the negotiations to get it passed by parliaments .
we have to have a new treaty ready to come into effect by jan 1 . , 2013 , that provides far more climate protection than the kyoto protocol .
it is of course also necessary that the international community backs the new treaty .
the countries that are responsible for climate change - the industrialized nations , and that includes europe and germany - have to show that you can have economic growth and increased energy efficiency . this is why we have to pass new climate and energy laws in germany by the end of the year .
the german chancellor not only has to convince seven federal states to pass these laws .
she also has to convince the state premiers from her own conservative block , which seems increasingly difficult .
we have worked well together with chancellor merkel and then we see our efforts undermined by conservative leaders .
we ca n't let this happen .
we ca n't demand that other countries participate and then do too little ourselves .
this is the acid test for climate and energy policy - we will see whether federal states run by conservatives block or pass the new laws . two weeks ago there was a meeting about this in the chancellery .
it was decided , against the will of german industry , to increase energy efficiency by 3 percent annually .
currently it 's only 1 percent .
those are pretty ambitious targets and german industry says it ca n't afford to do it .
how realistic is this goal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy consumption continues to be a touchy subject in germany i never understood the fact that industry was against these plans .
surely it 's in their interests to reduce energy costs .
when energy prices rise then it is prudent to reduce energy consumption .
by the way , our energy efficiency currently increases at a rate of 1.7 percent .
in times of economic growth energy efficiency also improves because plants become more efficient .
people buy new cars , which are more efficient .
so even without doing anything energy efficiency has risen to just under 2 percent .
now industry has to keep its promises and increase combined heat and power generation .
we will introduce new laws because they have not lived up to their promises .
we will do more on the consumer side - electrical goods will use less power , buildings will be better insulated .
for all that we will provide extra subsidies . the disputes between you and certain parts of industry in germany are often quite vocal .
there were press reports of comments you made - for example you said the actions of basf ceo hambrecht reminded you of business stalinism .
you were then accused of being an ecological bolshevik .
does it do any good to deal with each other in this way ? no , it does n't .
but sometimes you have to talk straight .
if business leaders say they will only continue to talk to the government when it does what they say , then i have to tell them to look at the constitution .
all state authority comes from the people through elections .
this is not about special interests , it 's about the good of the people .
i can understand that certain parts of german industry are annoyed that we are now putting more pressure on them to do what they promised in the first place but never actually did .
they pledged to reduce co2 emissions by 20 tons by 2005 .
the reality is 30 million tons extra were emitted , although high energy users like the chemical , steel , and aluminum industries actually cut co2 emissions .
but the energy industry itself increased emissions .
so you ca n't just simply speak of german industry as a whole . let 's stay on the topic of the power companies .
vattenfall , a swedish energy giant , had incidents recently at two nuclear plants in the north of germany .
without saying too much , let 's say that the information given by the company was questionable .
as a social democrat , does that give you more reason to stick by plans , or even increase pressure , to phase out nuclear energy in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the krümmel nuclear power plant has been shut down for the time being first of all , it shows that old power stations have risks .
it makes sense to close old nuclear power plants sooner and let newer power plants run longer .
this is because of the age and not necessarily because of the company that runs them , or the workers .
i 'm convinced that they are doing their jobs as well as possible .
the nuclear power law also states that old plants should close first .
but the energy companies want to do the opposite .
the reason is simple .
these old power plants have been completely paid off , so they make one million euros -lrb- $ 1.37 million -rrb- more profit a day than the newer plants .
but safety comes first . they have to close down the older plants and we will keep a strict eye on the plants that had incidents recently .
the krümmel plant will not be restarted until all problems have been solved .
this is particularly true of the communication problems .
vattenfall has finally agreed to let us talk directly to the people in charge at the time of the incidents .
we 're not out to get them .
we just want to find out how it happened so that we know how to react the next time and check other plants for similar dangers . we want to talk to the workers behind closed doors and we wo n't be holding any one person accountable .
i 'm sure they all tried to do their best .
but mistakes were made and we have to find out which ones . dw-tv 's jens thurau interviewed sigmar gabriel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal would see renewable energy sources making up 20 percent of europe 's energy by 2020 - a relatively ambitious goal . at the g8 summit in heiligendamm , the chancellor also managed to convince us president george w. bush to take on the problem of climate change .
it was clear before germany took over the rotating presidency of the eu that climate protection would be an important topic .
but , to be honest , did you expect these somewhat surprisingly positive results ? sigmar gabriel : yes .
that became clear in the meetings of the environment council that were held before the eu summit .
we all agreed on one position in the eu , but of course it is still a great success .
it was only possible because the heads of state and government got personally involved .
if meetings were only between environment ministers , then we would never have had the power to make sweeping changes .
climate change and energy policy is more than just an environmental issue .
it 's security , stability and economic policy .
the leaders realize this now and this is a great success for germany 's term as president of the eu .
it 's also been a success for the grand coalition in germany , for its climate and energy policy . but the real test lies ahead .
the promises made at heiligendamm now have to be fulfilled .
the un climate conference in bali in december is the next step to replace the kyoto protocol .
that runs out in 2012 and it is important that countries like china , india and the us show more willingness to take part in climate protection .
do you think it will be a success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel manage to work her magic with bush again ?
george bush has said that he will take part in the discussions , but he has not made any clear statements on the goals .
it 's a bit like the neil armstrong quote : it might be a giant leap for the americans - but only a small step for mankind .
we have to get a mandate for negotiation in bali .
then we will spend two years working out the new treaty .
the kyoto protocol ends in 2012 .
between 2009 and 2012 , we have to get the new treaty ratified across the world .
in germany we have to get it passed by the 16 federal states .
that takes time .
so you can just imagine how long it will take for the whole world .
we will need two years after the negotiations to get it passed by parliaments .
we have to have a new treaty ready to come into effect by jan 1 . , 2013 , that provides far more climate protection than the kyoto protocol .
it is of course also necessary that the international community backs the new treaty .
the countries that are responsible for climate change - the industrialized nations , and that includes europe and germany - have to show that you can have economic growth and increased energy efficiency . this is why we have to pass new climate and energy laws in germany by the end of the year .
the german chancellor not only has to convince seven federal states to pass these laws .
she also has to convince the state premiers from her own conservative block , which seems increasingly difficult .
we have worked well together with chancellor merkel and then we see our efforts undermined by conservative leaders .
we ca n't let this happen .
we ca n't demand that other countries participate and then do too little ourselves .
this is the acid test for climate and energy policy - we will see whether federal states run by conservatives block or pass the new laws . two weeks ago there was a meeting about this in the chancellery .
it was decided , against the will of german industry , to increase energy efficiency by 3 percent annually .
currently it 's only 1 percent .
those are pretty ambitious targets and german industry says it ca n't afford to do it .
how realistic is this goal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy consumption continues to be a touchy subject in germany i never understood the fact that industry was against these plans .
surely it 's in their interests to reduce energy costs .
when energy prices rise then it is prudent to reduce energy consumption .
by the way , our energy efficiency currently increases at a rate of 1.7 percent .
in times of economic growth energy efficiency also improves because plants become more efficient .
people buy new cars , which are more efficient .
so even without doing anything energy efficiency has risen to just under 2 percent .
now industry has to keep its promises and increase combined heat and power generation .
we will introduce new laws because they have not lived up to their promises .
we will do more on the consumer side - electrical goods will use less power , buildings will be better insulated .
for all that we will provide extra subsidies . the disputes between you and certain parts of industry in germany are often quite vocal .
there were press reports of comments you made - for example you said the actions of basf ceo hambrecht reminded you of business stalinism .
you were then accused of being an ecological bolshevik .
does it do any good to deal with each other in this way ? no , it does n't .
but sometimes you have to talk straight .
if business leaders say they will only continue to talk to the government when it does what they say , then i have to tell them to look at the constitution .
all state authority comes from the people through elections .
this is not about special interests , it 's about the good of the people .
i can understand that certain parts of german industry are annoyed that we are now putting more pressure on them to do what they promised in the first place but never actually did .
they pledged to reduce co2 emissions by 20 tons by 2005 .
the reality is 30 million tons extra were emitted , although high energy users like the chemical , steel , and aluminum industries actually cut co2 emissions .
but the energy industry itself increased emissions .
so you ca n't just simply speak of german industry as a whole . let 's stay on the topic of the power companies .
vattenfall , a swedish energy giant , had incidents recently at two nuclear plants in the north of germany .
without saying too much , let 's say that the information given by the company was questionable .
as a social democrat , does that give you more reason to stick by plans , or even increase pressure , to phase out nuclear energy in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the krümmel nuclear power plant has been shut down for the time being first of all , it shows that old power stations have risks .
it makes sense to close old nuclear power plants sooner and let newer power plants run longer .
this is because of the age and not necessarily because of the company that runs them , or the workers .
i 'm convinced that they are doing their jobs as well as possible .
the nuclear power law also states that old plants should close first .
but the energy companies want to do the opposite .
the reason is simple .
these old power plants have been completely paid off , so they make one million euros -lrb- $ 1.37 million -rrb- more profit a day than the newer plants .
but safety comes first . they have to close down the older plants and we will keep a strict eye on the plants that had incidents recently .
the krümmel plant will not be restarted until all problems have been solved .
this is particularly true of the communication problems .
vattenfall has finally agreed to let us talk directly to the people in charge at the time of the incidents .
we 're not out to get them .
we just want to find out how it happened so that we know how to react the next time and check other plants for similar dangers . we want to talk to the workers behind closed doors and we wo n't be holding any one person accountable .

belgrade has said it would give special autonomy to kosovo , but rejects full independence . un secretary general ban ki-moon , fearing that kosovo 's albanians would unilaterally declare independence , urged them on monday to instead let the security council settle the issue . in addition to kosovo , merkel and kostunica also discussed bilateral relations and the stabilization and security agreement that serbia hopes to have in place with the european union in october as a prelude towards full eu membership . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

british prosecutors had requested that andrei lugovoi , a former kgb officer , be extradited to face trial in britain for litvinenko 's murder , which russia rejected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstators in moscow demanding zakayev 's extradition in 2004 " the new british prime minister has declared war on russia - a diplomatic one , " the pro-kremlin daily izvestia wrote , adding that russian courts were still waiting for british authorities to extradite oligarch boris berezovsky and chechen rebel leader ahmed zakayev .
" in russia there are ongoing criminal investigations against them but the british consider them ' politically persecuted kremlin opponents . ' ... it wo n't be long before an ' appropriate response ' from moscow -lsb- comes -rsb- .
but what does britain need a ' second front ' for when it has n't finished dealing with the terrorists who have declared a jihad against it ? " kommersant daily agreed .
" great britain and russia have begun a diplomatic war , " warning that " moscow 's reaction , judging from yesterday 's emotional commentary from russian officials , will be even more violent . " british newspapers sided with prime minister gordon brown 's government . " what choice have we ? " asked the daily mail .
" by refusing to extradite andrei lugovoi to face trial , -lsb- russian -rsb- president vladimir putin has committed an outrage that demands punishment ...
as it is , the new prime minister has come up with sanctions that will present putin with real difficulties in his dealings with the west .
mr. brown has faced his serious test as an international statesman - and passed it with ease . " the times also applauded the government 's decision , noting that " the key issue was what steps could be taken that were both measured and appropriate .
those announced yesterday were right .
britain will suffer , and cynics may argue that today 's measures are futile and counter-productive .
but they send a signal to all those who would silence their critics abroad : britain will protect those on its soil and can not overlook murder for the sake of diplomatic convenience . " similarly , the guardian said it was " reasonable " to expect russia to amend its constitution to allow for the extradition of its citizens , which is currently prohibited .
" if russia is seeking to integrate itself into the world business community , if it seeks for its citizens greater freedom of movement and fewer visa restrictions , if it seeks to cooperate in the fight against international terrorism , it has also got to live by the rules that most other european states subject themselves to , " the paper 's editorial read .
" confrontation is in no one 's interest .
but nor is letting freelance murders take place on the streets of london . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russian foreign ministry spokesman mikhail kamynin already said that there will be consequences after the extraditions but a few british papers also cautioned that the expulsions may lead to serious consequences . " the government should not be surprised if sanctions are extended to british companies in russia , " wrote the daily telegraph . the sun chimed in , adding that britain would have to secure public declarations of support from its allies in what it described as " the biggest test for european nerve since the cold war ... we have learned in two -lsb- world wars -rsb- not to appease bullies ...

if the commission goes ahead with the authorization , it will be the first time since 1998 that a genetically engineered plant is given permission for large-scale cultivation in the eu .

however , the european food safety authority has given a positive opinion on the basf-developed potato , saying its antibiotic resistance genes do not pose a " relevant " risk to human health or the environment .

the commission has said it favors the introduction of the genetically modified potato - which includes genes that make it resistant to antibiotics - since it will only be used for starch production and as animal feed .
" it will not enter the nutritional chain , " said a commission spokeswoman .
if the commission goes ahead with the authorization , it will be the first time since 1998 that a genetically engineered plant is given permission for large-scale cultivation in the eu .
however , the commission decision could take some time .
but international environmental group greenpeace said an eu go-ahead for cultivation of the potato would amount to allowing controversial genetically modified crops to enter the eu " through the back door . "

other states , including britain , favor the move .
greenpeace has called on governments to reject the potato , which has been developed by german chemical company basf , saying it poses significant risks to health and the environment .
eu rules demand that genes which may have adverse effects on human health and the environment should be phased out .
however , the european food safety authority has given a positive opinion on the basf-developed potato , saying its antibiotic resistance genes do not pose a " relevant " risk to human health or the environment .
greenpeace has warned that the genetically engineered potato did not undergo full risk assessment including its effect on biodiversity .

the commission has said it favors the introduction of the genetically modified potato - which includes genes that make it resistant to antibiotics - since it will only be used for starch production and as animal feed .
" it will not enter the nutritional chain , " said a commission spokeswoman .
if the commission goes ahead with the authorization , it will be the first time since 1998 that a genetically engineered plant is given permission for large-scale cultivation in the eu .
however , the commission decision could take some time .
but international environmental group greenpeace said an eu go-ahead for cultivation of the potato would amount to allowing controversial genetically modified crops to enter the eu " through the back door . "

other states , including britain , favor the move .
greenpeace has called on governments to reject the potato , which has been developed by german chemical company basf , saying it poses significant risks to health and the environment .
eu rules demand that genes which may have adverse effects on human health and the environment should be phased out .
however , the european food safety authority has given a positive opinion on the basf-developed potato , saying its antibiotic resistance genes do not pose a " relevant " risk to human health or the environment .
greenpeace has warned that the genetically engineered potato did not undergo full risk assessment including its effect on biodiversity .

british prosecutors had requested that andrei lugovoi , a former kgb officer , be extradited to face trial in britain for litvinenko 's murder , which russia rejected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstators in moscow demanding zakayev 's extradition in 2004 " the new british prime minister has declared war on russia - a diplomatic one , " the pro-kremlin daily izvestia wrote , adding that russian courts were still waiting for british authorities to extradite oligarch boris berezovsky and chechen rebel leader ahmed zakayev .
" in russia there are ongoing criminal investigations against them but the british consider them ' politically persecuted kremlin opponents . ' ... it wo n't be long before an ' appropriate response ' from moscow -lsb- comes -rsb- .

" by refusing to extradite andrei lugovoi to face trial , -lsb- russian -rsb- president vladimir putin has committed an outrage that demands punishment ...
as it is , the new prime minister has come up with sanctions that will present putin with real difficulties in his dealings with the west .

those announced yesterday were right .

british prosecutors had requested that andrei lugovoi , a former kgb officer , be extradited to face trial in britain for litvinenko 's murder , which russia rejected . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : demonstators in moscow demanding zakayev 's extradition in 2004 " the new british prime minister has declared war on russia - a diplomatic one , " the pro-kremlin daily izvestia wrote , adding that russian courts were still waiting for british authorities to extradite oligarch boris berezovsky and chechen rebel leader ahmed zakayev .
" in russia there are ongoing criminal investigations against them but the british consider them ' politically persecuted kremlin opponents . ' ... it wo n't be long before an ' appropriate response ' from moscow -lsb- comes -rsb- .
but what does britain need a ' second front ' for when it has n't finished dealing with the terrorists who have declared a jihad against it ? " kommersant daily agreed .
" great britain and russia have begun a diplomatic war , " warning that " moscow 's reaction , judging from yesterday 's emotional commentary from russian officials , will be even more violent . " british newspapers sided with prime minister gordon brown 's government . " what choice have we ? " asked the daily mail .
" by refusing to extradite andrei lugovoi to face trial , -lsb- russian -rsb- president vladimir putin has committed an outrage that demands punishment ...
as it is , the new prime minister has come up with sanctions that will present putin with real difficulties in his dealings with the west .
mr. brown has faced his serious test as an international statesman - and passed it with ease . " the times also applauded the government 's decision , noting that " the key issue was what steps could be taken that were both measured and appropriate .
those announced yesterday were right .
britain will suffer , and cynics may argue that today 's measures are futile and counter-productive .
but they send a signal to all those who would silence their critics abroad : britain will protect those on its soil and can not overlook murder for the sake of diplomatic convenience . " similarly , the guardian said it was " reasonable " to expect russia to amend its constitution to allow for the extradition of its citizens , which is currently prohibited .
" if russia is seeking to integrate itself into the world business community , if it seeks for its citizens greater freedom of movement and fewer visa restrictions , if it seeks to cooperate in the fight against international terrorism , it has also got to live by the rules that most other european states subject themselves to , " the paper 's editorial read .
" confrontation is in no one 's interest .
but nor is letting freelance murders take place on the streets of london .

" the government should not be surprised if sanctions are extended to british companies in russia , " wrote the daily telegraph . the sun chimed in , adding that britain would have to secure public declarations of support from its allies in what it described as " the biggest test for european nerve since the cold war ... we have learned in two -lsb- world wars -rsb- not to appease bullies ...

bulgaria wants the six , now facing life imprisonment , to be transferred to sofia . " the high judicial council decided to commute the death sentences against the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor to life-imprisonment terms , " the council said in a brief statement on tuesday . the decision was greeted with relief by the eu and the us even as critics say they would have liked the medics , who say they are innocent , to be pardoned . bulgaria said it would ask libya to transfer the six medics to sofia . " this decision is a big step ...
for us the case will end once they come back to bulgaria , " foreign minister ivailo kalfin told reporters .
he said the decision of libya 's high judicial council to commute the death sentences to life imprisonment allowed sofia to use an agreement with tripoli on exchange of prisoners and request the transfer of the five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor , who has received bulgarian citizenship . " tomorrow morning we will start working on implementing the transfer of the medics , " kalfin said . sussanah sherkin , deputy director of physicians for human rights said she hoped the medics would be pardoned . " we can only hope in the hours ahead a pardon will be issued and this ordeal will be over , " she said . " the entire world is watching this processs and we are very hopeful given all of the engagement of world leaders , human rights groups and the bulgarians in this case . " relatives of hiv children drop death sentence demand libya 's decision followed news that relatives of the libyan hiv-infected children had agreed to drop their demand that five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor , all of whom were convicted in december , be executed .

bulgaria wants the six , now facing life imprisonment , to be transferred to sofia . " the high judicial council decided to commute the death sentences against the five bulgarian nurses and the palestinian doctor to life-imprisonment terms , " the council said in a brief statement on tuesday . the decision was greeted with relief by the eu and the us even as critics say they would have liked the medics , who say they are innocent , to be pardoned . bulgaria said it would ask libya to transfer the six medics to sofia . " this decision is a big step ...
for us the case will end once they come back to bulgaria , " foreign minister ivailo kalfin told reporters .
he said the decision of libya 's high judicial council to commute the death sentences to life imprisonment allowed sofia to use an agreement with tripoli on exchange of prisoners and request the transfer of the five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor , who has received bulgarian citizenship . " tomorrow morning we will start working on implementing the transfer of the medics , " kalfin said . sussanah sherkin , deputy director of physicians for human rights said she hoped the medics would be pardoned . " we can only hope in the hours ahead a pardon will be issued and this ordeal will be over , " she said . " the entire world is watching this processs and we are very hopeful given all of the engagement of world leaders , human rights groups and the bulgarians in this case . " relatives of hiv children drop death sentence demand libya 's decision followed news that relatives of the libyan hiv-infected children had agreed to drop their demand that five bulgarian nurses and a palestinian doctor , all of whom were convicted in december , be executed . " we have notified in writing that the families have relinquished their demand for the execution " of the six medics , idriss lagha , the head of the libyan-based association for the families of hiv-infected children , told the associated press . lagha said the families had renounced asking for the death of the medics because they had received all the compensation money they were due under a settlement reached last week .
" all the families have received their cash transfer , one million dollars for each infection , " lagha told ap . earlier , libya had said it had given checks to more than 50 percent of the families whose children were killed by the aids virus . medics say they are innocent bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the high judiciary council is the last place the medics can appeal their sentence the nurses , who have been in jail since 1999 , maintain their innocence and have said they confessed to the accusations under torture . foreign experts familiar with libya have blamed the country 's poor health care system and unhygienic conditions for the infections that have led to 56 children 's deaths , prompting widespread anger in libya . the victims ' families have said the case was part of a western attempt to undermine muslims and libya .

the deal would see renewable energy sources making up 20 percent of europe 's energy by 2020 - a relatively ambitious goal . at the g8 summit in heiligendamm , the chancellor also managed to convince us president george w. bush to take on the problem of climate change .
it was clear before germany took over the rotating presidency of the eu that climate protection would be an important topic .
but , to be honest , did you expect these somewhat surprisingly positive results ? sigmar gabriel : yes .
that became clear in the meetings of the environment council that were held before the eu summit .
we all agreed on one position in the eu , but of course it is still a great success .
it was only possible because the heads of state and government got personally involved .
if meetings were only between environment ministers , then we would never have had the power to make sweeping changes .
climate change and energy policy is more than just an environmental issue .
it 's security , stability and economic policy .
the leaders realize this now and this is a great success for germany 's term as president of the eu .
it 's also been a success for the grand coalition in germany , for its climate and energy policy . but the real test lies ahead .
the promises made at heiligendamm now have to be fulfilled .
the un climate conference in bali in december is the next step to replace the kyoto protocol .
that runs out in 2012 and it is important that countries like china , india and the us show more willingness to take part in climate protection .
do you think it will be a success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel manage to work her magic with bush again ?
george bush has said that he will take part in the discussions , but he has not made any clear statements on the goals .
it 's a bit like the neil armstrong quote : it might be a giant leap for the americans - but only a small step for mankind .
we have to get a mandate for negotiation in bali .
then we will spend two years working out the new treaty .
the kyoto protocol ends in 2012 .
between 2009 and 2012 , we have to get the new treaty ratified across the world .
in germany we have to get it passed by the 16 federal states .
that takes time .
so you can just imagine how long it will take for the whole world .
we will need two years after the negotiations to get it passed by parliaments .
we have to have a new treaty ready to come into effect by jan 1 . , 2013 , that provides far more climate protection than the kyoto protocol .
it is of course also necessary that the international community backs the new treaty .
the countries that are responsible for climate change - the industrialized nations , and that includes europe and germany - have to show that you can have economic growth and increased energy efficiency . this is why we have to pass new climate and energy laws in germany by the end of the year .
the german chancellor not only has to convince seven federal states to pass these laws .
she also has to convince the state premiers from her own conservative block , which seems increasingly difficult .
we have worked well together with chancellor merkel and then we see our efforts undermined by conservative leaders .
we ca n't let this happen .
we ca n't demand that other countries participate and then do too little ourselves .
this is the acid test for climate and energy policy - we will see whether federal states run by conservatives block or pass the new laws . two weeks ago there was a meeting about this in the chancellery .
it was decided , against the will of german industry , to increase energy efficiency by 3 percent annually .
currently it 's only 1 percent .
those are pretty ambitious targets and german industry says it ca n't afford to do it .
how realistic is this goal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy consumption continues to be a touchy subject in germany i never understood the fact that industry was against these plans .
surely it 's in their interests to reduce energy costs .
when energy prices rise then it is prudent to reduce energy consumption .
by the way , our energy efficiency currently increases at a rate of 1.7 percent .
in times of economic growth energy efficiency also improves because plants become more efficient .
people buy new cars , which are more efficient .
so even without doing anything energy efficiency has risen to just under 2 percent .
now industry has to keep its promises and increase combined heat and power generation .
we will introduce new laws because they have not lived up to their promises .
we will do more on the consumer side - electrical goods will use less power , buildings will be better insulated .
for all that we will provide extra subsidies . the disputes between you and certain parts of industry in germany are often quite vocal .
there were press reports of comments you made - for example you said the actions of basf ceo hambrecht reminded you of business stalinism .
you were then accused of being an ecological bolshevik .
does it do any good to deal with each other in this way ? no , it does n't .
but sometimes you have to talk straight .
if business leaders say they will only continue to talk to the government when it does what they say , then i have to tell them to look at the constitution .
all state authority comes from the people through elections .
this is not about special interests , it 's about the good of the people .
i can understand that certain parts of german industry are annoyed that we are now putting more pressure on them to do what they promised in the first place but never actually did .
they pledged to reduce co2 emissions by 20 tons by 2005 .
the reality is 30 million tons extra were emitted , although high energy users like the chemical , steel , and aluminum industries actually cut co2 emissions .
but the energy industry itself increased emissions .
so you ca n't just simply speak of german industry as a whole . let 's stay on the topic of the power companies .
vattenfall , a swedish energy giant , had incidents recently at two nuclear plants in the north of germany .
without saying too much , let 's say that the information given by the company was questionable .
as a social democrat , does that give you more reason to stick by plans , or even increase pressure , to phase out nuclear energy in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the krümmel nuclear power plant has been shut down for the time being first of all , it shows that old power stations have risks .
it makes sense to close old nuclear power plants sooner and let newer power plants run longer .
this is because of the age and not necessarily because of the company that runs them , or the workers .
i 'm convinced that they are doing their jobs as well as possible .
the nuclear power law also states that old plants should close first .
but the energy companies want to do the opposite .
the reason is simple .
these old power plants have been completely paid off , so they make one million euros -lrb- $ 1.37 million -rrb- more profit a day than the newer plants .
but safety comes first . they have to close down the older plants and we will keep a strict eye on the plants that had incidents recently .
the krümmel plant will not be restarted until all problems have been solved .
this is particularly true of the communication problems .
vattenfall has finally agreed to let us talk directly to the people in charge at the time of the incidents .
we 're not out to get them .
we just want to find out how it happened so that we know how to react the next time and check other plants for similar dangers . we want to talk to the workers behind closed doors and we wo n't be holding any one person accountable .
i 'm sure they all tried to do their best .

the deal would see renewable energy sources making up 20 percent of europe 's energy by 2020 - a relatively ambitious goal . at the g8 summit in heiligendamm , the chancellor also managed to convince us president george w. bush to take on the problem of climate change .
it was clear before germany took over the rotating presidency of the eu that climate protection would be an important topic .
but , to be honest , did you expect these somewhat surprisingly positive results ? sigmar gabriel : yes .
that became clear in the meetings of the environment council that were held before the eu summit .
we all agreed on one position in the eu , but of course it is still a great success .
it was only possible because the heads of state and government got personally involved .
if meetings were only between environment ministers , then we would never have had the power to make sweeping changes .
climate change and energy policy is more than just an environmental issue .
it 's security , stability and economic policy .
the leaders realize this now and this is a great success for germany 's term as president of the eu .
it 's also been a success for the grand coalition in germany , for its climate and energy policy . but the real test lies ahead .
the promises made at heiligendamm now have to be fulfilled .
the un climate conference in bali in december is the next step to replace the kyoto protocol .
that runs out in 2012 and it is important that countries like china , india and the us show more willingness to take part in climate protection .
do you think it will be a success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel manage to work her magic with bush again ?
george bush has said that he will take part in the discussions , but he has not made any clear statements on the goals .
it 's a bit like the neil armstrong quote : it might be a giant leap for the americans - but only a small step for mankind .
we have to get a mandate for negotiation in bali .
then we will spend two years working out the new treaty .
the kyoto protocol ends in 2012 .
between 2009 and 2012 , we have to get the new treaty ratified across the world .
in germany we have to get it passed by the 16 federal states .
that takes time .
so you can just imagine how long it will take for the whole world .
we will need two years after the negotiations to get it passed by parliaments .
we have to have a new treaty ready to come into effect by jan 1 . , 2013 , that provides far more climate protection than the kyoto protocol .
it is of course also necessary that the international community backs the new treaty .
the countries that are responsible for climate change - the industrialized nations , and that includes europe and germany - have to show that you can have economic growth and increased energy efficiency . this is why we have to pass new climate and energy laws in germany by the end of the year .
the german chancellor not only has to convince seven federal states to pass these laws .
she also has to convince the state premiers from her own conservative block , which seems increasingly difficult .
we have worked well together with chancellor merkel and then we see our efforts undermined by conservative leaders .
we ca n't let this happen .
we ca n't demand that other countries participate and then do too little ourselves .
this is the acid test for climate and energy policy - we will see whether federal states run by conservatives block or pass the new laws . two weeks ago there was a meeting about this in the chancellery .
it was decided , against the will of german industry , to increase energy efficiency by 3 percent annually .
currently it 's only 1 percent .
those are pretty ambitious targets and german industry says it ca n't afford to do it .
how realistic is this goal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy consumption continues to be a touchy subject in germany i never understood the fact that industry was against these plans .
surely it 's in their interests to reduce energy costs .
when energy prices rise then it is prudent to reduce energy consumption .
by the way , our energy efficiency currently increases at a rate of 1.7 percent .
in times of economic growth energy efficiency also improves because plants become more efficient .
people buy new cars , which are more efficient .
so even without doing anything energy efficiency has risen to just under 2 percent .
now industry has to keep its promises and increase combined heat and power generation .
we will introduce new laws because they have not lived up to their promises .
we will do more on the consumer side - electrical goods will use less power , buildings will be better insulated .
for all that we will provide extra subsidies . the disputes between you and certain parts of industry in germany are often quite vocal .
there were press reports of comments you made - for example you said the actions of basf ceo hambrecht reminded you of business stalinism .
you were then accused of being an ecological bolshevik .
does it do any good to deal with each other in this way ? no , it does n't .
but sometimes you have to talk straight .
if business leaders say they will only continue to talk to the government when it does what they say , then i have to tell them to look at the constitution .
all state authority comes from the people through elections .
this is not about special interests , it 's about the good of the people .
i can understand that certain parts of german industry are annoyed that we are now putting more pressure on them to do what they promised in the first place but never actually did .
they pledged to reduce co2 emissions by 20 tons by 2005 .
the reality is 30 million tons extra were emitted , although high energy users like the chemical , steel , and aluminum industries actually cut co2 emissions .
but the energy industry itself increased emissions .
so you ca n't just simply speak of german industry as a whole . let 's stay on the topic of the power companies .
vattenfall , a swedish energy giant , had incidents recently at two nuclear plants in the north of germany .
without saying too much , let 's say that the information given by the company was questionable .
as a social democrat , does that give you more reason to stick by plans , or even increase pressure , to phase out nuclear energy in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the krümmel nuclear power plant has been shut down for the time being first of all , it shows that old power stations have risks .
it makes sense to close old nuclear power plants sooner and let newer power plants run longer .
this is because of the age and not necessarily because of the company that runs them , or the workers .
i 'm convinced that they are doing their jobs as well as possible .
the nuclear power law also states that old plants should close first .
but the energy companies want to do the opposite .
the reason is simple .
these old power plants have been completely paid off , so they make one million euros -lrb- $ 1.37 million -rrb- more profit a day than the newer plants .
but safety comes first . they have to close down the older plants and we will keep a strict eye on the plants that had incidents recently .
the krümmel plant will not be restarted until all problems have been solved .
this is particularly true of the communication problems .
vattenfall has finally agreed to let us talk directly to the people in charge at the time of the incidents .
we 're not out to get them .
we just want to find out how it happened so that we know how to react the next time and check other plants for similar dangers . we want to talk to the workers behind closed doors and we wo n't be holding any one person accountable .
i 'm sure they all tried to do their best .
but mistakes were made and we have to find out which ones . dw-tv 's jens thurau interviewed sigmar gabriel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de environment -pipe- 17.07.2007 " this is the acid test for climate and energy policy " großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : gabriel wants new climate and energy laws for germany by the end of the year german environment minister sigmar gabriel spoke to dw-tv about the environmental successes of germany 's eu and g8 presidencies , the need for a new kyoto protocol and problems at german nuclear power plants . dw-tv : mr. gabriel , at the european union summit earlier this year , the german chancellor reached a breakthrough on climate and energy policy in the eu .
the deal would see renewable energy sources making up 20 percent of europe 's energy by 2020 - a relatively ambitious goal . at the g8 summit in heiligendamm , the chancellor also managed to convince us president george w. bush to take on the problem of climate change .
it was clear before germany took over the rotating presidency of the eu that climate protection would be an important topic .
but , to be honest , did you expect these somewhat surprisingly positive results ? sigmar gabriel : yes .
that became clear in the meetings of the environment council that were held before the eu summit .
we all agreed on one position in the eu , but of course it is still a great success .
it was only possible because the heads of state and government got personally involved .
if meetings were only between environment ministers , then we would never have had the power to make sweeping changes .
climate change and energy policy is more than just an environmental issue .
it 's security , stability and economic policy .
the leaders realize this now and this is a great success for germany 's term as president of the eu .
it 's also been a success for the grand coalition in germany , for its climate and energy policy . but the real test lies ahead .
the promises made at heiligendamm now have to be fulfilled .
the un climate conference in bali in december is the next step to replace the kyoto protocol .
that runs out in 2012 and it is important that countries like china , india and the us show more willingness to take part in climate protection .
do you think it will be a success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel manage to work her magic with bush again ?
george bush has said that he will take part in the discussions , but he has not made any clear statements on the goals .
it 's a bit like the neil armstrong quote : it might be a giant leap for the americans - but only a small step for mankind .
we have to get a mandate for negotiation in bali .
then we will spend two years working out the new treaty .
the kyoto protocol ends in 2012 .
between 2009 and 2012 , we have to get the new treaty ratified across the world .
in germany we have to get it passed by the 16 federal states .
that takes time .
so you can just imagine how long it will take for the whole world .
we will need two years after the negotiations to get it passed by parliaments .
we have to have a new treaty ready to come into effect by jan 1 . , 2013 , that provides far more climate protection than the kyoto protocol .
it is of course also necessary that the international community backs the new treaty .
the countries that are responsible for climate change - the industrialized nations , and that includes europe and germany - have to show that you can have economic growth and increased energy efficiency . this is why we have to pass new climate and energy laws in germany by the end of the year .
the german chancellor not only has to convince seven federal states to pass these laws .
she also has to convince the state premiers from her own conservative block , which seems increasingly difficult .
we have worked well together with chancellor merkel and then we see our efforts undermined by conservative leaders .
we ca n't let this happen .
we ca n't demand that other countries participate and then do too little ourselves .
this is the acid test for climate and energy policy - we will see whether federal states run by conservatives block or pass the new laws . two weeks ago there was a meeting about this in the chancellery .
it was decided , against the will of german industry , to increase energy efficiency by 3 percent annually .
currently it 's only 1 percent .
those are pretty ambitious targets and german industry says it ca n't afford to do it .
how realistic is this goal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy consumption continues to be a touchy subject in germany i never understood the fact that industry was against these plans .
surely it 's in their interests to reduce energy costs .
when energy prices rise then it is prudent to reduce energy consumption .
by the way , our energy efficiency currently increases at a rate of 1.7 percent .
in times of economic growth energy efficiency also improves because plants become more efficient .
people buy new cars , which are more efficient .
so even without doing anything energy efficiency has risen to just under 2 percent .
now industry has to keep its promises and increase combined heat and power generation .
we will introduce new laws because they have not lived up to their promises .
we will do more on the consumer side - electrical goods will use less power , buildings will be better insulated .
for all that we will provide extra subsidies . the disputes between you and certain parts of industry in germany are often quite vocal .
there were press reports of comments you made - for example you said the actions of basf ceo hambrecht reminded you of business stalinism .
you were then accused of being an ecological bolshevik .
does it do any good to deal with each other in this way ? no , it does n't .
but sometimes you have to talk straight .
if business leaders say they will only continue to talk to the government when it does what they say , then i have to tell them to look at the constitution .
all state authority comes from the people through elections .
this is not about special interests , it 's about the good of the people .
i can understand that certain parts of german industry are annoyed that we are now putting more pressure on them to do what they promised in the first place but never actually did .
they pledged to reduce co2 emissions by 20 tons by 2005 .
the reality is 30 million tons extra were emitted , although high energy users like the chemical , steel , and aluminum industries actually cut co2 emissions .
but the energy industry itself increased emissions .
so you ca n't just simply speak of german industry as a whole . let 's stay on the topic of the power companies .
vattenfall , a swedish energy giant , had incidents recently at two nuclear plants in the north of germany .
without saying too much , let 's say that the information given by the company was questionable .
as a social democrat , does that give you more reason to stick by plans , or even increase pressure , to phase out nuclear energy in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the krümmel nuclear power plant has been shut down for the time being first of all , it shows that old power stations have risks .
it makes sense to close old nuclear power plants sooner and let newer power plants run longer .
this is because of the age and not necessarily because of the company that runs them , or the workers .
i 'm convinced that they are doing their jobs as well as possible .
the nuclear power law also states that old plants should close first .
but the energy companies want to do the opposite .
the reason is simple .
these old power plants have been completely paid off , so they make one million euros -lrb- $ 1.37 million -rrb- more profit a day than the newer plants .
but safety comes first . they have to close down the older plants and we will keep a strict eye on the plants that had incidents recently .
the krümmel plant will not be restarted until all problems have been solved .
this is particularly true of the communication problems .
vattenfall has finally agreed to let us talk directly to the people in charge at the time of the incidents .
we 're not out to get them .
we just want to find out how it happened so that we know how to react the next time and check other plants for similar dangers . we want to talk to the workers behind closed doors and we wo n't be holding any one person accountable .
i 'm sure they all tried to do their best .
but mistakes were made and we have to find out which ones . dw-tv 's jens thurau interviewed sigmar gabriel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

poland said building will restart aug .
1 . poland announced on tuesday that work would continue on aug .
1 on the controversial via baltica highway through a section of virgin forest in the northeast rospuda valley , near the border with lithuania .
however , european commission spokeswoman on environmental affairs , barbara helfferich , said the eu executive would not hesitate to take poland to the european court of justice -lrb- ecj -rrb- once again to get the road work halted .
" we have a letter ready to be sent to the court to ask for interim measures and they can be applied very quickly , " she told afp news agency . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : poland has 31 orchid species , 19 of which can be found in the rospuda valley she added that poland had not officially informed the commission that it would resume roadwork .
" if they resume , then the commission would definitely send the letter , " she said .
unique habitat the rospuda marshlands and surrounding area are the world 's most important breeding grounds for the endangered aquatic warbler .
the region is also home to rare spotted eagles , lynx and wolves .
the planned " via baltica " highway , however , is intended as a new , major corridor for the baltic states meant to ease traffic and thus trade between eastern and western europe .
to cut down on traffic flow near the town of augustow , polish transport officials foresee building a bypass road that would cut right through the rospuda river valley .
eu authorities consider the area to be " a unique wetland system . "
currently , some 4,500 heavy goods trucks use poland 's existing , one-lane route eight every day on their way to and from the lithuanian border , with the road traveling right through the center of augustow .

that would be roughly until the end of this month . with the halt to the roadworks , the european commission then froze its action at the ecj , europe 's highest court .
nonetheless , the eu had earmarked funds for poland in the 2007-2013 budget , but none of them have been allocated as yet .

" it is apparent that the -lrb- british -rrb- sanctions are aimed at politicizing the litvinenko affair , " he added .
" this is a direct path to confrontation . " eu could be pulled into fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has promised to respond to the expulsion gruschko also said he hoped the european union would have " enough common sense " as to not allow itself to become an instrument in the affair . but the eu is likely to be pulled into any dispute between a member state and russia , according to luxemburg 's foreign minister jean asselborn . " naturally we are showing our solidarity with another eu member , but you also have to have the right to question certain steps , " asselborn told financial times deutschland , adding that he wondered if the dispute could have been settled using " silent , diplomatic channels . " german chancellor angela merkel gave her support to brown 's decision to expel the russians , who are rumored to be part of the embassy 's intelligence unit . " the decisions have been made after very careful consideration of the facts at hand in the united kingdom , " she said monday night after meeting with brown , who made berlin his first foreign stop as britain 's prime minister .
" we hope that this phase will be overcome as quickly as possible and that one can continue along the lines of having a very good cooperation , which is after all what you want with russia . " the french foreign ministry allow issued a statement tuesday calling for moscow to " constructively answer the british request . " uk also refused to extradite russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has demanded britain extradite chechen leader ahmed zakayev miliband told parliament monday there was a " significant body of evidence " of lugovoi 's involvement in the litvinenko murder , but russia has refused to extradite him to face trial in britain . according to the british public prosecutor , ex-kgb officer lugovoi is said to have killed former russian agent litvinenko by poisoning him with radioactive polonium-210 in november 2006 .
lugovoi has denied involvement in the case . the russian government condemned the diplomats ' expulsion as " provocative " and " immoral " and said it would have " the most serious consequences for russian-british relations as a whole . " grushko added that britain has refused to extradite 21 russians living in the uk and offered asylum to some of them . " if russia acted in the same manner as london , over 80 diplomats would have been expelled from the british embassy to russia , " grushko said business ties unlikely to be hurt both the british and russian governments emphasized that they did not anticipate their countries ' economic relationship to suffer due to the political confrontation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stop to energy deliveries damage both russia and the uk " we do not expect our disappointment with the russian authorities about the litvinenko case to affect the economic sphere , " british ambassador to russia tony brenton told reporters .

" grushko said that moscow would take international business interests into account when formulating its as yet unannounced response to the russian diplomats ' expulsion . " we will fully take into account the interests of ordinary citizens , tourists , participants in cultural and scientific exchanges and business circles , " he said .
" we do not want them to suffer because of london 's political actions . " russia , which has used its vast energy resources as a political instrument to limit fuel supplies to its neighbors in the past , would benefit little from such action with britain as the uk is one of the largest investors in russian energy markets and pumped nearly 4 billion euros into the branch last year , according to a report in britain 's times newspaper . a spokesman for britain 's foreign office said no retaliation by russia would be justified . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

belgrade has said it would give special autonomy to kosovo , but rejects full independence . un secretary general ban ki-moon , fearing that kosovo 's albanians would unilaterally declare independence , urged them on monday to instead let the security council settle the issue . in addition to kosovo , merkel and kostunica also discussed bilateral relations and the stabilization and security agreement that serbia hopes to have in place with the european union in october as a prelude towards full eu membership . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" grushko added that britain has refused to extradite 21 russians living in the uk and offered asylum to some of them . " if russia acted in the same manner as london , over 80 diplomats would have been expelled from the british embassy to russia , " grushko said business ties unlikely to be hurt both the british and russian governments emphasized that they did not anticipate their countries ' economic relationship to suffer due to the political confrontation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stop to energy deliveries damage both russia and the uk " we do not expect our disappointment with the russian authorities about the litvinenko case to affect the economic sphere , " british ambassador to russia tony brenton told reporters .
" indeed we expect british-russian economic ties to continue to grow . " grushko said that moscow would take international business interests into account when formulating its as yet unannounced response to the russian diplomats ' expulsion . " we will fully take into account the interests of ordinary citizens , tourists , participants in cultural and scientific exchanges and business circles , " he said .
" we do not want them to suffer because of london 's political actions . " russia , which has used its vast energy resources as a political instrument to limit fuel supplies to its neighbors in the past , would benefit little from such action with britain as the uk is one of the largest investors in russian energy markets and pumped nearly 4 billion euros into the branch last year , according to a report in britain 's times newspaper . a spokesman for britain 's foreign office said no retaliation by russia would be justified . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

belgrade has said it would give special autonomy to kosovo , but rejects full independence . un secretary general ban ki-moon , fearing that kosovo 's albanians would unilaterally declare independence , urged them on monday to instead let the security council settle the issue . in addition to kosovo , merkel and kostunica also discussed bilateral relations and the stabilization and security agreement that serbia hopes to have in place with the european union in october as a prelude towards full eu membership . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" it is apparent that the -lrb- british -rrb- sanctions are aimed at politicizing the litvinenko affair , " he added .
" this is a direct path to confrontation . " eu could be pulled into fight bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has promised to respond to the expulsion gruschko also said he hoped the european union would have " enough common sense " as to not allow itself to become an instrument in the affair . but the eu is likely to be pulled into any dispute between a member state and russia , according to luxemburg 's foreign minister jean asselborn . " naturally we are showing our solidarity with another eu member , but you also have to have the right to question certain steps , " asselborn told financial times deutschland , adding that he wondered if the dispute could have been settled using " silent , diplomatic channels . " german chancellor angela merkel gave her support to brown 's decision to expel the russians , who are rumored to be part of the embassy 's intelligence unit . " the decisions have been made after very careful consideration of the facts at hand in the united kingdom , " she said monday night after meeting with brown , who made berlin his first foreign stop as britain 's prime minister .
" we hope that this phase will be overcome as quickly as possible and that one can continue along the lines of having a very good cooperation , which is after all what you want with russia . " the french foreign ministry allow issued a statement tuesday calling for moscow to " constructively answer the british request . " uk also refused to extradite russians bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : russia has demanded britain extradite chechen leader ahmed zakayev miliband told parliament monday there was a " significant body of evidence " of lugovoi 's involvement in the litvinenko murder , but russia has refused to extradite him to face trial in britain . according to the british public prosecutor , ex-kgb officer lugovoi is said to have killed former russian agent litvinenko by poisoning him with radioactive polonium-210 in november 2006 .
lugovoi has denied involvement in the case . the russian government condemned the diplomats ' expulsion as " provocative " and " immoral " and said it would have " the most serious consequences for russian-british relations as a whole . " grushko added that britain has refused to extradite 21 russians living in the uk and offered asylum to some of them . " if russia acted in the same manner as london , over 80 diplomats would have been expelled from the british embassy to russia , " grushko said business ties unlikely to be hurt both the british and russian governments emphasized that they did not anticipate their countries ' economic relationship to suffer due to the political confrontation . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a stop to energy deliveries damage both russia and the uk " we do not expect our disappointment with the russian authorities about the litvinenko case to affect the economic sphere , " british ambassador to russia tony brenton told reporters .
" indeed we expect british-russian economic ties to continue to grow . " grushko said that moscow would take international business interests into account when formulating its as yet unannounced response to the russian diplomats ' expulsion . " we will fully take into account the interests of ordinary citizens , tourists , participants in cultural and scientific exchanges and business circles , " he said .
" we do not want them to suffer because of london 's political actions . " russia , which has used its vast energy resources as a political instrument to limit fuel supplies to its neighbors in the past , would benefit little from such action with britain as the uk is one of the largest investors in russian energy markets and pumped nearly 4 billion euros into the branch last year , according to a report in britain 's times newspaper . a spokesman for britain 's foreign office said no retaliation by russia would be justified . dw staff -lrb- sms -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

belgrade has said it would give special autonomy to kosovo , but rejects full independence . un secretary general ban ki-moon , fearing that kosovo 's albanians would unilaterally declare independence , urged them on monday to instead let the security council settle the issue . in addition to kosovo , merkel and kostunica also discussed bilateral relations and the stabilization and security agreement that serbia hopes to have in place with the european union in october as a prelude towards full eu membership . dw staff / dpa -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

the deal would see renewable energy sources making up 20 percent of europe 's energy by 2020 - a relatively ambitious goal . at the g8 summit in heiligendamm , the chancellor also managed to convince us president george w. bush to take on the problem of climate change .
it was clear before germany took over the rotating presidency of the eu that climate protection would be an important topic .
but , to be honest , did you expect these somewhat surprisingly positive results ? sigmar gabriel : yes .
that became clear in the meetings of the environment council that were held before the eu summit .
we all agreed on one position in the eu , but of course it is still a great success .
it was only possible because the heads of state and government got personally involved .
if meetings were only between environment ministers , then we would never have had the power to make sweeping changes .
climate change and energy policy is more than just an environmental issue .
it 's security , stability and economic policy .
the leaders realize this now and this is a great success for germany 's term as president of the eu .
it 's also been a success for the grand coalition in germany , for its climate and energy policy . but the real test lies ahead .
the promises made at heiligendamm now have to be fulfilled .
the un climate conference in bali in december is the next step to replace the kyoto protocol .
that runs out in 2012 and it is important that countries like china , india and the us show more willingness to take part in climate protection .
do you think it will be a success ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : will merkel manage to work her magic with bush again ?
george bush has said that he will take part in the discussions , but he has not made any clear statements on the goals .
it 's a bit like the neil armstrong quote : it might be a giant leap for the americans - but only a small step for mankind .
we have to get a mandate for negotiation in bali .
then we will spend two years working out the new treaty .
the kyoto protocol ends in 2012 .
between 2009 and 2012 , we have to get the new treaty ratified across the world .
in germany we have to get it passed by the 16 federal states .
that takes time .
so you can just imagine how long it will take for the whole world .
we will need two years after the negotiations to get it passed by parliaments .
we have to have a new treaty ready to come into effect by jan 1 . , 2013 , that provides far more climate protection than the kyoto protocol .
it is of course also necessary that the international community backs the new treaty .
the countries that are responsible for climate change - the industrialized nations , and that includes europe and germany - have to show that you can have economic growth and increased energy efficiency . this is why we have to pass new climate and energy laws in germany by the end of the year .
the german chancellor not only has to convince seven federal states to pass these laws .
she also has to convince the state premiers from her own conservative block , which seems increasingly difficult .
we have worked well together with chancellor merkel and then we see our efforts undermined by conservative leaders .
we ca n't let this happen .
we ca n't demand that other countries participate and then do too little ourselves .
this is the acid test for climate and energy policy - we will see whether federal states run by conservatives block or pass the new laws . two weeks ago there was a meeting about this in the chancellery .
it was decided , against the will of german industry , to increase energy efficiency by 3 percent annually .
currently it 's only 1 percent .
those are pretty ambitious targets and german industry says it ca n't afford to do it .
how realistic is this goal ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : energy consumption continues to be a touchy subject in germany i never understood the fact that industry was against these plans .
surely it 's in their interests to reduce energy costs .
when energy prices rise then it is prudent to reduce energy consumption .
by the way , our energy efficiency currently increases at a rate of 1.7 percent .
in times of economic growth energy efficiency also improves because plants become more efficient .
people buy new cars , which are more efficient .
so even without doing anything energy efficiency has risen to just under 2 percent .
now industry has to keep its promises and increase combined heat and power generation .
we will introduce new laws because they have not lived up to their promises .
we will do more on the consumer side - electrical goods will use less power , buildings will be better insulated .
for all that we will provide extra subsidies . the disputes between you and certain parts of industry in germany are often quite vocal .
there were press reports of comments you made - for example you said the actions of basf ceo hambrecht reminded you of business stalinism .
you were then accused of being an ecological bolshevik .
does it do any good to deal with each other in this way ? no , it does n't .
but sometimes you have to talk straight .
if business leaders say they will only continue to talk to the government when it does what they say , then i have to tell them to look at the constitution .
all state authority comes from the people through elections .
this is not about special interests , it 's about the good of the people .
i can understand that certain parts of german industry are annoyed that we are now putting more pressure on them to do what they promised in the first place but never actually did .
they pledged to reduce co2 emissions by 20 tons by 2005 .
the reality is 30 million tons extra were emitted , although high energy users like the chemical , steel , and aluminum industries actually cut co2 emissions .
but the energy industry itself increased emissions .
so you ca n't just simply speak of german industry as a whole . let 's stay on the topic of the power companies .
vattenfall , a swedish energy giant , had incidents recently at two nuclear plants in the north of germany .
without saying too much , let 's say that the information given by the company was questionable .
as a social democrat , does that give you more reason to stick by plans , or even increase pressure , to phase out nuclear energy in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the krümmel nuclear power plant has been shut down for the time being first of all , it shows that old power stations have risks .
it makes sense to close old nuclear power plants sooner and let newer power plants run longer .
this is because of the age and not necessarily because of the company that runs them , or the workers .
i 'm convinced that they are doing their jobs as well as possible .
the nuclear power law also states that old plants should close first .
but the energy companies want to do the opposite .
the reason is simple .
these old power plants have been completely paid off , so they make one million euros -lrb- $ 1.37 million -rrb- more profit a day than the newer plants .
but safety comes first . they have to close down the older plants and we will keep a strict eye on the plants that had incidents recently .
the krümmel plant will not be restarted until all problems have been solved .
this is particularly true of the communication problems .
vattenfall has finally agreed to let us talk directly to the people in charge at the time of the incidents .
we 're not out to get them .
we just want to find out how it happened so that we know how to react the next time and check other plants for similar dangers . we want to talk to the workers behind closed doors and we wo n't be holding any one person accountable .
i 'm sure they all tried to do their best .
but mistakes were made and we have to find out which ones . dw-tv 's jens thurau interviewed sigmar gabriel -lrb- win -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

if the commission goes ahead with the authorization , it will be the first time since 1998 that a genetically engineered plant is given permission for large-scale cultivation in the eu .

voices from care cymru said the plans - for local authorities to buy in advice for youngsters - " will fail some of wales 's most vulnerable children " .
it is supported on this issue by the british medical association -lrb- bma -rrb- .
the welsh assembly government said it had " noted " the charity 's comments .
the consultation continues until 23 july .
voices from care cymru - the only independent charity in wales representing looked-after children - said it had " fundamental issues " with the proposals set out by the welsh assembly government . "
the assembly government must now listen to the growing body of evidence ... as well as the recommendations in a series of reports over the last decade " deborah jones , voices from care cymru the group , which represents some 4,500 youngsters in wales in children 's homes and foster care , called for advocacy services for children and young people to be " truly independent " .

dafydd rhys williams , whose father was from the valleys town of bargoed , has already spoken welsh in space and taken gareth edwards ' rugby cap into orbit .
weeks away from his second trip on the space shuttle , dr williams told bbc wales that a welsh dragon would be watching over his mission notebook .
the 14-day tour will see dr williams make three space walks .
the former emergency room physician will be helping to build an extension on the international space station on the mission , which blasts off from the kennedy space centre in florida , usa on the shuttle endeavour on 7 august .
dr williams is excited by his latest challenge , which is vastly different from his role aboard columbia in 1998 when he carried out experiments in space as a neuro-scientist .
i realised that in 30 seconds i was going to have 7,000,000lb of thrust beneath me and that kind of got my attention dafydd rhys williams " i 'm not really feeling nervous at the moment , it is more a sense of excitement as all of our training is beginning to come together , " said dr williams , who is 53 and a father-of-two .
" the last time i flew in space i was kind of the same way .

dr williams ' second mission was due to have taken place in november 2003 , again aboard columbia .

the thumb and fingers can move and grip just like a human hand and are controlled by the patient 's mind and muscles .
it was invented by david gow and was designed and built by touch bionics , which is based in livingston .
the technology has been tested by a number of people , including us soldiers who lost limbs in the iraq war .
mr gow , who is the director of rehabilitation engineering services at nhs lothian , told the bbc 's good morning scotland programme : " it 's the first hand to come to the market that 's actually had bending fingers just like your own hand . "
" if you gave someone this hand for a month and then gave them back their old device , they would be very disappointed " donald mackillop bionic hand recipient donald mackillop from kilmarnock was one of the first people to be fitted with the bionic hand in 2006 and has been testing the new hand over the past few months .
the retired welder lost his right hand in an industrial accident almost 30 years ago .
since then , he has tried a succession of artificial hands but none have come close to the latest version .
" the most important thing is the movement of the fingers , that 's what really makes the difference , " he said .
" the hand does feel like a replacement for my missing hand and it is now very natural for me to pick up all sorts of objects .
it makes everyday activities much easier .
" if you gave someone this hand for a month and then gave them back their old device , they would be very disappointed . "
juan arredondo , from texas , who lost his hand in iraq in 2004 , has also been fitted with one of the hands .
" every day i have the hand , it surprises me , " he said .
" now i can pick up a styrofoam cup without crushing it .
with my other hand , i would really have to concentrate on how much pressure i was putting on the cup . "
stuart mead , chief executive at touch bionics , said : " we are delighted to be the company that moves bionic hand technology from the research and development phase into the real world , and to lead a generational advance in bionics and patient care .
" we have always existed to change the lives of patients with severe injuries and disabilities , and it is thrilling to feel that we are now able to accomplish that goal . "
the hand was tested at the national centre for prosthetics at strathclyde university .
mr gow , who works at a new state-of-the-art centre at the astley ainsley hospital in edinburgh , hopes the bionic hand could be available on the health service within two to five years .

it is not expected to reopen before september 2010 .
the reading rooms were unusually full last week .
bespectacled university professors , graduate students from famous universities around the world , monks wearing brown and black habits , and biblical researchers from more than 50 countries were sitting elbow-to-elbow at desks piled with documents and crowded with laptops and ancient manuscripts .
they were working desperately against time to complete their work before the closing down for the next three years of this powerhouse of academic research .
hive of activity you could have heard a pin drop in the library .
everyone talks in whispers .
there was an unmistakable sense of controlled hysteria among library staff , scurrying around to retrieve urgently needed books for scholars from the 60km -lrb- 37 miles -rrb- of stacks spread over seven floors , some of them underground .
many researchers had queued for hours to get a square metre of desk space .
vatican authorities had doubled the number of readers ' chairs from 100 to 200 in an attempt to satisfy the sudden spurt in demand since the announcement of the closure of the library for the first time in its 500-year history .
the vatican is home to many valuable historic texts even during the first and second world wars the library remained open .
one wing of the 16th century building which houses the library was found to be structurally unsafe earlier this year .
the accumulated weight of books was simply too heavy for the foundations of the building .
the vatican library was started by pope nicholas v in the early 1450s with an initial 350 latin manuscripts .
by the time he died in 1455 , the collection comprised some 1,500 documents and was already the largest in europe .
the collection now contains more than 1.5 million printed books , in addition to 150,000 precious manuscripts , the earliest of which date back to the days of the late roman empire .
scholars under pressure one of the library 's greatest treasures is the codex vaticanus , the world 's oldest bible , written by hand in the days of the first christian emperor constantine , early in the 4th century ad .
vatican engineers gave the 100-strong library staff only three months to remove 350,000 books from the endangered wing .
pope benedict visited the library last month scholars around the world protested against the lack of warning .
the emergency closure interrupted academic research in many countries .
scott mandelbrote of peterhouse college , cambridge , told me he had to rush out to rome to finish some library research earlier this summer , disrupting his university classes .
" the vatican library has resources that you can find nowhere else in the world , " he said .
but ambrogio piazzoni , deputy head of the vatican library , told me : " the library is now closed .
there will be no exceptions , although scholars can continue to request photocopies and microfilm until the library reopens in september 2010 . "
hi-tech help in the corridor outside his office hang portraits of the red-hatted cardinals who filled the prestigious post of papal librarian in the 16th century .
the present head of the library , jean tauran , also holds the rank of cardinal .
mr piazzoni , a layman , is proud that the vatican library is in the vanguard of digital technology .
microchips have already been installed inside some valuable books , which tell librarians if a book is missing from its regular stack .
in co-operation with a japanese company , new techniques have also been developed to read palimpsests , or ancient documents that have been written over again in the days when parchment or paper was a valuable commodity .
" using ultraviolet rays we can now easily scan documents digitally to reveal the writing underneath , which is invisible to the naked eye , " mr piazzoni said .
i asked him why stacks of old card indexes still fill one of the reading rooms when the library catalogue has been transferred to a digital database .
" we shall never destroy them because scholars often prefer to use the old library cards , and they are a permanent record which we can always use to check possible mistakes in the database , " he explained .

one wing of the 16th century building which houses the library was found to be structurally unsafe earlier this year .
the accumulated weight of books was simply too heavy for the foundations of the building .
the vatican library was started by pope nicholas v in the early 1450s with an initial 350 latin manuscripts .
by the time he died in 1455 , the collection comprised some 1,500 documents and was already the largest in europe .
the collection now contains more than 1.5 million printed books , in addition to 150,000 precious manuscripts , the earliest of which date back to the days of the late roman empire .
scholars under pressure one of the library 's greatest treasures is the codex vaticanus , the world 's oldest bible , written by hand in the days of the first christian emperor constantine , early in the 4th century ad .
vatican engineers gave the 100-strong library staff only three months to remove 350,000 books from the endangered wing .
pope benedict visited the library last month scholars around the world protested against the lack of warning .
the emergency closure interrupted academic research in many countries .
scott mandelbrote of peterhouse college , cambridge , told me he had to rush out to rome to finish some library research earlier this summer , disrupting his university classes .
" the vatican library has resources that you can find nowhere else in the world , " he said .
but ambrogio piazzoni , deputy head of the vatican library , told me : " the library is now closed .
there will be no exceptions , although scholars can continue to request photocopies and microfilm until the library reopens in september 2010 . "
hi-tech help in the corridor outside his office hang portraits of the red-hatted cardinals who filled the prestigious post of papal librarian in the 16th century .
the present head of the library , jean tauran , also holds the rank of cardinal .
mr piazzoni , a layman , is proud that the vatican library is in the vanguard of digital technology .
microchips have already been installed inside some valuable books , which tell librarians if a book is missing from its regular stack .
in co-operation with a japanese company , new techniques have also been developed to read palimpsests , or ancient documents that have been written over again in the days when parchment or paper was a valuable commodity .
" using ultraviolet rays we can now easily scan documents digitally to reveal the writing underneath , which is invisible to the naked eye , " mr piazzoni said .
i asked him why stacks of old card indexes still fill one of the reading rooms when the library catalogue has been transferred to a digital database .
" we shall never destroy them because scholars often prefer to use the old library cards , and they are a permanent record which we can always use to check possible mistakes in the database , " he explained .

here are a few of the controversies : early days after graduating in 1987 , mr johnson became a trainee reporter with the times newspaper but was sacked within a year for falsifying a quotation from his godfather colin lucas .
he described the episode in an interview with the independent in 2002 as his " biggest cock-up " , saying he had needed a historian 's quote for a story and had rung sir colin - who later became vice-chancellor of oxford university - and had misquoted him in a way that had jeopardised his academic reputation .
" it was a complete nightmare of a disaster , and to make it even worse , that very week colin was trying to become master of balliol college .
he later succeeded - but not that time .
of all the mistakes i 've made , i think that takes the biscuit , " he told the newspaper .
ken bigley in october 2004 , while editor of the spectator , mr johnson apologised for an unsigned editorial which criticised the city of liverpool over grief expressed for ken bigley - the british contractor who was taken hostage and later killed in iraq .
mr johnson accepted responsibility for the article , which said liverpudlians " wallow " in their " victim status " and attributed blame to liverpool football fans for the 1989 hillsborough disaster .
the then conservative leader michael howard ordered him to go to liverpool to apologise , which he did , to mixed reviews .
how boris said sorry to liverpool sacked in november 2004 , mr howard sacked mr johnson from his frontbench team for failing to tell the truth about claims he had had an affair .
but mr johnson later told reporters : " i did not mislead michael howard . "
mp denies misleading leader wrong code with world cup fever in the air in may 2006 , mr johnson took part in an england vs germany : the legends game , at reading 's madejski stadium .

" there was no malice in my actions .
i was going for the ball with my head , which i understand is a legitimate move in soccer . "
papua new guinea in september 2006 , mr johnson went one better than irritating the people of a city by managing to annoy an entire country .
in a daily telegraph column , he wrote : " for 10 years we in the tory party have become used to papua new guinea-style orgies of cannibalism and chief-killing , and so it is with a happy amazement that we watch as the madness engulfs the labour party . "
papua new guinea 's high commissioner in london was not best pleased by this comparison and demanded an apology .
mr johnson obliged , saying : " i meant no insult to the people of papua new guinea who i 'm sure lead lives of blameless bourgeois domesticity in common with the rest of us . "
he promised to " add papua new guinea to my global itinerary of apology " .
apology to papua new guinea jamie oliver at the 2006 conservative annual party conference , mr johnson became the biggest story around when he was quoted as taking a swipe at tv chef jamie oliver 's campaign to improve school dinners .
he allegedly told a fringe meeting at the bournemouth event that " if i was in charge i would get rid of jamie oliver and tell people to eat what they like " .
the mp reportedly stood up for mothers who helped their children avoid healthier options , saying : " i say let people eat what they like .

they demanded he apologise and visit the city .
but the conservative party said figures backed mr johnson 's comments and politicians should not criticise him for speaking the truth .

he described the episode in an interview with the independent in 2002 as his " biggest cock-up " , saying he had needed a historian 's quote for a story and had rung sir colin - who later became vice-chancellor of oxford university - and had misquoted him in a way that had jeopardised his academic reputation .

a competition , which aims to find novel ideas that exploit the pin-point accuracy of europe 's soon-to-launch galileo system , is calling for entries .
previous winners include a system that monitors changes in the ground that occur before an earthquake strikes .
the eventual winner of the uk satellite navigation challenge will then compete in a european tournament for cash and support to kick-start the business .
" everybody has been amazed at what clever entrepreneurs have been able to do -lsb- with gps -rsb- ; it does far more than what anyone could have dreamed of when they invented the system , " said richard peckham of eads astrium navigation , and one of the judges of the uk competition .
" i think the same will be true in the future when you have galileo plus gps . "
he said the uk competition was primarily looking for something that had business potential .
" you are also looking for novelty and whether people will be one day willing to pay for the capability . "
time-keeper last year 's competition , for example , was won by genesys consultancy , which suggested a product to help predict natural disasters like volcanic eruptions and earthquakes .
unlike previous winners , geosynch , as the product is known , primarily uses the increased accuracy of the timing signals from the galileo satellites rather than its positioning application .
the company triumphed in both the uk challenge and the european galileo masters .
galileo under construction a european commission and european space agency project 30 satellites to be launched in batches by end of 2011-12 will work alongside us gps and russian glonass systems promises real-time positioning down to less than a metre guaranteed under all but most extreme circumstances suitable for safety-critical roles where lives depend on service europe lofts galileo satellite q & a : europe 's galileo project galileo puts uk on map the system could also help oil companies keep track of their reserves and improve prospecting for gas , water or even archaeological ruins .
" the background to this is seismology , " explained conor keegan , director of genesys consultancy .
seismology is an established technique , often used in the oil industry , which allows scientists to peer beneath the surface of the earth .
by studying how sound waves produced by earthquakes or artificial sources , such as explosions , are reflected by different subsurface layers , seismologists can build up a picture of the structures beneath their feet .
the technique can be expensive and time consuming .
however , geosynch should reduce this cost .
" there is also a considerable gain in accuracy over what is used today , " said mr keegan .
geosynch will take advantage of the galileo satellites ' onboard atomic clocks to accurately measure the time between when waves leave a controlled source and when they are picked up by an array of ipod-sized wireless ground sensors .
when a system has to measure sound waves travelling at 8km / s , tiny fractions of a second count .
" that will allow you to improve the accuracy of the time measurement by a few orders of magnitude , " mr keegan told the bbc news website .
disaster monitoring this improvement will allow seismologists to gain new insights into subterranean features and processes .
" one of the main users we see for this is oil and gas prospecting companies , " said mr keegan .
galileo is expected to become fully operational in 2012 but rather than helping them to find new reserves , geosynch may allow them to work out when to stop pumping oil .
" today there is no way of accurately measuring the depletion in an oil field , " he said .
" if the oil reserves drop down below a certain level it is no longer commercially viable for them to continue working it . "
by mapping tiny subsurface changes , geosynch should have the accuracy to tell them when to stop .
but the application is not just limited to the oil industry .
mr keegan also believes that it could be used to predict natural disasters .
" before an earthquake there is compression of a fault and then that is released , " he explained .
" when you compress earth it changes in density and there is therefore a change in the speed of sound -lsb- travelling through it -rsb- . "
by measuring these subtle shifts and comparing them to areas where there is a build up of stress in the earth 's crust , mr keegan believes the system could help predict the cataclysmic events .
prize draw he is now working towards building a prototype of the system , helped along by the cash he received from the galileo masters .
" if everything goes to plan we could commercialise this in three years , " he said .
that would mean that he could be up and running using the us gps system even before the galileo system is switched on , a date currently set for 2012 .
then he may be joined by a raft of other fledgling businesses given a boost by the uk satellite navigation challenge .
the winners of this year 's competition will win more than £ 35,000 worth of prizes including a patent for their idea .
the european winner will win a further 10,000 euros and the possibility of working with the european space agency to develop the proposal .
" a lot of the ideas coming forward are very futuristic , " said adam tucker of the hertfordshire business incubation centre -lrb- hbic -rrb- , that runs the event .
" what we are doing is providing them with a platform to assist them which may make them a commercial and viable business . "

prize draw he is now working towards building a prototype of the system , helped along by the cash he received from the galileo masters .
" if everything goes to plan we could commercialise this in three years , " he said .
that would mean that he could be up and running using the us gps system even before the galileo system is switched on , a date currently set for 2012 .
then he may be joined by a raft of other fledgling businesses given a boost by the uk satellite navigation challenge .
the winners of this year 's competition will win more than £ 35,000 worth of prizes including a patent for their idea .
the european winner will win a further 10,000 euros and the possibility of working with the european space agency to develop the proposal .
" a lot of the ideas coming forward are very futuristic , " said adam tucker of the hertfordshire business incubation centre -lrb- hbic -rrb- , that runs the event .
" what we are doing is providing them with a platform to assist them which may make them a commercial and viable business . "
the competition 's website will close to bids on 31 july .
satellite navigation systems determine a position by measuring the distances to a number of known locations - the galileo satellites the distance to one satellite defines a sphere of possible solutions ; the distances to four satellites defines a single , common area the accuracy of the distance measurements determines how small the common area is and thus the accuracy of the final location in practice , a receiver captures atomic-clock time signals sent from the satellites and converts them into the respective distances the whole system is monitored from the ground to ensure satellite clocks do not drift and give out misleading timings e-mail this to a friend printable version see also navigating future for road charges 29 dec 05 -pipe- science / nature smart directions for green ideas 02 nov 05 -pipe- science / nature sat-nav looks to smart ideas 26 apr 05 -pipe- science / nature time and place for entrepreneurs 23 may 06 -pipe- science / nature related internet links galileo -lrb- ec -rrb- galileo -lrb- esa -rrb- galileo masters -lrb- uk pages -rrb- the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites top science & environment stories phantom eye ' spy plane ' unveiled higgs discovery rumour is denied rare tortoises seized in malaysia most popular stories now most shared most read lack of sleep ' poses death risk ' rwanda : how the genocide happened holocaust ' ban ' e-mail confusion most popular now , in detail most shared most read ' many drown ' in australia sinking french king 's lost head ' genuine ' brain clue to fighter pilot skill diamonds goalkeeper roberts dies how life survived snowball earth beauty sleep concept ' not a myth ' casino robbed of $ 1.5m in chips us envoy hopes to ' calm ' n korea riots as berlusconi survives vote facebook connections map the world most popular now , in detail features , views , analysis praying for revenge widowed governor in philippines seeks curse plastic fantastic the loyalty reward programme for facebook fans path to the presidency could sarah palin win the republican nomination ?

bbc news -pipe- science / nature -pipe- galileo challenges sat-nav firms bbc news / science / nature graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- tuesday , 17 july 2007 , 07:29 gmt 08:29 uk galileo challenges sat-nav firms by jonathan fildes science and technology reporter , bbc news entrepreneurs are being urged to look to the future of satellite navigation .
a competition , which aims to find novel ideas that exploit the pin-point accuracy of europe 's soon-to-launch galileo system , is calling for entries .
previous winners include a system that monitors changes in the ground that occur before an earthquake strikes .
the eventual winner of the uk satellite navigation challenge will then compete in a european tournament for cash and support to kick-start the business .
" everybody has been amazed at what clever entrepreneurs have been able to do -lsb- with gps -rsb- ; it does far more than what anyone could have dreamed of when they invented the system , " said richard peckham of eads astrium navigation , and one of the judges of the uk competition .
" i think the same will be true in the future when you have galileo plus gps . "
he said the uk competition was primarily looking for something that had business potential .
" you are also looking for novelty and whether people will be one day willing to pay for the capability . "
time-keeper last year 's competition , for example , was won by genesys consultancy , which suggested a product to help predict natural disasters like volcanic eruptions and earthquakes .
unlike previous winners , geosynch , as the product is known , primarily uses the increased accuracy of the timing signals from the galileo satellites rather than its positioning application .
the company triumphed in both the uk challenge and the european galileo masters .
galileo under construction a european commission and european space agency project 30 satellites to be launched in batches by end of 2011-12 will work alongside us gps and russian glonass systems promises real-time positioning down to less than a metre guaranteed under all but most extreme circumstances suitable for safety-critical roles where lives depend on service europe lofts galileo satellite q & a : europe 's galileo project galileo puts uk on map the system could also help oil companies keep track of their reserves and improve prospecting for gas , water or even archaeological ruins .
" the background to this is seismology , " explained conor keegan , director of genesys consultancy .
seismology is an established technique , often used in the oil industry , which allows scientists to peer beneath the surface of the earth .
by studying how sound waves produced by earthquakes or artificial sources , such as explosions , are reflected by different subsurface layers , seismologists can build up a picture of the structures beneath their feet .
the technique can be expensive and time consuming .
however , geosynch should reduce this cost .
" there is also a considerable gain in accuracy over what is used today , " said mr keegan .
geosynch will take advantage of the galileo satellites ' onboard atomic clocks to accurately measure the time between when waves leave a controlled source and when they are picked up by an array of ipod-sized wireless ground sensors .
when a system has to measure sound waves travelling at 8km / s , tiny fractions of a second count .
" that will allow you to improve the accuracy of the time measurement by a few orders of magnitude , " mr keegan told the bbc news website .
disaster monitoring this improvement will allow seismologists to gain new insights into subterranean features and processes .
" one of the main users we see for this is oil and gas prospecting companies , " said mr keegan .
but rather than helping them to find new reserves , geosynch may allow them to work out when to stop pumping oil .
" today there is no way of accurately measuring the depletion in an oil field , " he said .
" if the oil reserves drop down below a certain level it is no longer commercially viable for them to continue working it . "
by mapping tiny subsurface changes , geosynch should have the accuracy to tell them when to stop .
but the application is not just limited to the oil industry .
mr keegan also believes that it could be used to predict natural disasters .
" before an earthquake there is compression of a fault and then that is released , " he explained .
" when you compress earth it changes in density and there is therefore a change in the speed of sound -lsb- travelling through it -rsb- . "
by measuring these subtle shifts and comparing them to areas where there is a build up of stress in the earth 's crust , mr keegan believes the system could help predict the cataclysmic events .
prize draw he is now working towards building a prototype of the system , helped along by the cash he received from the galileo masters .
" if everything goes to plan we could commercialise this in three years , " he said .
that would mean that he could be up and running using the us gps system even before the galileo system is switched on , a date currently set for 2012 .
then he may be joined by a raft of other fledgling businesses given a boost by the uk satellite navigation challenge .
the winners of this year 's competition will win more than £ 35,000 worth of prizes including a patent for their idea .
the european winner will win a further 10,000 euros and the possibility of working with the european space agency to develop the proposal .
" a lot of the ideas coming forward are very futuristic , " said adam tucker of the hertfordshire business incubation centre -lrb- hbic -rrb- , that runs the event .
" what we are doing is providing them with a platform to assist them which may make them a commercial and viable business . "
the competition 's website will close to bids on 31 july .
satellite navigation systems determine a position by measuring the distances to a number of known locations - the galileo satellites the distance to one satellite defines a sphere of possible solutions ; the distances to four satellites defines a single , common area the accuracy of the distance measurements determines how small the common area is and thus the accuracy of the final location in practice , a receiver captures atomic-clock time signals sent from the satellites and converts them into the respective distances the whole system is monitored from the ground to ensure satellite clocks do not drift and give out misleading timings e-mail this to a friend related to this story : navigating future for road charges -lrb- 29 dec 05 -pipe- science / nature -rrb- smart directions for green ideas -lrb- 02 nov 05 -pipe- science / nature -rrb- sat-nav looks to smart ideas -lrb- 26 apr 05 -pipe- science / nature -rrb- time and place for entrepreneurs -lrb- 23 may 06 -pipe- science / nature -rrb- related internet links galileo -lrb- ec -rrb- galileo -lrb- esa -rrb- galileo masters -lrb- uk pages -rrb- the bbc is not responsible for the content of external internet sites search bbc news : news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- newswatch -pipe- notes -pipe- contact us -pipe- about bbc news -pipe- profiles -pipe- history ^ back to top -pipe- bbc sport home -pipe- bbc homepage -pipe- contact us -pipe- help -pipe- ©

national audit office figures show carrying out work on tornadoes at raf marham in norfolk and harriers at raf cottesmore in leics has paid off .
the move was sparked by a shortage of harrier aircraft for operations because of engineering problems .
however , the bulk of the savings have been made on servicing of tornadoes .
since the end of last year the number of harrier aircraft fit for action has met the raf 's targets , the national audit office report reveals .
minor repairs auditor general sir john bourn said : " the ministry of defence has made significant reductions in the cost of repairing and maintaining its jets , whilst broadly maintaining aircraft availability .
" on this basis , the changes represent value for money and underline the benefit of the mod 's approach to partnering with industry and rationalising repair activity . "
the sites carry out all major repairs and upgrades at raf marham in norfolk for tornados and raf cottesmore in rutland for harriers .
operational maintenance and minor repairs are carried out at squadrons ' home bases .
over the period 2001/02 to 2006/07 , savings totalled £ 109m for harriers and £ 1.3bn for tornados .
the time taken to perform minor maintenance has reduced by 37 % for tornados and 19 % for harriers .
the mod is also working closely with industry to ensure the supply chain works satisfactorily .

minor repairs auditor general sir john bourn said : " the ministry of defence has made significant reductions in the cost of repairing and maintaining its jets , whilst broadly maintaining aircraft availability .
" on this basis , the changes represent value for money and underline the benefit of the mod 's approach to partnering with industry and rationalising repair activity . "
the sites carry out all major repairs and upgrades at raf marham in norfolk for tornados and raf cottesmore in rutland for harriers .
operational maintenance and minor repairs are carried out at squadrons ' home bases .
over the period 2001/02 to 2006/07 , savings totalled £ 109m for harriers and £ 1.3bn for tornados .
the time taken to perform minor maintenance has reduced by 37 % for tornados and 19 % for harriers .
