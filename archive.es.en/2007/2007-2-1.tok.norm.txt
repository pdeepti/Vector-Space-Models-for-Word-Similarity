" if we continue along the current path , the present fragmented industrial bases in europe will not be sustainable , " verheugen told a defense conference in brussels . verheugen stressed that the european defense sector in its current form was riddled with inefficiency and national protectionism .
maintaining national control in the defence sector has pushed the prices up and undermined the future of the 300,000 jobs in defense manufacturing across the eu .

it would also remove the need for eu exporters to obtain security licenses for exporting defense-related goods to other eu nations . at the moment , around 12,000 requests for such licenses are filed every year .
in view of the close military cooperation between eu governments , only 15 licenses were refused in 2003 , and none in 2004 and 2005 . " on the government side , we must combine our requirements so as to offer industry projects with a worthwhile economy of scale .

" if we continue along the current path , the present fragmented industrial bases in europe will not be sustainable , " verheugen told a defense conference in brussels . verheugen stressed that the european defense sector in its current form was riddled with inefficiency and national protectionism .
maintaining national control in the defence sector has pushed the prices up and undermined the future of the 300,000 jobs in defense manufacturing across the eu .

" in the situation of the time he -lrb- steinmeier -rrb- acted absolutely correctly and in sync with the political line that was my responsibility , " schröder said , adding that he would have taken the exact same decisions in light of the atmosphere and events of the time . the former chancellor said he was not informed personally about the case of murat kurnaz , who was seized by us forces in pakistan after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks and sent to guantanamo bay in 2002 .
" but i take responsibility for the then security policy , " he said . schröder pointed out that given the fear of further attacks in the wake of the sept .
11 atrocity , germany 's internal security had the highest priority at the time , along with a strict regard for legal principles and human rights . " in light of the fact that a few perpetrators of the sept .
11 attacks had lived in germany , we had to be highly alert , " he said . steinmeier to testify on march 8 schröder 's defense of steinmeier will be a welcome respite for the foreign minister who is increasingly under pressure over the kurnaz case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz says he was tortured at guantanamo bay steinmeier faces allegations of not having done enough , and in certain cases having blocked , kurnaz ' release from the us prison camp on cuba .
the german-born turkish national , who has claimed he was abused and tortured in the prison , was released last year after the intervention of current chancellor angela merkel . on thursday , it emerged that steinmeier , who has consistently rejected any allegations of wrongdoing , will be testifying on march 8 before an independent parliamentary committee set up to investigate the case .
critics have complained that given the mounting evidence which points to steinmeier 's role in the affair , the foreign minister should testify earlier than march . the glare of the media increased on the minister this week when a german court issued arrest warrants for 13 people in connection with the alleged cia-backed kidnapping of a lebanese-born german citizen , khaled el-masri . minister rebuffs allegations in the latest of a series of interviews to defend his actions , steinmeier said claims that the german government received a formal offer from the us administration to free kurnaz in 2002 were " made-up . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the affair has given steinmeier a major headache he told die zeit weekly newspaper that washington had simply suggested cutting a deal with kurnaz to use him to infiltrate extremist muslim groups in germany .
the german government rejected the idea on the advice of security experts and the foreign intelligence services , steinmeier said . he said it was easy to forget the highly charged atmosphere at the time , with the west bracing for islamist attacks .
the german government had " the responsibility to ensure that no further attacks took place , " steinmeier told die zeit .
he pointed out that germany has to this day remained free from a major terrorist attack since the suicide hijackings of september 11 . merkel 's grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats is closing ranks around steinmeier , a member of the social democratic party . thomas de maiziere , a conservative who now holds steinmeier 's old job of chief of staff at the chancellery , warned against harshly judging the kurnaz case in hindsight . " it is very easy with the witness statements and documents to judge the incident four or five years later .
but it is far harder to make decisions at a highly complex point in time , " he said . three members of the german intelligence services who questioned kurnaz in guantanamo were to give evidence on thursday to the parliamentary committee investigating the case . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court orders arrest of 13 over cia kidnapping a german court ordered the arrest of 13 people behind the alleged cia-backed kidnapping of a german citizen , believed to be one of the most notorious us " renditions " of a terror suspect , prosecutors said wednesday .

the hamburger morgenpost reported thursday that magath would take over at hsv .
a team spokesman , however , said there was " nothing to report . " back in bavaria , hitzfeld , who in his first spell as bayern manager led them to four titles and the champions league crown , takes over a team lying fourth and struggling to qualify for the champions league next season . werder turned up the pressure on the 20-time champions with a 2-0 win over bayer leverkusen , with german international striker miroslav klose joining serb marko pantelic at the top of the bundesliga scoring charts with 11 goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke squeaked past aachen to stay tied for first schalke 04 , in second also on 42 points , scraped through their home clash with aachen 2-1 . in other action on wednesday vfb stuttgart maintained third place with a 3-2 win over ninth-placed arminia bielfeld . hamburg are propping up the league after a disappointing 1-1 draw with energie cottbus , while mainz beat dortmund 1-0 and left the bundesliga basement . bayern suffer long fall bayern players received an angry dressing-down from now former coach felix magath after the defeat in dortmund .
he warned his charges that anything less than victory against bochum would spell the end of the title chances - and probably guessed it would be the end of his own as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath 's enthusiasm was n't enough to help bayern - or save his own job bayern took to the field at the allianz arena seemingly toiling under the weight of those words , passing erratically and in accurately in the early exchanges .
it took the bavarians well over half an hour to find any kind of rhythm , with bastian schweinsteiger showing one of the rare pieces of skill in the first half to release dutch midfielder mark van bommel .
but " schweini " then had to watch the dutchman rush his shot , which bochum keeper jaroslav drobny saved easily . disgruntled fans display their anger bayern offered little threat against their relegation-threatened opponents in the second-half and were jeered off the pitch at the end , their fans obviously disgusted with the drab performance that saw the champions unable to break down a bochum side who had been beaten 1-0 at home by bottom side mainz on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli kahn shows the direction bayern should be going " we 're very disappointed , obviously , " bayern goalkeeper and captain oliver kahn told arena tv .
" we have to realize we do n't have a season ticket for first place .

" we had messed up in our first game at the weekend so we had to show our fans we could play the second half of the season as we did the first , " gomez said .
" we had good chances in both halves so i think the victory was deserved . " mid-table teams held in stalemates elsewhere , wolfsburg and eintracht frankfurt shared the spoils in a 2-2 draw .

a doping scandal is a nightmare for athletes and fans , but corporate sponsors may be the ones who suffer most .
marketers hope new international rules and corporate vigilance will aid in damage control . on thursday , an international unesco convention on doping goes into effect .
while the agreement is unlikely to put a stop to doping in sports any time soon , it represents the first time that governments around the world have agreed to throw the force of international law behind the problem . " until now , doping cases have been handled by sporting authorities .
this puts it in the countries ' courts of law , " said christoph breuer , a professor of sports management at the athletics college of cologne . the international accord can be seen as a vote of confidence in german 's national anti-doping agency , nada , and its international offshoot , world anti doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- . dancing to their own tune bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich , right , no longer wears the t-mobile jersey .

a doping scandal is a nightmare for athletes and fans , but corporate sponsors may be the ones who suffer most .
marketers hope new international rules and corporate vigilance will aid in damage control . on thursday , an international unesco convention on doping goes into effect .
while the agreement is unlikely to put a stop to doping in sports any time soon , it represents the first time that governments around the world have agreed to throw the force of international law behind the problem . " until now , doping cases have been handled by sporting authorities .
this puts it in the countries ' courts of law , " said christoph breuer , a professor of sports management at the athletics college of cologne . the international accord can be seen as a vote of confidence in german 's national anti-doping agency , nada , and its international offshoot , world anti doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- . dancing to their own tune bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich , right , no longer wears the t-mobile jersey .

" as far as i know , sponsors have been fairly reluctant to join in the active fight against doping , " said christian sachs , a spokesman for the federal interior ministry committee that supported the un treaty .
" we want to encourage sponsors within the field of sport to contribute to the funding of nada , which they have hardly done up to now .

even if its negative publicity , the name will be known . " for the past several years , it has been the norm in the sports marketing world for sponsors to put an escape clause in their contract that ends the sponsorship if an athlete or team is accused or convicted of doping . still , the bad taste of a doping accusation can linger , and become an image nightmare for a company that has the misfortune to back the wrong athletes . the case of jan ullrich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german biathlete thomas oelsner was suspended from the paralympics for alleged doping " this is the most castastrophic thing that can happen in sports sponsoring , and we advise our clients to be very careful before they get into any endorsement contracts , " said stephan schröder , who is on the managing board of the cologne-based sports marketing consultancy sport + markt . schröder cited as an example the case of jan ullrich .
the german cycling star was booted by his sponsor t-mobile after he was implicated in a highly publicized doping investigation shortly before last summer 's tour de france .

11 attacks had lived in germany , we had to be highly alert , " he said . steinmeier to testify on march 8 schröder 's defense of steinmeier will be a welcome respite for the foreign minister who is increasingly under pressure over the kurnaz case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz says he was tortured at guantanamo bay steinmeier faces allegations of not having done enough , and in certain cases having blocked , kurnaz ' release from the us prison camp on cuba .
the german-born turkish national , who has claimed he was abused and tortured in the prison , was released last year after the intervention of current chancellor angela merkel . on thursday , it emerged that steinmeier , who has consistently rejected any allegations of wrongdoing , will be testifying on march 8 before an independent parliamentary committee set up to investigate the case .
critics have complained that given the mounting evidence which points to steinmeier 's role in the affair , the foreign minister should testify earlier than march . the glare of the media increased on the minister this week when a german court issued arrest warrants for 13 people in connection with the alleged cia-backed kidnapping of a lebanese-born german citizen , khaled el-masri . minister rebuffs allegations in the latest of a series of interviews to defend his actions , steinmeier said claims that the german government received a formal offer from the us administration to free kurnaz in 2002 were " made-up . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the affair has given steinmeier a major headache he told die zeit weekly newspaper that washington had simply suggested cutting a deal with kurnaz to use him to infiltrate extremist muslim groups in germany .
the german government rejected the idea on the advice of security experts and the foreign intelligence services , steinmeier said . he said it was easy to forget the highly charged atmosphere at the time , with the west bracing for islamist attacks .
the german government had " the responsibility to ensure that no further attacks took place , " steinmeier told die zeit .
he pointed out that germany has to this day remained free from a major terrorist attack since the suicide hijackings of september 11 . merkel 's grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats is closing ranks around steinmeier , a member of the social democratic party . thomas de maiziere , a conservative who now holds steinmeier 's old job of chief of staff at the chancellery , warned against harshly judging the kurnaz case in hindsight . " it is very easy with the witness statements and documents to judge the incident four or five years later .
but it is far harder to make decisions at a highly complex point in time , " he said . three members of the german intelligence services who questioned kurnaz in guantanamo were to give evidence on thursday to the parliamentary committee investigating the case . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court orders arrest of 13 over cia kidnapping a german court ordered the arrest of 13 people behind the alleged cia-backed kidnapping of a german citizen , believed to be one of the most notorious us " renditions " of a terror suspect , prosecutors said wednesday .

separately , hamburg says it will take a share in a consortium buying a stake in parent company eads . amid reports that the world 's largest plane maker , airbus , is planning a tough cost-cutting operation , the german city-state of hamburg confirmed thursday that it will take a 10-percent share in a consortium acquiring the 7.5-percent stake in parent company eads .
the stake is being sold by german-us auto giant , daimlerchrysler . based on the current share price of 25.83 euros -lrb- $ 33.6 -rrb- , hamburg 's stake would be worth 160 million euros.the two neighboring north german states of lower saxony and bremen have already signaled their intention to invest 80 million euros and 30 million euros respectively in the acquisition of the stake . germany is currently represented in eads via a 22.5-percent share held by daimlerchrysler . all countries will be " equally unhappy " germany 's oldenburg-based newspaper nordwest zeitung reported thursday that thomas enders , co-chief of the eads , which fully owns airbus , had said the france-based plane maker would sell off production sites . in an earlier online report , the paper said enders only planned to keep those airbus plants involved in the final assembly or those that make components .
other manufacturing sites would be sold to trim bloated personnel costs and some 10,000 airbus jobs would be axed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads co- head thomas enders has hinted at painul cost-cutting " nobody in germany will be happy about what will be decided , " the paper quoted enders as saying .
but he also said he expected " everybody will be equally unhappy " in all the countries that are home to airbus plants . addressing some 300 guests - including german parliamentarians and representatives of the aviation industry - at the lower saxony embassy in berlin on wednesday , enders spoke of tough cuts in order to push through a restructuring program called " power 8 , " which aims to lower costs and make airbus more competitive for the future . enders , however , is said to have played down fears that airbus production sites in germany would be affected .
" there are no decisions at this point , " enders was quoted to have said . eads says it 's all speculation but spokesman for airbus parent company eads , michael hauger told ap news agency that though enders had spoken of " tough cuts , " he had also stressed that the rumors about job cuts and closing of production plants were pure speculation . hauger added that airbus management was still looking into the " power 8 " program , which would then have to be presented to eads bosses enders and louis gallois before the company 's supervisory board could have its final say .

eads has said the plane maker will record its first full-year loss ever for 2006 because of cost overruns on its a380 , which is at least two years behind schedule . minister says germany will fight to save jobs german economics minister michael glos said wednesday he will insist on a fair distribution of the burden resulting from airbus ' restructuring measures . " i will do everything possible to call on the french partner and those who run airbus to make sure that any job cuts will be in both countries and not to the disadvantage of german sites , " glos said .
" i will listen to the worries and help wherever i can within a government framework . " germany must get a share in present and future production that corresponds with its weight -lrb- in the company -rrb- , " he added .

it appears germany 's mighty automobile lobby is getting its way in brussels , as the eu moves its regulatory focus from emissions standards to biofuel use across the bloc . germany 's auto lobby might be feeling celebratory these days , though the oil producers may have shed some tears .
the european commission on wednesday suggested tightening fuel ecology standards as a measure toward combating climate change . observers read this as a sign that , in its battle against global warming , brussels is ready to shift its focus away from tighter standards on car motors and onto " greener " fuels by having gas and diesel providers monitoring greenhouse gas emissions during the delivery , refining , and transport of oil . missing the target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany would rather change the fuel than the motor because the auto industry is likely to miss a voluntary goal of cutting carbon dioxide emissions for new cars , european commission president jose manuel barroso and environment commissioner stavros dimas want binding legislation that would require carmakers to reduce new cars ' co2 emissions to an industry average of 120 grams per kilometer in 2012 . in addition , the eu wants to limit the sulfur content of diesel fuel .
instead , a new type of fuel with a higher content of " clean " bioethanol should be developed , the eu said . merkel joins in debate but while the goal of the eu is to lower co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , the german car industry - and german chancellor angela merkel , who has gone to battle in brussels on its behalf - is opposed to blanket measures that would apply to all cars , regardless of their size . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has stepped in to fight for the german car industry on monday , merkel waded into the fray , saying it was " regrettable " that european carmakers would not meet the targets they had set themselves , but adding : " we must not let the result of that be to impose a general obligation for all cars to be subject to the same measure . " merkel added that she would " never " agree to binding limits on makers of bigger cars . michael glos , merkel 's economy minister , also came out in support of the german auto industry on wednesday and accused the commission of following its own industrial agenda . " this is not about environmental policy but hard-nosed industrial policy interests , " he said .

it appears germany 's mighty automobile lobby is getting its way in brussels , as the eu moves its regulatory focus from emissions standards to biofuel use across the bloc . germany 's auto lobby might be feeling celebratory these days , though the oil producers may have shed some tears .
the european commission on wednesday suggested tightening fuel ecology standards as a measure toward combating climate change . observers read this as a sign that , in its battle against global warming , brussels is ready to shift its focus away from tighter standards on car motors and onto " greener " fuels by having gas and diesel providers monitoring greenhouse gas emissions during the delivery , refining , and transport of oil . missing the target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany would rather change the fuel than the motor because the auto industry is likely to miss a voluntary goal of cutting carbon dioxide emissions for new cars , european commission president jose manuel barroso and environment commissioner stavros dimas want binding legislation that would require carmakers to reduce new cars ' co2 emissions to an industry average of 120 grams per kilometer in 2012 . in addition , the eu wants to limit the sulfur content of diesel fuel .

" merkel added that she would " never " agree to binding limits on makers of bigger cars . michael glos , merkel 's economy minister , also came out in support of the german auto industry on wednesday and accused the commission of following its own industrial agenda . " this is not about environmental policy but hard-nosed industrial policy interests , " he said .

the hamburger morgenpost reported thursday that magath would take over at hsv .
a team spokesman , however , said there was " nothing to report . " back in bavaria , hitzfeld , who in his first spell as bayern manager led them to four titles and the champions league crown , takes over a team lying fourth and struggling to qualify for the champions league next season . werder turned up the pressure on the 20-time champions with a 2-0 win over bayer leverkusen , with german international striker miroslav klose joining serb marko pantelic at the top of the bundesliga scoring charts with 11 goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke squeaked past aachen to stay tied for first schalke 04 , in second also on 42 points , scraped through their home clash with aachen 2-1 . in other action on wednesday vfb stuttgart maintained third place with a 3-2 win over ninth-placed arminia bielfeld . hamburg are propping up the league after a disappointing 1-1 draw with energie cottbus , while mainz beat dortmund 1-0 and left the bundesliga basement . bayern suffer long fall bayern players received an angry dressing-down from now former coach felix magath after the defeat in dortmund .
he warned his charges that anything less than victory against bochum would spell the end of the title chances - and probably guessed it would be the end of his own as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath 's enthusiasm was n't enough to help bayern - or save his own job bayern took to the field at the allianz arena seemingly toiling under the weight of those words , passing erratically and in accurately in the early exchanges .
it took the bavarians well over half an hour to find any kind of rhythm , with bastian schweinsteiger showing one of the rare pieces of skill in the first half to release dutch midfielder mark van bommel .
but " schweini " then had to watch the dutchman rush his shot , which bochum keeper jaroslav drobny saved easily . disgruntled fans display their anger bayern offered little threat against their relegation-threatened opponents in the second-half and were jeered off the pitch at the end , their fans obviously disgusted with the drab performance that saw the champions unable to break down a bochum side who had been beaten 1-0 at home by bottom side mainz on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli kahn shows the direction bayern should be going " we 're very disappointed , obviously , " bayern goalkeeper and captain oliver kahn told arena tv .
" we have to realize we do n't have a season ticket for first place .

" we had messed up in our first game at the weekend so we had to show our fans we could play the second half of the season as we did the first , " gomez said .
" we had good chances in both halves so i think the victory was deserved . " mid-table teams held in stalemates elsewhere , wolfsburg and eintracht frankfurt shared the spoils in a 2-2 draw .

" chirac caused a stir after he downplayed the threat posed by iran in an interview to three publications earlier this week . " having one or perhaps a second bomb a little later , well that 's not very dangerous , " chirac said .
" where would iran drop this bomb ?
on israel ? " he asked .
" it would not have gone off 200 meters into the atmosphere before tehran would be razed to the ground , " he said . the elysee palace issued a statement on thursday clarifying chirac 's stance and a presidential aide complained of a " shameful polemic " stoked by " certain media across the atlantic " who are anti-french . a clear position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac said he had oversimplified the iran issue in his interview the white house said it was satisfied with chirac 's " revised and extended " comments . " the fact is our position on iran is clear , they should n't have any nuclear weapon and furthermore they ought to take steps to suspend uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities , " said spokesman tony snow . " that is not only the stated position of the united states but also its allies , including france , in terms of dealing with the iranians , " snow told reporters . chirac explosive interview came , nonetheless , at a rather sensitive moment for us-eu relations . tensions rising ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un imposed sanctions on iran in december although european countries agreed with the united states to impose sanctions on iran in line with a un resolution adopted in december , they have resisted us calls to go even further and force global financial institutions to sever all ties with the islamic republic . us undersecretary in charge of fighting terrorist funding , stuart levey , has made several whirlwind trips to europe over the past months to try to persuade european multinationals and banks to stop investing in iran . but so far he has run into a brick wall , with european countries maintaining they are not ready to cut off banking links with iranian companies , arguing that such a move goes beyond the spirit of the un resolution . " we are going to do the utmost to apply the content of the resolution .
we are not going to go beyond what is in the resolution as states , " a senior european official told afp . partial withdrawal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank partially bowed to us pressure on wednesday , commerzbank , the second-biggest bank in germany , joined other european banks in curtailing its activities with iran by abolishing dollar transactions for iran at its new york branch . a number of european banks - such as credit suisse and ubs have already taken similar decisions , paring back or ceasing altogether their operations with iran . commerzbank , however , said it would continue to handle euro transactions for its iranian clients . additionally , several european countries continue to offer mostly state-sponsored loans to the islamic republic .
in 2005 alone , italy awarded 4.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.2 billion -rrb- in loans to teheran , with germany tallying slightly behind with 4.2 billion euros . frustration in the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president bush has accused iranian leaders of stirring up violence in iraq us officials this week gave vent to their mounting frustration , which comes as us president george w. bush has accused iranian leaders of helping to forment the mounting sectarian violence in iraq , fuelling fears that the us could be preparing some kind of military response against tehran . " the european response on the economic side has been pretty weak , " one unnamed senior us official was quoted in the new york times . " we are telling the europeans that they need to go way beyond what they 've done to maximize pressure on iran , " he added . legal concerns this position , however , does not seem to completely reflect the view of the us administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu will address the issue of sanctions against iran in mid-february " i think that the concerns that european governments are expressing have to do with their legal requirements .
they have a set of legal requirements that they have to abide by , " said state department spokesman sean mccormack . " and i 'm not sure i would call that resistance to discussing or cooperating on these various measures . " european union foreign ministers last week agreed to implement the full raft of un sanctions against tehran and deplored " iran 's failure to take the steps repeatedly required by the iaea board of governors and the united nations security council .

he is joined by newcomer mario gomez and a host of returning stars . germany coach joachim löw was in frankfurt at the weekend to see the 24-year-old kuranyi net a brace in the 3-1 victory over eintracht frankfurt to help his side stay joint top of the bundesliga with werder bremen . " kevin has shown shortly before the winter break and now since the bundesliga restarted that his form is improving , " said löw . kuranyi last played for germany in november 2005 in the scoreless draw against france in paris and failed to make his country 's world cup squad .
his club form took a dive soon after joining schalke from stuttgart in 2005 , scoring just 10 goals in 30 appearances for the club .
by the end of the world cup season , kuranyi 's body language spoke of a striker running on empty . kuranyi 's world cup nightmare dissipating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi 's world cup pain was obvious but since the beginning of this current season , with his world cup disappointment behind him , kuranyi has bagged on average a goal every other game and is looking decidedly more confident . the competition for places up front for germany got even hotter with the announcement that löw was also calling up stuttgart 's in-form striker mario gomez for the switzerland game . a product of the stuttgart youth system , gomez has hit ten goals in 18 games for stuttgart and has been integral in the southern club 's push for the champions league places , a surge that saw them set an early pace at the top of the league . germany coach löw was watching on tuesday night when the 22-year-old scored a brace against arminia bielefeld , fuelling rumors that a place in the national squad was being considered . klose a shoe-in , but poldi 's form raises questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's main strikers are experiencing different luck while first choice striker miroslav klose is firing on all cylinders for high-scoring league leaders werder bremen , lukas podolski , klose 's usual international partner in attack , is fairing less favorably at bayern munich . podolski has just one goal to his name this season in his sporadic appearances for the champions .
while löw is known to have great faith in podolski , the striker 's current club form may raise some questions in the future which the coach may find hard to ignore .
the topic of podolski 's inclusion is a mute point however as he is suspended for the switzerland friendly . with kuranyi and gomez entering the equation , löw may be tempted to experiment against the swiss at some point during the 90 minutes , especially as borussia mönchengladbach 's veteran striker oliver neuville will be missing through injury . return of the formerly walking wounded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi löw rings the changes löw also said he we has happy to name borussia dortmund 's christoph metzelder and werder bremen 's tim borowski in the squad and said that borowski was likely to start against the swiss . the same goes for teammate per mertesacker , who makes his return to the german squad for the first time since last summer 's world cup following his achilles operation last autumn . " per will definitely return , " said löw .
" he has been playing permanently for bremen . " metzelder returns to the national team after a six-month absence due to injury .

"
" otherwise , the church will be left with just one third of its current membership and only fifty percent of its current funds by 2030 , " it warned .
so the alarm bells were ringing when some 300 church representatives and politicians came together for a congress in wittenberg to discuss ways of braking this accelerating trend .
according to the organizers from the ekd , the solution is a slate of reforms designed to usher in a " decade of change " set to culminate on the 500th anniversary of luther 's theses in 2017 .
identity crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what relevance does christ have in today 's world ?
the proposals included cutting back the country 's regional churches from 23 to a maximum of 12 , with the squeeze primarily on traditional , smaller parishes .
in future , the ekd wants to see the congregations of the individual regional churches number at least 1 million - twice the size of many of the smallest existing communities .
but these are n't the main challenges .
the church 's strapped finances are problematic enough , but the congress participants were well aware that far more is at stake than a leaking roof or two .
ultimately , the church knows it needs to reappraise its role and find a new place for faith within contemporary society .
" it 's time for a new departure , " parliamentary deputy speaker katrin göring-eckardt of the green party told the congress .
" and not primarily because of declining membership and lack of funds . "
göring-eckardt dismissed complaints that the ekd treated the church like a business in need of a turn-around by bandying around terms like ' quality control ' and ' quotas , ' and stressed the church 's need to adapt to the times .
" we need a worldly church , not an other-worldly church , " she said .
the business of religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : redefining its role many agree that a bit of business acumen is exactly what the church needs .
the days when even handing around a collection plate was an embarrassing concession to earthly matters are long over , and thies gundlach from the ekd says the church has to become less coy about resorting to best-practice marketing tricks .
" the church would be betraying itself if it behaved like a business , " he said .
" but in the bible , paul says : ' test everything , retain what is good , ' which is a principle that does allow us to learn a few lessons from business and economics - from customer loyalty to promoting the protestant brand - so long as we never forget that the church will never be a company like any other . "
his feelings are shared by swen schönheit , pastor at the apostle petrus church in berlin .
an angular building built in the 1960s , it could n't seem less inviting from the outside , but what it lacks in aesthetics it more than makes up for in atmosphere , defying the national trend by regularly welcoming a full house on sundays .
" what many churches in germany lack is charisma , " he says .
" the church has suffered a loss of spiritual energy , it lacks relevance .
its crisis is a spiritual one not a financial one . "
and it 's no one 's fault but its own , he says .
" society is seeing a boom in religious interest , there 's a renewal of spiritual soul-searching going on in germany , but this is completely passing by the church , and it 's time the church found a way of harnessing it . "
" it has to realize it is in competition with other sources of spirituality within society and get its act together , " he insists .

community activities range from children 's dance classes to group summer holidays , while the sunday service kicks off with a house band switching on the electric amplifier as the congregation sings along with the help of a power point show .
but to some , this form of happy-clappy religion is suspiciously reminiscent of the born-again evangelism popular in the us - one which goes hand-in-hand with a christian-right political agenda deeply foreign to secular european sensibilities .
but it 's unlikely german protestants will ever head in this direction .
" traditionally , religious affiliation has been a private matter in germany due to the separation of church and state , " explains urike murmann , pastor at hamburg 's st katherine 's church .
that said , she does believe a dose of showmanship never goes amiss .
" going to church should be cheerful , it should be fun , " she says .
" we 've seen that people respond very well when we offer music or theatre . "
but she also knows where to draw the line .
" of course , if it descended into a superficial entertainment , that would be terrible . "
her main emphasis is on the community role of the church , and she says that it 's already learning how to be more aware of parish needs .
" in hamburg , we look carefully at what our congregation wants and we tailor our activities accordingly .
we know we need to do more than just lecture people . "
but even though a number of churches across the country are managing to fill their pews by offering a new and improved form of protestantism , their popularity is failing to translate into church membership .
attending church is one thing , actually joining is another .
and the reasons might be purely mundane .
the spirit is willing , one might say , but the flesh is weak .
" the church tax is a stumbling block , " says murmann .
" it 's not easy to persuade people it 's valid .
furthermore , there 's been a growing skepticism towards institutions in recent years .

so the alarm bells were ringing when some 300 church representatives and politicians came together for a congress in wittenberg to discuss ways of braking this accelerating trend .
according to the organizers from the ekd , the solution is a slate of reforms designed to usher in a " decade of change " set to culminate on the 500th anniversary of luther 's theses in 2017 .
identity crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what relevance does christ have in today 's world ?
the proposals included cutting back the country 's regional churches from 23 to a maximum of 12 , with the squeeze primarily on traditional , smaller parishes .
in future , the ekd wants to see the congregations of the individual regional churches number at least 1 million - twice the size of many of the smallest existing communities .
but these are n't the main challenges .
the church 's strapped finances are problematic enough , but the congress participants were well aware that far more is at stake than a leaking roof or two .
ultimately , the church knows it needs to reappraise its role and find a new place for faith within contemporary society .
" it 's time for a new departure , " parliamentary deputy speaker katrin göring-eckardt of the green party told the congress .
" and not primarily because of declining membership and lack of funds . "
göring-eckardt dismissed complaints that the ekd treated the church like a business in need of a turn-around by bandying around terms like ' quality control ' and ' quotas , ' and stressed the church 's need to adapt to the times .
" we need a worldly church , not an other-worldly church , " she said .

" but in the bible , paul says : ' test everything , retain what is good , ' which is a principle that does allow us to learn a few lessons from business and economics - from customer loyalty to promoting the protestant brand - so long as we never forget that the church will never be a company like any other .

" what many churches in germany lack is charisma , " he says .
" the church has suffered a loss of spiritual energy , it lacks relevance .
its crisis is a spiritual one not a financial one . "
and it 's no one 's fault but its own , he says .
" society is seeing a boom in religious interest , there 's a renewal of spiritual soul-searching going on in germany , but this is completely passing by the church , and it 's time the church found a way of harnessing it . "

but to some , this form of happy-clappy religion is suspiciously reminiscent of the born-again evangelism popular in the us - one which goes hand-in-hand with a christian-right political agenda deeply foreign to secular european sensibilities .
but it 's unlikely german protestants will ever head in this direction .
" traditionally , religious affiliation has been a private matter in germany due to the separation of church and state , " explains urike murmann , pastor at hamburg 's st katherine 's church .

" otherwise , the church will be left with just one third of its current membership and only fifty percent of its current funds by 2030 , " it warned .
so the alarm bells were ringing when some 300 church representatives and politicians came together for a congress in wittenberg to discuss ways of braking this accelerating trend .
according to the organizers from the ekd , the solution is a slate of reforms designed to usher in a " decade of change " set to culminate on the 500th anniversary of luther 's theses in 2017 .
identity crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what relevance does christ have in today 's world ?
the proposals included cutting back the country 's regional churches from 23 to a maximum of 12 , with the squeeze primarily on traditional , smaller parishes .
in future , the ekd wants to see the congregations of the individual regional churches number at least 1 million - twice the size of many of the smallest existing communities .
but these are n't the main challenges .
the church 's strapped finances are problematic enough , but the congress participants were well aware that far more is at stake than a leaking roof or two .
ultimately , the church knows it needs to reappraise its role and find a new place for faith within contemporary society .
" it 's time for a new departure , " parliamentary deputy speaker katrin göring-eckardt of the green party told the congress .
" and not primarily because of declining membership and lack of funds . "
göring-eckardt dismissed complaints that the ekd treated the church like a business in need of a turn-around by bandying around terms like ' quality control ' and ' quotas , ' and stressed the church 's need to adapt to the times .
" we need a worldly church , not an other-worldly church , " she said .
the business of religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : redefining its role many agree that a bit of business acumen is exactly what the church needs .
the days when even handing around a collection plate was an embarrassing concession to earthly matters are long over , and thies gundlach from the ekd says the church has to become less coy about resorting to best-practice marketing tricks .
" the church would be betraying itself if it behaved like a business , " he said .
" but in the bible , paul says : ' test everything , retain what is good , ' which is a principle that does allow us to learn a few lessons from business and economics - from customer loyalty to promoting the protestant brand - so long as we never forget that the church will never be a company like any other . "
his feelings are shared by swen schönheit , pastor at the apostle petrus church in berlin .
an angular building built in the 1960s , it could n't seem less inviting from the outside , but what it lacks in aesthetics it more than makes up for in atmosphere , defying the national trend by regularly welcoming a full house on sundays .
" what many churches in germany lack is charisma , " he says .
" the church has suffered a loss of spiritual energy , it lacks relevance .
its crisis is a spiritual one not a financial one . "
and it 's no one 's fault but its own , he says .
" society is seeing a boom in religious interest , there 's a renewal of spiritual soul-searching going on in germany , but this is completely passing by the church , and it 's time the church found a way of harnessing it . "
" it has to realize it is in competition with other sources of spirituality within society and get its act together , " he insists .

community activities range from children 's dance classes to group summer holidays , while the sunday service kicks off with a house band switching on the electric amplifier as the congregation sings along with the help of a power point show .
but to some , this form of happy-clappy religion is suspiciously reminiscent of the born-again evangelism popular in the us - one which goes hand-in-hand with a christian-right political agenda deeply foreign to secular european sensibilities .
but it 's unlikely german protestants will ever head in this direction .
" traditionally , religious affiliation has been a private matter in germany due to the separation of church and state , " explains urike murmann , pastor at hamburg 's st katherine 's church .
that said , she does believe a dose of showmanship never goes amiss .
" going to church should be cheerful , it should be fun , " she says .
" we 've seen that people respond very well when we offer music or theatre . "
but she also knows where to draw the line .
" of course , if it descended into a superficial entertainment , that would be terrible . "
her main emphasis is on the community role of the church , and she says that it 's already learning how to be more aware of parish needs .
" in hamburg , we look carefully at what our congregation wants and we tailor our activities accordingly .
we know we need to do more than just lecture people . "
but even though a number of churches across the country are managing to fill their pews by offering a new and improved form of protestantism , their popularity is failing to translate into church membership .
attending church is one thing , actually joining is another .
and the reasons might be purely mundane .
the spirit is willing , one might say , but the flesh is weak .
" the church tax is a stumbling block , " says murmann .
" it 's not easy to persuade people it 's valid .

separately , hamburg says it will take a share in a consortium buying a stake in parent company eads . amid reports that the world 's largest plane maker , airbus , is planning a tough cost-cutting operation , the german city-state of hamburg confirmed thursday that it will take a 10-percent share in a consortium acquiring the 7.5-percent stake in parent company eads .
the stake is being sold by german-us auto giant , daimlerchrysler . based on the current share price of 25.83 euros -lrb- $ 33.6 -rrb- , hamburg 's stake would be worth 160 million euros.the two neighboring north german states of lower saxony and bremen have already signaled their intention to invest 80 million euros and 30 million euros respectively in the acquisition of the stake . germany is currently represented in eads via a 22.5-percent share held by daimlerchrysler . all countries will be " equally unhappy " germany 's oldenburg-based newspaper nordwest zeitung reported thursday that thomas enders , co-chief of the eads , which fully owns airbus , had said the france-based plane maker would sell off production sites . in an earlier online report , the paper said enders only planned to keep those airbus plants involved in the final assembly or those that make components .
other manufacturing sites would be sold to trim bloated personnel costs and some 10,000 airbus jobs would be axed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads co- head thomas enders has hinted at painul cost-cutting " nobody in germany will be happy about what will be decided , " the paper quoted enders as saying .
but he also said he expected " everybody will be equally unhappy " in all the countries that are home to airbus plants . addressing some 300 guests - including german parliamentarians and representatives of the aviation industry - at the lower saxony embassy in berlin on wednesday , enders spoke of tough cuts in order to push through a restructuring program called " power 8 , " which aims to lower costs and make airbus more competitive for the future . enders , however , is said to have played down fears that airbus production sites in germany would be affected .
" there are no decisions at this point , " enders was quoted to have said . eads says it 's all speculation but spokesman for airbus parent company eads , michael hauger told ap news agency that though enders had spoken of " tough cuts , " he had also stressed that the rumors about job cuts and closing of production plants were pure speculation . hauger added that airbus management was still looking into the " power 8 " program , which would then have to be presented to eads bosses enders and louis gallois before the company 's supervisory board could have its final say . " everything that you hear before that is speculation , " hauger said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2,000 to 4,000 jobs could be axed at the airbus plant in hamburg but reports of massive job losses and the closing down of entire production plants are already doing the rounds in germany . horst niehus , a works council leader at the company 's hamburg factory told union members in a memo that the toulouse-based plane maker may sell manufacturing sites , buy more parts from outside suppliers and move work now done in germany to france . " should all scenarios be realized , it is expected that 5,000 through 8,000 jobs will be lost at airbus germany and 2,000 through 4,000 at hamburg , " niehus said in the report . airbus plans to slash 2.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.7 billion -rrb- from annual costs by 2010 .
eads has said the plane maker will record its first full-year loss ever for 2006 because of cost overruns on its a380 , which is at least two years behind schedule . minister says germany will fight to save jobs german economics minister michael glos said wednesday he will insist on a fair distribution of the burden resulting from airbus ' restructuring measures . " i will do everything possible to call on the french partner and those who run airbus to make sure that any job cuts will be in both countries and not to the disadvantage of german sites , " glos said .
" i will listen to the worries and help wherever i can within a government framework . " germany must get a share in present and future production that corresponds with its weight -lrb- in the company -rrb- , " he added .
" the german government will lobby for the german business location with all its power - also in its role as one of eads ' biggest contractors . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thousands of german job cuts feared at airbus workers geared up for demonstrations after a union leader said he feared that eads , the multi-national parent company of the troubled airbus concern , may cut up to 8,000 jobs in northern germany .

the hamburger morgenpost reported thursday that magath would take over at hsv .
a team spokesman , however , said there was " nothing to report . " back in bavaria , hitzfeld , who in his first spell as bayern manager led them to four titles and the champions league crown , takes over a team lying fourth and struggling to qualify for the champions league next season . werder turned up the pressure on the 20-time champions with a 2-0 win over bayer leverkusen , with german international striker miroslav klose joining serb marko pantelic at the top of the bundesliga scoring charts with 11 goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke squeaked past aachen to stay tied for first schalke 04 , in second also on 42 points , scraped through their home clash with aachen 2-1 . in other action on wednesday vfb stuttgart maintained third place with a 3-2 win over ninth-placed arminia bielfeld . hamburg are propping up the league after a disappointing 1-1 draw with energie cottbus , while mainz beat dortmund 1-0 and left the bundesliga basement . bayern suffer long fall bayern players received an angry dressing-down from now former coach felix magath after the defeat in dortmund .
he warned his charges that anything less than victory against bochum would spell the end of the title chances - and probably guessed it would be the end of his own as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath 's enthusiasm was n't enough to help bayern - or save his own job bayern took to the field at the allianz arena seemingly toiling under the weight of those words , passing erratically and in accurately in the early exchanges .
it took the bavarians well over half an hour to find any kind of rhythm , with bastian schweinsteiger showing one of the rare pieces of skill in the first half to release dutch midfielder mark van bommel .
but " schweini " then had to watch the dutchman rush his shot , which bochum keeper jaroslav drobny saved easily . disgruntled fans display their anger bayern offered little threat against their relegation-threatened opponents in the second-half and were jeered off the pitch at the end , their fans obviously disgusted with the drab performance that saw the champions unable to break down a bochum side who had been beaten 1-0 at home by bottom side mainz on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli kahn shows the direction bayern should be going " we 're very disappointed , obviously , " bayern goalkeeper and captain oliver kahn told arena tv .
" we have to realize we do n't have a season ticket for first place .
it all looks very bad at the moment . " chairman karl-heinz rummenigge left the stadium saying he did not want to comment .
" i 'm saying nothing now .
i have to sleep on it first , " he said . stuttgart recover to claim third place meanwhile vfb stuttgart , who had been beaten 4-1 at nuremberg on saturday , overtook bayern with a 3-2 victory over arminia bielefeld to move third in the table on 35 points . striker mario gomez scored twice in front of the watching german national team coach joachim löw to boost his chances of a first full international team call-up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario gomez has caught the eye of the national coach gomez opened the stuttgart account with a close-range header in the ninth minute and notched his second and stuttgart 's third in the 59th minute shortly after shooting over an open goal from two meters . strike partner cacau , who had set up the first goal , was on target with a header from a free-kick by pavel pardo seven minutes after the break . christian eigler had leveled for bielefeld with a fine finish from the edge of the area in the 26th minute , and substitute abdelaziz ahanfouf converted from the penalty spot four minutes from time . " we had messed up in our first game at the weekend so we had to show our fans we could play the second half of the season as we did the first , " gomez said .
" we had good chances in both halves so i think the victory was deserved . " mid-table teams held in stalemates elsewhere , wolfsburg and eintracht frankfurt shared the spoils in a 2-2 draw .
diego fernando klimowicz in the eighth minute and mike hanke with a header in the 73rd were on target for the wolves either side of goals in the 63rd and 69th minutes from michael thurk and alexander meier . in the other tuesday night game , struggling borussia mönchengladbach and mid-table nuremberg played out drab 0-0 draw . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern search for replacements as departures draw near the season is only half-way through and yet a number of bayern munich 's midfielders are looking for new clubs .

"
" otherwise , the church will be left with just one third of its current membership and only fifty percent of its current funds by 2030 , " it warned .
so the alarm bells were ringing when some 300 church representatives and politicians came together for a congress in wittenberg to discuss ways of braking this accelerating trend .
according to the organizers from the ekd , the solution is a slate of reforms designed to usher in a " decade of change " set to culminate on the 500th anniversary of luther 's theses in 2017 .
identity crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what relevance does christ have in today 's world ?
the proposals included cutting back the country 's regional churches from 23 to a maximum of 12 , with the squeeze primarily on traditional , smaller parishes .
in future , the ekd wants to see the congregations of the individual regional churches number at least 1 million - twice the size of many of the smallest existing communities .
but these are n't the main challenges .
the church 's strapped finances are problematic enough , but the congress participants were well aware that far more is at stake than a leaking roof or two .
ultimately , the church knows it needs to reappraise its role and find a new place for faith within contemporary society .
" it 's time for a new departure , " parliamentary deputy speaker katrin göring-eckardt of the green party told the congress .
" and not primarily because of declining membership and lack of funds . "
göring-eckardt dismissed complaints that the ekd treated the church like a business in need of a turn-around by bandying around terms like ' quality control ' and ' quotas , ' and stressed the church 's need to adapt to the times .
" we need a worldly church , not an other-worldly church , " she said .
the business of religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : redefining its role many agree that a bit of business acumen is exactly what the church needs .
the days when even handing around a collection plate was an embarrassing concession to earthly matters are long over , and thies gundlach from the ekd says the church has to become less coy about resorting to best-practice marketing tricks .
" the church would be betraying itself if it behaved like a business , " he said .
" but in the bible , paul says : ' test everything , retain what is good , ' which is a principle that does allow us to learn a few lessons from business and economics - from customer loyalty to promoting the protestant brand - so long as we never forget that the church will never be a company like any other . "
his feelings are shared by swen schönheit , pastor at the apostle petrus church in berlin .
an angular building built in the 1960s , it could n't seem less inviting from the outside , but what it lacks in aesthetics it more than makes up for in atmosphere , defying the national trend by regularly welcoming a full house on sundays .
" what many churches in germany lack is charisma , " he says .
" the church has suffered a loss of spiritual energy , it lacks relevance .
its crisis is a spiritual one not a financial one . "
and it 's no one 's fault but its own , he says .
" society is seeing a boom in religious interest , there 's a renewal of spiritual soul-searching going on in germany , but this is completely passing by the church , and it 's time the church found a way of harnessing it . "
" it has to realize it is in competition with other sources of spirituality within society and get its act together , " he insists .
the new religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many feel the church needs more of a human touch his own church obviously has .
community activities range from children 's dance classes to group summer holidays , while the sunday service kicks off with a house band switching on the electric amplifier as the congregation sings along with the help of a power point show .
but to some , this form of happy-clappy religion is suspiciously reminiscent of the born-again evangelism popular in the us - one which goes hand-in-hand with a christian-right political agenda deeply foreign to secular european sensibilities .
but it 's unlikely german protestants will ever head in this direction .
" traditionally , religious affiliation has been a private matter in germany due to the separation of church and state , " explains urike murmann , pastor at hamburg 's st katherine 's church .
that said , she does believe a dose of showmanship never goes amiss .
" going to church should be cheerful , it should be fun , " she says .
" we 've seen that people respond very well when we offer music or theatre . "
but she also knows where to draw the line .
" of course , if it descended into a superficial entertainment , that would be terrible . "
her main emphasis is on the community role of the church , and she says that it 's already learning how to be more aware of parish needs .
" in hamburg , we look carefully at what our congregation wants and we tailor our activities accordingly .
we know we need to do more than just lecture people . "
but even though a number of churches across the country are managing to fill their pews by offering a new and improved form of protestantism , their popularity is failing to translate into church membership .
attending church is one thing , actually joining is another .
and the reasons might be purely mundane .
the spirit is willing , one might say , but the flesh is weak .
" the church tax is a stumbling block , " says murmann .
" it 's not easy to persuade people it 's valid .
furthermore , there 's been a growing skepticism towards institutions in recent years .
people do n't join political parties , they do n't join unions .

separately , hamburg says it will take a share in a consortium buying a stake in parent company eads . amid reports that the world 's largest plane maker , airbus , is planning a tough cost-cutting operation , the german city-state of hamburg confirmed thursday that it will take a 10-percent share in a consortium acquiring the 7.5-percent stake in parent company eads .
the stake is being sold by german-us auto giant , daimlerchrysler . based on the current share price of 25.83 euros -lrb- $ 33.6 -rrb- , hamburg 's stake would be worth 160 million euros.the two neighboring north german states of lower saxony and bremen have already signaled their intention to invest 80 million euros and 30 million euros respectively in the acquisition of the stake . germany is currently represented in eads via a 22.5-percent share held by daimlerchrysler . all countries will be " equally unhappy " germany 's oldenburg-based newspaper nordwest zeitung reported thursday that thomas enders , co-chief of the eads , which fully owns airbus , had said the france-based plane maker would sell off production sites . in an earlier online report , the paper said enders only planned to keep those airbus plants involved in the final assembly or those that make components .
other manufacturing sites would be sold to trim bloated personnel costs and some 10,000 airbus jobs would be axed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads co- head thomas enders has hinted at painul cost-cutting " nobody in germany will be happy about what will be decided , " the paper quoted enders as saying .

eads has said the plane maker will record its first full-year loss ever for 2006 because of cost overruns on its a380 , which is at least two years behind schedule . minister says germany will fight to save jobs german economics minister michael glos said wednesday he will insist on a fair distribution of the burden resulting from airbus ' restructuring measures . " i will do everything possible to call on the french partner and those who run airbus to make sure that any job cuts will be in both countries and not to the disadvantage of german sites , " glos said .
" i will listen to the worries and help wherever i can within a government framework . " germany must get a share in present and future production that corresponds with its weight -lrb- in the company -rrb- , " he added .

"
" otherwise , the church will be left with just one third of its current membership and only fifty percent of its current funds by 2030 , " it warned .
so the alarm bells were ringing when some 300 church representatives and politicians came together for a congress in wittenberg to discuss ways of braking this accelerating trend .
according to the organizers from the ekd , the solution is a slate of reforms designed to usher in a " decade of change " set to culminate on the 500th anniversary of luther 's theses in 2017 .
identity crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what relevance does christ have in today 's world ?
the proposals included cutting back the country 's regional churches from 23 to a maximum of 12 , with the squeeze primarily on traditional , smaller parishes .
in future , the ekd wants to see the congregations of the individual regional churches number at least 1 million - twice the size of many of the smallest existing communities .
but these are n't the main challenges .
the church 's strapped finances are problematic enough , but the congress participants were well aware that far more is at stake than a leaking roof or two .
ultimately , the church knows it needs to reappraise its role and find a new place for faith within contemporary society .
" it 's time for a new departure , " parliamentary deputy speaker katrin göring-eckardt of the green party told the congress .
" and not primarily because of declining membership and lack of funds . "
göring-eckardt dismissed complaints that the ekd treated the church like a business in need of a turn-around by bandying around terms like ' quality control ' and ' quotas , ' and stressed the church 's need to adapt to the times .
" we need a worldly church , not an other-worldly church , " she said .
the business of religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : redefining its role many agree that a bit of business acumen is exactly what the church needs .
the days when even handing around a collection plate was an embarrassing concession to earthly matters are long over , and thies gundlach from the ekd says the church has to become less coy about resorting to best-practice marketing tricks .
" the church would be betraying itself if it behaved like a business , " he said .
" but in the bible , paul says : ' test everything , retain what is good , ' which is a principle that does allow us to learn a few lessons from business and economics - from customer loyalty to promoting the protestant brand - so long as we never forget that the church will never be a company like any other . "
his feelings are shared by swen schönheit , pastor at the apostle petrus church in berlin .
an angular building built in the 1960s , it could n't seem less inviting from the outside , but what it lacks in aesthetics it more than makes up for in atmosphere , defying the national trend by regularly welcoming a full house on sundays .
" what many churches in germany lack is charisma , " he says .
" the church has suffered a loss of spiritual energy , it lacks relevance .
its crisis is a spiritual one not a financial one . "
and it 's no one 's fault but its own , he says .
" society is seeing a boom in religious interest , there 's a renewal of spiritual soul-searching going on in germany , but this is completely passing by the church , and it 's time the church found a way of harnessing it . "
" it has to realize it is in competition with other sources of spirituality within society and get its act together , " he insists .
the new religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many feel the church needs more of a human touch his own church obviously has .
community activities range from children 's dance classes to group summer holidays , while the sunday service kicks off with a house band switching on the electric amplifier as the congregation sings along with the help of a power point show .
but to some , this form of happy-clappy religion is suspiciously reminiscent of the born-again evangelism popular in the us - one which goes hand-in-hand with a christian-right political agenda deeply foreign to secular european sensibilities .
but it 's unlikely german protestants will ever head in this direction .
" traditionally , religious affiliation has been a private matter in germany due to the separation of church and state , " explains urike murmann , pastor at hamburg 's st katherine 's church .
that said , she does believe a dose of showmanship never goes amiss .
" going to church should be cheerful , it should be fun , " she says .
" we 've seen that people respond very well when we offer music or theatre . "
but she also knows where to draw the line .
" of course , if it descended into a superficial entertainment , that would be terrible . "
her main emphasis is on the community role of the church , and she says that it 's already learning how to be more aware of parish needs .
" in hamburg , we look carefully at what our congregation wants and we tailor our activities accordingly .
we know we need to do more than just lecture people . "
but even though a number of churches across the country are managing to fill their pews by offering a new and improved form of protestantism , their popularity is failing to translate into church membership .
attending church is one thing , actually joining is another .
and the reasons might be purely mundane .
the spirit is willing , one might say , but the flesh is weak .
" the church tax is a stumbling block , " says murmann .
" it 's not easy to persuade people it 's valid .
furthermore , there 's been a growing skepticism towards institutions in recent years .
people do n't join political parties , they do n't join unions .
the church is no exception . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reformers turn up heat on church critics have been present at world youth day , bringing up issues such as the role of women , family planning and gay rights .

" if we continue along the current path , the present fragmented industrial bases in europe will not be sustainable , " verheugen told a defense conference in brussels . verheugen stressed that the european defense sector in its current form was riddled with inefficiency and national protectionism .

" having one or perhaps a second bomb a little later , well that 's not very dangerous , " chirac said .
" where would iran drop this bomb ?

" it would not have gone off 200 meters into the atmosphere before tehran would be razed to the ground , " he said . the elysee palace issued a statement on thursday clarifying chirac 's stance and a presidential aide complained of a " shameful polemic " stoked by " certain media across the atlantic " who are anti-french . a clear position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac said he had oversimplified the iran issue in his interview the white house said it was satisfied with chirac 's " revised and extended " comments . " the fact is our position on iran is clear , they should n't have any nuclear weapon and furthermore they ought to take steps to suspend uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities , " said spokesman tony snow . " that is not only the stated position of the united states but also its allies , including france , in terms of dealing with the iranians , " snow told reporters . chirac explosive interview came , nonetheless , at a rather sensitive moment for us-eu relations . tensions rising ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un imposed sanctions on iran in december although european countries agreed with the united states to impose sanctions on iran in line with a un resolution adopted in december , they have resisted us calls to go even further and force global financial institutions to sever all ties with the islamic republic . us undersecretary in charge of fighting terrorist funding , stuart levey , has made several whirlwind trips to europe over the past months to try to persuade european multinationals and banks to stop investing in iran . but so far he has run into a brick wall , with european countries maintaining they are not ready to cut off banking links with iranian companies , arguing that such a move goes beyond the spirit of the un resolution . " we are going to do the utmost to apply the content of the resolution .
we are not going to go beyond what is in the resolution as states , " a senior european official told afp . partial withdrawal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank partially bowed to us pressure on wednesday , commerzbank , the second-biggest bank in germany , joined other european banks in curtailing its activities with iran by abolishing dollar transactions for iran at its new york branch . a number of european banks - such as credit suisse and ubs have already taken similar decisions , paring back or ceasing altogether their operations with iran . commerzbank , however , said it would continue to handle euro transactions for its iranian clients . additionally , several european countries continue to offer mostly state-sponsored loans to the islamic republic .
in 2005 alone , italy awarded 4.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.2 billion -rrb- in loans to teheran , with germany tallying slightly behind with 4.2 billion euros . frustration in the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president bush has accused iranian leaders of stirring up violence in iraq us officials this week gave vent to their mounting frustration , which comes as us president george w. bush has accused iranian leaders of helping to forment the mounting sectarian violence in iraq , fuelling fears that the us could be preparing some kind of military response against tehran . " the european response on the economic side has been pretty weak , " one unnamed senior us official was quoted in the new york times . " we are telling the europeans that they need to go way beyond what they 've done to maximize pressure on iran , " he added . legal concerns this position , however , does not seem to completely reflect the view of the us administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu will address the issue of sanctions against iran in mid-february " i think that the concerns that european governments are expressing have to do with their legal requirements .
they have a set of legal requirements that they have to abide by , " said state department spokesman sean mccormack . " and i 'm not sure i would call that resistance to discussing or cooperating on these various measures . " european union foreign ministers last week agreed to implement the full raft of un sanctions against tehran and deplored " iran 's failure to take the steps repeatedly required by the iaea board of governors and the united nations security council . " a new eu meeting is planned in mid-february to put in place european regulations on the iran sanctions which suspend all exports of materiel and technology to the islamic republic . the un resolution also freezes iranian assets abroad and restricts foreign travel by iranians deemed to be involved in the suspect programs . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran defies sanctions , vows to expand enrichment iran vowed sunday to start work immediately on drastically expanding its capacity to enrich uranium , defying the first un sanctions against the islamic republic 's nuclear program .

" if we continue along the current path , the present fragmented industrial bases in europe will not be sustainable , " verheugen told a defense conference in brussels . verheugen stressed that the european defense sector in its current form was riddled with inefficiency and national protectionism .
maintaining national control in the defence sector has pushed the prices up and undermined the future of the 300,000 jobs in defense manufacturing across the eu . " it means a lack of competition , an inability to exploit economies of scale and , above all , poor value for money for european taxpayers , " he said . opening up the borders even though eu governments agreed last year to open up markets to more cross-border competition last year , the defense-related industries have been largely kept out of the remit of the internal market . the 27-nation block , for instance , has 23 distinct national programs for building armored fighting vehicles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union foreign policy chief javier solana " cross-border competition in a continental-sized market is essential , " eu foreign policy chief jaiver solana told the conference .
" this is a matter on which its -lrb- the industry 's -rrb- survival rests . " the eu commission is expected to propose a new legislation later this year that would open the 30 billion euro -lrb- $ 39 billion -rrb- defense market to more cross-national competition .
it would also remove the need for eu exporters to obtain security licenses for exporting defense-related goods to other eu nations . at the moment , around 12,000 requests for such licenses are filed every year .
in view of the close military cooperation between eu governments , only 15 licenses were refused in 2003 , and none in 2004 and 2005 . " on the government side , we must combine our requirements so as to offer industry projects with a worthwhile economy of scale .
and we must encourage the restructuring and consolidation of the supply side as well , " solana said . trans-atlantic competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commissioner for enterprise and industry günter verheugen verheugen , who also serves as vice president of the european commission , blasted the united states for not opening up its defense markets to european contractors . " the protectionist spirit in the united sates is much more strong than in europe , " verheugen said . " especially in congress , it is obvious that as a result of the american electoral system you find such a position that american jobs must be protected , even if it is economically not very sound , " he said . after his recent meetings in washington , however , verheugen said he was optimistic that " a first set of rules " which would improve the exchange between the us and the eu could emerge later this year . " if that does not work , it would be disappointing , " he said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leaders meet in berlin to bolster eu defense force eu industry and government leaders are meeting in berlin to discuss a host of defense topics , including making sure that european mobile battle groups are ready to report for duty early next year .

it appears germany 's mighty automobile lobby is getting its way in brussels , as the eu moves its regulatory focus from emissions standards to biofuel use across the bloc . germany 's auto lobby might be feeling celebratory these days , though the oil producers may have shed some tears .
the european commission on wednesday suggested tightening fuel ecology standards as a measure toward combating climate change . observers read this as a sign that , in its battle against global warming , brussels is ready to shift its focus away from tighter standards on car motors and onto " greener " fuels by having gas and diesel providers monitoring greenhouse gas emissions during the delivery , refining , and transport of oil . missing the target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany would rather change the fuel than the motor because the auto industry is likely to miss a voluntary goal of cutting carbon dioxide emissions for new cars , european commission president jose manuel barroso and environment commissioner stavros dimas want binding legislation that would require carmakers to reduce new cars ' co2 emissions to an industry average of 120 grams per kilometer in 2012 . in addition , the eu wants to limit the sulfur content of diesel fuel .
instead , a new type of fuel with a higher content of " clean " bioethanol should be developed , the eu said . merkel joins in debate but while the goal of the eu is to lower co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , the german car industry - and german chancellor angela merkel , who has gone to battle in brussels on its behalf - is opposed to blanket measures that would apply to all cars , regardless of their size . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has stepped in to fight for the german car industry on monday , merkel waded into the fray , saying it was " regrettable " that european carmakers would not meet the targets they had set themselves , but adding : " we must not let the result of that be to impose a general obligation for all cars to be subject to the same measure . " merkel added that she would " never " agree to binding limits on makers of bigger cars . michael glos , merkel 's economy minister , also came out in support of the german auto industry on wednesday and accused the commission of following its own industrial agenda . " this is not about environmental policy but hard-nosed industrial policy interests , " he said .
" the european commission 's planned exhaust levels for cars are unacceptable . " the german car lobby has warned that forcing carmakers to modernize their products to meet binding limits would pose a threat to jobs and competitiveness for the german automakers .

it appears germany 's mighty automobile lobby is getting its way in brussels , as the eu moves its regulatory focus from emissions standards to biofuel use across the bloc . germany 's auto lobby might be feeling celebratory these days , though the oil producers may have shed some tears .
the european commission on wednesday suggested tightening fuel ecology standards as a measure toward combating climate change . observers read this as a sign that , in its battle against global warming , brussels is ready to shift its focus away from tighter standards on car motors and onto " greener " fuels by having gas and diesel providers monitoring greenhouse gas emissions during the delivery , refining , and transport of oil . missing the target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany would rather change the fuel than the motor because the auto industry is likely to miss a voluntary goal of cutting carbon dioxide emissions for new cars , european commission president jose manuel barroso and environment commissioner stavros dimas want binding legislation that would require carmakers to reduce new cars ' co2 emissions to an industry average of 120 grams per kilometer in 2012 . in addition , the eu wants to limit the sulfur content of diesel fuel .
instead , a new type of fuel with a higher content of " clean " bioethanol should be developed , the eu said . merkel joins in debate but while the goal of the eu is to lower co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , the german car industry - and german chancellor angela merkel , who has gone to battle in brussels on its behalf - is opposed to blanket measures that would apply to all cars , regardless of their size . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has stepped in to fight for the german car industry on monday , merkel waded into the fray , saying it was " regrettable " that european carmakers would not meet the targets they had set themselves , but adding : " we must not let the result of that be to impose a general obligation for all cars to be subject to the same measure . " merkel added that she would " never " agree to binding limits on makers of bigger cars . michael glos , merkel 's economy minister , also came out in support of the german auto industry on wednesday and accused the commission of following its own industrial agenda . " this is not about environmental policy but hard-nosed industrial policy interests , " he said .
" the european commission 's planned exhaust levels for cars are unacceptable . " the german car lobby has warned that forcing carmakers to modernize their products to meet binding limits would pose a threat to jobs and competitiveness for the german automakers .

but according to the financial times newspaper , environment commissioner dimas has already given in to german pressure . observers say he is now ready to accept a reduction to 130 grams per kilometer by 2012 , instead of 120 , according to the daily .
the difference would then need to be made up by improvements in development and use of cleaner fuels . eu industry commissioner günter verheugen also agreed with this new plan .
in the case of the auto industry , he said he is in favor of an " integrated approach " to greenhouse gas reduction .

" chirac caused a stir after he downplayed the threat posed by iran in an interview to three publications earlier this week . " having one or perhaps a second bomb a little later , well that 's not very dangerous , " chirac said .
" where would iran drop this bomb ?
on israel ? " he asked .
" it would not have gone off 200 meters into the atmosphere before tehran would be razed to the ground , " he said . the elysee palace issued a statement on thursday clarifying chirac 's stance and a presidential aide complained of a " shameful polemic " stoked by " certain media across the atlantic " who are anti-french . a clear position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac said he had oversimplified the iran issue in his interview the white house said it was satisfied with chirac 's " revised and extended " comments . " the fact is our position on iran is clear , they should n't have any nuclear weapon and furthermore they ought to take steps to suspend uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities , " said spokesman tony snow . " that is not only the stated position of the united states but also its allies , including france , in terms of dealing with the iranians , " snow told reporters . chirac explosive interview came , nonetheless , at a rather sensitive moment for us-eu relations . tensions rising ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un imposed sanctions on iran in december although european countries agreed with the united states to impose sanctions on iran in line with a un resolution adopted in december , they have resisted us calls to go even further and force global financial institutions to sever all ties with the islamic republic . us undersecretary in charge of fighting terrorist funding , stuart levey , has made several whirlwind trips to europe over the past months to try to persuade european multinationals and banks to stop investing in iran . but so far he has run into a brick wall , with european countries maintaining they are not ready to cut off banking links with iranian companies , arguing that such a move goes beyond the spirit of the un resolution . " we are going to do the utmost to apply the content of the resolution .
we are not going to go beyond what is in the resolution as states , " a senior european official told afp . partial withdrawal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank partially bowed to us pressure on wednesday , commerzbank , the second-biggest bank in germany , joined other european banks in curtailing its activities with iran by abolishing dollar transactions for iran at its new york branch . a number of european banks - such as credit suisse and ubs have already taken similar decisions , paring back or ceasing altogether their operations with iran . commerzbank , however , said it would continue to handle euro transactions for its iranian clients . additionally , several european countries continue to offer mostly state-sponsored loans to the islamic republic .
in 2005 alone , italy awarded 4.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.2 billion -rrb- in loans to teheran , with germany tallying slightly behind with 4.2 billion euros . frustration in the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president bush has accused iranian leaders of stirring up violence in iraq us officials this week gave vent to their mounting frustration , which comes as us president george w. bush has accused iranian leaders of helping to forment the mounting sectarian violence in iraq , fuelling fears that the us could be preparing some kind of military response against tehran . " the european response on the economic side has been pretty weak , " one unnamed senior us official was quoted in the new york times . " we are telling the europeans that they need to go way beyond what they 've done to maximize pressure on iran , " he added . legal concerns this position , however , does not seem to completely reflect the view of the us administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu will address the issue of sanctions against iran in mid-february " i think that the concerns that european governments are expressing have to do with their legal requirements .
they have a set of legal requirements that they have to abide by , " said state department spokesman sean mccormack . " and i 'm not sure i would call that resistance to discussing or cooperating on these various measures . " european union foreign ministers last week agreed to implement the full raft of un sanctions against tehran and deplored " iran 's failure to take the steps repeatedly required by the iaea board of governors and the united nations security council . " a new eu meeting is planned in mid-february to put in place european regulations on the iran sanctions which suspend all exports of materiel and technology to the islamic republic . the un resolution also freezes iranian assets abroad and restricts foreign travel by iranians deemed to be involved in the suspect programs . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran defies sanctions , vows to expand enrichment iran vowed sunday to start work immediately on drastically expanding its capacity to enrich uranium , defying the first un sanctions against the islamic republic 's nuclear program .

" it would not have gone off 200 meters into the atmosphere before tehran would be razed to the ground , " he said . the elysee palace issued a statement on thursday clarifying chirac 's stance and a presidential aide complained of a " shameful polemic " stoked by " certain media across the atlantic " who are anti-french . a clear position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac said he had oversimplified the iran issue in his interview the white house said it was satisfied with chirac 's " revised and extended " comments . " the fact is our position on iran is clear , they should n't have any nuclear weapon and furthermore they ought to take steps to suspend uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities , " said spokesman tony snow . " that is not only the stated position of the united states but also its allies , including france , in terms of dealing with the iranians , " snow told reporters . chirac explosive interview came , nonetheless , at a rather sensitive moment for us-eu relations . tensions rising ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un imposed sanctions on iran in december although european countries agreed with the united states to impose sanctions on iran in line with a un resolution adopted in december , they have resisted us calls to go even further and force global financial institutions to sever all ties with the islamic republic . us undersecretary in charge of fighting terrorist funding , stuart levey , has made several whirlwind trips to europe over the past months to try to persuade european multinationals and banks to stop investing in iran . but so far he has run into a brick wall , with european countries maintaining they are not ready to cut off banking links with iranian companies , arguing that such a move goes beyond the spirit of the un resolution . " we are going to do the utmost to apply the content of the resolution .
we are not going to go beyond what is in the resolution as states , " a senior european official told afp . partial withdrawal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank partially bowed to us pressure on wednesday , commerzbank , the second-biggest bank in germany , joined other european banks in curtailing its activities with iran by abolishing dollar transactions for iran at its new york branch . a number of european banks - such as credit suisse and ubs have already taken similar decisions , paring back or ceasing altogether their operations with iran . commerzbank , however , said it would continue to handle euro transactions for its iranian clients . additionally , several european countries continue to offer mostly state-sponsored loans to the islamic republic .
in 2005 alone , italy awarded 4.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.2 billion -rrb- in loans to teheran , with germany tallying slightly behind with 4.2 billion euros . frustration in the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president bush has accused iranian leaders of stirring up violence in iraq us officials this week gave vent to their mounting frustration , which comes as us president george w. bush has accused iranian leaders of helping to forment the mounting sectarian violence in iraq , fuelling fears that the us could be preparing some kind of military response against tehran . " the european response on the economic side has been pretty weak , " one unnamed senior us official was quoted in the new york times . " we are telling the europeans that they need to go way beyond what they 've done to maximize pressure on iran , " he added . legal concerns this position , however , does not seem to completely reflect the view of the us administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu will address the issue of sanctions against iran in mid-february " i think that the concerns that european governments are expressing have to do with their legal requirements .
they have a set of legal requirements that they have to abide by , " said state department spokesman sean mccormack . " and i 'm not sure i would call that resistance to discussing or cooperating on these various measures . " european union foreign ministers last week agreed to implement the full raft of un sanctions against tehran and deplored " iran 's failure to take the steps repeatedly required by the iaea board of governors and the united nations security council . " a new eu meeting is planned in mid-february to put in place european regulations on the iran sanctions which suspend all exports of materiel and technology to the islamic republic . the un resolution also freezes iranian assets abroad and restricts foreign travel by iranians deemed to be involved in the suspect programs . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran defies sanctions , vows to expand enrichment iran vowed sunday to start work immediately on drastically expanding its capacity to enrich uranium , defying the first un sanctions against the islamic republic 's nuclear program .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de auto industry -pipe- 01.02.2007 german car lobby appears to bend will of eu regulators großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : everyone knows they are harmful , but how best to reduce co2 emissions ?
it appears germany 's mighty automobile lobby is getting its way in brussels , as the eu moves its regulatory focus from emissions standards to biofuel use across the bloc . germany 's auto lobby might be feeling celebratory these days , though the oil producers may have shed some tears .
the european commission on wednesday suggested tightening fuel ecology standards as a measure toward combating climate change . observers read this as a sign that , in its battle against global warming , brussels is ready to shift its focus away from tighter standards on car motors and onto " greener " fuels by having gas and diesel providers monitoring greenhouse gas emissions during the delivery , refining , and transport of oil . missing the target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany would rather change the fuel than the motor because the auto industry is likely to miss a voluntary goal of cutting carbon dioxide emissions for new cars , european commission president jose manuel barroso and environment commissioner stavros dimas want binding legislation that would require carmakers to reduce new cars ' co2 emissions to an industry average of 120 grams per kilometer in 2012 . in addition , the eu wants to limit the sulfur content of diesel fuel .
instead , a new type of fuel with a higher content of " clean " bioethanol should be developed , the eu said . merkel joins in debate but while the goal of the eu is to lower co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , the german car industry - and german chancellor angela merkel , who has gone to battle in brussels on its behalf - is opposed to blanket measures that would apply to all cars , regardless of their size . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has stepped in to fight for the german car industry on monday , merkel waded into the fray , saying it was " regrettable " that european carmakers would not meet the targets they had set themselves , but adding : " we must not let the result of that be to impose a general obligation for all cars to be subject to the same measure . " merkel added that she would " never " agree to binding limits on makers of bigger cars . michael glos , merkel 's economy minister , also came out in support of the german auto industry on wednesday and accused the commission of following its own industrial agenda . " this is not about environmental policy but hard-nosed industrial policy interests , " he said .
" the european commission 's planned exhaust levels for cars are unacceptable . " the german car lobby has warned that forcing carmakers to modernize their products to meet binding limits would pose a threat to jobs and competitiveness for the german automakers .

he is joined by newcomer mario gomez and a host of returning stars . germany coach joachim löw was in frankfurt at the weekend to see the 24-year-old kuranyi net a brace in the 3-1 victory over eintracht frankfurt to help his side stay joint top of the bundesliga with werder bremen . " kevin has shown shortly before the winter break and now since the bundesliga restarted that his form is improving , " said löw . kuranyi last played for germany in november 2005 in the scoreless draw against france in paris and failed to make his country 's world cup squad .
his club form took a dive soon after joining schalke from stuttgart in 2005 , scoring just 10 goals in 30 appearances for the club .
by the end of the world cup season , kuranyi 's body language spoke of a striker running on empty . kuranyi 's world cup nightmare dissipating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi 's world cup pain was obvious but since the beginning of this current season , with his world cup disappointment behind him , kuranyi has bagged on average a goal every other game and is looking decidedly more confident . the competition for places up front for germany got even hotter with the announcement that löw was also calling up stuttgart 's in-form striker mario gomez for the switzerland game . a product of the stuttgart youth system , gomez has hit ten goals in 18 games for stuttgart and has been integral in the southern club 's push for the champions league places , a surge that saw them set an early pace at the top of the league . germany coach löw was watching on tuesday night when the 22-year-old scored a brace against arminia bielefeld , fuelling rumors that a place in the national squad was being considered . klose a shoe-in , but poldi 's form raises questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's main strikers are experiencing different luck while first choice striker miroslav klose is firing on all cylinders for high-scoring league leaders werder bremen , lukas podolski , klose 's usual international partner in attack , is fairing less favorably at bayern munich . podolski has just one goal to his name this season in his sporadic appearances for the champions .
while löw is known to have great faith in podolski , the striker 's current club form may raise some questions in the future which the coach may find hard to ignore .
the topic of podolski 's inclusion is a mute point however as he is suspended for the switzerland friendly . with kuranyi and gomez entering the equation , löw may be tempted to experiment against the swiss at some point during the 90 minutes , especially as borussia mönchengladbach 's veteran striker oliver neuville will be missing through injury . return of the formerly walking wounded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi löw rings the changes löw also said he we has happy to name borussia dortmund 's christoph metzelder and werder bremen 's tim borowski in the squad and said that borowski was likely to start against the swiss . the same goes for teammate per mertesacker , who makes his return to the german squad for the first time since last summer 's world cup following his achilles operation last autumn . " per will definitely return , " said löw .
" he has been playing permanently for bremen . " metzelder returns to the national team after a six-month absence due to injury .

a doping scandal is a nightmare for athletes and fans , but corporate sponsors may be the ones who suffer most .
marketers hope new international rules and corporate vigilance will aid in damage control . on thursday , an international unesco convention on doping goes into effect .
while the agreement is unlikely to put a stop to doping in sports any time soon , it represents the first time that governments around the world have agreed to throw the force of international law behind the problem . " until now , doping cases have been handled by sporting authorities .
this puts it in the countries ' courts of law , " said christoph breuer , a professor of sports management at the athletics college of cologne . the international accord can be seen as a vote of confidence in german 's national anti-doping agency , nada , and its international offshoot , world anti doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- . dancing to their own tune bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich , right , no longer wears the t-mobile jersey .

" in the situation of the time he -lrb- steinmeier -rrb- acted absolutely correctly and in sync with the political line that was my responsibility , " schröder said , adding that he would have taken the exact same decisions in light of the atmosphere and events of the time . the former chancellor said he was not informed personally about the case of murat kurnaz , who was seized by us forces in pakistan after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks and sent to guantanamo bay in 2002 .
" but i take responsibility for the then security policy , " he said . schröder pointed out that given the fear of further attacks in the wake of the sept .
11 atrocity , germany 's internal security had the highest priority at the time , along with a strict regard for legal principles and human rights . " in light of the fact that a few perpetrators of the sept .
11 attacks had lived in germany , we had to be highly alert , " he said . steinmeier to testify on march 8 schröder 's defense of steinmeier will be a welcome respite for the foreign minister who is increasingly under pressure over the kurnaz case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz says he was tortured at guantanamo bay steinmeier faces allegations of not having done enough , and in certain cases having blocked , kurnaz ' release from the us prison camp on cuba .
the german-born turkish national , who has claimed he was abused and tortured in the prison , was released last year after the intervention of current chancellor angela merkel . on thursday , it emerged that steinmeier , who has consistently rejected any allegations of wrongdoing , will be testifying on march 8 before an independent parliamentary committee set up to investigate the case .
critics have complained that given the mounting evidence which points to steinmeier 's role in the affair , the foreign minister should testify earlier than march . the glare of the media increased on the minister this week when a german court issued arrest warrants for 13 people in connection with the alleged cia-backed kidnapping of a lebanese-born german citizen , khaled el-masri . minister rebuffs allegations in the latest of a series of interviews to defend his actions , steinmeier said claims that the german government received a formal offer from the us administration to free kurnaz in 2002 were " made-up . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the affair has given steinmeier a major headache he told die zeit weekly newspaper that washington had simply suggested cutting a deal with kurnaz to use him to infiltrate extremist muslim groups in germany .
the german government rejected the idea on the advice of security experts and the foreign intelligence services , steinmeier said . he said it was easy to forget the highly charged atmosphere at the time , with the west bracing for islamist attacks .
the german government had " the responsibility to ensure that no further attacks took place , " steinmeier told die zeit .
he pointed out that germany has to this day remained free from a major terrorist attack since the suicide hijackings of september 11 . merkel 's grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats is closing ranks around steinmeier , a member of the social democratic party . thomas de maiziere , a conservative who now holds steinmeier 's old job of chief of staff at the chancellery , warned against harshly judging the kurnaz case in hindsight . " it is very easy with the witness statements and documents to judge the incident four or five years later .
but it is far harder to make decisions at a highly complex point in time , " he said . three members of the german intelligence services who questioned kurnaz in guantanamo were to give evidence on thursday to the parliamentary committee investigating the case . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court orders arrest of 13 over cia kidnapping a german court ordered the arrest of 13 people behind the alleged cia-backed kidnapping of a german citizen , believed to be one of the most notorious us " renditions " of a terror suspect , prosecutors said wednesday .

" chirac caused a stir after he downplayed the threat posed by iran in an interview to three publications earlier this week . " having one or perhaps a second bomb a little later , well that 's not very dangerous , " chirac said .
" where would iran drop this bomb ?
on israel ? " he asked .
" it would not have gone off 200 meters into the atmosphere before tehran would be razed to the ground , " he said . the elysee palace issued a statement on thursday clarifying chirac 's stance and a presidential aide complained of a " shameful polemic " stoked by " certain media across the atlantic " who are anti-french . a clear position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac said he had oversimplified the iran issue in his interview the white house said it was satisfied with chirac 's " revised and extended " comments . " the fact is our position on iran is clear , they should n't have any nuclear weapon and furthermore they ought to take steps to suspend uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities , " said spokesman tony snow . " that is not only the stated position of the united states but also its allies , including france , in terms of dealing with the iranians , " snow told reporters . chirac explosive interview came , nonetheless , at a rather sensitive moment for us-eu relations . tensions rising ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un imposed sanctions on iran in december although european countries agreed with the united states to impose sanctions on iran in line with a un resolution adopted in december , they have resisted us calls to go even further and force global financial institutions to sever all ties with the islamic republic . us undersecretary in charge of fighting terrorist funding , stuart levey , has made several whirlwind trips to europe over the past months to try to persuade european multinationals and banks to stop investing in iran . but so far he has run into a brick wall , with european countries maintaining they are not ready to cut off banking links with iranian companies , arguing that such a move goes beyond the spirit of the un resolution . " we are going to do the utmost to apply the content of the resolution .
we are not going to go beyond what is in the resolution as states , " a senior european official told afp . partial withdrawal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank partially bowed to us pressure on wednesday , commerzbank , the second-biggest bank in germany , joined other european banks in curtailing its activities with iran by abolishing dollar transactions for iran at its new york branch . a number of european banks - such as credit suisse and ubs have already taken similar decisions , paring back or ceasing altogether their operations with iran . commerzbank , however , said it would continue to handle euro transactions for its iranian clients . additionally , several european countries continue to offer mostly state-sponsored loans to the islamic republic .
in 2005 alone , italy awarded 4.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.2 billion -rrb- in loans to teheran , with germany tallying slightly behind with 4.2 billion euros . frustration in the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president bush has accused iranian leaders of stirring up violence in iraq us officials this week gave vent to their mounting frustration , which comes as us president george w. bush has accused iranian leaders of helping to forment the mounting sectarian violence in iraq , fuelling fears that the us could be preparing some kind of military response against tehran . " the european response on the economic side has been pretty weak , " one unnamed senior us official was quoted in the new york times . " we are telling the europeans that they need to go way beyond what they 've done to maximize pressure on iran , " he added . legal concerns this position , however , does not seem to completely reflect the view of the us administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu will address the issue of sanctions against iran in mid-february " i think that the concerns that european governments are expressing have to do with their legal requirements .
they have a set of legal requirements that they have to abide by , " said state department spokesman sean mccormack . " and i 'm not sure i would call that resistance to discussing or cooperating on these various measures . " european union foreign ministers last week agreed to implement the full raft of un sanctions against tehran and deplored " iran 's failure to take the steps repeatedly required by the iaea board of governors and the united nations security council . " a new eu meeting is planned in mid-february to put in place european regulations on the iran sanctions which suspend all exports of materiel and technology to the islamic republic . the un resolution also freezes iranian assets abroad and restricts foreign travel by iranians deemed to be involved in the suspect programs . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran defies sanctions , vows to expand enrichment iran vowed sunday to start work immediately on drastically expanding its capacity to enrich uranium , defying the first un sanctions against the islamic republic 's nuclear program .

"
" otherwise , the church will be left with just one third of its current membership and only fifty percent of its current funds by 2030 , " it warned .
so the alarm bells were ringing when some 300 church representatives and politicians came together for a congress in wittenberg to discuss ways of braking this accelerating trend .
according to the organizers from the ekd , the solution is a slate of reforms designed to usher in a " decade of change " set to culminate on the 500th anniversary of luther 's theses in 2017 .
identity crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what relevance does christ have in today 's world ?
the proposals included cutting back the country 's regional churches from 23 to a maximum of 12 , with the squeeze primarily on traditional , smaller parishes .
in future , the ekd wants to see the congregations of the individual regional churches number at least 1 million - twice the size of many of the smallest existing communities .
but these are n't the main challenges .
the church 's strapped finances are problematic enough , but the congress participants were well aware that far more is at stake than a leaking roof or two .
ultimately , the church knows it needs to reappraise its role and find a new place for faith within contemporary society .
" it 's time for a new departure , " parliamentary deputy speaker katrin göring-eckardt of the green party told the congress .
" and not primarily because of declining membership and lack of funds . "
göring-eckardt dismissed complaints that the ekd treated the church like a business in need of a turn-around by bandying around terms like ' quality control ' and ' quotas , ' and stressed the church 's need to adapt to the times .
" we need a worldly church , not an other-worldly church , " she said .
the business of religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : redefining its role many agree that a bit of business acumen is exactly what the church needs .
the days when even handing around a collection plate was an embarrassing concession to earthly matters are long over , and thies gundlach from the ekd says the church has to become less coy about resorting to best-practice marketing tricks .
" the church would be betraying itself if it behaved like a business , " he said .
" but in the bible , paul says : ' test everything , retain what is good , ' which is a principle that does allow us to learn a few lessons from business and economics - from customer loyalty to promoting the protestant brand - so long as we never forget that the church will never be a company like any other . "
his feelings are shared by swen schönheit , pastor at the apostle petrus church in berlin .
an angular building built in the 1960s , it could n't seem less inviting from the outside , but what it lacks in aesthetics it more than makes up for in atmosphere , defying the national trend by regularly welcoming a full house on sundays .
" what many churches in germany lack is charisma , " he says .
" the church has suffered a loss of spiritual energy , it lacks relevance .
its crisis is a spiritual one not a financial one . "
and it 's no one 's fault but its own , he says .
" society is seeing a boom in religious interest , there 's a renewal of spiritual soul-searching going on in germany , but this is completely passing by the church , and it 's time the church found a way of harnessing it . "
" it has to realize it is in competition with other sources of spirituality within society and get its act together , " he insists .
the new religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many feel the church needs more of a human touch his own church obviously has .
community activities range from children 's dance classes to group summer holidays , while the sunday service kicks off with a house band switching on the electric amplifier as the congregation sings along with the help of a power point show .
but to some , this form of happy-clappy religion is suspiciously reminiscent of the born-again evangelism popular in the us - one which goes hand-in-hand with a christian-right political agenda deeply foreign to secular european sensibilities .
but it 's unlikely german protestants will ever head in this direction .
" traditionally , religious affiliation has been a private matter in germany due to the separation of church and state , " explains urike murmann , pastor at hamburg 's st katherine 's church .

"
" otherwise , the church will be left with just one third of its current membership and only fifty percent of its current funds by 2030 , " it warned .
so the alarm bells were ringing when some 300 church representatives and politicians came together for a congress in wittenberg to discuss ways of braking this accelerating trend .
according to the organizers from the ekd , the solution is a slate of reforms designed to usher in a " decade of change " set to culminate on the 500th anniversary of luther 's theses in 2017 .
identity crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what relevance does christ have in today 's world ?
the proposals included cutting back the country 's regional churches from 23 to a maximum of 12 , with the squeeze primarily on traditional , smaller parishes .
in future , the ekd wants to see the congregations of the individual regional churches number at least 1 million - twice the size of many of the smallest existing communities .
but these are n't the main challenges .
the church 's strapped finances are problematic enough , but the congress participants were well aware that far more is at stake than a leaking roof or two .
ultimately , the church knows it needs to reappraise its role and find a new place for faith within contemporary society .
" it 's time for a new departure , " parliamentary deputy speaker katrin göring-eckardt of the green party told the congress .
" and not primarily because of declining membership and lack of funds . "
göring-eckardt dismissed complaints that the ekd treated the church like a business in need of a turn-around by bandying around terms like ' quality control ' and ' quotas , ' and stressed the church 's need to adapt to the times .
" we need a worldly church , not an other-worldly church , " she said .
the business of religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : redefining its role many agree that a bit of business acumen is exactly what the church needs .
the days when even handing around a collection plate was an embarrassing concession to earthly matters are long over , and thies gundlach from the ekd says the church has to become less coy about resorting to best-practice marketing tricks .
" the church would be betraying itself if it behaved like a business , " he said .
" but in the bible , paul says : ' test everything , retain what is good , ' which is a principle that does allow us to learn a few lessons from business and economics - from customer loyalty to promoting the protestant brand - so long as we never forget that the church will never be a company like any other .

his feelings are shared by swen schönheit , pastor at the apostle petrus church in berlin .

" what many churches in germany lack is charisma , " he says .
" the church has suffered a loss of spiritual energy , it lacks relevance .
its crisis is a spiritual one not a financial one . "
and it 's no one 's fault but its own , he says .
" society is seeing a boom in religious interest , there 's a renewal of spiritual soul-searching going on in germany , but this is completely passing by the church , and it 's time the church found a way of harnessing it . "
" it has to realize it is in competition with other sources of spirituality within society and get its act together , " he insists .

community activities range from children 's dance classes to group summer holidays , while the sunday service kicks off with a house band switching on the electric amplifier as the congregation sings along with the help of a power point show .
but to some , this form of happy-clappy religion is suspiciously reminiscent of the born-again evangelism popular in the us - one which goes hand-in-hand with a christian-right political agenda deeply foreign to secular european sensibilities .
but it 's unlikely german protestants will ever head in this direction .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 01.02.2007 sponsors follow own path in fight against doping großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urine testing is one way to check for illegal substances .
a doping scandal is a nightmare for athletes and fans , but corporate sponsors may be the ones who suffer most .
marketers hope new international rules and corporate vigilance will aid in damage control . on thursday , an international unesco convention on doping goes into effect .
while the agreement is unlikely to put a stop to doping in sports any time soon , it represents the first time that governments around the world have agreed to throw the force of international law behind the problem . " until now , doping cases have been handled by sporting authorities .
this puts it in the countries ' courts of law , " said christoph breuer , a professor of sports management at the athletics college of cologne . the international accord can be seen as a vote of confidence in german 's national anti-doping agency , nada , and its international offshoot , world anti doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- . dancing to their own tune bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich , right , no longer wears the t-mobile jersey .
he was fired amid doping allegations but corporate sponsors , who may have millions riding on the image of cleanliness in sports , have stayed out of the fray , mostly dealing with the issue in their own way . " as far as i know , sponsors have been fairly reluctant to join in the active fight against doping , " said christian sachs , a spokesman for the federal interior ministry committee that supported the un treaty .
" we want to encourage sponsors within the field of sport to contribute to the funding of nada , which they have hardly done up to now . " indeed , corporate sponsors generally take a reactive , not a proactive , stance , said breuer from the athletics college . the upside of scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cycling and track and field are the two sports where doping is said to be rampant " often , when an athlete is first suspected of doping , a corporate sponsor 's first reaction is to stand behind them and protect them , " he said .
" but once the charges are proven , the sponsors often separate from the athlete . " yet , breuer added , there are certain instances in which doping allegations can actually work in a sponsor 's favor : " for an unknown firm , a doping case might serve to boost its profile .
even if its negative publicity , the name will be known . " for the past several years , it has been the norm in the sports marketing world for sponsors to put an escape clause in their contract that ends the sponsorship if an athlete or team is accused or convicted of doping . still , the bad taste of a doping accusation can linger , and become an image nightmare for a company that has the misfortune to back the wrong athletes . the case of jan ullrich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german biathlete thomas oelsner was suspended from the paralympics for alleged doping " this is the most castastrophic thing that can happen in sports sponsoring , and we advise our clients to be very careful before they get into any endorsement contracts , " said stephan schröder , who is on the managing board of the cologne-based sports marketing consultancy sport + markt . schröder cited as an example the case of jan ullrich .
the german cycling star was booted by his sponsor t-mobile after he was implicated in a highly publicized doping investigation shortly before last summer 's tour de france .
after losing his german racing license , ullrich moved to switzerland and has been busy fending off both german and swiss allegations ever since . t-mobile , meanwhile , was saddled with an enormous image problem - which it fought with an intensive public relations offensive , according to schröder . t-mobile reacts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bodybuilders are often said to turn to steroid use " the company took a very aggressive stance and went straight to the press , " schröder added .

it appears germany 's mighty automobile lobby is getting its way in brussels , as the eu moves its regulatory focus from emissions standards to biofuel use across the bloc . germany 's auto lobby might be feeling celebratory these days , though the oil producers may have shed some tears .
the european commission on wednesday suggested tightening fuel ecology standards as a measure toward combating climate change . observers read this as a sign that , in its battle against global warming , brussels is ready to shift its focus away from tighter standards on car motors and onto " greener " fuels by having gas and diesel providers monitoring greenhouse gas emissions during the delivery , refining , and transport of oil . missing the target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany would rather change the fuel than the motor because the auto industry is likely to miss a voluntary goal of cutting carbon dioxide emissions for new cars , european commission president jose manuel barroso and environment commissioner stavros dimas want binding legislation that would require carmakers to reduce new cars ' co2 emissions to an industry average of 120 grams per kilometer in 2012 . in addition , the eu wants to limit the sulfur content of diesel fuel .
instead , a new type of fuel with a higher content of " clean " bioethanol should be developed , the eu said . merkel joins in debate but while the goal of the eu is to lower co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , the german car industry - and german chancellor angela merkel , who has gone to battle in brussels on its behalf - is opposed to blanket measures that would apply to all cars , regardless of their size . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has stepped in to fight for the german car industry on monday , merkel waded into the fray , saying it was " regrettable " that european carmakers would not meet the targets they had set themselves , but adding : " we must not let the result of that be to impose a general obligation for all cars to be subject to the same measure . " merkel added that she would " never " agree to binding limits on makers of bigger cars . michael glos , merkel 's economy minister , also came out in support of the german auto industry on wednesday and accused the commission of following its own industrial agenda . " this is not about environmental policy but hard-nosed industrial policy interests , " he said .
" the european commission 's planned exhaust levels for cars are unacceptable . " the german car lobby has warned that forcing carmakers to modernize their products to meet binding limits would pose a threat to jobs and competitiveness for the german automakers .
the car industry is a major pillar of the german economy . change of focus ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimas is caught between german carmakers and a hard place the eu commission plans present its emissions plan in the coming weeks .
but according to the financial times newspaper , environment commissioner dimas has already given in to german pressure . observers say he is now ready to accept a reduction to 130 grams per kilometer by 2012 , instead of 120 , according to the daily .
the difference would then need to be made up by improvements in development and use of cleaner fuels . eu industry commissioner günter verheugen also agreed with this new plan .
in the case of the auto industry , he said he is in favor of an " integrated approach " to greenhouse gas reduction .
instead of binding emissions limits , verheugen promoted ideas like limiting traffic , improving tires , and cleaner fuels . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel opposed to eu plans for car emissions scheme german chancellor merkel said she would resist attempts from the eu commission to impose caps on auto emissions which would apply to all new cars in the bloc .

"
" otherwise , the church will be left with just one third of its current membership and only fifty percent of its current funds by 2030 , " it warned .
so the alarm bells were ringing when some 300 church representatives and politicians came together for a congress in wittenberg to discuss ways of braking this accelerating trend .
according to the organizers from the ekd , the solution is a slate of reforms designed to usher in a " decade of change " set to culminate on the 500th anniversary of luther 's theses in 2017 .
identity crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what relevance does christ have in today 's world ?
the proposals included cutting back the country 's regional churches from 23 to a maximum of 12 , with the squeeze primarily on traditional , smaller parishes .
in future , the ekd wants to see the congregations of the individual regional churches number at least 1 million - twice the size of many of the smallest existing communities .
but these are n't the main challenges .
the church 's strapped finances are problematic enough , but the congress participants were well aware that far more is at stake than a leaking roof or two .
ultimately , the church knows it needs to reappraise its role and find a new place for faith within contemporary society .
" it 's time for a new departure , " parliamentary deputy speaker katrin göring-eckardt of the green party told the congress .
" and not primarily because of declining membership and lack of funds . "
göring-eckardt dismissed complaints that the ekd treated the church like a business in need of a turn-around by bandying around terms like ' quality control ' and ' quotas , ' and stressed the church 's need to adapt to the times .
" we need a worldly church , not an other-worldly church , " she said .
the business of religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : redefining its role many agree that a bit of business acumen is exactly what the church needs .
the days when even handing around a collection plate was an embarrassing concession to earthly matters are long over , and thies gundlach from the ekd says the church has to become less coy about resorting to best-practice marketing tricks .
" the church would be betraying itself if it behaved like a business , " he said .
" but in the bible , paul says : ' test everything , retain what is good , ' which is a principle that does allow us to learn a few lessons from business and economics - from customer loyalty to promoting the protestant brand - so long as we never forget that the church will never be a company like any other .

" what many churches in germany lack is charisma , " he says .
" the church has suffered a loss of spiritual energy , it lacks relevance .
its crisis is a spiritual one not a financial one . "
and it 's no one 's fault but its own , he says .
" society is seeing a boom in religious interest , there 's a renewal of spiritual soul-searching going on in germany , but this is completely passing by the church , and it 's time the church found a way of harnessing it . "
" it has to realize it is in competition with other sources of spirituality within society and get its act together , " he insists .

community activities range from children 's dance classes to group summer holidays , while the sunday service kicks off with a house band switching on the electric amplifier as the congregation sings along with the help of a power point show .
but to some , this form of happy-clappy religion is suspiciously reminiscent of the born-again evangelism popular in the us - one which goes hand-in-hand with a christian-right political agenda deeply foreign to secular european sensibilities .
but it 's unlikely german protestants will ever head in this direction .
" traditionally , religious affiliation has been a private matter in germany due to the separation of church and state , " explains urike murmann , pastor at hamburg 's st katherine 's church .
that said , she does believe a dose of showmanship never goes amiss .
" going to church should be cheerful , it should be fun , " she says .
" we 've seen that people respond very well when we offer music or theatre . "
but she also knows where to draw the line .
" of course , if it descended into a superficial entertainment , that would be terrible . "
her main emphasis is on the community role of the church , and she says that it 's already learning how to be more aware of parish needs .
" in hamburg , we look carefully at what our congregation wants and we tailor our activities accordingly .
we know we need to do more than just lecture people . "
but even though a number of churches across the country are managing to fill their pews by offering a new and improved form of protestantism , their popularity is failing to translate into church membership .

ultimately , the church knows it needs to reappraise its role and find a new place for faith within contemporary society .
" it 's time for a new departure , " parliamentary deputy speaker katrin göring-eckardt of the green party told the congress .
" and not primarily because of declining membership and lack of funds . "
göring-eckardt dismissed complaints that the ekd treated the church like a business in need of a turn-around by bandying around terms like ' quality control ' and ' quotas , ' and stressed the church 's need to adapt to the times .
" we need a worldly church , not an other-worldly church , " she said .
the business of religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : redefining its role many agree that a bit of business acumen is exactly what the church needs .
the days when even handing around a collection plate was an embarrassing concession to earthly matters are long over , and thies gundlach from the ekd says the church has to become less coy about resorting to best-practice marketing tricks .
" the church would be betraying itself if it behaved like a business , " he said .
" but in the bible , paul says : ' test everything , retain what is good , ' which is a principle that does allow us to learn a few lessons from business and economics - from customer loyalty to promoting the protestant brand - so long as we never forget that the church will never be a company like any other . "
his feelings are shared by swen schönheit , pastor at the apostle petrus church in berlin .
an angular building built in the 1960s , it could n't seem less inviting from the outside , but what it lacks in aesthetics it more than makes up for in atmosphere , defying the national trend by regularly welcoming a full house on sundays .
" what many churches in germany lack is charisma , " he says .
" the church has suffered a loss of spiritual energy , it lacks relevance .
its crisis is a spiritual one not a financial one . "
and it 's no one 's fault but its own , he says .
" society is seeing a boom in religious interest , there 's a renewal of spiritual soul-searching going on in germany , but this is completely passing by the church , and it 's time the church found a way of harnessing it . "
" it has to realize it is in competition with other sources of spirituality within society and get its act together , " he insists .
the new religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many feel the church needs more of a human touch his own church obviously has .
community activities range from children 's dance classes to group summer holidays , while the sunday service kicks off with a house band switching on the electric amplifier as the congregation sings along with the help of a power point show .
but to some , this form of happy-clappy religion is suspiciously reminiscent of the born-again evangelism popular in the us - one which goes hand-in-hand with a christian-right political agenda deeply foreign to secular european sensibilities .
but it 's unlikely german protestants will ever head in this direction .
" traditionally , religious affiliation has been a private matter in germany due to the separation of church and state , " explains urike murmann , pastor at hamburg 's st katherine 's church .
that said , she does believe a dose of showmanship never goes amiss .
" going to church should be cheerful , it should be fun , " she says .
" we 've seen that people respond very well when we offer music or theatre . "
but she also knows where to draw the line .
" of course , if it descended into a superficial entertainment , that would be terrible . "
her main emphasis is on the community role of the church , and she says that it 's already learning how to be more aware of parish needs .
" in hamburg , we look carefully at what our congregation wants and we tailor our activities accordingly .
we know we need to do more than just lecture people . "
but even though a number of churches across the country are managing to fill their pews by offering a new and improved form of protestantism , their popularity is failing to translate into church membership .
attending church is one thing , actually joining is another .
and the reasons might be purely mundane .
the spirit is willing , one might say , but the flesh is weak .
" the church tax is a stumbling block , " says murmann .
" it 's not easy to persuade people it 's valid .
furthermore , there 's been a growing skepticism towards institutions in recent years .
people do n't join political parties , they do n't join unions .
the church is no exception . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reformers turn up heat on church critics have been present at world youth day , bringing up issues such as the role of women , family planning and gay rights .

" as far as i know , sponsors have been fairly reluctant to join in the active fight against doping , " said christian sachs , a spokesman for the federal interior ministry committee that supported the un treaty .
" we want to encourage sponsors within the field of sport to contribute to the funding of nada , which they have hardly done up to now . " indeed , corporate sponsors generally take a reactive , not a proactive , stance , said breuer from the athletics college . the upside of scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cycling and track and field are the two sports where doping is said to be rampant " often , when an athlete is first suspected of doping , a corporate sponsor 's first reaction is to stand behind them and protect them , " he said .
" but once the charges are proven , the sponsors often separate from the athlete . " yet , breuer added , there are certain instances in which doping allegations can actually work in a sponsor 's favor : " for an unknown firm , a doping case might serve to boost its profile .
even if its negative publicity , the name will be known . " for the past several years , it has been the norm in the sports marketing world for sponsors to put an escape clause in their contract that ends the sponsorship if an athlete or team is accused or convicted of doping . still , the bad taste of a doping accusation can linger , and become an image nightmare for a company that has the misfortune to back the wrong athletes . the case of jan ullrich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german biathlete thomas oelsner was suspended from the paralympics for alleged doping " this is the most castastrophic thing that can happen in sports sponsoring , and we advise our clients to be very careful before they get into any endorsement contracts , " said stephan schröder , who is on the managing board of the cologne-based sports marketing consultancy sport + markt . schröder cited as an example the case of jan ullrich .
the german cycling star was booted by his sponsor t-mobile after he was implicated in a highly publicized doping investigation shortly before last summer 's tour de france .
after losing his german racing license , ullrich moved to switzerland and has been busy fending off both german and swiss allegations ever since . t-mobile , meanwhile , was saddled with an enormous image problem - which it fought with an intensive public relations offensive , according to schröder . t-mobile reacts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bodybuilders are often said to turn to steroid use " the company took a very aggressive stance and went straight to the press , " schröder added .
" they distanced themselves from ullrich , and said they were working hard to clean up the image of the rest of the team . " indeed , shortly after the ullrich scandal broke , t-mobile announced plans to take a " tough stance in the fight against doping " by putting a german physician in charge of the team and " consistently evaluating and monitoring the training methods " of the riders .
t-mobile also committed some financial support to the anti-doping agency nada , among other measures . according to schröder , " actively supporting the image of fair play in sports " could be a good solution to the problem sponsors are faced with when fighting an image soiled by doping allegations . pr vs marketing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agony and the extasy : a sponsor 's image is linked to that of its star athletes but others say it is unlikely that voluntary funding for anti-doping agencies would ever take an important role in corporate image building . " companies have two marketing goals when they go into corporate sports sponsorship : becoming better known , and improving their image .
funding nada and wada would fall more under social sponsoring , and pr , than sports sponsoring , " cologne athletic college 's breuer said . " you ca n't expect companies to invest in that , it would n't be an efficient way of meeting their goals , " he added . but wouldn ’ t the entire sporting world benefit from cleaner sports all around ? in principle , yes , said breuer .
but in business , he added , " people tend to think in the short term , not the long term .

the hamburger morgenpost reported thursday that magath would take over at hsv .
a team spokesman , however , said there was " nothing to report . " back in bavaria , hitzfeld , who in his first spell as bayern manager led them to four titles and the champions league crown , takes over a team lying fourth and struggling to qualify for the champions league next season . werder turned up the pressure on the 20-time champions with a 2-0 win over bayer leverkusen , with german international striker miroslav klose joining serb marko pantelic at the top of the bundesliga scoring charts with 11 goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke squeaked past aachen to stay tied for first schalke 04 , in second also on 42 points , scraped through their home clash with aachen 2-1 . in other action on wednesday vfb stuttgart maintained third place with a 3-2 win over ninth-placed arminia bielfeld . hamburg are propping up the league after a disappointing 1-1 draw with energie cottbus , while mainz beat dortmund 1-0 and left the bundesliga basement . bayern suffer long fall bayern players received an angry dressing-down from now former coach felix magath after the defeat in dortmund .
he warned his charges that anything less than victory against bochum would spell the end of the title chances - and probably guessed it would be the end of his own as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath 's enthusiasm was n't enough to help bayern - or save his own job bayern took to the field at the allianz arena seemingly toiling under the weight of those words , passing erratically and in accurately in the early exchanges .
it took the bavarians well over half an hour to find any kind of rhythm , with bastian schweinsteiger showing one of the rare pieces of skill in the first half to release dutch midfielder mark van bommel .
but " schweini " then had to watch the dutchman rush his shot , which bochum keeper jaroslav drobny saved easily . disgruntled fans display their anger bayern offered little threat against their relegation-threatened opponents in the second-half and were jeered off the pitch at the end , their fans obviously disgusted with the drab performance that saw the champions unable to break down a bochum side who had been beaten 1-0 at home by bottom side mainz on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli kahn shows the direction bayern should be going " we 're very disappointed , obviously , " bayern goalkeeper and captain oliver kahn told arena tv .

" we had messed up in our first game at the weekend so we had to show our fans we could play the second half of the season as we did the first , " gomez said .
" we had good chances in both halves so i think the victory was deserved . " mid-table teams held in stalemates elsewhere , wolfsburg and eintracht frankfurt shared the spoils in a 2-2 draw .

"
" otherwise , the church will be left with just one third of its current membership and only fifty percent of its current funds by 2030 , " it warned .
so the alarm bells were ringing when some 300 church representatives and politicians came together for a congress in wittenberg to discuss ways of braking this accelerating trend .
according to the organizers from the ekd , the solution is a slate of reforms designed to usher in a " decade of change " set to culminate on the 500th anniversary of luther 's theses in 2017 .
identity crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what relevance does christ have in today 's world ?
the proposals included cutting back the country 's regional churches from 23 to a maximum of 12 , with the squeeze primarily on traditional , smaller parishes .
in future , the ekd wants to see the congregations of the individual regional churches number at least 1 million - twice the size of many of the smallest existing communities .
but these are n't the main challenges .
the church 's strapped finances are problematic enough , but the congress participants were well aware that far more is at stake than a leaking roof or two .
ultimately , the church knows it needs to reappraise its role and find a new place for faith within contemporary society .
" it 's time for a new departure , " parliamentary deputy speaker katrin göring-eckardt of the green party told the congress .
" and not primarily because of declining membership and lack of funds . "
göring-eckardt dismissed complaints that the ekd treated the church like a business in need of a turn-around by bandying around terms like ' quality control ' and ' quotas , ' and stressed the church 's need to adapt to the times .
" we need a worldly church , not an other-worldly church , " she said .
the business of religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : redefining its role many agree that a bit of business acumen is exactly what the church needs .
the days when even handing around a collection plate was an embarrassing concession to earthly matters are long over , and thies gundlach from the ekd says the church has to become less coy about resorting to best-practice marketing tricks .
" the church would be betraying itself if it behaved like a business , " he said .
" but in the bible , paul says : ' test everything , retain what is good , ' which is a principle that does allow us to learn a few lessons from business and economics - from customer loyalty to promoting the protestant brand - so long as we never forget that the church will never be a company like any other . "
his feelings are shared by swen schönheit , pastor at the apostle petrus church in berlin .
an angular building built in the 1960s , it could n't seem less inviting from the outside , but what it lacks in aesthetics it more than makes up for in atmosphere , defying the national trend by regularly welcoming a full house on sundays .
" what many churches in germany lack is charisma , " he says .
" the church has suffered a loss of spiritual energy , it lacks relevance .
its crisis is a spiritual one not a financial one . "
and it 's no one 's fault but its own , he says .
" society is seeing a boom in religious interest , there 's a renewal of spiritual soul-searching going on in germany , but this is completely passing by the church , and it 's time the church found a way of harnessing it . "
" it has to realize it is in competition with other sources of spirituality within society and get its act together , " he insists .
the new religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many feel the church needs more of a human touch his own church obviously has .
community activities range from children 's dance classes to group summer holidays , while the sunday service kicks off with a house band switching on the electric amplifier as the congregation sings along with the help of a power point show .
but to some , this form of happy-clappy religion is suspiciously reminiscent of the born-again evangelism popular in the us - one which goes hand-in-hand with a christian-right political agenda deeply foreign to secular european sensibilities .
but it 's unlikely german protestants will ever head in this direction .
" traditionally , religious affiliation has been a private matter in germany due to the separation of church and state , " explains urike murmann , pastor at hamburg 's st katherine 's church .
that said , she does believe a dose of showmanship never goes amiss .
" going to church should be cheerful , it should be fun , " she says .
" we 've seen that people respond very well when we offer music or theatre . "
but she also knows where to draw the line .
" of course , if it descended into a superficial entertainment , that would be terrible . "
her main emphasis is on the community role of the church , and she says that it 's already learning how to be more aware of parish needs .
" in hamburg , we look carefully at what our congregation wants and we tailor our activities accordingly .
we know we need to do more than just lecture people . "
but even though a number of churches across the country are managing to fill their pews by offering a new and improved form of protestantism , their popularity is failing to translate into church membership .
attending church is one thing , actually joining is another .
and the reasons might be purely mundane .
the spirit is willing , one might say , but the flesh is weak .
" the church tax is a stumbling block , " says murmann .
" it 's not easy to persuade people it 's valid .
furthermore , there 's been a growing skepticism towards institutions in recent years .
people do n't join political parties , they do n't join unions .

he is joined by newcomer mario gomez and a host of returning stars . germany coach joachim löw was in frankfurt at the weekend to see the 24-year-old kuranyi net a brace in the 3-1 victory over eintracht frankfurt to help his side stay joint top of the bundesliga with werder bremen . " kevin has shown shortly before the winter break and now since the bundesliga restarted that his form is improving , " said löw . kuranyi last played for germany in november 2005 in the scoreless draw against france in paris and failed to make his country 's world cup squad .
his club form took a dive soon after joining schalke from stuttgart in 2005 , scoring just 10 goals in 30 appearances for the club .
by the end of the world cup season , kuranyi 's body language spoke of a striker running on empty . kuranyi 's world cup nightmare dissipating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi 's world cup pain was obvious but since the beginning of this current season , with his world cup disappointment behind him , kuranyi has bagged on average a goal every other game and is looking decidedly more confident . the competition for places up front for germany got even hotter with the announcement that löw was also calling up stuttgart 's in-form striker mario gomez for the switzerland game . a product of the stuttgart youth system , gomez has hit ten goals in 18 games for stuttgart and has been integral in the southern club 's push for the champions league places , a surge that saw them set an early pace at the top of the league . germany coach löw was watching on tuesday night when the 22-year-old scored a brace against arminia bielefeld , fuelling rumors that a place in the national squad was being considered . klose a shoe-in , but poldi 's form raises questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's main strikers are experiencing different luck while first choice striker miroslav klose is firing on all cylinders for high-scoring league leaders werder bremen , lukas podolski , klose 's usual international partner in attack , is fairing less favorably at bayern munich . podolski has just one goal to his name this season in his sporadic appearances for the champions .
while löw is known to have great faith in podolski , the striker 's current club form may raise some questions in the future which the coach may find hard to ignore .
the topic of podolski 's inclusion is a mute point however as he is suspended for the switzerland friendly . with kuranyi and gomez entering the equation , löw may be tempted to experiment against the swiss at some point during the 90 minutes , especially as borussia mönchengladbach 's veteran striker oliver neuville will be missing through injury . return of the formerly walking wounded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi löw rings the changes löw also said he we has happy to name borussia dortmund 's christoph metzelder and werder bremen 's tim borowski in the squad and said that borowski was likely to start against the swiss . the same goes for teammate per mertesacker , who makes his return to the german squad for the first time since last summer 's world cup following his achilles operation last autumn . " per will definitely return , " said löw .

the hamburger morgenpost reported thursday that magath would take over at hsv .
a team spokesman , however , said there was " nothing to report . " back in bavaria , hitzfeld , who in his first spell as bayern manager led them to four titles and the champions league crown , takes over a team lying fourth and struggling to qualify for the champions league next season . werder turned up the pressure on the 20-time champions with a 2-0 win over bayer leverkusen , with german international striker miroslav klose joining serb marko pantelic at the top of the bundesliga scoring charts with 11 goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke squeaked past aachen to stay tied for first schalke 04 , in second also on 42 points , scraped through their home clash with aachen 2-1 . in other action on wednesday vfb stuttgart maintained third place with a 3-2 win over ninth-placed arminia bielfeld . hamburg are propping up the league after a disappointing 1-1 draw with energie cottbus , while mainz beat dortmund 1-0 and left the bundesliga basement . bayern suffer long fall bayern players received an angry dressing-down from now former coach felix magath after the defeat in dortmund .
he warned his charges that anything less than victory against bochum would spell the end of the title chances - and probably guessed it would be the end of his own as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath 's enthusiasm was n't enough to help bayern - or save his own job bayern took to the field at the allianz arena seemingly toiling under the weight of those words , passing erratically and in accurately in the early exchanges .
it took the bavarians well over half an hour to find any kind of rhythm , with bastian schweinsteiger showing one of the rare pieces of skill in the first half to release dutch midfielder mark van bommel .
but " schweini " then had to watch the dutchman rush his shot , which bochum keeper jaroslav drobny saved easily . disgruntled fans display their anger bayern offered little threat against their relegation-threatened opponents in the second-half and were jeered off the pitch at the end , their fans obviously disgusted with the drab performance that saw the champions unable to break down a bochum side who had been beaten 1-0 at home by bottom side mainz on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli kahn shows the direction bayern should be going " we 're very disappointed , obviously , " bayern goalkeeper and captain oliver kahn told arena tv .
" we have to realize we do n't have a season ticket for first place .
it all looks very bad at the moment . " chairman karl-heinz rummenigge left the stadium saying he did not want to comment .
" i 'm saying nothing now .
i have to sleep on it first , " he said . stuttgart recover to claim third place meanwhile vfb stuttgart , who had been beaten 4-1 at nuremberg on saturday , overtook bayern with a 3-2 victory over arminia bielefeld to move third in the table on 35 points . striker mario gomez scored twice in front of the watching german national team coach joachim löw to boost his chances of a first full international team call-up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario gomez has caught the eye of the national coach gomez opened the stuttgart account with a close-range header in the ninth minute and notched his second and stuttgart 's third in the 59th minute shortly after shooting over an open goal from two meters . strike partner cacau , who had set up the first goal , was on target with a header from a free-kick by pavel pardo seven minutes after the break . christian eigler had leveled for bielefeld with a fine finish from the edge of the area in the 26th minute , and substitute abdelaziz ahanfouf converted from the penalty spot four minutes from time . " we had messed up in our first game at the weekend so we had to show our fans we could play the second half of the season as we did the first , " gomez said .
" we had good chances in both halves so i think the victory was deserved . " mid-table teams held in stalemates elsewhere , wolfsburg and eintracht frankfurt shared the spoils in a 2-2 draw .
diego fernando klimowicz in the eighth minute and mike hanke with a header in the 73rd were on target for the wolves either side of goals in the 63rd and 69th minutes from michael thurk and alexander meier . in the other tuesday night game , struggling borussia mönchengladbach and mid-table nuremberg played out drab 0-0 draw . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern search for replacements as departures draw near the season is only half-way through and yet a number of bayern munich 's midfielders are looking for new clubs .

"
" otherwise , the church will be left with just one third of its current membership and only fifty percent of its current funds by 2030 , " it warned .
so the alarm bells were ringing when some 300 church representatives and politicians came together for a congress in wittenberg to discuss ways of braking this accelerating trend .
according to the organizers from the ekd , the solution is a slate of reforms designed to usher in a " decade of change " set to culminate on the 500th anniversary of luther 's theses in 2017 .
identity crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what relevance does christ have in today 's world ?
the proposals included cutting back the country 's regional churches from 23 to a maximum of 12 , with the squeeze primarily on traditional , smaller parishes .
in future , the ekd wants to see the congregations of the individual regional churches number at least 1 million - twice the size of many of the smallest existing communities .
but these are n't the main challenges .
the church 's strapped finances are problematic enough , but the congress participants were well aware that far more is at stake than a leaking roof or two .
ultimately , the church knows it needs to reappraise its role and find a new place for faith within contemporary society .
" it 's time for a new departure , " parliamentary deputy speaker katrin göring-eckardt of the green party told the congress .
" and not primarily because of declining membership and lack of funds . "
göring-eckardt dismissed complaints that the ekd treated the church like a business in need of a turn-around by bandying around terms like ' quality control ' and ' quotas , ' and stressed the church 's need to adapt to the times .
" we need a worldly church , not an other-worldly church , " she said .
the business of religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : redefining its role many agree that a bit of business acumen is exactly what the church needs .
the days when even handing around a collection plate was an embarrassing concession to earthly matters are long over , and thies gundlach from the ekd says the church has to become less coy about resorting to best-practice marketing tricks .
" the church would be betraying itself if it behaved like a business , " he said .
" but in the bible , paul says : ' test everything , retain what is good , ' which is a principle that does allow us to learn a few lessons from business and economics - from customer loyalty to promoting the protestant brand - so long as we never forget that the church will never be a company like any other . "
his feelings are shared by swen schönheit , pastor at the apostle petrus church in berlin .
an angular building built in the 1960s , it could n't seem less inviting from the outside , but what it lacks in aesthetics it more than makes up for in atmosphere , defying the national trend by regularly welcoming a full house on sundays .
" what many churches in germany lack is charisma , " he says .
" the church has suffered a loss of spiritual energy , it lacks relevance .
its crisis is a spiritual one not a financial one . "
and it 's no one 's fault but its own , he says .
" society is seeing a boom in religious interest , there 's a renewal of spiritual soul-searching going on in germany , but this is completely passing by the church , and it 's time the church found a way of harnessing it . "
" it has to realize it is in competition with other sources of spirituality within society and get its act together , " he insists .

community activities range from children 's dance classes to group summer holidays , while the sunday service kicks off with a house band switching on the electric amplifier as the congregation sings along with the help of a power point show .
but to some , this form of happy-clappy religion is suspiciously reminiscent of the born-again evangelism popular in the us - one which goes hand-in-hand with a christian-right political agenda deeply foreign to secular european sensibilities .
but it 's unlikely german protestants will ever head in this direction .
" traditionally , religious affiliation has been a private matter in germany due to the separation of church and state , " explains urike murmann , pastor at hamburg 's st katherine 's church .
that said , she does believe a dose of showmanship never goes amiss .
" going to church should be cheerful , it should be fun , " she says .
" we 've seen that people respond very well when we offer music or theatre . "
but she also knows where to draw the line .
" of course , if it descended into a superficial entertainment , that would be terrible . "
her main emphasis is on the community role of the church , and she says that it 's already learning how to be more aware of parish needs .
" in hamburg , we look carefully at what our congregation wants and we tailor our activities accordingly .
we know we need to do more than just lecture people . "
but even though a number of churches across the country are managing to fill their pews by offering a new and improved form of protestantism , their popularity is failing to translate into church membership .
attending church is one thing , actually joining is another .
and the reasons might be purely mundane .
the spirit is willing , one might say , but the flesh is weak .
" the church tax is a stumbling block , " says murmann .
" it 's not easy to persuade people it 's valid .

the hamburger morgenpost reported thursday that magath would take over at hsv .
a team spokesman , however , said there was " nothing to report . " back in bavaria , hitzfeld , who in his first spell as bayern manager led them to four titles and the champions league crown , takes over a team lying fourth and struggling to qualify for the champions league next season . werder turned up the pressure on the 20-time champions with a 2-0 win over bayer leverkusen , with german international striker miroslav klose joining serb marko pantelic at the top of the bundesliga scoring charts with 11 goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke squeaked past aachen to stay tied for first schalke 04 , in second also on 42 points , scraped through their home clash with aachen 2-1 . in other action on wednesday vfb stuttgart maintained third place with a 3-2 win over ninth-placed arminia bielfeld . hamburg are propping up the league after a disappointing 1-1 draw with energie cottbus , while mainz beat dortmund 1-0 and left the bundesliga basement . bayern suffer long fall bayern players received an angry dressing-down from now former coach felix magath after the defeat in dortmund .
he warned his charges that anything less than victory against bochum would spell the end of the title chances - and probably guessed it would be the end of his own as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath 's enthusiasm was n't enough to help bayern - or save his own job bayern took to the field at the allianz arena seemingly toiling under the weight of those words , passing erratically and in accurately in the early exchanges .
it took the bavarians well over half an hour to find any kind of rhythm , with bastian schweinsteiger showing one of the rare pieces of skill in the first half to release dutch midfielder mark van bommel .
but " schweini " then had to watch the dutchman rush his shot , which bochum keeper jaroslav drobny saved easily . disgruntled fans display their anger bayern offered little threat against their relegation-threatened opponents in the second-half and were jeered off the pitch at the end , their fans obviously disgusted with the drab performance that saw the champions unable to break down a bochum side who had been beaten 1-0 at home by bottom side mainz on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli kahn shows the direction bayern should be going " we 're very disappointed , obviously , " bayern goalkeeper and captain oliver kahn told arena tv .
" we have to realize we do n't have a season ticket for first place .

the hamburger morgenpost reported thursday that magath would take over at hsv .
a team spokesman , however , said there was " nothing to report . " back in bavaria , hitzfeld , who in his first spell as bayern manager led them to four titles and the champions league crown , takes over a team lying fourth and struggling to qualify for the champions league next season . werder turned up the pressure on the 20-time champions with a 2-0 win over bayer leverkusen , with german international striker miroslav klose joining serb marko pantelic at the top of the bundesliga scoring charts with 11 goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke squeaked past aachen to stay tied for first schalke 04 , in second also on 42 points , scraped through their home clash with aachen 2-1 . in other action on wednesday vfb stuttgart maintained third place with a 3-2 win over ninth-placed arminia bielfeld . hamburg are propping up the league after a disappointing 1-1 draw with energie cottbus , while mainz beat dortmund 1-0 and left the bundesliga basement . bayern suffer long fall bayern players received an angry dressing-down from now former coach felix magath after the defeat in dortmund .
he warned his charges that anything less than victory against bochum would spell the end of the title chances - and probably guessed it would be the end of his own as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath 's enthusiasm was n't enough to help bayern - or save his own job bayern took to the field at the allianz arena seemingly toiling under the weight of those words , passing erratically and in accurately in the early exchanges .
it took the bavarians well over half an hour to find any kind of rhythm , with bastian schweinsteiger showing one of the rare pieces of skill in the first half to release dutch midfielder mark van bommel .
but " schweini " then had to watch the dutchman rush his shot , which bochum keeper jaroslav drobny saved easily . disgruntled fans display their anger bayern offered little threat against their relegation-threatened opponents in the second-half and were jeered off the pitch at the end , their fans obviously disgusted with the drab performance that saw the champions unable to break down a bochum side who had been beaten 1-0 at home by bottom side mainz on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli kahn shows the direction bayern should be going " we 're very disappointed , obviously , " bayern goalkeeper and captain oliver kahn told arena tv .
" we have to realize we do n't have a season ticket for first place .

it appears germany 's mighty automobile lobby is getting its way in brussels , as the eu moves its regulatory focus from emissions standards to biofuel use across the bloc . germany 's auto lobby might be feeling celebratory these days , though the oil producers may have shed some tears .
the european commission on wednesday suggested tightening fuel ecology standards as a measure toward combating climate change . observers read this as a sign that , in its battle against global warming , brussels is ready to shift its focus away from tighter standards on car motors and onto " greener " fuels by having gas and diesel providers monitoring greenhouse gas emissions during the delivery , refining , and transport of oil . missing the target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany would rather change the fuel than the motor because the auto industry is likely to miss a voluntary goal of cutting carbon dioxide emissions for new cars , european commission president jose manuel barroso and environment commissioner stavros dimas want binding legislation that would require carmakers to reduce new cars ' co2 emissions to an industry average of 120 grams per kilometer in 2012 . in addition , the eu wants to limit the sulfur content of diesel fuel .

separately , hamburg says it will take a share in a consortium buying a stake in parent company eads . amid reports that the world 's largest plane maker , airbus , is planning a tough cost-cutting operation , the german city-state of hamburg confirmed thursday that it will take a 10-percent share in a consortium acquiring the 7.5-percent stake in parent company eads .
the stake is being sold by german-us auto giant , daimlerchrysler . based on the current share price of 25.83 euros -lrb- $ 33.6 -rrb- , hamburg 's stake would be worth 160 million euros.the two neighboring north german states of lower saxony and bremen have already signaled their intention to invest 80 million euros and 30 million euros respectively in the acquisition of the stake . germany is currently represented in eads via a 22.5-percent share held by daimlerchrysler . all countries will be " equally unhappy " germany 's oldenburg-based newspaper nordwest zeitung reported thursday that thomas enders , co-chief of the eads , which fully owns airbus , had said the france-based plane maker would sell off production sites . in an earlier online report , the paper said enders only planned to keep those airbus plants involved in the final assembly or those that make components .
other manufacturing sites would be sold to trim bloated personnel costs and some 10,000 airbus jobs would be axed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads co- head thomas enders has hinted at painul cost-cutting " nobody in germany will be happy about what will be decided , " the paper quoted enders as saying .
but he also said he expected " everybody will be equally unhappy " in all the countries that are home to airbus plants . addressing some 300 guests - including german parliamentarians and representatives of the aviation industry - at the lower saxony embassy in berlin on wednesday , enders spoke of tough cuts in order to push through a restructuring program called " power 8 , " which aims to lower costs and make airbus more competitive for the future . enders , however , is said to have played down fears that airbus production sites in germany would be affected .
" there are no decisions at this point , " enders was quoted to have said . eads says it 's all speculation but spokesman for airbus parent company eads , michael hauger told ap news agency that though enders had spoken of " tough cuts , " he had also stressed that the rumors about job cuts and closing of production plants were pure speculation . hauger added that airbus management was still looking into the " power 8 " program , which would then have to be presented to eads bosses enders and louis gallois before the company 's supervisory board could have its final say . " everything that you hear before that is speculation , " hauger said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2,000 to 4,000 jobs could be axed at the airbus plant in hamburg but reports of massive job losses and the closing down of entire production plants are already doing the rounds in germany . horst niehus , a works council leader at the company 's hamburg factory told union members in a memo that the toulouse-based plane maker may sell manufacturing sites , buy more parts from outside suppliers and move work now done in germany to france . " should all scenarios be realized , it is expected that 5,000 through 8,000 jobs will be lost at airbus germany and 2,000 through 4,000 at hamburg , " niehus said in the report . airbus plans to slash 2.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.7 billion -rrb- from annual costs by 2010 .
eads has said the plane maker will record its first full-year loss ever for 2006 because of cost overruns on its a380 , which is at least two years behind schedule . minister says germany will fight to save jobs german economics minister michael glos said wednesday he will insist on a fair distribution of the burden resulting from airbus ' restructuring measures . " i will do everything possible to call on the french partner and those who run airbus to make sure that any job cuts will be in both countries and not to the disadvantage of german sites , " glos said .
" i will listen to the worries and help wherever i can within a government framework . " germany must get a share in present and future production that corresponds with its weight -lrb- in the company -rrb- , " he added .
" the german government will lobby for the german business location with all its power - also in its role as one of eads ' biggest contractors .

separately , hamburg says it will take a share in a consortium buying a stake in parent company eads . amid reports that the world 's largest plane maker , airbus , is planning a tough cost-cutting operation , the german city-state of hamburg confirmed thursday that it will take a 10-percent share in a consortium acquiring the 7.5-percent stake in parent company eads .
the stake is being sold by german-us auto giant , daimlerchrysler . based on the current share price of 25.83 euros -lrb- $ 33.6 -rrb- , hamburg 's stake would be worth 160 million euros.the two neighboring north german states of lower saxony and bremen have already signaled their intention to invest 80 million euros and 30 million euros respectively in the acquisition of the stake . germany is currently represented in eads via a 22.5-percent share held by daimlerchrysler . all countries will be " equally unhappy " germany 's oldenburg-based newspaper nordwest zeitung reported thursday that thomas enders , co-chief of the eads , which fully owns airbus , had said the france-based plane maker would sell off production sites . in an earlier online report , the paper said enders only planned to keep those airbus plants involved in the final assembly or those that make components .
other manufacturing sites would be sold to trim bloated personnel costs and some 10,000 airbus jobs would be axed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads co- head thomas enders has hinted at painul cost-cutting " nobody in germany will be happy about what will be decided , " the paper quoted enders as saying .
but he also said he expected " everybody will be equally unhappy " in all the countries that are home to airbus plants . addressing some 300 guests - including german parliamentarians and representatives of the aviation industry - at the lower saxony embassy in berlin on wednesday , enders spoke of tough cuts in order to push through a restructuring program called " power 8 , " which aims to lower costs and make airbus more competitive for the future . enders , however , is said to have played down fears that airbus production sites in germany would be affected .
" there are no decisions at this point , " enders was quoted to have said . eads says it 's all speculation but spokesman for airbus parent company eads , michael hauger told ap news agency that though enders had spoken of " tough cuts , " he had also stressed that the rumors about job cuts and closing of production plants were pure speculation . hauger added that airbus management was still looking into the " power 8 " program , which would then have to be presented to eads bosses enders and louis gallois before the company 's supervisory board could have its final say . " everything that you hear before that is speculation , " hauger said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2,000 to 4,000 jobs could be axed at the airbus plant in hamburg but reports of massive job losses and the closing down of entire production plants are already doing the rounds in germany . horst niehus , a works council leader at the company 's hamburg factory told union members in a memo that the toulouse-based plane maker may sell manufacturing sites , buy more parts from outside suppliers and move work now done in germany to france . " should all scenarios be realized , it is expected that 5,000 through 8,000 jobs will be lost at airbus germany and 2,000 through 4,000 at hamburg , " niehus said in the report . airbus plans to slash 2.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.7 billion -rrb- from annual costs by 2010 .
eads has said the plane maker will record its first full-year loss ever for 2006 because of cost overruns on its a380 , which is at least two years behind schedule . minister says germany will fight to save jobs german economics minister michael glos said wednesday he will insist on a fair distribution of the burden resulting from airbus ' restructuring measures . " i will do everything possible to call on the french partner and those who run airbus to make sure that any job cuts will be in both countries and not to the disadvantage of german sites , " glos said .
" i will listen to the worries and help wherever i can within a government framework . " germany must get a share in present and future production that corresponds with its weight -lrb- in the company -rrb- , " he added .
" the german government will lobby for the german business location with all its power - also in its role as one of eads ' biggest contractors .

" if we continue along the current path , the present fragmented industrial bases in europe will not be sustainable , " verheugen told a defense conference in brussels . verheugen stressed that the european defense sector in its current form was riddled with inefficiency and national protectionism .
maintaining national control in the defence sector has pushed the prices up and undermined the future of the 300,000 jobs in defense manufacturing across the eu . " it means a lack of competition , an inability to exploit economies of scale and , above all , poor value for money for european taxpayers , " he said . opening up the borders even though eu governments agreed last year to open up markets to more cross-border competition last year , the defense-related industries have been largely kept out of the remit of the internal market . the 27-nation block , for instance , has 23 distinct national programs for building armored fighting vehicles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union foreign policy chief javier solana " cross-border competition in a continental-sized market is essential , " eu foreign policy chief jaiver solana told the conference .
" this is a matter on which its -lrb- the industry 's -rrb- survival rests . " the eu commission is expected to propose a new legislation later this year that would open the 30 billion euro -lrb- $ 39 billion -rrb- defense market to more cross-national competition .
it would also remove the need for eu exporters to obtain security licenses for exporting defense-related goods to other eu nations . at the moment , around 12,000 requests for such licenses are filed every year .
in view of the close military cooperation between eu governments , only 15 licenses were refused in 2003 , and none in 2004 and 2005 . " on the government side , we must combine our requirements so as to offer industry projects with a worthwhile economy of scale .
and we must encourage the restructuring and consolidation of the supply side as well , " solana said . trans-atlantic competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commissioner for enterprise and industry günter verheugen verheugen , who also serves as vice president of the european commission , blasted the united states for not opening up its defense markets to european contractors . " the protectionist spirit in the united sates is much more strong than in europe , " verheugen said . " especially in congress , it is obvious that as a result of the american electoral system you find such a position that american jobs must be protected , even if it is economically not very sound , " he said . after his recent meetings in washington , however , verheugen said he was optimistic that " a first set of rules " which would improve the exchange between the us and the eu could emerge later this year .

" in the situation of the time he -lrb- steinmeier -rrb- acted absolutely correctly and in sync with the political line that was my responsibility , " schröder said , adding that he would have taken the exact same decisions in light of the atmosphere and events of the time . the former chancellor said he was not informed personally about the case of murat kurnaz , who was seized by us forces in pakistan after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks and sent to guantanamo bay in 2002 .
" but i take responsibility for the then security policy , " he said . schröder pointed out that given the fear of further attacks in the wake of the sept .
11 atrocity , germany 's internal security had the highest priority at the time , along with a strict regard for legal principles and human rights . " in light of the fact that a few perpetrators of the sept .
11 attacks had lived in germany , we had to be highly alert , " he said . steinmeier to testify on march 8 schröder 's defense of steinmeier will be a welcome respite for the foreign minister who is increasingly under pressure over the kurnaz case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz says he was tortured at guantanamo bay steinmeier faces allegations of not having done enough , and in certain cases having blocked , kurnaz ' release from the us prison camp on cuba .
the german-born turkish national , who has claimed he was abused and tortured in the prison , was released last year after the intervention of current chancellor angela merkel . on thursday , it emerged that steinmeier , who has consistently rejected any allegations of wrongdoing , will be testifying on march 8 before an independent parliamentary committee set up to investigate the case .
critics have complained that given the mounting evidence which points to steinmeier 's role in the affair , the foreign minister should testify earlier than march . the glare of the media increased on the minister this week when a german court issued arrest warrants for 13 people in connection with the alleged cia-backed kidnapping of a lebanese-born german citizen , khaled el-masri . minister rebuffs allegations in the latest of a series of interviews to defend his actions , steinmeier said claims that the german government received a formal offer from the us administration to free kurnaz in 2002 were " made-up . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the affair has given steinmeier a major headache he told die zeit weekly newspaper that washington had simply suggested cutting a deal with kurnaz to use him to infiltrate extremist muslim groups in germany .
the german government rejected the idea on the advice of security experts and the foreign intelligence services , steinmeier said . he said it was easy to forget the highly charged atmosphere at the time , with the west bracing for islamist attacks .
the german government had " the responsibility to ensure that no further attacks took place , " steinmeier told die zeit .
he pointed out that germany has to this day remained free from a major terrorist attack since the suicide hijackings of september 11 . merkel 's grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats is closing ranks around steinmeier , a member of the social democratic party . thomas de maiziere , a conservative who now holds steinmeier 's old job of chief of staff at the chancellery , warned against harshly judging the kurnaz case in hindsight . " it is very easy with the witness statements and documents to judge the incident four or five years later .
but it is far harder to make decisions at a highly complex point in time , " he said . three members of the german intelligence services who questioned kurnaz in guantanamo were to give evidence on thursday to the parliamentary committee investigating the case . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court orders arrest of 13 over cia kidnapping a german court ordered the arrest of 13 people behind the alleged cia-backed kidnapping of a german citizen , believed to be one of the most notorious us " renditions " of a terror suspect , prosecutors said wednesday .

" chirac caused a stir after he downplayed the threat posed by iran in an interview to three publications earlier this week . " having one or perhaps a second bomb a little later , well that 's not very dangerous , " chirac said .
" where would iran drop this bomb ?
on israel ? " he asked .
" it would not have gone off 200 meters into the atmosphere before tehran would be razed to the ground , " he said . the elysee palace issued a statement on thursday clarifying chirac 's stance and a presidential aide complained of a " shameful polemic " stoked by " certain media across the atlantic " who are anti-french . a clear position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac said he had oversimplified the iran issue in his interview the white house said it was satisfied with chirac 's " revised and extended " comments . " the fact is our position on iran is clear , they should n't have any nuclear weapon and furthermore they ought to take steps to suspend uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities , " said spokesman tony snow . " that is not only the stated position of the united states but also its allies , including france , in terms of dealing with the iranians , " snow told reporters . chirac explosive interview came , nonetheless , at a rather sensitive moment for us-eu relations . tensions rising ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un imposed sanctions on iran in december although european countries agreed with the united states to impose sanctions on iran in line with a un resolution adopted in december , they have resisted us calls to go even further and force global financial institutions to sever all ties with the islamic republic . us undersecretary in charge of fighting terrorist funding , stuart levey , has made several whirlwind trips to europe over the past months to try to persuade european multinationals and banks to stop investing in iran . but so far he has run into a brick wall , with european countries maintaining they are not ready to cut off banking links with iranian companies , arguing that such a move goes beyond the spirit of the un resolution . " we are going to do the utmost to apply the content of the resolution .
we are not going to go beyond what is in the resolution as states , " a senior european official told afp . partial withdrawal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank partially bowed to us pressure on wednesday , commerzbank , the second-biggest bank in germany , joined other european banks in curtailing its activities with iran by abolishing dollar transactions for iran at its new york branch . a number of european banks - such as credit suisse and ubs have already taken similar decisions , paring back or ceasing altogether their operations with iran . commerzbank , however , said it would continue to handle euro transactions for its iranian clients . additionally , several european countries continue to offer mostly state-sponsored loans to the islamic republic .
in 2005 alone , italy awarded 4.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.2 billion -rrb- in loans to teheran , with germany tallying slightly behind with 4.2 billion euros . frustration in the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president bush has accused iranian leaders of stirring up violence in iraq us officials this week gave vent to their mounting frustration , which comes as us president george w. bush has accused iranian leaders of helping to forment the mounting sectarian violence in iraq , fuelling fears that the us could be preparing some kind of military response against tehran . " the european response on the economic side has been pretty weak , " one unnamed senior us official was quoted in the new york times . " we are telling the europeans that they need to go way beyond what they 've done to maximize pressure on iran , " he added . legal concerns this position , however , does not seem to completely reflect the view of the us administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu will address the issue of sanctions against iran in mid-february " i think that the concerns that european governments are expressing have to do with their legal requirements .
they have a set of legal requirements that they have to abide by , " said state department spokesman sean mccormack . " and i 'm not sure i would call that resistance to discussing or cooperating on these various measures . " european union foreign ministers last week agreed to implement the full raft of un sanctions against tehran and deplored " iran 's failure to take the steps repeatedly required by the iaea board of governors and the united nations security council . " a new eu meeting is planned in mid-february to put in place european regulations on the iran sanctions which suspend all exports of materiel and technology to the islamic republic . the un resolution also freezes iranian assets abroad and restricts foreign travel by iranians deemed to be involved in the suspect programs . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran defies sanctions , vows to expand enrichment iran vowed sunday to start work immediately on drastically expanding its capacity to enrich uranium , defying the first un sanctions against the islamic republic 's nuclear program .

" chirac caused a stir after he downplayed the threat posed by iran in an interview to three publications earlier this week . " having one or perhaps a second bomb a little later , well that 's not very dangerous , " chirac said .
" where would iran drop this bomb ?
on israel ? " he asked .
" it would not have gone off 200 meters into the atmosphere before tehran would be razed to the ground , " he said . the elysee palace issued a statement on thursday clarifying chirac 's stance and a presidential aide complained of a " shameful polemic " stoked by " certain media across the atlantic " who are anti-french . a clear position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac said he had oversimplified the iran issue in his interview the white house said it was satisfied with chirac 's " revised and extended " comments . " the fact is our position on iran is clear , they should n't have any nuclear weapon and furthermore they ought to take steps to suspend uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities , " said spokesman tony snow . " that is not only the stated position of the united states but also its allies , including france , in terms of dealing with the iranians , " snow told reporters . chirac explosive interview came , nonetheless , at a rather sensitive moment for us-eu relations . tensions rising ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un imposed sanctions on iran in december although european countries agreed with the united states to impose sanctions on iran in line with a un resolution adopted in december , they have resisted us calls to go even further and force global financial institutions to sever all ties with the islamic republic . us undersecretary in charge of fighting terrorist funding , stuart levey , has made several whirlwind trips to europe over the past months to try to persuade european multinationals and banks to stop investing in iran . but so far he has run into a brick wall , with european countries maintaining they are not ready to cut off banking links with iranian companies , arguing that such a move goes beyond the spirit of the un resolution . " we are going to do the utmost to apply the content of the resolution .
we are not going to go beyond what is in the resolution as states , " a senior european official told afp . partial withdrawal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank partially bowed to us pressure on wednesday , commerzbank , the second-biggest bank in germany , joined other european banks in curtailing its activities with iran by abolishing dollar transactions for iran at its new york branch . a number of european banks - such as credit suisse and ubs have already taken similar decisions , paring back or ceasing altogether their operations with iran . commerzbank , however , said it would continue to handle euro transactions for its iranian clients . additionally , several european countries continue to offer mostly state-sponsored loans to the islamic republic .
in 2005 alone , italy awarded 4.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.2 billion -rrb- in loans to teheran , with germany tallying slightly behind with 4.2 billion euros . frustration in the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president bush has accused iranian leaders of stirring up violence in iraq us officials this week gave vent to their mounting frustration , which comes as us president george w. bush has accused iranian leaders of helping to forment the mounting sectarian violence in iraq , fuelling fears that the us could be preparing some kind of military response against tehran . " the european response on the economic side has been pretty weak , " one unnamed senior us official was quoted in the new york times . " we are telling the europeans that they need to go way beyond what they 've done to maximize pressure on iran , " he added . legal concerns this position , however , does not seem to completely reflect the view of the us administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu will address the issue of sanctions against iran in mid-february " i think that the concerns that european governments are expressing have to do with their legal requirements .
they have a set of legal requirements that they have to abide by , " said state department spokesman sean mccormack . " and i 'm not sure i would call that resistance to discussing or cooperating on these various measures . " european union foreign ministers last week agreed to implement the full raft of un sanctions against tehran and deplored " iran 's failure to take the steps repeatedly required by the iaea board of governors and the united nations security council . " a new eu meeting is planned in mid-february to put in place european regulations on the iran sanctions which suspend all exports of materiel and technology to the islamic republic . the un resolution also freezes iranian assets abroad and restricts foreign travel by iranians deemed to be involved in the suspect programs . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran defies sanctions , vows to expand enrichment iran vowed sunday to start work immediately on drastically expanding its capacity to enrich uranium , defying the first un sanctions against the islamic republic 's nuclear program .

" if we continue along the current path , the present fragmented industrial bases in europe will not be sustainable , " verheugen told a defense conference in brussels . verheugen stressed that the european defense sector in its current form was riddled with inefficiency and national protectionism .
maintaining national control in the defence sector has pushed the prices up and undermined the future of the 300,000 jobs in defense manufacturing across the eu . " it means a lack of competition , an inability to exploit economies of scale and , above all , poor value for money for european taxpayers , " he said . opening up the borders even though eu governments agreed last year to open up markets to more cross-border competition last year , the defense-related industries have been largely kept out of the remit of the internal market . the 27-nation block , for instance , has 23 distinct national programs for building armored fighting vehicles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union foreign policy chief javier solana " cross-border competition in a continental-sized market is essential , " eu foreign policy chief jaiver solana told the conference .
" this is a matter on which its -lrb- the industry 's -rrb- survival rests . " the eu commission is expected to propose a new legislation later this year that would open the 30 billion euro -lrb- $ 39 billion -rrb- defense market to more cross-national competition .
it would also remove the need for eu exporters to obtain security licenses for exporting defense-related goods to other eu nations . at the moment , around 12,000 requests for such licenses are filed every year .
in view of the close military cooperation between eu governments , only 15 licenses were refused in 2003 , and none in 2004 and 2005 . " on the government side , we must combine our requirements so as to offer industry projects with a worthwhile economy of scale .
and we must encourage the restructuring and consolidation of the supply side as well , " solana said . trans-atlantic competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commissioner for enterprise and industry günter verheugen verheugen , who also serves as vice president of the european commission , blasted the united states for not opening up its defense markets to european contractors . " the protectionist spirit in the united sates is much more strong than in europe , " verheugen said . " especially in congress , it is obvious that as a result of the american electoral system you find such a position that american jobs must be protected , even if it is economically not very sound , " he said . after his recent meetings in washington , however , verheugen said he was optimistic that " a first set of rules " which would improve the exchange between the us and the eu could emerge later this year .

in view of the close military cooperation between eu governments , only 15 licenses were refused in 2003 , and none in 2004 and 2005 . " on the government side , we must combine our requirements so as to offer industry projects with a worthwhile economy of scale .

" in the situation of the time he -lrb- steinmeier -rrb- acted absolutely correctly and in sync with the political line that was my responsibility , " schröder said , adding that he would have taken the exact same decisions in light of the atmosphere and events of the time . the former chancellor said he was not informed personally about the case of murat kurnaz , who was seized by us forces in pakistan after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks and sent to guantanamo bay in 2002 .
" but i take responsibility for the then security policy , " he said . schröder pointed out that given the fear of further attacks in the wake of the sept .
11 atrocity , germany 's internal security had the highest priority at the time , along with a strict regard for legal principles and human rights . " in light of the fact that a few perpetrators of the sept .
11 attacks had lived in germany , we had to be highly alert , " he said . steinmeier to testify on march 8 schröder 's defense of steinmeier will be a welcome respite for the foreign minister who is increasingly under pressure over the kurnaz case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz says he was tortured at guantanamo bay steinmeier faces allegations of not having done enough , and in certain cases having blocked , kurnaz ' release from the us prison camp on cuba .
the german-born turkish national , who has claimed he was abused and tortured in the prison , was released last year after the intervention of current chancellor angela merkel . on thursday , it emerged that steinmeier , who has consistently rejected any allegations of wrongdoing , will be testifying on march 8 before an independent parliamentary committee set up to investigate the case .
critics have complained that given the mounting evidence which points to steinmeier 's role in the affair , the foreign minister should testify earlier than march . the glare of the media increased on the minister this week when a german court issued arrest warrants for 13 people in connection with the alleged cia-backed kidnapping of a lebanese-born german citizen , khaled el-masri . minister rebuffs allegations in the latest of a series of interviews to defend his actions , steinmeier said claims that the german government received a formal offer from the us administration to free kurnaz in 2002 were " made-up . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the affair has given steinmeier a major headache he told die zeit weekly newspaper that washington had simply suggested cutting a deal with kurnaz to use him to infiltrate extremist muslim groups in germany .
the german government rejected the idea on the advice of security experts and the foreign intelligence services , steinmeier said . he said it was easy to forget the highly charged atmosphere at the time , with the west bracing for islamist attacks .
the german government had " the responsibility to ensure that no further attacks took place , " steinmeier told die zeit .
he pointed out that germany has to this day remained free from a major terrorist attack since the suicide hijackings of september 11 . merkel 's grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats is closing ranks around steinmeier , a member of the social democratic party . thomas de maiziere , a conservative who now holds steinmeier 's old job of chief of staff at the chancellery , warned against harshly judging the kurnaz case in hindsight . " it is very easy with the witness statements and documents to judge the incident four or five years later .
but it is far harder to make decisions at a highly complex point in time , " he said . three members of the german intelligence services who questioned kurnaz in guantanamo were to give evidence on thursday to the parliamentary committee investigating the case . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court orders arrest of 13 over cia kidnapping a german court ordered the arrest of 13 people behind the alleged cia-backed kidnapping of a german citizen , believed to be one of the most notorious us " renditions " of a terror suspect , prosecutors said wednesday .

" chirac caused a stir after he downplayed the threat posed by iran in an interview to three publications earlier this week . " having one or perhaps a second bomb a little later , well that 's not very dangerous , " chirac said .
" where would iran drop this bomb ?
on israel ? " he asked .
" it would not have gone off 200 meters into the atmosphere before tehran would be razed to the ground , " he said . the elysee palace issued a statement on thursday clarifying chirac 's stance and a presidential aide complained of a " shameful polemic " stoked by " certain media across the atlantic " who are anti-french . a clear position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac said he had oversimplified the iran issue in his interview the white house said it was satisfied with chirac 's " revised and extended " comments . " the fact is our position on iran is clear , they should n't have any nuclear weapon and furthermore they ought to take steps to suspend uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities , " said spokesman tony snow . " that is not only the stated position of the united states but also its allies , including france , in terms of dealing with the iranians , " snow told reporters . chirac explosive interview came , nonetheless , at a rather sensitive moment for us-eu relations . tensions rising ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un imposed sanctions on iran in december although european countries agreed with the united states to impose sanctions on iran in line with a un resolution adopted in december , they have resisted us calls to go even further and force global financial institutions to sever all ties with the islamic republic . us undersecretary in charge of fighting terrorist funding , stuart levey , has made several whirlwind trips to europe over the past months to try to persuade european multinationals and banks to stop investing in iran . but so far he has run into a brick wall , with european countries maintaining they are not ready to cut off banking links with iranian companies , arguing that such a move goes beyond the spirit of the un resolution . " we are going to do the utmost to apply the content of the resolution .
we are not going to go beyond what is in the resolution as states , " a senior european official told afp . partial withdrawal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank partially bowed to us pressure on wednesday , commerzbank , the second-biggest bank in germany , joined other european banks in curtailing its activities with iran by abolishing dollar transactions for iran at its new york branch . a number of european banks - such as credit suisse and ubs have already taken similar decisions , paring back or ceasing altogether their operations with iran . commerzbank , however , said it would continue to handle euro transactions for its iranian clients . additionally , several european countries continue to offer mostly state-sponsored loans to the islamic republic .
in 2005 alone , italy awarded 4.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.2 billion -rrb- in loans to teheran , with germany tallying slightly behind with 4.2 billion euros . frustration in the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president bush has accused iranian leaders of stirring up violence in iraq us officials this week gave vent to their mounting frustration , which comes as us president george w. bush has accused iranian leaders of helping to forment the mounting sectarian violence in iraq , fuelling fears that the us could be preparing some kind of military response against tehran . " the european response on the economic side has been pretty weak , " one unnamed senior us official was quoted in the new york times . " we are telling the europeans that they need to go way beyond what they 've done to maximize pressure on iran , " he added . legal concerns this position , however , does not seem to completely reflect the view of the us administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu will address the issue of sanctions against iran in mid-february " i think that the concerns that european governments are expressing have to do with their legal requirements .
they have a set of legal requirements that they have to abide by , " said state department spokesman sean mccormack . " and i 'm not sure i would call that resistance to discussing or cooperating on these various measures . " european union foreign ministers last week agreed to implement the full raft of un sanctions against tehran and deplored " iran 's failure to take the steps repeatedly required by the iaea board of governors and the united nations security council . " a new eu meeting is planned in mid-february to put in place european regulations on the iran sanctions which suspend all exports of materiel and technology to the islamic republic . the un resolution also freezes iranian assets abroad and restricts foreign travel by iranians deemed to be involved in the suspect programs . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran defies sanctions , vows to expand enrichment iran vowed sunday to start work immediately on drastically expanding its capacity to enrich uranium , defying the first un sanctions against the islamic republic 's nuclear program .

a doping scandal is a nightmare for athletes and fans , but corporate sponsors may be the ones who suffer most .
marketers hope new international rules and corporate vigilance will aid in damage control . on thursday , an international unesco convention on doping goes into effect .
while the agreement is unlikely to put a stop to doping in sports any time soon , it represents the first time that governments around the world have agreed to throw the force of international law behind the problem . " until now , doping cases have been handled by sporting authorities .
this puts it in the countries ' courts of law , " said christoph breuer , a professor of sports management at the athletics college of cologne . the international accord can be seen as a vote of confidence in german 's national anti-doping agency , nada , and its international offshoot , world anti doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- . dancing to their own tune bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich , right , no longer wears the t-mobile jersey .
he was fired amid doping allegations but corporate sponsors , who may have millions riding on the image of cleanliness in sports , have stayed out of the fray , mostly dealing with the issue in their own way . " as far as i know , sponsors have been fairly reluctant to join in the active fight against doping , " said christian sachs , a spokesman for the federal interior ministry committee that supported the un treaty .
" we want to encourage sponsors within the field of sport to contribute to the funding of nada , which they have hardly done up to now . " indeed , corporate sponsors generally take a reactive , not a proactive , stance , said breuer from the athletics college . the upside of scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cycling and track and field are the two sports where doping is said to be rampant " often , when an athlete is first suspected of doping , a corporate sponsor 's first reaction is to stand behind them and protect them , " he said .
" but once the charges are proven , the sponsors often separate from the athlete . " yet , breuer added , there are certain instances in which doping allegations can actually work in a sponsor 's favor : " for an unknown firm , a doping case might serve to boost its profile .
even if its negative publicity , the name will be known . " for the past several years , it has been the norm in the sports marketing world for sponsors to put an escape clause in their contract that ends the sponsorship if an athlete or team is accused or convicted of doping . still , the bad taste of a doping accusation can linger , and become an image nightmare for a company that has the misfortune to back the wrong athletes . the case of jan ullrich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german biathlete thomas oelsner was suspended from the paralympics for alleged doping " this is the most castastrophic thing that can happen in sports sponsoring , and we advise our clients to be very careful before they get into any endorsement contracts , " said stephan schröder , who is on the managing board of the cologne-based sports marketing consultancy sport + markt . schröder cited as an example the case of jan ullrich .
the german cycling star was booted by his sponsor t-mobile after he was implicated in a highly publicized doping investigation shortly before last summer 's tour de france .
after losing his german racing license , ullrich moved to switzerland and has been busy fending off both german and swiss allegations ever since . t-mobile , meanwhile , was saddled with an enormous image problem - which it fought with an intensive public relations offensive , according to schröder . t-mobile reacts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bodybuilders are often said to turn to steroid use " the company took a very aggressive stance and went straight to the press , " schröder added .
" they distanced themselves from ullrich , and said they were working hard to clean up the image of the rest of the team . " indeed , shortly after the ullrich scandal broke , t-mobile announced plans to take a " tough stance in the fight against doping " by putting a german physician in charge of the team and " consistently evaluating and monitoring the training methods " of the riders .
t-mobile also committed some financial support to the anti-doping agency nada , among other measures . according to schröder , " actively supporting the image of fair play in sports " could be a good solution to the problem sponsors are faced with when fighting an image soiled by doping allegations . pr vs marketing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agony and the extasy : a sponsor 's image is linked to that of its star athletes but others say it is unlikely that voluntary funding for anti-doping agencies would ever take an important role in corporate image building .

" chirac caused a stir after he downplayed the threat posed by iran in an interview to three publications earlier this week . " having one or perhaps a second bomb a little later , well that 's not very dangerous , " chirac said .
" where would iran drop this bomb ?
on israel ? " he asked .
" it would not have gone off 200 meters into the atmosphere before tehran would be razed to the ground , " he said . the elysee palace issued a statement on thursday clarifying chirac 's stance and a presidential aide complained of a " shameful polemic " stoked by " certain media across the atlantic " who are anti-french . a clear position bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : chirac said he had oversimplified the iran issue in his interview the white house said it was satisfied with chirac 's " revised and extended " comments . " the fact is our position on iran is clear , they should n't have any nuclear weapon and furthermore they ought to take steps to suspend uranium enrichment and reprocessing activities , " said spokesman tony snow . " that is not only the stated position of the united states but also its allies , including france , in terms of dealing with the iranians , " snow told reporters . chirac explosive interview came , nonetheless , at a rather sensitive moment for us-eu relations . tensions rising ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the un imposed sanctions on iran in december although european countries agreed with the united states to impose sanctions on iran in line with a un resolution adopted in december , they have resisted us calls to go even further and force global financial institutions to sever all ties with the islamic republic . us undersecretary in charge of fighting terrorist funding , stuart levey , has made several whirlwind trips to europe over the past months to try to persuade european multinationals and banks to stop investing in iran . but so far he has run into a brick wall , with european countries maintaining they are not ready to cut off banking links with iranian companies , arguing that such a move goes beyond the spirit of the un resolution . " we are going to do the utmost to apply the content of the resolution .
we are not going to go beyond what is in the resolution as states , " a senior european official told afp . partial withdrawal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : commerzbank partially bowed to us pressure on wednesday , commerzbank , the second-biggest bank in germany , joined other european banks in curtailing its activities with iran by abolishing dollar transactions for iran at its new york branch . a number of european banks - such as credit suisse and ubs have already taken similar decisions , paring back or ceasing altogether their operations with iran . commerzbank , however , said it would continue to handle euro transactions for its iranian clients . additionally , several european countries continue to offer mostly state-sponsored loans to the islamic republic .
in 2005 alone , italy awarded 4.8 billion euros -lrb- $ 6.2 billion -rrb- in loans to teheran , with germany tallying slightly behind with 4.2 billion euros . frustration in the us bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : us president bush has accused iranian leaders of stirring up violence in iraq us officials this week gave vent to their mounting frustration , which comes as us president george w. bush has accused iranian leaders of helping to forment the mounting sectarian violence in iraq , fuelling fears that the us could be preparing some kind of military response against tehran . " the european response on the economic side has been pretty weak , " one unnamed senior us official was quoted in the new york times . " we are telling the europeans that they need to go way beyond what they 've done to maximize pressure on iran , " he added . legal concerns this position , however , does not seem to completely reflect the view of the us administration . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu will address the issue of sanctions against iran in mid-february " i think that the concerns that european governments are expressing have to do with their legal requirements .
they have a set of legal requirements that they have to abide by , " said state department spokesman sean mccormack . " and i 'm not sure i would call that resistance to discussing or cooperating on these various measures . " european union foreign ministers last week agreed to implement the full raft of un sanctions against tehran and deplored " iran 's failure to take the steps repeatedly required by the iaea board of governors and the united nations security council . " a new eu meeting is planned in mid-february to put in place european regulations on the iran sanctions which suspend all exports of materiel and technology to the islamic republic . the un resolution also freezes iranian assets abroad and restricts foreign travel by iranians deemed to be involved in the suspect programs . dw staff / afp , dpa -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de iran defies sanctions , vows to expand enrichment iran vowed sunday to start work immediately on drastically expanding its capacity to enrich uranium , defying the first un sanctions against the islamic republic 's nuclear program .

"
" otherwise , the church will be left with just one third of its current membership and only fifty percent of its current funds by 2030 , " it warned .
so the alarm bells were ringing when some 300 church representatives and politicians came together for a congress in wittenberg to discuss ways of braking this accelerating trend .
according to the organizers from the ekd , the solution is a slate of reforms designed to usher in a " decade of change " set to culminate on the 500th anniversary of luther 's theses in 2017 .
identity crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what relevance does christ have in today 's world ?
the proposals included cutting back the country 's regional churches from 23 to a maximum of 12 , with the squeeze primarily on traditional , smaller parishes .
in future , the ekd wants to see the congregations of the individual regional churches number at least 1 million - twice the size of many of the smallest existing communities .
but these are n't the main challenges .
the church 's strapped finances are problematic enough , but the congress participants were well aware that far more is at stake than a leaking roof or two .
ultimately , the church knows it needs to reappraise its role and find a new place for faith within contemporary society .
" it 's time for a new departure , " parliamentary deputy speaker katrin göring-eckardt of the green party told the congress .
" and not primarily because of declining membership and lack of funds . "
göring-eckardt dismissed complaints that the ekd treated the church like a business in need of a turn-around by bandying around terms like ' quality control ' and ' quotas , ' and stressed the church 's need to adapt to the times .
" we need a worldly church , not an other-worldly church , " she said .
the business of religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : redefining its role many agree that a bit of business acumen is exactly what the church needs .
the days when even handing around a collection plate was an embarrassing concession to earthly matters are long over , and thies gundlach from the ekd says the church has to become less coy about resorting to best-practice marketing tricks .
" the church would be betraying itself if it behaved like a business , " he said .
" but in the bible , paul says : ' test everything , retain what is good , ' which is a principle that does allow us to learn a few lessons from business and economics - from customer loyalty to promoting the protestant brand - so long as we never forget that the church will never be a company like any other . "
his feelings are shared by swen schönheit , pastor at the apostle petrus church in berlin .
an angular building built in the 1960s , it could n't seem less inviting from the outside , but what it lacks in aesthetics it more than makes up for in atmosphere , defying the national trend by regularly welcoming a full house on sundays .
" what many churches in germany lack is charisma , " he says .
" the church has suffered a loss of spiritual energy , it lacks relevance .
its crisis is a spiritual one not a financial one . "
and it 's no one 's fault but its own , he says .
" society is seeing a boom in religious interest , there 's a renewal of spiritual soul-searching going on in germany , but this is completely passing by the church , and it 's time the church found a way of harnessing it . "
" it has to realize it is in competition with other sources of spirituality within society and get its act together , " he insists .
the new religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many feel the church needs more of a human touch his own church obviously has .
community activities range from children 's dance classes to group summer holidays , while the sunday service kicks off with a house band switching on the electric amplifier as the congregation sings along with the help of a power point show .
but to some , this form of happy-clappy religion is suspiciously reminiscent of the born-again evangelism popular in the us - one which goes hand-in-hand with a christian-right political agenda deeply foreign to secular european sensibilities .
but it 's unlikely german protestants will ever head in this direction .
" traditionally , religious affiliation has been a private matter in germany due to the separation of church and state , " explains urike murmann , pastor at hamburg 's st katherine 's church .
that said , she does believe a dose of showmanship never goes amiss .
" going to church should be cheerful , it should be fun , " she says .
" we 've seen that people respond very well when we offer music or theatre . "
but she also knows where to draw the line .
" of course , if it descended into a superficial entertainment , that would be terrible . "
her main emphasis is on the community role of the church , and she says that it 's already learning how to be more aware of parish needs .
" in hamburg , we look carefully at what our congregation wants and we tailor our activities accordingly .
we know we need to do more than just lecture people . "
but even though a number of churches across the country are managing to fill their pews by offering a new and improved form of protestantism , their popularity is failing to translate into church membership .
attending church is one thing , actually joining is another .
and the reasons might be purely mundane .
the spirit is willing , one might say , but the flesh is weak .
" the church tax is a stumbling block , " says murmann .
" it 's not easy to persuade people it 's valid .
furthermore , there 's been a growing skepticism towards institutions in recent years .
people do n't join political parties , they do n't join unions .
the church is no exception . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reformers turn up heat on church critics have been present at world youth day , bringing up issues such as the role of women , family planning and gay rights .

"
" otherwise , the church will be left with just one third of its current membership and only fifty percent of its current funds by 2030 , " it warned .
so the alarm bells were ringing when some 300 church representatives and politicians came together for a congress in wittenberg to discuss ways of braking this accelerating trend .
according to the organizers from the ekd , the solution is a slate of reforms designed to usher in a " decade of change " set to culminate on the 500th anniversary of luther 's theses in 2017 .
identity crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what relevance does christ have in today 's world ?
the proposals included cutting back the country 's regional churches from 23 to a maximum of 12 , with the squeeze primarily on traditional , smaller parishes .
in future , the ekd wants to see the congregations of the individual regional churches number at least 1 million - twice the size of many of the smallest existing communities .
but these are n't the main challenges .
the church 's strapped finances are problematic enough , but the congress participants were well aware that far more is at stake than a leaking roof or two .
ultimately , the church knows it needs to reappraise its role and find a new place for faith within contemporary society .
" it 's time for a new departure , " parliamentary deputy speaker katrin göring-eckardt of the green party told the congress .
" and not primarily because of declining membership and lack of funds . "
göring-eckardt dismissed complaints that the ekd treated the church like a business in need of a turn-around by bandying around terms like ' quality control ' and ' quotas , ' and stressed the church 's need to adapt to the times .
" we need a worldly church , not an other-worldly church , " she said .
the business of religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : redefining its role many agree that a bit of business acumen is exactly what the church needs .
the days when even handing around a collection plate was an embarrassing concession to earthly matters are long over , and thies gundlach from the ekd says the church has to become less coy about resorting to best-practice marketing tricks .
" the church would be betraying itself if it behaved like a business , " he said .
" but in the bible , paul says : ' test everything , retain what is good , ' which is a principle that does allow us to learn a few lessons from business and economics - from customer loyalty to promoting the protestant brand - so long as we never forget that the church will never be a company like any other . "
his feelings are shared by swen schönheit , pastor at the apostle petrus church in berlin .
an angular building built in the 1960s , it could n't seem less inviting from the outside , but what it lacks in aesthetics it more than makes up for in atmosphere , defying the national trend by regularly welcoming a full house on sundays .
" what many churches in germany lack is charisma , " he says .
" the church has suffered a loss of spiritual energy , it lacks relevance .
its crisis is a spiritual one not a financial one . "
and it 's no one 's fault but its own , he says .
" society is seeing a boom in religious interest , there 's a renewal of spiritual soul-searching going on in germany , but this is completely passing by the church , and it 's time the church found a way of harnessing it . "
" it has to realize it is in competition with other sources of spirituality within society and get its act together , " he insists .
the new religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many feel the church needs more of a human touch his own church obviously has .
community activities range from children 's dance classes to group summer holidays , while the sunday service kicks off with a house band switching on the electric amplifier as the congregation sings along with the help of a power point show .
but to some , this form of happy-clappy religion is suspiciously reminiscent of the born-again evangelism popular in the us - one which goes hand-in-hand with a christian-right political agenda deeply foreign to secular european sensibilities .
but it 's unlikely german protestants will ever head in this direction .
" traditionally , religious affiliation has been a private matter in germany due to the separation of church and state , " explains urike murmann , pastor at hamburg 's st katherine 's church .
that said , she does believe a dose of showmanship never goes amiss .
" going to church should be cheerful , it should be fun , " she says .
" we 've seen that people respond very well when we offer music or theatre . "
but she also knows where to draw the line .
" of course , if it descended into a superficial entertainment , that would be terrible . "
her main emphasis is on the community role of the church , and she says that it 's already learning how to be more aware of parish needs .
" in hamburg , we look carefully at what our congregation wants and we tailor our activities accordingly .
we know we need to do more than just lecture people . "
but even though a number of churches across the country are managing to fill their pews by offering a new and improved form of protestantism , their popularity is failing to translate into church membership .
attending church is one thing , actually joining is another .
and the reasons might be purely mundane .
the spirit is willing , one might say , but the flesh is weak .
" the church tax is a stumbling block , " says murmann .
" it 's not easy to persuade people it 's valid .
furthermore , there 's been a growing skepticism towards institutions in recent years .
people do n't join political parties , they do n't join unions .
the church is no exception . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reformers turn up heat on church critics have been present at world youth day , bringing up issues such as the role of women , family planning and gay rights .

" in the situation of the time he -lrb- steinmeier -rrb- acted absolutely correctly and in sync with the political line that was my responsibility , " schröder said , adding that he would have taken the exact same decisions in light of the atmosphere and events of the time . the former chancellor said he was not informed personally about the case of murat kurnaz , who was seized by us forces in pakistan after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks and sent to guantanamo bay in 2002 .
" but i take responsibility for the then security policy , " he said . schröder pointed out that given the fear of further attacks in the wake of the sept .
11 atrocity , germany 's internal security had the highest priority at the time , along with a strict regard for legal principles and human rights . " in light of the fact that a few perpetrators of the sept .
11 attacks had lived in germany , we had to be highly alert , " he said . steinmeier to testify on march 8 schröder 's defense of steinmeier will be a welcome respite for the foreign minister who is increasingly under pressure over the kurnaz case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz says he was tortured at guantanamo bay steinmeier faces allegations of not having done enough , and in certain cases having blocked , kurnaz ' release from the us prison camp on cuba .
the german-born turkish national , who has claimed he was abused and tortured in the prison , was released last year after the intervention of current chancellor angela merkel . on thursday , it emerged that steinmeier , who has consistently rejected any allegations of wrongdoing , will be testifying on march 8 before an independent parliamentary committee set up to investigate the case .
critics have complained that given the mounting evidence which points to steinmeier 's role in the affair , the foreign minister should testify earlier than march . the glare of the media increased on the minister this week when a german court issued arrest warrants for 13 people in connection with the alleged cia-backed kidnapping of a lebanese-born german citizen , khaled el-masri . minister rebuffs allegations in the latest of a series of interviews to defend his actions , steinmeier said claims that the german government received a formal offer from the us administration to free kurnaz in 2002 were " made-up . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the affair has given steinmeier a major headache he told die zeit weekly newspaper that washington had simply suggested cutting a deal with kurnaz to use him to infiltrate extremist muslim groups in germany .
the german government rejected the idea on the advice of security experts and the foreign intelligence services , steinmeier said . he said it was easy to forget the highly charged atmosphere at the time , with the west bracing for islamist attacks .
the german government had " the responsibility to ensure that no further attacks took place , " steinmeier told die zeit .
he pointed out that germany has to this day remained free from a major terrorist attack since the suicide hijackings of september 11 . merkel 's grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats is closing ranks around steinmeier , a member of the social democratic party . thomas de maiziere , a conservative who now holds steinmeier 's old job of chief of staff at the chancellery , warned against harshly judging the kurnaz case in hindsight . " it is very easy with the witness statements and documents to judge the incident four or five years later .
but it is far harder to make decisions at a highly complex point in time , " he said . three members of the german intelligence services who questioned kurnaz in guantanamo were to give evidence on thursday to the parliamentary committee investigating the case . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court orders arrest of 13 over cia kidnapping a german court ordered the arrest of 13 people behind the alleged cia-backed kidnapping of a german citizen , believed to be one of the most notorious us " renditions " of a terror suspect , prosecutors said wednesday .

" in the situation of the time he -lrb- steinmeier -rrb- acted absolutely correctly and in sync with the political line that was my responsibility , " schröder said , adding that he would have taken the exact same decisions in light of the atmosphere and events of the time . the former chancellor said he was not informed personally about the case of murat kurnaz , who was seized by us forces in pakistan after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks and sent to guantanamo bay in 2002 .
" but i take responsibility for the then security policy , " he said . schröder pointed out that given the fear of further attacks in the wake of the sept .
11 atrocity , germany 's internal security had the highest priority at the time , along with a strict regard for legal principles and human rights . " in light of the fact that a few perpetrators of the sept .
11 attacks had lived in germany , we had to be highly alert , " he said . steinmeier to testify on march 8 schröder 's defense of steinmeier will be a welcome respite for the foreign minister who is increasingly under pressure over the kurnaz case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz says he was tortured at guantanamo bay steinmeier faces allegations of not having done enough , and in certain cases having blocked , kurnaz ' release from the us prison camp on cuba .
the german-born turkish national , who has claimed he was abused and tortured in the prison , was released last year after the intervention of current chancellor angela merkel . on thursday , it emerged that steinmeier , who has consistently rejected any allegations of wrongdoing , will be testifying on march 8 before an independent parliamentary committee set up to investigate the case .
critics have complained that given the mounting evidence which points to steinmeier 's role in the affair , the foreign minister should testify earlier than march . the glare of the media increased on the minister this week when a german court issued arrest warrants for 13 people in connection with the alleged cia-backed kidnapping of a lebanese-born german citizen , khaled el-masri . minister rebuffs allegations in the latest of a series of interviews to defend his actions , steinmeier said claims that the german government received a formal offer from the us administration to free kurnaz in 2002 were " made-up . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the affair has given steinmeier a major headache he told die zeit weekly newspaper that washington had simply suggested cutting a deal with kurnaz to use him to infiltrate extremist muslim groups in germany .
the german government rejected the idea on the advice of security experts and the foreign intelligence services , steinmeier said . he said it was easy to forget the highly charged atmosphere at the time , with the west bracing for islamist attacks .
the german government had " the responsibility to ensure that no further attacks took place , " steinmeier told die zeit .
he pointed out that germany has to this day remained free from a major terrorist attack since the suicide hijackings of september 11 . merkel 's grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats is closing ranks around steinmeier , a member of the social democratic party . thomas de maiziere , a conservative who now holds steinmeier 's old job of chief of staff at the chancellery , warned against harshly judging the kurnaz case in hindsight . " it is very easy with the witness statements and documents to judge the incident four or five years later .
but it is far harder to make decisions at a highly complex point in time , " he said . three members of the german intelligence services who questioned kurnaz in guantanamo were to give evidence on thursday to the parliamentary committee investigating the case . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court orders arrest of 13 over cia kidnapping a german court ordered the arrest of 13 people behind the alleged cia-backed kidnapping of a german citizen , believed to be one of the most notorious us " renditions " of a terror suspect , prosecutors said wednesday .

" if we continue along the current path , the present fragmented industrial bases in europe will not be sustainable , " verheugen told a defense conference in brussels . verheugen stressed that the european defense sector in its current form was riddled with inefficiency and national protectionism .
maintaining national control in the defence sector has pushed the prices up and undermined the future of the 300,000 jobs in defense manufacturing across the eu .

it would also remove the need for eu exporters to obtain security licenses for exporting defense-related goods to other eu nations . at the moment , around 12,000 requests for such licenses are filed every year .
in view of the close military cooperation between eu governments , only 15 licenses were refused in 2003 , and none in 2004 and 2005 . " on the government side , we must combine our requirements so as to offer industry projects with a worthwhile economy of scale .

" if we continue along the current path , the present fragmented industrial bases in europe will not be sustainable , " verheugen told a defense conference in brussels . verheugen stressed that the european defense sector in its current form was riddled with inefficiency and national protectionism .
maintaining national control in the defence sector has pushed the prices up and undermined the future of the 300,000 jobs in defense manufacturing across the eu . " it means a lack of competition , an inability to exploit economies of scale and , above all , poor value for money for european taxpayers , " he said . opening up the borders even though eu governments agreed last year to open up markets to more cross-border competition last year , the defense-related industries have been largely kept out of the remit of the internal market . the 27-nation block , for instance , has 23 distinct national programs for building armored fighting vehicles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union foreign policy chief javier solana " cross-border competition in a continental-sized market is essential , " eu foreign policy chief jaiver solana told the conference .

it would also remove the need for eu exporters to obtain security licenses for exporting defense-related goods to other eu nations . at the moment , around 12,000 requests for such licenses are filed every year .
in view of the close military cooperation between eu governments , only 15 licenses were refused in 2003 , and none in 2004 and 2005 . " on the government side , we must combine our requirements so as to offer industry projects with a worthwhile economy of scale .

separately , hamburg says it will take a share in a consortium buying a stake in parent company eads . amid reports that the world 's largest plane maker , airbus , is planning a tough cost-cutting operation , the german city-state of hamburg confirmed thursday that it will take a 10-percent share in a consortium acquiring the 7.5-percent stake in parent company eads .
the stake is being sold by german-us auto giant , daimlerchrysler . based on the current share price of 25.83 euros -lrb- $ 33.6 -rrb- , hamburg 's stake would be worth 160 million euros.the two neighboring north german states of lower saxony and bremen have already signaled their intention to invest 80 million euros and 30 million euros respectively in the acquisition of the stake . germany is currently represented in eads via a 22.5-percent share held by daimlerchrysler . all countries will be " equally unhappy " germany 's oldenburg-based newspaper nordwest zeitung reported thursday that thomas enders , co-chief of the eads , which fully owns airbus , had said the france-based plane maker would sell off production sites . in an earlier online report , the paper said enders only planned to keep those airbus plants involved in the final assembly or those that make components .
other manufacturing sites would be sold to trim bloated personnel costs and some 10,000 airbus jobs would be axed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads co- head thomas enders has hinted at painul cost-cutting " nobody in germany will be happy about what will be decided , " the paper quoted enders as saying .
but he also said he expected " everybody will be equally unhappy " in all the countries that are home to airbus plants . addressing some 300 guests - including german parliamentarians and representatives of the aviation industry - at the lower saxony embassy in berlin on wednesday , enders spoke of tough cuts in order to push through a restructuring program called " power 8 , " which aims to lower costs and make airbus more competitive for the future . enders , however , is said to have played down fears that airbus production sites in germany would be affected .
" there are no decisions at this point , " enders was quoted to have said . eads says it 's all speculation but spokesman for airbus parent company eads , michael hauger told ap news agency that though enders had spoken of " tough cuts , " he had also stressed that the rumors about job cuts and closing of production plants were pure speculation . hauger added that airbus management was still looking into the " power 8 " program , which would then have to be presented to eads bosses enders and louis gallois before the company 's supervisory board could have its final say . " everything that you hear before that is speculation , " hauger said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2,000 to 4,000 jobs could be axed at the airbus plant in hamburg but reports of massive job losses and the closing down of entire production plants are already doing the rounds in germany . horst niehus , a works council leader at the company 's hamburg factory told union members in a memo that the toulouse-based plane maker may sell manufacturing sites , buy more parts from outside suppliers and move work now done in germany to france . " should all scenarios be realized , it is expected that 5,000 through 8,000 jobs will be lost at airbus germany and 2,000 through 4,000 at hamburg , " niehus said in the report . airbus plans to slash 2.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.7 billion -rrb- from annual costs by 2010 .
eads has said the plane maker will record its first full-year loss ever for 2006 because of cost overruns on its a380 , which is at least two years behind schedule . minister says germany will fight to save jobs german economics minister michael glos said wednesday he will insist on a fair distribution of the burden resulting from airbus ' restructuring measures . " i will do everything possible to call on the french partner and those who run airbus to make sure that any job cuts will be in both countries and not to the disadvantage of german sites , " glos said .
" i will listen to the worries and help wherever i can within a government framework . " germany must get a share in present and future production that corresponds with its weight -lrb- in the company -rrb- , " he added .
" the german government will lobby for the german business location with all its power - also in its role as one of eads ' biggest contractors .

separately , hamburg says it will take a share in a consortium buying a stake in parent company eads . amid reports that the world 's largest plane maker , airbus , is planning a tough cost-cutting operation , the german city-state of hamburg confirmed thursday that it will take a 10-percent share in a consortium acquiring the 7.5-percent stake in parent company eads .
the stake is being sold by german-us auto giant , daimlerchrysler . based on the current share price of 25.83 euros -lrb- $ 33.6 -rrb- , hamburg 's stake would be worth 160 million euros.the two neighboring north german states of lower saxony and bremen have already signaled their intention to invest 80 million euros and 30 million euros respectively in the acquisition of the stake . germany is currently represented in eads via a 22.5-percent share held by daimlerchrysler . all countries will be " equally unhappy " germany 's oldenburg-based newspaper nordwest zeitung reported thursday that thomas enders , co-chief of the eads , which fully owns airbus , had said the france-based plane maker would sell off production sites . in an earlier online report , the paper said enders only planned to keep those airbus plants involved in the final assembly or those that make components .
other manufacturing sites would be sold to trim bloated personnel costs and some 10,000 airbus jobs would be axed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads co- head thomas enders has hinted at painul cost-cutting " nobody in germany will be happy about what will be decided , " the paper quoted enders as saying .
but he also said he expected " everybody will be equally unhappy " in all the countries that are home to airbus plants . addressing some 300 guests - including german parliamentarians and representatives of the aviation industry - at the lower saxony embassy in berlin on wednesday , enders spoke of tough cuts in order to push through a restructuring program called " power 8 , " which aims to lower costs and make airbus more competitive for the future . enders , however , is said to have played down fears that airbus production sites in germany would be affected .
" there are no decisions at this point , " enders was quoted to have said . eads says it 's all speculation but spokesman for airbus parent company eads , michael hauger told ap news agency that though enders had spoken of " tough cuts , " he had also stressed that the rumors about job cuts and closing of production plants were pure speculation . hauger added that airbus management was still looking into the " power 8 " program , which would then have to be presented to eads bosses enders and louis gallois before the company 's supervisory board could have its final say . " everything that you hear before that is speculation , " hauger said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2,000 to 4,000 jobs could be axed at the airbus plant in hamburg but reports of massive job losses and the closing down of entire production plants are already doing the rounds in germany . horst niehus , a works council leader at the company 's hamburg factory told union members in a memo that the toulouse-based plane maker may sell manufacturing sites , buy more parts from outside suppliers and move work now done in germany to france . " should all scenarios be realized , it is expected that 5,000 through 8,000 jobs will be lost at airbus germany and 2,000 through 4,000 at hamburg , " niehus said in the report . airbus plans to slash 2.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.7 billion -rrb- from annual costs by 2010 .
eads has said the plane maker will record its first full-year loss ever for 2006 because of cost overruns on its a380 , which is at least two years behind schedule . minister says germany will fight to save jobs german economics minister michael glos said wednesday he will insist on a fair distribution of the burden resulting from airbus ' restructuring measures . " i will do everything possible to call on the french partner and those who run airbus to make sure that any job cuts will be in both countries and not to the disadvantage of german sites , " glos said .
" i will listen to the worries and help wherever i can within a government framework . " germany must get a share in present and future production that corresponds with its weight -lrb- in the company -rrb- , " he added .
" the german government will lobby for the german business location with all its power - also in its role as one of eads ' biggest contractors . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thousands of german job cuts feared at airbus workers geared up for demonstrations after a union leader said he feared that eads , the multi-national parent company of the troubled airbus concern , may cut up to 8,000 jobs in northern germany .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de aviation -pipe- 01.02.2007 report says airbus has decided on cost-cutting measures großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : a grey cloud is hanging over airbus headquarters in toulouse a report says plane maker airbus has decided to slash jobs and sell some manufacturing sites .
separately , hamburg says it will take a share in a consortium buying a stake in parent company eads . amid reports that the world 's largest plane maker , airbus , is planning a tough cost-cutting operation , the german city-state of hamburg confirmed thursday that it will take a 10-percent share in a consortium acquiring the 7.5-percent stake in parent company eads .
the stake is being sold by german-us auto giant , daimlerchrysler . based on the current share price of 25.83 euros -lrb- $ 33.6 -rrb- , hamburg 's stake would be worth 160 million euros.the two neighboring north german states of lower saxony and bremen have already signaled their intention to invest 80 million euros and 30 million euros respectively in the acquisition of the stake . germany is currently represented in eads via a 22.5-percent share held by daimlerchrysler . all countries will be " equally unhappy " germany 's oldenburg-based newspaper nordwest zeitung reported thursday that thomas enders , co-chief of the eads , which fully owns airbus , had said the france-based plane maker would sell off production sites . in an earlier online report , the paper said enders only planned to keep those airbus plants involved in the final assembly or those that make components .
other manufacturing sites would be sold to trim bloated personnel costs and some 10,000 airbus jobs would be axed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads co- head thomas enders has hinted at painul cost-cutting " nobody in germany will be happy about what will be decided , " the paper quoted enders as saying .
but he also said he expected " everybody will be equally unhappy " in all the countries that are home to airbus plants . addressing some 300 guests - including german parliamentarians and representatives of the aviation industry - at the lower saxony embassy in berlin on wednesday , enders spoke of tough cuts in order to push through a restructuring program called " power 8 , " which aims to lower costs and make airbus more competitive for the future . enders , however , is said to have played down fears that airbus production sites in germany would be affected .
" there are no decisions at this point , " enders was quoted to have said . eads says it 's all speculation but spokesman for airbus parent company eads , michael hauger told ap news agency that though enders had spoken of " tough cuts , " he had also stressed that the rumors about job cuts and closing of production plants were pure speculation . hauger added that airbus management was still looking into the " power 8 " program , which would then have to be presented to eads bosses enders and louis gallois before the company 's supervisory board could have its final say . " everything that you hear before that is speculation , " hauger said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2,000 to 4,000 jobs could be axed at the airbus plant in hamburg but reports of massive job losses and the closing down of entire production plants are already doing the rounds in germany . horst niehus , a works council leader at the company 's hamburg factory told union members in a memo that the toulouse-based plane maker may sell manufacturing sites , buy more parts from outside suppliers and move work now done in germany to france . " should all scenarios be realized , it is expected that 5,000 through 8,000 jobs will be lost at airbus germany and 2,000 through 4,000 at hamburg , " niehus said in the report . airbus plans to slash 2.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.7 billion -rrb- from annual costs by 2010 .
eads has said the plane maker will record its first full-year loss ever for 2006 because of cost overruns on its a380 , which is at least two years behind schedule . minister says germany will fight to save jobs german economics minister michael glos said wednesday he will insist on a fair distribution of the burden resulting from airbus ' restructuring measures . " i will do everything possible to call on the french partner and those who run airbus to make sure that any job cuts will be in both countries and not to the disadvantage of german sites , " glos said .
" i will listen to the worries and help wherever i can within a government framework . " germany must get a share in present and future production that corresponds with its weight -lrb- in the company -rrb- , " he added .
" the german government will lobby for the german business location with all its power - also in its role as one of eads ' biggest contractors . " dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de thousands of german job cuts feared at airbus workers geared up for demonstrations after a union leader said he feared that eads , the multi-national parent company of the troubled airbus concern , may cut up to 8,000 jobs in northern germany .

it appears germany 's mighty automobile lobby is getting its way in brussels , as the eu moves its regulatory focus from emissions standards to biofuel use across the bloc . germany 's auto lobby might be feeling celebratory these days , though the oil producers may have shed some tears .
the european commission on wednesday suggested tightening fuel ecology standards as a measure toward combating climate change . observers read this as a sign that , in its battle against global warming , brussels is ready to shift its focus away from tighter standards on car motors and onto " greener " fuels by having gas and diesel providers monitoring greenhouse gas emissions during the delivery , refining , and transport of oil . missing the target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany would rather change the fuel than the motor because the auto industry is likely to miss a voluntary goal of cutting carbon dioxide emissions for new cars , european commission president jose manuel barroso and environment commissioner stavros dimas want binding legislation that would require carmakers to reduce new cars ' co2 emissions to an industry average of 120 grams per kilometer in 2012 . in addition , the eu wants to limit the sulfur content of diesel fuel .
instead , a new type of fuel with a higher content of " clean " bioethanol should be developed , the eu said . merkel joins in debate but while the goal of the eu is to lower co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , the german car industry - and german chancellor angela merkel , who has gone to battle in brussels on its behalf - is opposed to blanket measures that would apply to all cars , regardless of their size . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has stepped in to fight for the german car industry on monday , merkel waded into the fray , saying it was " regrettable " that european carmakers would not meet the targets they had set themselves , but adding : " we must not let the result of that be to impose a general obligation for all cars to be subject to the same measure . " merkel added that she would " never " agree to binding limits on makers of bigger cars . michael glos , merkel 's economy minister , also came out in support of the german auto industry on wednesday and accused the commission of following its own industrial agenda . " this is not about environmental policy but hard-nosed industrial policy interests , " he said .
" the european commission 's planned exhaust levels for cars are unacceptable . " the german car lobby has warned that forcing carmakers to modernize their products to meet binding limits would pose a threat to jobs and competitiveness for the german automakers .
the car industry is a major pillar of the german economy . change of focus ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimas is caught between german carmakers and a hard place the eu commission plans present its emissions plan in the coming weeks .
but according to the financial times newspaper , environment commissioner dimas has already given in to german pressure . observers say he is now ready to accept a reduction to 130 grams per kilometer by 2012 , instead of 120 , according to the daily .
the difference would then need to be made up by improvements in development and use of cleaner fuels . eu industry commissioner günter verheugen also agreed with this new plan .
in the case of the auto industry , he said he is in favor of an " integrated approach " to greenhouse gas reduction .
instead of binding emissions limits , verheugen promoted ideas like limiting traffic , improving tires , and cleaner fuels . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel opposed to eu plans for car emissions scheme german chancellor merkel said she would resist attempts from the eu commission to impose caps on auto emissions which would apply to all new cars in the bloc .

it appears germany 's mighty automobile lobby is getting its way in brussels , as the eu moves its regulatory focus from emissions standards to biofuel use across the bloc . germany 's auto lobby might be feeling celebratory these days , though the oil producers may have shed some tears .
the european commission on wednesday suggested tightening fuel ecology standards as a measure toward combating climate change . observers read this as a sign that , in its battle against global warming , brussels is ready to shift its focus away from tighter standards on car motors and onto " greener " fuels by having gas and diesel providers monitoring greenhouse gas emissions during the delivery , refining , and transport of oil . missing the target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany would rather change the fuel than the motor because the auto industry is likely to miss a voluntary goal of cutting carbon dioxide emissions for new cars , european commission president jose manuel barroso and environment commissioner stavros dimas want binding legislation that would require carmakers to reduce new cars ' co2 emissions to an industry average of 120 grams per kilometer in 2012 . in addition , the eu wants to limit the sulfur content of diesel fuel .
instead , a new type of fuel with a higher content of " clean " bioethanol should be developed , the eu said . merkel joins in debate but while the goal of the eu is to lower co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , the german car industry - and german chancellor angela merkel , who has gone to battle in brussels on its behalf - is opposed to blanket measures that would apply to all cars , regardless of their size . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has stepped in to fight for the german car industry on monday , merkel waded into the fray , saying it was " regrettable " that european carmakers would not meet the targets they had set themselves , but adding : " we must not let the result of that be to impose a general obligation for all cars to be subject to the same measure . " merkel added that she would " never " agree to binding limits on makers of bigger cars . michael glos , merkel 's economy minister , also came out in support of the german auto industry on wednesday and accused the commission of following its own industrial agenda . " this is not about environmental policy but hard-nosed industrial policy interests , " he said .
" the european commission 's planned exhaust levels for cars are unacceptable . " the german car lobby has warned that forcing carmakers to modernize their products to meet binding limits would pose a threat to jobs and competitiveness for the german automakers .
the car industry is a major pillar of the german economy . change of focus ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimas is caught between german carmakers and a hard place the eu commission plans present its emissions plan in the coming weeks .
but according to the financial times newspaper , environment commissioner dimas has already given in to german pressure . observers say he is now ready to accept a reduction to 130 grams per kilometer by 2012 , instead of 120 , according to the daily .
the difference would then need to be made up by improvements in development and use of cleaner fuels . eu industry commissioner günter verheugen also agreed with this new plan .
in the case of the auto industry , he said he is in favor of an " integrated approach " to greenhouse gas reduction .
instead of binding emissions limits , verheugen promoted ideas like limiting traffic , improving tires , and cleaner fuels . dw staff -lrb- jen -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel opposed to eu plans for car emissions scheme german chancellor merkel said she would resist attempts from the eu commission to impose caps on auto emissions which would apply to all new cars in the bloc .

he is joined by newcomer mario gomez and a host of returning stars . germany coach joachim löw was in frankfurt at the weekend to see the 24-year-old kuranyi net a brace in the 3-1 victory over eintracht frankfurt to help his side stay joint top of the bundesliga with werder bremen . " kevin has shown shortly before the winter break and now since the bundesliga restarted that his form is improving , " said löw . kuranyi last played for germany in november 2005 in the scoreless draw against france in paris and failed to make his country 's world cup squad .
his club form took a dive soon after joining schalke from stuttgart in 2005 , scoring just 10 goals in 30 appearances for the club .
by the end of the world cup season , kuranyi 's body language spoke of a striker running on empty . kuranyi 's world cup nightmare dissipating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi 's world cup pain was obvious but since the beginning of this current season , with his world cup disappointment behind him , kuranyi has bagged on average a goal every other game and is looking decidedly more confident . the competition for places up front for germany got even hotter with the announcement that löw was also calling up stuttgart 's in-form striker mario gomez for the switzerland game . a product of the stuttgart youth system , gomez has hit ten goals in 18 games for stuttgart and has been integral in the southern club 's push for the champions league places , a surge that saw them set an early pace at the top of the league . germany coach löw was watching on tuesday night when the 22-year-old scored a brace against arminia bielefeld , fuelling rumors that a place in the national squad was being considered . klose a shoe-in , but poldi 's form raises questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's main strikers are experiencing different luck while first choice striker miroslav klose is firing on all cylinders for high-scoring league leaders werder bremen , lukas podolski , klose 's usual international partner in attack , is fairing less favorably at bayern munich . podolski has just one goal to his name this season in his sporadic appearances for the champions .
while löw is known to have great faith in podolski , the striker 's current club form may raise some questions in the future which the coach may find hard to ignore .
the topic of podolski 's inclusion is a mute point however as he is suspended for the switzerland friendly . with kuranyi and gomez entering the equation , löw may be tempted to experiment against the swiss at some point during the 90 minutes , especially as borussia mönchengladbach 's veteran striker oliver neuville will be missing through injury . return of the formerly walking wounded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi löw rings the changes löw also said he we has happy to name borussia dortmund 's christoph metzelder and werder bremen 's tim borowski in the squad and said that borowski was likely to start against the swiss . the same goes for teammate per mertesacker , who makes his return to the german squad for the first time since last summer 's world cup following his achilles operation last autumn . " per will definitely return , " said löw .
" he has been playing permanently for bremen . " metzelder returns to the national team after a six-month absence due to injury .

separately , hamburg says it will take a share in a consortium buying a stake in parent company eads . amid reports that the world 's largest plane maker , airbus , is planning a tough cost-cutting operation , the german city-state of hamburg confirmed thursday that it will take a 10-percent share in a consortium acquiring the 7.5-percent stake in parent company eads .
the stake is being sold by german-us auto giant , daimlerchrysler . based on the current share price of 25.83 euros -lrb- $ 33.6 -rrb- , hamburg 's stake would be worth 160 million euros.the two neighboring north german states of lower saxony and bremen have already signaled their intention to invest 80 million euros and 30 million euros respectively in the acquisition of the stake . germany is currently represented in eads via a 22.5-percent share held by daimlerchrysler . all countries will be " equally unhappy " germany 's oldenburg-based newspaper nordwest zeitung reported thursday that thomas enders , co-chief of the eads , which fully owns airbus , had said the france-based plane maker would sell off production sites . in an earlier online report , the paper said enders only planned to keep those airbus plants involved in the final assembly or those that make components .
other manufacturing sites would be sold to trim bloated personnel costs and some 10,000 airbus jobs would be axed . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : eads co- head thomas enders has hinted at painul cost-cutting " nobody in germany will be happy about what will be decided , " the paper quoted enders as saying .
but he also said he expected " everybody will be equally unhappy " in all the countries that are home to airbus plants . addressing some 300 guests - including german parliamentarians and representatives of the aviation industry - at the lower saxony embassy in berlin on wednesday , enders spoke of tough cuts in order to push through a restructuring program called " power 8 , " which aims to lower costs and make airbus more competitive for the future . enders , however , is said to have played down fears that airbus production sites in germany would be affected .
" there are no decisions at this point , " enders was quoted to have said . eads says it 's all speculation but spokesman for airbus parent company eads , michael hauger told ap news agency that though enders had spoken of " tough cuts , " he had also stressed that the rumors about job cuts and closing of production plants were pure speculation . hauger added that airbus management was still looking into the " power 8 " program , which would then have to be presented to eads bosses enders and louis gallois before the company 's supervisory board could have its final say . " everything that you hear before that is speculation , " hauger said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2,000 to 4,000 jobs could be axed at the airbus plant in hamburg but reports of massive job losses and the closing down of entire production plants are already doing the rounds in germany . horst niehus , a works council leader at the company 's hamburg factory told union members in a memo that the toulouse-based plane maker may sell manufacturing sites , buy more parts from outside suppliers and move work now done in germany to france . " should all scenarios be realized , it is expected that 5,000 through 8,000 jobs will be lost at airbus germany and 2,000 through 4,000 at hamburg , " niehus said in the report . airbus plans to slash 2.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.7 billion -rrb- from annual costs by 2010 .
eads has said the plane maker will record its first full-year loss ever for 2006 because of cost overruns on its a380 , which is at least two years behind schedule . minister says germany will fight to save jobs german economics minister michael glos said wednesday he will insist on a fair distribution of the burden resulting from airbus ' restructuring measures . " i will do everything possible to call on the french partner and those who run airbus to make sure that any job cuts will be in both countries and not to the disadvantage of german sites , " glos said .
" i will listen to the worries and help wherever i can within a government framework . " germany must get a share in present and future production that corresponds with its weight -lrb- in the company -rrb- , " he added .

but he also said he expected " everybody will be equally unhappy " in all the countries that are home to airbus plants . addressing some 300 guests - including german parliamentarians and representatives of the aviation industry - at the lower saxony embassy in berlin on wednesday , enders spoke of tough cuts in order to push through a restructuring program called " power 8 , " which aims to lower costs and make airbus more competitive for the future . enders , however , is said to have played down fears that airbus production sites in germany would be affected .
" there are no decisions at this point , " enders was quoted to have said . eads says it 's all speculation but spokesman for airbus parent company eads , michael hauger told ap news agency that though enders had spoken of " tough cuts , " he had also stressed that the rumors about job cuts and closing of production plants were pure speculation . hauger added that airbus management was still looking into the " power 8 " program , which would then have to be presented to eads bosses enders and louis gallois before the company 's supervisory board could have its final say . " everything that you hear before that is speculation , " hauger said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some 2,000 to 4,000 jobs could be axed at the airbus plant in hamburg but reports of massive job losses and the closing down of entire production plants are already doing the rounds in germany . horst niehus , a works council leader at the company 's hamburg factory told union members in a memo that the toulouse-based plane maker may sell manufacturing sites , buy more parts from outside suppliers and move work now done in germany to france . " should all scenarios be realized , it is expected that 5,000 through 8,000 jobs will be lost at airbus germany and 2,000 through 4,000 at hamburg , " niehus said in the report . airbus plans to slash 2.1 billion euros -lrb- $ 2.7 billion -rrb- from annual costs by 2010 .
eads has said the plane maker will record its first full-year loss ever for 2006 because of cost overruns on its a380 , which is at least two years behind schedule . minister says germany will fight to save jobs german economics minister michael glos said wednesday he will insist on a fair distribution of the burden resulting from airbus ' restructuring measures . " i will do everything possible to call on the french partner and those who run airbus to make sure that any job cuts will be in both countries and not to the disadvantage of german sites , " glos said .
" i will listen to the worries and help wherever i can within a government framework . " germany must get a share in present and future production that corresponds with its weight -lrb- in the company -rrb- , " he added .
" the german government will lobby for the german business location with all its power - also in its role as one of eads ' biggest contractors .

he is joined by newcomer mario gomez and a host of returning stars . germany coach joachim löw was in frankfurt at the weekend to see the 24-year-old kuranyi net a brace in the 3-1 victory over eintracht frankfurt to help his side stay joint top of the bundesliga with werder bremen . " kevin has shown shortly before the winter break and now since the bundesliga restarted that his form is improving , " said löw . kuranyi last played for germany in november 2005 in the scoreless draw against france in paris and failed to make his country 's world cup squad .
his club form took a dive soon after joining schalke from stuttgart in 2005 , scoring just 10 goals in 30 appearances for the club .
by the end of the world cup season , kuranyi 's body language spoke of a striker running on empty . kuranyi 's world cup nightmare dissipating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi 's world cup pain was obvious but since the beginning of this current season , with his world cup disappointment behind him , kuranyi has bagged on average a goal every other game and is looking decidedly more confident . the competition for places up front for germany got even hotter with the announcement that löw was also calling up stuttgart 's in-form striker mario gomez for the switzerland game . a product of the stuttgart youth system , gomez has hit ten goals in 18 games for stuttgart and has been integral in the southern club 's push for the champions league places , a surge that saw them set an early pace at the top of the league . germany coach löw was watching on tuesday night when the 22-year-old scored a brace against arminia bielefeld , fuelling rumors that a place in the national squad was being considered . klose a shoe-in , but poldi 's form raises questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's main strikers are experiencing different luck while first choice striker miroslav klose is firing on all cylinders for high-scoring league leaders werder bremen , lukas podolski , klose 's usual international partner in attack , is fairing less favorably at bayern munich . podolski has just one goal to his name this season in his sporadic appearances for the champions .
while löw is known to have great faith in podolski , the striker 's current club form may raise some questions in the future which the coach may find hard to ignore .
the topic of podolski 's inclusion is a mute point however as he is suspended for the switzerland friendly . with kuranyi and gomez entering the equation , löw may be tempted to experiment against the swiss at some point during the 90 minutes , especially as borussia mönchengladbach 's veteran striker oliver neuville will be missing through injury . return of the formerly walking wounded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi löw rings the changes löw also said he we has happy to name borussia dortmund 's christoph metzelder and werder bremen 's tim borowski in the squad and said that borowski was likely to start against the swiss . the same goes for teammate per mertesacker , who makes his return to the german squad for the first time since last summer 's world cup following his achilles operation last autumn . " per will definitely return , " said löw .
" he has been playing permanently for bremen . " metzelder returns to the national team after a six-month absence due to injury .

it appears germany 's mighty automobile lobby is getting its way in brussels , as the eu moves its regulatory focus from emissions standards to biofuel use across the bloc . germany 's auto lobby might be feeling celebratory these days , though the oil producers may have shed some tears .
the european commission on wednesday suggested tightening fuel ecology standards as a measure toward combating climate change . observers read this as a sign that , in its battle against global warming , brussels is ready to shift its focus away from tighter standards on car motors and onto " greener " fuels by having gas and diesel providers monitoring greenhouse gas emissions during the delivery , refining , and transport of oil . missing the target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany would rather change the fuel than the motor because the auto industry is likely to miss a voluntary goal of cutting carbon dioxide emissions for new cars , european commission president jose manuel barroso and environment commissioner stavros dimas want binding legislation that would require carmakers to reduce new cars ' co2 emissions to an industry average of 120 grams per kilometer in 2012 . in addition , the eu wants to limit the sulfur content of diesel fuel .
instead , a new type of fuel with a higher content of " clean " bioethanol should be developed , the eu said . merkel joins in debate but while the goal of the eu is to lower co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , the german car industry - and german chancellor angela merkel , who has gone to battle in brussels on its behalf - is opposed to blanket measures that would apply to all cars , regardless of their size . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has stepped in to fight for the german car industry on monday , merkel waded into the fray , saying it was " regrettable " that european carmakers would not meet the targets they had set themselves , but adding : " we must not let the result of that be to impose a general obligation for all cars to be subject to the same measure .

" this is not about environmental policy but hard-nosed industrial policy interests , " he said .
" the european commission 's planned exhaust levels for cars are unacceptable . " the german car lobby has warned that forcing carmakers to modernize their products to meet binding limits would pose a threat to jobs and competitiveness for the german automakers .

it appears germany 's mighty automobile lobby is getting its way in brussels , as the eu moves its regulatory focus from emissions standards to biofuel use across the bloc . germany 's auto lobby might be feeling celebratory these days , though the oil producers may have shed some tears .
the european commission on wednesday suggested tightening fuel ecology standards as a measure toward combating climate change . observers read this as a sign that , in its battle against global warming , brussels is ready to shift its focus away from tighter standards on car motors and onto " greener " fuels by having gas and diesel providers monitoring greenhouse gas emissions during the delivery , refining , and transport of oil . missing the target bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany would rather change the fuel than the motor because the auto industry is likely to miss a voluntary goal of cutting carbon dioxide emissions for new cars , european commission president jose manuel barroso and environment commissioner stavros dimas want binding legislation that would require carmakers to reduce new cars ' co2 emissions to an industry average of 120 grams per kilometer in 2012 . in addition , the eu wants to limit the sulfur content of diesel fuel .
instead , a new type of fuel with a higher content of " clean " bioethanol should be developed , the eu said . merkel joins in debate but while the goal of the eu is to lower co2 emissions by 20 percent by 2020 , the german car industry - and german chancellor angela merkel , who has gone to battle in brussels on its behalf - is opposed to blanket measures that would apply to all cars , regardless of their size . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : merkel has stepped in to fight for the german car industry on monday , merkel waded into the fray , saying it was " regrettable " that european carmakers would not meet the targets they had set themselves , but adding : " we must not let the result of that be to impose a general obligation for all cars to be subject to the same measure . " merkel added that she would " never " agree to binding limits on makers of bigger cars . michael glos , merkel 's economy minister , also came out in support of the german auto industry on wednesday and accused the commission of following its own industrial agenda . " this is not about environmental policy but hard-nosed industrial policy interests , " he said .
" the european commission 's planned exhaust levels for cars are unacceptable . " the german car lobby has warned that forcing carmakers to modernize their products to meet binding limits would pose a threat to jobs and competitiveness for the german automakers .
the car industry is a major pillar of the german economy . change of focus ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : dimas is caught between german carmakers and a hard place the eu commission plans present its emissions plan in the coming weeks .
but according to the financial times newspaper , environment commissioner dimas has already given in to german pressure . observers say he is now ready to accept a reduction to 130 grams per kilometer by 2012 , instead of 120 , according to the daily .
the difference would then need to be made up by improvements in development and use of cleaner fuels . eu industry commissioner günter verheugen also agreed with this new plan .
in the case of the auto industry , he said he is in favor of an " integrated approach " to greenhouse gas reduction .

"
" otherwise , the church will be left with just one third of its current membership and only fifty percent of its current funds by 2030 , " it warned .
so the alarm bells were ringing when some 300 church representatives and politicians came together for a congress in wittenberg to discuss ways of braking this accelerating trend .
according to the organizers from the ekd , the solution is a slate of reforms designed to usher in a " decade of change " set to culminate on the 500th anniversary of luther 's theses in 2017 .
identity crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what relevance does christ have in today 's world ?
the proposals included cutting back the country 's regional churches from 23 to a maximum of 12 , with the squeeze primarily on traditional , smaller parishes .
in future , the ekd wants to see the congregations of the individual regional churches number at least 1 million - twice the size of many of the smallest existing communities .
but these are n't the main challenges .
the church 's strapped finances are problematic enough , but the congress participants were well aware that far more is at stake than a leaking roof or two .
ultimately , the church knows it needs to reappraise its role and find a new place for faith within contemporary society .
" it 's time for a new departure , " parliamentary deputy speaker katrin göring-eckardt of the green party told the congress .
" and not primarily because of declining membership and lack of funds . "
göring-eckardt dismissed complaints that the ekd treated the church like a business in need of a turn-around by bandying around terms like ' quality control ' and ' quotas , ' and stressed the church 's need to adapt to the times .
" we need a worldly church , not an other-worldly church , " she said .
the business of religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : redefining its role many agree that a bit of business acumen is exactly what the church needs .
the days when even handing around a collection plate was an embarrassing concession to earthly matters are long over , and thies gundlach from the ekd says the church has to become less coy about resorting to best-practice marketing tricks .
" the church would be betraying itself if it behaved like a business , " he said .
" but in the bible , paul says : ' test everything , retain what is good , ' which is a principle that does allow us to learn a few lessons from business and economics - from customer loyalty to promoting the protestant brand - so long as we never forget that the church will never be a company like any other . "
his feelings are shared by swen schönheit , pastor at the apostle petrus church in berlin .
an angular building built in the 1960s , it could n't seem less inviting from the outside , but what it lacks in aesthetics it more than makes up for in atmosphere , defying the national trend by regularly welcoming a full house on sundays .
" what many churches in germany lack is charisma , " he says .
" the church has suffered a loss of spiritual energy , it lacks relevance .
its crisis is a spiritual one not a financial one . "
and it 's no one 's fault but its own , he says .
" society is seeing a boom in religious interest , there 's a renewal of spiritual soul-searching going on in germany , but this is completely passing by the church , and it 's time the church found a way of harnessing it . "
" it has to realize it is in competition with other sources of spirituality within society and get its act together , " he insists .
the new religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many feel the church needs more of a human touch his own church obviously has .
community activities range from children 's dance classes to group summer holidays , while the sunday service kicks off with a house band switching on the electric amplifier as the congregation sings along with the help of a power point show .
but to some , this form of happy-clappy religion is suspiciously reminiscent of the born-again evangelism popular in the us - one which goes hand-in-hand with a christian-right political agenda deeply foreign to secular european sensibilities .
but it 's unlikely german protestants will ever head in this direction .
" traditionally , religious affiliation has been a private matter in germany due to the separation of church and state , " explains urike murmann , pastor at hamburg 's st katherine 's church .
that said , she does believe a dose of showmanship never goes amiss .
" going to church should be cheerful , it should be fun , " she says .
" we 've seen that people respond very well when we offer music or theatre . "
but she also knows where to draw the line .
" of course , if it descended into a superficial entertainment , that would be terrible . "
her main emphasis is on the community role of the church , and she says that it 's already learning how to be more aware of parish needs .
" in hamburg , we look carefully at what our congregation wants and we tailor our activities accordingly .
we know we need to do more than just lecture people . "
but even though a number of churches across the country are managing to fill their pews by offering a new and improved form of protestantism , their popularity is failing to translate into church membership .
attending church is one thing , actually joining is another .
and the reasons might be purely mundane .
the spirit is willing , one might say , but the flesh is weak .
" the church tax is a stumbling block , " says murmann .
" it 's not easy to persuade people it 's valid .
furthermore , there 's been a growing skepticism towards institutions in recent years .
people do n't join political parties , they do n't join unions .
the church is no exception . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reformers turn up heat on church critics have been present at world youth day , bringing up issues such as the role of women , family planning and gay rights .

"
" otherwise , the church will be left with just one third of its current membership and only fifty percent of its current funds by 2030 , " it warned .
so the alarm bells were ringing when some 300 church representatives and politicians came together for a congress in wittenberg to discuss ways of braking this accelerating trend .
according to the organizers from the ekd , the solution is a slate of reforms designed to usher in a " decade of change " set to culminate on the 500th anniversary of luther 's theses in 2017 .
identity crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what relevance does christ have in today 's world ?
the proposals included cutting back the country 's regional churches from 23 to a maximum of 12 , with the squeeze primarily on traditional , smaller parishes .
in future , the ekd wants to see the congregations of the individual regional churches number at least 1 million - twice the size of many of the smallest existing communities .
but these are n't the main challenges .
the church 's strapped finances are problematic enough , but the congress participants were well aware that far more is at stake than a leaking roof or two .
ultimately , the church knows it needs to reappraise its role and find a new place for faith within contemporary society .
" it 's time for a new departure , " parliamentary deputy speaker katrin göring-eckardt of the green party told the congress .
" and not primarily because of declining membership and lack of funds . "
göring-eckardt dismissed complaints that the ekd treated the church like a business in need of a turn-around by bandying around terms like ' quality control ' and ' quotas , ' and stressed the church 's need to adapt to the times .
" we need a worldly church , not an other-worldly church , " she said .
the business of religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : redefining its role many agree that a bit of business acumen is exactly what the church needs .
the days when even handing around a collection plate was an embarrassing concession to earthly matters are long over , and thies gundlach from the ekd says the church has to become less coy about resorting to best-practice marketing tricks .
" the church would be betraying itself if it behaved like a business , " he said .
" but in the bible , paul says : ' test everything , retain what is good , ' which is a principle that does allow us to learn a few lessons from business and economics - from customer loyalty to promoting the protestant brand - so long as we never forget that the church will never be a company like any other .

his feelings are shared by swen schönheit , pastor at the apostle petrus church in berlin .
an angular building built in the 1960s , it could n't seem less inviting from the outside , but what it lacks in aesthetics it more than makes up for in atmosphere , defying the national trend by regularly welcoming a full house on sundays .
" what many churches in germany lack is charisma , " he says .
" the church has suffered a loss of spiritual energy , it lacks relevance .
its crisis is a spiritual one not a financial one . "
and it 's no one 's fault but its own , he says .
" society is seeing a boom in religious interest , there 's a renewal of spiritual soul-searching going on in germany , but this is completely passing by the church , and it 's time the church found a way of harnessing it . "
" it has to realize it is in competition with other sources of spirituality within society and get its act together , " he insists .

community activities range from children 's dance classes to group summer holidays , while the sunday service kicks off with a house band switching on the electric amplifier as the congregation sings along with the help of a power point show .
but to some , this form of happy-clappy religion is suspiciously reminiscent of the born-again evangelism popular in the us - one which goes hand-in-hand with a christian-right political agenda deeply foreign to secular european sensibilities .
but it 's unlikely german protestants will ever head in this direction .
" traditionally , religious affiliation has been a private matter in germany due to the separation of church and state , " explains urike murmann , pastor at hamburg 's st katherine 's church .
that said , she does believe a dose of showmanship never goes amiss .
" going to church should be cheerful , it should be fun , " she says .
" we 've seen that people respond very well when we offer music or theatre . "
but she also knows where to draw the line .
" of course , if it descended into a superficial entertainment , that would be terrible . "
her main emphasis is on the community role of the church , and she says that it 's already learning how to be more aware of parish needs .
" in hamburg , we look carefully at what our congregation wants and we tailor our activities accordingly .
we know we need to do more than just lecture people . "

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 01.02.2007 sponsors follow own path in fight against doping großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urine testing is one way to check for illegal substances .
a doping scandal is a nightmare for athletes and fans , but corporate sponsors may be the ones who suffer most .
marketers hope new international rules and corporate vigilance will aid in damage control . on thursday , an international unesco convention on doping goes into effect .
while the agreement is unlikely to put a stop to doping in sports any time soon , it represents the first time that governments around the world have agreed to throw the force of international law behind the problem . " until now , doping cases have been handled by sporting authorities .
this puts it in the countries ' courts of law , " said christoph breuer , a professor of sports management at the athletics college of cologne . the international accord can be seen as a vote of confidence in german 's national anti-doping agency , nada , and its international offshoot , world anti doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- . dancing to their own tune bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich , right , no longer wears the t-mobile jersey .
he was fired amid doping allegations but corporate sponsors , who may have millions riding on the image of cleanliness in sports , have stayed out of the fray , mostly dealing with the issue in their own way . " as far as i know , sponsors have been fairly reluctant to join in the active fight against doping , " said christian sachs , a spokesman for the federal interior ministry committee that supported the un treaty .
" we want to encourage sponsors within the field of sport to contribute to the funding of nada , which they have hardly done up to now . " indeed , corporate sponsors generally take a reactive , not a proactive , stance , said breuer from the athletics college . the upside of scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cycling and track and field are the two sports where doping is said to be rampant " often , when an athlete is first suspected of doping , a corporate sponsor 's first reaction is to stand behind them and protect them , " he said .
" but once the charges are proven , the sponsors often separate from the athlete . " yet , breuer added , there are certain instances in which doping allegations can actually work in a sponsor 's favor : " for an unknown firm , a doping case might serve to boost its profile .
even if its negative publicity , the name will be known .

"
" otherwise , the church will be left with just one third of its current membership and only fifty percent of its current funds by 2030 , " it warned .
so the alarm bells were ringing when some 300 church representatives and politicians came together for a congress in wittenberg to discuss ways of braking this accelerating trend .
according to the organizers from the ekd , the solution is a slate of reforms designed to usher in a " decade of change " set to culminate on the 500th anniversary of luther 's theses in 2017 .
identity crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what relevance does christ have in today 's world ?
the proposals included cutting back the country 's regional churches from 23 to a maximum of 12 , with the squeeze primarily on traditional , smaller parishes .
in future , the ekd wants to see the congregations of the individual regional churches number at least 1 million - twice the size of many of the smallest existing communities .
but these are n't the main challenges .
the church 's strapped finances are problematic enough , but the congress participants were well aware that far more is at stake than a leaking roof or two .
ultimately , the church knows it needs to reappraise its role and find a new place for faith within contemporary society .
" it 's time for a new departure , " parliamentary deputy speaker katrin göring-eckardt of the green party told the congress .
" and not primarily because of declining membership and lack of funds . "
göring-eckardt dismissed complaints that the ekd treated the church like a business in need of a turn-around by bandying around terms like ' quality control ' and ' quotas , ' and stressed the church 's need to adapt to the times .

community activities range from children 's dance classes to group summer holidays , while the sunday service kicks off with a house band switching on the electric amplifier as the congregation sings along with the help of a power point show .
but to some , this form of happy-clappy religion is suspiciously reminiscent of the born-again evangelism popular in the us - one which goes hand-in-hand with a christian-right political agenda deeply foreign to secular european sensibilities .
but it 's unlikely german protestants will ever head in this direction .
" traditionally , religious affiliation has been a private matter in germany due to the separation of church and state , " explains urike murmann , pastor at hamburg 's st katherine 's church .

we know we need to do more than just lecture people . "

"
" otherwise , the church will be left with just one third of its current membership and only fifty percent of its current funds by 2030 , " it warned .
so the alarm bells were ringing when some 300 church representatives and politicians came together for a congress in wittenberg to discuss ways of braking this accelerating trend .
according to the organizers from the ekd , the solution is a slate of reforms designed to usher in a " decade of change " set to culminate on the 500th anniversary of luther 's theses in 2017 .
identity crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what relevance does christ have in today 's world ?
the proposals included cutting back the country 's regional churches from 23 to a maximum of 12 , with the squeeze primarily on traditional , smaller parishes .
in future , the ekd wants to see the congregations of the individual regional churches number at least 1 million - twice the size of many of the smallest existing communities .
but these are n't the main challenges .
the church 's strapped finances are problematic enough , but the congress participants were well aware that far more is at stake than a leaking roof or two .
ultimately , the church knows it needs to reappraise its role and find a new place for faith within contemporary society .
" it 's time for a new departure , " parliamentary deputy speaker katrin göring-eckardt of the green party told the congress .
" and not primarily because of declining membership and lack of funds . "
göring-eckardt dismissed complaints that the ekd treated the church like a business in need of a turn-around by bandying around terms like ' quality control ' and ' quotas , ' and stressed the church 's need to adapt to the times .
" we need a worldly church , not an other-worldly church , " she said .
the business of religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : redefining its role many agree that a bit of business acumen is exactly what the church needs .

" if we continue along the current path , the present fragmented industrial bases in europe will not be sustainable , " verheugen told a defense conference in brussels . verheugen stressed that the european defense sector in its current form was riddled with inefficiency and national protectionism .
maintaining national control in the defence sector has pushed the prices up and undermined the future of the 300,000 jobs in defense manufacturing across the eu . " it means a lack of competition , an inability to exploit economies of scale and , above all , poor value for money for european taxpayers , " he said . opening up the borders even though eu governments agreed last year to open up markets to more cross-border competition last year , the defense-related industries have been largely kept out of the remit of the internal market . the 27-nation block , for instance , has 23 distinct national programs for building armored fighting vehicles . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european union foreign policy chief javier solana " cross-border competition in a continental-sized market is essential , " eu foreign policy chief jaiver solana told the conference .
" this is a matter on which its -lrb- the industry 's -rrb- survival rests . " the eu commission is expected to propose a new legislation later this year that would open the 30 billion euro -lrb- $ 39 billion -rrb- defense market to more cross-national competition .
it would also remove the need for eu exporters to obtain security licenses for exporting defense-related goods to other eu nations . at the moment , around 12,000 requests for such licenses are filed every year .
in view of the close military cooperation between eu governments , only 15 licenses were refused in 2003 , and none in 2004 and 2005 . " on the government side , we must combine our requirements so as to offer industry projects with a worthwhile economy of scale .
and we must encourage the restructuring and consolidation of the supply side as well , " solana said . trans-atlantic competition bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european commissioner for enterprise and industry günter verheugen verheugen , who also serves as vice president of the european commission , blasted the united states for not opening up its defense markets to european contractors . " the protectionist spirit in the united sates is much more strong than in europe , " verheugen said . " especially in congress , it is obvious that as a result of the american electoral system you find such a position that american jobs must be protected , even if it is economically not very sound , " he said . after his recent meetings in washington , however , verheugen said he was optimistic that " a first set of rules " which would improve the exchange between the us and the eu could emerge later this year . " if that does not work , it would be disappointing , " he said . dw staff -lrb- tt -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de leaders meet in berlin to bolster eu defense force eu industry and government leaders are meeting in berlin to discuss a host of defense topics , including making sure that european mobile battle groups are ready to report for duty early next year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de internationals -pipe- 01.02.2007 kuranyi back for germany ; gomez gets nod from löw großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi cuts a more confident figure these days in comparison to the broken man of 2006 after a year he would rather forget , schalke striker kevin kuranyi is back in the international fold for germany 's friendly against the swiss next week .
he is joined by newcomer mario gomez and a host of returning stars . germany coach joachim löw was in frankfurt at the weekend to see the 24-year-old kuranyi net a brace in the 3-1 victory over eintracht frankfurt to help his side stay joint top of the bundesliga with werder bremen . " kevin has shown shortly before the winter break and now since the bundesliga restarted that his form is improving , " said löw . kuranyi last played for germany in november 2005 in the scoreless draw against france in paris and failed to make his country 's world cup squad .
his club form took a dive soon after joining schalke from stuttgart in 2005 , scoring just 10 goals in 30 appearances for the club .
by the end of the world cup season , kuranyi 's body language spoke of a striker running on empty . kuranyi 's world cup nightmare dissipating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi 's world cup pain was obvious but since the beginning of this current season , with his world cup disappointment behind him , kuranyi has bagged on average a goal every other game and is looking decidedly more confident . the competition for places up front for germany got even hotter with the announcement that löw was also calling up stuttgart 's in-form striker mario gomez for the switzerland game . a product of the stuttgart youth system , gomez has hit ten goals in 18 games for stuttgart and has been integral in the southern club 's push for the champions league places , a surge that saw them set an early pace at the top of the league . germany coach löw was watching on tuesday night when the 22-year-old scored a brace against arminia bielefeld , fuelling rumors that a place in the national squad was being considered . klose a shoe-in , but poldi 's form raises questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's main strikers are experiencing different luck while first choice striker miroslav klose is firing on all cylinders for high-scoring league leaders werder bremen , lukas podolski , klose 's usual international partner in attack , is fairing less favorably at bayern munich . podolski has just one goal to his name this season in his sporadic appearances for the champions .
while löw is known to have great faith in podolski , the striker 's current club form may raise some questions in the future which the coach may find hard to ignore .
the topic of podolski 's inclusion is a mute point however as he is suspended for the switzerland friendly . with kuranyi and gomez entering the equation , löw may be tempted to experiment against the swiss at some point during the 90 minutes , especially as borussia mönchengladbach 's veteran striker oliver neuville will be missing through injury . return of the formerly walking wounded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi löw rings the changes löw also said he we has happy to name borussia dortmund 's christoph metzelder and werder bremen 's tim borowski in the squad and said that borowski was likely to start against the swiss . the same goes for teammate per mertesacker , who makes his return to the german squad for the first time since last summer 's world cup following his achilles operation last autumn .

he is joined by newcomer mario gomez and a host of returning stars . germany coach joachim löw was in frankfurt at the weekend to see the 24-year-old kuranyi net a brace in the 3-1 victory over eintracht frankfurt to help his side stay joint top of the bundesliga with werder bremen . " kevin has shown shortly before the winter break and now since the bundesliga restarted that his form is improving , " said löw . kuranyi last played for germany in november 2005 in the scoreless draw against france in paris and failed to make his country 's world cup squad .
his club form took a dive soon after joining schalke from stuttgart in 2005 , scoring just 10 goals in 30 appearances for the club .
by the end of the world cup season , kuranyi 's body language spoke of a striker running on empty . kuranyi 's world cup nightmare dissipating bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : kuranyi 's world cup pain was obvious but since the beginning of this current season , with his world cup disappointment behind him , kuranyi has bagged on average a goal every other game and is looking decidedly more confident . the competition for places up front for germany got even hotter with the announcement that löw was also calling up stuttgart 's in-form striker mario gomez for the switzerland game . a product of the stuttgart youth system , gomez has hit ten goals in 18 games for stuttgart and has been integral in the southern club 's push for the champions league places , a surge that saw them set an early pace at the top of the league . germany coach löw was watching on tuesday night when the 22-year-old scored a brace against arminia bielefeld , fuelling rumors that a place in the national squad was being considered . klose a shoe-in , but poldi 's form raises questions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany 's main strikers are experiencing different luck while first choice striker miroslav klose is firing on all cylinders for high-scoring league leaders werder bremen , lukas podolski , klose 's usual international partner in attack , is fairing less favorably at bayern munich . podolski has just one goal to his name this season in his sporadic appearances for the champions .
while löw is known to have great faith in podolski , the striker 's current club form may raise some questions in the future which the coach may find hard to ignore .
the topic of podolski 's inclusion is a mute point however as he is suspended for the switzerland friendly . with kuranyi and gomez entering the equation , löw may be tempted to experiment against the swiss at some point during the 90 minutes , especially as borussia mönchengladbach 's veteran striker oliver neuville will be missing through injury . return of the formerly walking wounded bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : jogi löw rings the changes löw also said he we has happy to name borussia dortmund 's christoph metzelder and werder bremen 's tim borowski in the squad and said that borowski was likely to start against the swiss . the same goes for teammate per mertesacker , who makes his return to the german squad for the first time since last summer 's world cup following his achilles operation last autumn .

"
" otherwise , the church will be left with just one third of its current membership and only fifty percent of its current funds by 2030 , " it warned .
so the alarm bells were ringing when some 300 church representatives and politicians came together for a congress in wittenberg to discuss ways of braking this accelerating trend .
according to the organizers from the ekd , the solution is a slate of reforms designed to usher in a " decade of change " set to culminate on the 500th anniversary of luther 's theses in 2017 .
identity crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what relevance does christ have in today 's world ?
the proposals included cutting back the country 's regional churches from 23 to a maximum of 12 , with the squeeze primarily on traditional , smaller parishes .
in future , the ekd wants to see the congregations of the individual regional churches number at least 1 million - twice the size of many of the smallest existing communities .
but these are n't the main challenges .
the church 's strapped finances are problematic enough , but the congress participants were well aware that far more is at stake than a leaking roof or two .
ultimately , the church knows it needs to reappraise its role and find a new place for faith within contemporary society .
" it 's time for a new departure , " parliamentary deputy speaker katrin göring-eckardt of the green party told the congress .
" and not primarily because of declining membership and lack of funds . "
göring-eckardt dismissed complaints that the ekd treated the church like a business in need of a turn-around by bandying around terms like ' quality control ' and ' quotas , ' and stressed the church 's need to adapt to the times .
" we need a worldly church , not an other-worldly church , " she said .
the business of religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : redefining its role many agree that a bit of business acumen is exactly what the church needs .
the days when even handing around a collection plate was an embarrassing concession to earthly matters are long over , and thies gundlach from the ekd says the church has to become less coy about resorting to best-practice marketing tricks .
" the church would be betraying itself if it behaved like a business , " he said .
" but in the bible , paul says : ' test everything , retain what is good , ' which is a principle that does allow us to learn a few lessons from business and economics - from customer loyalty to promoting the protestant brand - so long as we never forget that the church will never be a company like any other . "
his feelings are shared by swen schönheit , pastor at the apostle petrus church in berlin .
an angular building built in the 1960s , it could n't seem less inviting from the outside , but what it lacks in aesthetics it more than makes up for in atmosphere , defying the national trend by regularly welcoming a full house on sundays .
" what many churches in germany lack is charisma , " he says .
" the church has suffered a loss of spiritual energy , it lacks relevance .
its crisis is a spiritual one not a financial one . "
and it 's no one 's fault but its own , he says .
" society is seeing a boom in religious interest , there 's a renewal of spiritual soul-searching going on in germany , but this is completely passing by the church , and it 's time the church found a way of harnessing it . "
" it has to realize it is in competition with other sources of spirituality within society and get its act together , " he insists .
the new religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many feel the church needs more of a human touch his own church obviously has .
community activities range from children 's dance classes to group summer holidays , while the sunday service kicks off with a house band switching on the electric amplifier as the congregation sings along with the help of a power point show .
but to some , this form of happy-clappy religion is suspiciously reminiscent of the born-again evangelism popular in the us - one which goes hand-in-hand with a christian-right political agenda deeply foreign to secular european sensibilities .
but it 's unlikely german protestants will ever head in this direction .
" traditionally , religious affiliation has been a private matter in germany due to the separation of church and state , " explains urike murmann , pastor at hamburg 's st katherine 's church .
that said , she does believe a dose of showmanship never goes amiss .
" going to church should be cheerful , it should be fun , " she says .
" we 've seen that people respond very well when we offer music or theatre . "
but she also knows where to draw the line .
" of course , if it descended into a superficial entertainment , that would be terrible . "
her main emphasis is on the community role of the church , and she says that it 's already learning how to be more aware of parish needs .
" in hamburg , we look carefully at what our congregation wants and we tailor our activities accordingly .
we know we need to do more than just lecture people . "
but even though a number of churches across the country are managing to fill their pews by offering a new and improved form of protestantism , their popularity is failing to translate into church membership .
attending church is one thing , actually joining is another .
and the reasons might be purely mundane .
the spirit is willing , one might say , but the flesh is weak .
" the church tax is a stumbling block , " says murmann .
" it 's not easy to persuade people it 's valid .
furthermore , there 's been a growing skepticism towards institutions in recent years .
people do n't join political parties , they do n't join unions .
the church is no exception . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reformers turn up heat on church critics have been present at world youth day , bringing up issues such as the role of women , family planning and gay rights .

"
" otherwise , the church will be left with just one third of its current membership and only fifty percent of its current funds by 2030 , " it warned .
so the alarm bells were ringing when some 300 church representatives and politicians came together for a congress in wittenberg to discuss ways of braking this accelerating trend .
according to the organizers from the ekd , the solution is a slate of reforms designed to usher in a " decade of change " set to culminate on the 500th anniversary of luther 's theses in 2017 .
identity crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what relevance does christ have in today 's world ?
the proposals included cutting back the country 's regional churches from 23 to a maximum of 12 , with the squeeze primarily on traditional , smaller parishes .
in future , the ekd wants to see the congregations of the individual regional churches number at least 1 million - twice the size of many of the smallest existing communities .
but these are n't the main challenges .
the church 's strapped finances are problematic enough , but the congress participants were well aware that far more is at stake than a leaking roof or two .
ultimately , the church knows it needs to reappraise its role and find a new place for faith within contemporary society .
" it 's time for a new departure , " parliamentary deputy speaker katrin göring-eckardt of the green party told the congress .
" and not primarily because of declining membership and lack of funds . "
göring-eckardt dismissed complaints that the ekd treated the church like a business in need of a turn-around by bandying around terms like ' quality control ' and ' quotas , ' and stressed the church 's need to adapt to the times .
" we need a worldly church , not an other-worldly church , " she said .
the business of religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : redefining its role many agree that a bit of business acumen is exactly what the church needs .
the days when even handing around a collection plate was an embarrassing concession to earthly matters are long over , and thies gundlach from the ekd says the church has to become less coy about resorting to best-practice marketing tricks .
" the church would be betraying itself if it behaved like a business , " he said .
" but in the bible , paul says : ' test everything , retain what is good , ' which is a principle that does allow us to learn a few lessons from business and economics - from customer loyalty to promoting the protestant brand - so long as we never forget that the church will never be a company like any other . "
his feelings are shared by swen schönheit , pastor at the apostle petrus church in berlin .
an angular building built in the 1960s , it could n't seem less inviting from the outside , but what it lacks in aesthetics it more than makes up for in atmosphere , defying the national trend by regularly welcoming a full house on sundays .
" what many churches in germany lack is charisma , " he says .
" the church has suffered a loss of spiritual energy , it lacks relevance .
its crisis is a spiritual one not a financial one . "
and it 's no one 's fault but its own , he says .
" society is seeing a boom in religious interest , there 's a renewal of spiritual soul-searching going on in germany , but this is completely passing by the church , and it 's time the church found a way of harnessing it . "
" it has to realize it is in competition with other sources of spirituality within society and get its act together , " he insists .
the new religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many feel the church needs more of a human touch his own church obviously has .
community activities range from children 's dance classes to group summer holidays , while the sunday service kicks off with a house band switching on the electric amplifier as the congregation sings along with the help of a power point show .
but to some , this form of happy-clappy religion is suspiciously reminiscent of the born-again evangelism popular in the us - one which goes hand-in-hand with a christian-right political agenda deeply foreign to secular european sensibilities .
but it 's unlikely german protestants will ever head in this direction .
" traditionally , religious affiliation has been a private matter in germany due to the separation of church and state , " explains urike murmann , pastor at hamburg 's st katherine 's church .
that said , she does believe a dose of showmanship never goes amiss .
" going to church should be cheerful , it should be fun , " she says .
" we 've seen that people respond very well when we offer music or theatre . "
but she also knows where to draw the line .
" of course , if it descended into a superficial entertainment , that would be terrible . "
her main emphasis is on the community role of the church , and she says that it 's already learning how to be more aware of parish needs .
" in hamburg , we look carefully at what our congregation wants and we tailor our activities accordingly .
we know we need to do more than just lecture people . "
but even though a number of churches across the country are managing to fill their pews by offering a new and improved form of protestantism , their popularity is failing to translate into church membership .
attending church is one thing , actually joining is another .
and the reasons might be purely mundane .
the spirit is willing , one might say , but the flesh is weak .
" the church tax is a stumbling block , " says murmann .
" it 's not easy to persuade people it 's valid .
furthermore , there 's been a growing skepticism towards institutions in recent years .
people do n't join political parties , they do n't join unions .
the church is no exception . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reformers turn up heat on church critics have been present at world youth day , bringing up issues such as the role of women , family planning and gay rights .

a doping scandal is a nightmare for athletes and fans , but corporate sponsors may be the ones who suffer most .
marketers hope new international rules and corporate vigilance will aid in damage control . on thursday , an international unesco convention on doping goes into effect .
while the agreement is unlikely to put a stop to doping in sports any time soon , it represents the first time that governments around the world have agreed to throw the force of international law behind the problem . " until now , doping cases have been handled by sporting authorities .
this puts it in the countries ' courts of law , " said christoph breuer , a professor of sports management at the athletics college of cologne . the international accord can be seen as a vote of confidence in german 's national anti-doping agency , nada , and its international offshoot , world anti doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- . dancing to their own tune bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich , right , no longer wears the t-mobile jersey .
he was fired amid doping allegations but corporate sponsors , who may have millions riding on the image of cleanliness in sports , have stayed out of the fray , mostly dealing with the issue in their own way . " as far as i know , sponsors have been fairly reluctant to join in the active fight against doping , " said christian sachs , a spokesman for the federal interior ministry committee that supported the un treaty .
" we want to encourage sponsors within the field of sport to contribute to the funding of nada , which they have hardly done up to now . " indeed , corporate sponsors generally take a reactive , not a proactive , stance , said breuer from the athletics college . the upside of scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cycling and track and field are the two sports where doping is said to be rampant " often , when an athlete is first suspected of doping , a corporate sponsor 's first reaction is to stand behind them and protect them , " he said .
" but once the charges are proven , the sponsors often separate from the athlete . " yet , breuer added , there are certain instances in which doping allegations can actually work in a sponsor 's favor : " for an unknown firm , a doping case might serve to boost its profile .
even if its negative publicity , the name will be known . " for the past several years , it has been the norm in the sports marketing world for sponsors to put an escape clause in their contract that ends the sponsorship if an athlete or team is accused or convicted of doping . still , the bad taste of a doping accusation can linger , and become an image nightmare for a company that has the misfortune to back the wrong athletes . the case of jan ullrich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german biathlete thomas oelsner was suspended from the paralympics for alleged doping " this is the most castastrophic thing that can happen in sports sponsoring , and we advise our clients to be very careful before they get into any endorsement contracts , " said stephan schröder , who is on the managing board of the cologne-based sports marketing consultancy sport + markt . schröder cited as an example the case of jan ullrich .
the german cycling star was booted by his sponsor t-mobile after he was implicated in a highly publicized doping investigation shortly before last summer 's tour de france .
after losing his german racing license , ullrich moved to switzerland and has been busy fending off both german and swiss allegations ever since . t-mobile , meanwhile , was saddled with an enormous image problem - which it fought with an intensive public relations offensive , according to schröder . t-mobile reacts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bodybuilders are often said to turn to steroid use " the company took a very aggressive stance and went straight to the press , " schröder added .
" they distanced themselves from ullrich , and said they were working hard to clean up the image of the rest of the team . " indeed , shortly after the ullrich scandal broke , t-mobile announced plans to take a " tough stance in the fight against doping " by putting a german physician in charge of the team and " consistently evaluating and monitoring the training methods " of the riders .
t-mobile also committed some financial support to the anti-doping agency nada , among other measures . according to schröder , " actively supporting the image of fair play in sports " could be a good solution to the problem sponsors are faced with when fighting an image soiled by doping allegations . pr vs marketing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agony and the extasy : a sponsor 's image is linked to that of its star athletes but others say it is unlikely that voluntary funding for anti-doping agencies would ever take an important role in corporate image building .

a doping scandal is a nightmare for athletes and fans , but corporate sponsors may be the ones who suffer most .
marketers hope new international rules and corporate vigilance will aid in damage control . on thursday , an international unesco convention on doping goes into effect .
while the agreement is unlikely to put a stop to doping in sports any time soon , it represents the first time that governments around the world have agreed to throw the force of international law behind the problem . " until now , doping cases have been handled by sporting authorities .
this puts it in the countries ' courts of law , " said christoph breuer , a professor of sports management at the athletics college of cologne . the international accord can be seen as a vote of confidence in german 's national anti-doping agency , nada , and its international offshoot , world anti doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- . dancing to their own tune bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich , right , no longer wears the t-mobile jersey .
he was fired amid doping allegations but corporate sponsors , who may have millions riding on the image of cleanliness in sports , have stayed out of the fray , mostly dealing with the issue in their own way . " as far as i know , sponsors have been fairly reluctant to join in the active fight against doping , " said christian sachs , a spokesman for the federal interior ministry committee that supported the un treaty .
" we want to encourage sponsors within the field of sport to contribute to the funding of nada , which they have hardly done up to now . " indeed , corporate sponsors generally take a reactive , not a proactive , stance , said breuer from the athletics college . the upside of scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cycling and track and field are the two sports where doping is said to be rampant " often , when an athlete is first suspected of doping , a corporate sponsor 's first reaction is to stand behind them and protect them , " he said .
" but once the charges are proven , the sponsors often separate from the athlete . " yet , breuer added , there are certain instances in which doping allegations can actually work in a sponsor 's favor : " for an unknown firm , a doping case might serve to boost its profile .
even if its negative publicity , the name will be known . " for the past several years , it has been the norm in the sports marketing world for sponsors to put an escape clause in their contract that ends the sponsorship if an athlete or team is accused or convicted of doping . still , the bad taste of a doping accusation can linger , and become an image nightmare for a company that has the misfortune to back the wrong athletes . the case of jan ullrich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german biathlete thomas oelsner was suspended from the paralympics for alleged doping " this is the most castastrophic thing that can happen in sports sponsoring , and we advise our clients to be very careful before they get into any endorsement contracts , " said stephan schröder , who is on the managing board of the cologne-based sports marketing consultancy sport + markt . schröder cited as an example the case of jan ullrich .
the german cycling star was booted by his sponsor t-mobile after he was implicated in a highly publicized doping investigation shortly before last summer 's tour de france .
after losing his german racing license , ullrich moved to switzerland and has been busy fending off both german and swiss allegations ever since . t-mobile , meanwhile , was saddled with an enormous image problem - which it fought with an intensive public relations offensive , according to schröder . t-mobile reacts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bodybuilders are often said to turn to steroid use " the company took a very aggressive stance and went straight to the press , " schröder added .
" they distanced themselves from ullrich , and said they were working hard to clean up the image of the rest of the team . " indeed , shortly after the ullrich scandal broke , t-mobile announced plans to take a " tough stance in the fight against doping " by putting a german physician in charge of the team and " consistently evaluating and monitoring the training methods " of the riders .
t-mobile also committed some financial support to the anti-doping agency nada , among other measures . according to schröder , " actively supporting the image of fair play in sports " could be a good solution to the problem sponsors are faced with when fighting an image soiled by doping allegations . pr vs marketing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agony and the extasy : a sponsor 's image is linked to that of its star athletes but others say it is unlikely that voluntary funding for anti-doping agencies would ever take an important role in corporate image building . " companies have two marketing goals when they go into corporate sports sponsorship : becoming better known , and improving their image .
funding nada and wada would fall more under social sponsoring , and pr , than sports sponsoring , " cologne athletic college 's breuer said . " you ca n't expect companies to invest in that , it would n't be an efficient way of meeting their goals , " he added . but wouldn ’ t the entire sporting world benefit from cleaner sports all around ? in principle , yes , said breuer .
but in business , he added , " people tend to think in the short term , not the long term .

"
" otherwise , the church will be left with just one third of its current membership and only fifty percent of its current funds by 2030 , " it warned .
so the alarm bells were ringing when some 300 church representatives and politicians came together for a congress in wittenberg to discuss ways of braking this accelerating trend .
according to the organizers from the ekd , the solution is a slate of reforms designed to usher in a " decade of change " set to culminate on the 500th anniversary of luther 's theses in 2017 .
identity crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what relevance does christ have in today 's world ?
the proposals included cutting back the country 's regional churches from 23 to a maximum of 12 , with the squeeze primarily on traditional , smaller parishes .
in future , the ekd wants to see the congregations of the individual regional churches number at least 1 million - twice the size of many of the smallest existing communities .
but these are n't the main challenges .
the church 's strapped finances are problematic enough , but the congress participants were well aware that far more is at stake than a leaking roof or two .
ultimately , the church knows it needs to reappraise its role and find a new place for faith within contemporary society .
" it 's time for a new departure , " parliamentary deputy speaker katrin göring-eckardt of the green party told the congress .
" and not primarily because of declining membership and lack of funds . "
göring-eckardt dismissed complaints that the ekd treated the church like a business in need of a turn-around by bandying around terms like ' quality control ' and ' quotas , ' and stressed the church 's need to adapt to the times .
" we need a worldly church , not an other-worldly church , " she said .
the business of religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : redefining its role many agree that a bit of business acumen is exactly what the church needs .
the days when even handing around a collection plate was an embarrassing concession to earthly matters are long over , and thies gundlach from the ekd says the church has to become less coy about resorting to best-practice marketing tricks .
" the church would be betraying itself if it behaved like a business , " he said .
" but in the bible , paul says : ' test everything , retain what is good , ' which is a principle that does allow us to learn a few lessons from business and economics - from customer loyalty to promoting the protestant brand - so long as we never forget that the church will never be a company like any other . "
his feelings are shared by swen schönheit , pastor at the apostle petrus church in berlin .
an angular building built in the 1960s , it could n't seem less inviting from the outside , but what it lacks in aesthetics it more than makes up for in atmosphere , defying the national trend by regularly welcoming a full house on sundays .
" what many churches in germany lack is charisma , " he says .
" the church has suffered a loss of spiritual energy , it lacks relevance .
its crisis is a spiritual one not a financial one . "
and it 's no one 's fault but its own , he says .
" society is seeing a boom in religious interest , there 's a renewal of spiritual soul-searching going on in germany , but this is completely passing by the church , and it 's time the church found a way of harnessing it . "
" it has to realize it is in competition with other sources of spirituality within society and get its act together , " he insists .
the new religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many feel the church needs more of a human touch his own church obviously has .
community activities range from children 's dance classes to group summer holidays , while the sunday service kicks off with a house band switching on the electric amplifier as the congregation sings along with the help of a power point show .
but to some , this form of happy-clappy religion is suspiciously reminiscent of the born-again evangelism popular in the us - one which goes hand-in-hand with a christian-right political agenda deeply foreign to secular european sensibilities .
but it 's unlikely german protestants will ever head in this direction .
" traditionally , religious affiliation has been a private matter in germany due to the separation of church and state , " explains urike murmann , pastor at hamburg 's st katherine 's church .
that said , she does believe a dose of showmanship never goes amiss .
" going to church should be cheerful , it should be fun , " she says .
" we 've seen that people respond very well when we offer music or theatre . "
but she also knows where to draw the line .
" of course , if it descended into a superficial entertainment , that would be terrible . "
her main emphasis is on the community role of the church , and she says that it 's already learning how to be more aware of parish needs .
" in hamburg , we look carefully at what our congregation wants and we tailor our activities accordingly .
we know we need to do more than just lecture people . "
but even though a number of churches across the country are managing to fill their pews by offering a new and improved form of protestantism , their popularity is failing to translate into church membership .
attending church is one thing , actually joining is another .
and the reasons might be purely mundane .
the spirit is willing , one might say , but the flesh is weak .
" the church tax is a stumbling block , " says murmann .
" it 's not easy to persuade people it 's valid .
furthermore , there 's been a growing skepticism towards institutions in recent years .
people do n't join political parties , they do n't join unions .
the church is no exception . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reformers turn up heat on church critics have been present at world youth day , bringing up issues such as the role of women , family planning and gay rights .

"
" otherwise , the church will be left with just one third of its current membership and only fifty percent of its current funds by 2030 , " it warned .
so the alarm bells were ringing when some 300 church representatives and politicians came together for a congress in wittenberg to discuss ways of braking this accelerating trend .
according to the organizers from the ekd , the solution is a slate of reforms designed to usher in a " decade of change " set to culminate on the 500th anniversary of luther 's theses in 2017 .
identity crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what relevance does christ have in today 's world ?
the proposals included cutting back the country 's regional churches from 23 to a maximum of 12 , with the squeeze primarily on traditional , smaller parishes .
in future , the ekd wants to see the congregations of the individual regional churches number at least 1 million - twice the size of many of the smallest existing communities .
but these are n't the main challenges .
the church 's strapped finances are problematic enough , but the congress participants were well aware that far more is at stake than a leaking roof or two .
ultimately , the church knows it needs to reappraise its role and find a new place for faith within contemporary society .
" it 's time for a new departure , " parliamentary deputy speaker katrin göring-eckardt of the green party told the congress .
" and not primarily because of declining membership and lack of funds . "
göring-eckardt dismissed complaints that the ekd treated the church like a business in need of a turn-around by bandying around terms like ' quality control ' and ' quotas , ' and stressed the church 's need to adapt to the times .
" we need a worldly church , not an other-worldly church , " she said .
the business of religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : redefining its role many agree that a bit of business acumen is exactly what the church needs .
the days when even handing around a collection plate was an embarrassing concession to earthly matters are long over , and thies gundlach from the ekd says the church has to become less coy about resorting to best-practice marketing tricks .
" the church would be betraying itself if it behaved like a business , " he said .
" but in the bible , paul says : ' test everything , retain what is good , ' which is a principle that does allow us to learn a few lessons from business and economics - from customer loyalty to promoting the protestant brand - so long as we never forget that the church will never be a company like any other . "
his feelings are shared by swen schönheit , pastor at the apostle petrus church in berlin .
an angular building built in the 1960s , it could n't seem less inviting from the outside , but what it lacks in aesthetics it more than makes up for in atmosphere , defying the national trend by regularly welcoming a full house on sundays .
" what many churches in germany lack is charisma , " he says .
" the church has suffered a loss of spiritual energy , it lacks relevance .
its crisis is a spiritual one not a financial one . "
and it 's no one 's fault but its own , he says .
" society is seeing a boom in religious interest , there 's a renewal of spiritual soul-searching going on in germany , but this is completely passing by the church , and it 's time the church found a way of harnessing it . "
" it has to realize it is in competition with other sources of spirituality within society and get its act together , " he insists .
the new religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many feel the church needs more of a human touch his own church obviously has .
community activities range from children 's dance classes to group summer holidays , while the sunday service kicks off with a house band switching on the electric amplifier as the congregation sings along with the help of a power point show .
but to some , this form of happy-clappy religion is suspiciously reminiscent of the born-again evangelism popular in the us - one which goes hand-in-hand with a christian-right political agenda deeply foreign to secular european sensibilities .
but it 's unlikely german protestants will ever head in this direction .
" traditionally , religious affiliation has been a private matter in germany due to the separation of church and state , " explains urike murmann , pastor at hamburg 's st katherine 's church .
that said , she does believe a dose of showmanship never goes amiss .
" going to church should be cheerful , it should be fun , " she says .
" we 've seen that people respond very well when we offer music or theatre . "
but she also knows where to draw the line .
" of course , if it descended into a superficial entertainment , that would be terrible . "
her main emphasis is on the community role of the church , and she says that it 's already learning how to be more aware of parish needs .
" in hamburg , we look carefully at what our congregation wants and we tailor our activities accordingly .
we know we need to do more than just lecture people . "
but even though a number of churches across the country are managing to fill their pews by offering a new and improved form of protestantism , their popularity is failing to translate into church membership .
attending church is one thing , actually joining is another .
and the reasons might be purely mundane .
the spirit is willing , one might say , but the flesh is weak .
" the church tax is a stumbling block , " says murmann .
" it 's not easy to persuade people it 's valid .
furthermore , there 's been a growing skepticism towards institutions in recent years .
people do n't join political parties , they do n't join unions .

the hamburger morgenpost reported thursday that magath would take over at hsv .
a team spokesman , however , said there was " nothing to report . " back in bavaria , hitzfeld , who in his first spell as bayern manager led them to four titles and the champions league crown , takes over a team lying fourth and struggling to qualify for the champions league next season . werder turned up the pressure on the 20-time champions with a 2-0 win over bayer leverkusen , with german international striker miroslav klose joining serb marko pantelic at the top of the bundesliga scoring charts with 11 goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke squeaked past aachen to stay tied for first schalke 04 , in second also on 42 points , scraped through their home clash with aachen 2-1 . in other action on wednesday vfb stuttgart maintained third place with a 3-2 win over ninth-placed arminia bielfeld . hamburg are propping up the league after a disappointing 1-1 draw with energie cottbus , while mainz beat dortmund 1-0 and left the bundesliga basement . bayern suffer long fall bayern players received an angry dressing-down from now former coach felix magath after the defeat in dortmund .
he warned his charges that anything less than victory against bochum would spell the end of the title chances - and probably guessed it would be the end of his own as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath 's enthusiasm was n't enough to help bayern - or save his own job bayern took to the field at the allianz arena seemingly toiling under the weight of those words , passing erratically and in accurately in the early exchanges .
it took the bavarians well over half an hour to find any kind of rhythm , with bastian schweinsteiger showing one of the rare pieces of skill in the first half to release dutch midfielder mark van bommel .
but " schweini " then had to watch the dutchman rush his shot , which bochum keeper jaroslav drobny saved easily . disgruntled fans display their anger bayern offered little threat against their relegation-threatened opponents in the second-half and were jeered off the pitch at the end , their fans obviously disgusted with the drab performance that saw the champions unable to break down a bochum side who had been beaten 1-0 at home by bottom side mainz on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli kahn shows the direction bayern should be going " we 're very disappointed , obviously , " bayern goalkeeper and captain oliver kahn told arena tv .
" we have to realize we do n't have a season ticket for first place .
it all looks very bad at the moment . " chairman karl-heinz rummenigge left the stadium saying he did not want to comment .

i have to sleep on it first , " he said . stuttgart recover to claim third place meanwhile vfb stuttgart , who had been beaten 4-1 at nuremberg on saturday , overtook bayern with a 3-2 victory over arminia bielefeld to move third in the table on 35 points . striker mario gomez scored twice in front of the watching german national team coach joachim löw to boost his chances of a first full international team call-up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario gomez has caught the eye of the national coach gomez opened the stuttgart account with a close-range header in the ninth minute and notched his second and stuttgart 's third in the 59th minute shortly after shooting over an open goal from two meters . strike partner cacau , who had set up the first goal , was on target with a header from a free-kick by pavel pardo seven minutes after the break . christian eigler had leveled for bielefeld with a fine finish from the edge of the area in the 26th minute , and substitute abdelaziz ahanfouf converted from the penalty spot four minutes from time . " we had messed up in our first game at the weekend so we had to show our fans we could play the second half of the season as we did the first , " gomez said .
" we had good chances in both halves so i think the victory was deserved . " mid-table teams held in stalemates elsewhere , wolfsburg and eintracht frankfurt shared the spoils in a 2-2 draw .

the hamburger morgenpost reported thursday that magath would take over at hsv .
a team spokesman , however , said there was " nothing to report . " back in bavaria , hitzfeld , who in his first spell as bayern manager led them to four titles and the champions league crown , takes over a team lying fourth and struggling to qualify for the champions league next season . werder turned up the pressure on the 20-time champions with a 2-0 win over bayer leverkusen , with german international striker miroslav klose joining serb marko pantelic at the top of the bundesliga scoring charts with 11 goals . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke squeaked past aachen to stay tied for first schalke 04 , in second also on 42 points , scraped through their home clash with aachen 2-1 . in other action on wednesday vfb stuttgart maintained third place with a 3-2 win over ninth-placed arminia bielfeld . hamburg are propping up the league after a disappointing 1-1 draw with energie cottbus , while mainz beat dortmund 1-0 and left the bundesliga basement . bayern suffer long fall bayern players received an angry dressing-down from now former coach felix magath after the defeat in dortmund .
he warned his charges that anything less than victory against bochum would spell the end of the title chances - and probably guessed it would be the end of his own as well . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : magath 's enthusiasm was n't enough to help bayern - or save his own job bayern took to the field at the allianz arena seemingly toiling under the weight of those words , passing erratically and in accurately in the early exchanges .
it took the bavarians well over half an hour to find any kind of rhythm , with bastian schweinsteiger showing one of the rare pieces of skill in the first half to release dutch midfielder mark van bommel .
but " schweini " then had to watch the dutchman rush his shot , which bochum keeper jaroslav drobny saved easily . disgruntled fans display their anger bayern offered little threat against their relegation-threatened opponents in the second-half and were jeered off the pitch at the end , their fans obviously disgusted with the drab performance that saw the champions unable to break down a bochum side who had been beaten 1-0 at home by bottom side mainz on saturday . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : oli kahn shows the direction bayern should be going " we 're very disappointed , obviously , " bayern goalkeeper and captain oliver kahn told arena tv .
" we have to realize we do n't have a season ticket for first place .
it all looks very bad at the moment . " chairman karl-heinz rummenigge left the stadium saying he did not want to comment .
" i 'm saying nothing now .
i have to sleep on it first , " he said . stuttgart recover to claim third place meanwhile vfb stuttgart , who had been beaten 4-1 at nuremberg on saturday , overtook bayern with a 3-2 victory over arminia bielefeld to move third in the table on 35 points . striker mario gomez scored twice in front of the watching german national team coach joachim löw to boost his chances of a first full international team call-up . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mario gomez has caught the eye of the national coach gomez opened the stuttgart account with a close-range header in the ninth minute and notched his second and stuttgart 's third in the 59th minute shortly after shooting over an open goal from two meters . strike partner cacau , who had set up the first goal , was on target with a header from a free-kick by pavel pardo seven minutes after the break . christian eigler had leveled for bielefeld with a fine finish from the edge of the area in the 26th minute , and substitute abdelaziz ahanfouf converted from the penalty spot four minutes from time . " we had messed up in our first game at the weekend so we had to show our fans we could play the second half of the season as we did the first , " gomez said .
" we had good chances in both halves so i think the victory was deserved . " mid-table teams held in stalemates elsewhere , wolfsburg and eintracht frankfurt shared the spoils in a 2-2 draw .
diego fernando klimowicz in the eighth minute and mike hanke with a header in the 73rd were on target for the wolves either side of goals in the 63rd and 69th minutes from michael thurk and alexander meier . in the other tuesday night game , struggling borussia mönchengladbach and mid-table nuremberg played out drab 0-0 draw . dw staff / dpa -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern search for replacements as departures draw near the season is only half-way through and yet a number of bayern munich 's midfielders are looking for new clubs .

"
" otherwise , the church will be left with just one third of its current membership and only fifty percent of its current funds by 2030 , " it warned .
so the alarm bells were ringing when some 300 church representatives and politicians came together for a congress in wittenberg to discuss ways of braking this accelerating trend .
according to the organizers from the ekd , the solution is a slate of reforms designed to usher in a " decade of change " set to culminate on the 500th anniversary of luther 's theses in 2017 .
identity crisis bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : what relevance does christ have in today 's world ?
the proposals included cutting back the country 's regional churches from 23 to a maximum of 12 , with the squeeze primarily on traditional , smaller parishes .
in future , the ekd wants to see the congregations of the individual regional churches number at least 1 million - twice the size of many of the smallest existing communities .
but these are n't the main challenges .
the church 's strapped finances are problematic enough , but the congress participants were well aware that far more is at stake than a leaking roof or two .
ultimately , the church knows it needs to reappraise its role and find a new place for faith within contemporary society .
" it 's time for a new departure , " parliamentary deputy speaker katrin göring-eckardt of the green party told the congress .
" and not primarily because of declining membership and lack of funds . "
göring-eckardt dismissed complaints that the ekd treated the church like a business in need of a turn-around by bandying around terms like ' quality control ' and ' quotas , ' and stressed the church 's need to adapt to the times .
" we need a worldly church , not an other-worldly church , " she said .
the business of religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : redefining its role many agree that a bit of business acumen is exactly what the church needs .
the days when even handing around a collection plate was an embarrassing concession to earthly matters are long over , and thies gundlach from the ekd says the church has to become less coy about resorting to best-practice marketing tricks .
" the church would be betraying itself if it behaved like a business , " he said .
" but in the bible , paul says : ' test everything , retain what is good , ' which is a principle that does allow us to learn a few lessons from business and economics - from customer loyalty to promoting the protestant brand - so long as we never forget that the church will never be a company like any other . "
his feelings are shared by swen schönheit , pastor at the apostle petrus church in berlin .
an angular building built in the 1960s , it could n't seem less inviting from the outside , but what it lacks in aesthetics it more than makes up for in atmosphere , defying the national trend by regularly welcoming a full house on sundays .
" what many churches in germany lack is charisma , " he says .
" the church has suffered a loss of spiritual energy , it lacks relevance .
its crisis is a spiritual one not a financial one . "
and it 's no one 's fault but its own , he says .
" society is seeing a boom in religious interest , there 's a renewal of spiritual soul-searching going on in germany , but this is completely passing by the church , and it 's time the church found a way of harnessing it . "
" it has to realize it is in competition with other sources of spirituality within society and get its act together , " he insists .
the new religion bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : many feel the church needs more of a human touch his own church obviously has .
community activities range from children 's dance classes to group summer holidays , while the sunday service kicks off with a house band switching on the electric amplifier as the congregation sings along with the help of a power point show .
but to some , this form of happy-clappy religion is suspiciously reminiscent of the born-again evangelism popular in the us - one which goes hand-in-hand with a christian-right political agenda deeply foreign to secular european sensibilities .
but it 's unlikely german protestants will ever head in this direction .
" traditionally , religious affiliation has been a private matter in germany due to the separation of church and state , " explains urike murmann , pastor at hamburg 's st katherine 's church .
that said , she does believe a dose of showmanship never goes amiss .
" going to church should be cheerful , it should be fun , " she says .
" we 've seen that people respond very well when we offer music or theatre . "
but she also knows where to draw the line .
" of course , if it descended into a superficial entertainment , that would be terrible . "
her main emphasis is on the community role of the church , and she says that it 's already learning how to be more aware of parish needs .
" in hamburg , we look carefully at what our congregation wants and we tailor our activities accordingly .
we know we need to do more than just lecture people . "
but even though a number of churches across the country are managing to fill their pews by offering a new and improved form of protestantism , their popularity is failing to translate into church membership .
attending church is one thing , actually joining is another .
and the reasons might be purely mundane .
the spirit is willing , one might say , but the flesh is weak .
" the church tax is a stumbling block , " says murmann .
" it 's not easy to persuade people it 's valid .
furthermore , there 's been a growing skepticism towards institutions in recent years .
people do n't join political parties , they do n't join unions .
the church is no exception . " jane paulick send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de reformers turn up heat on church critics have been present at world youth day , bringing up issues such as the role of women , family planning and gay rights .

he is joined by newcomer mario gomez and a host of returning stars . germany coach joachim löw was in frankfurt at the weekend to see the 24-year-old kuranyi net a brace in the 3-1 victory over eintracht frankfurt to help his side stay joint top of the bundesliga with werder bremen .

" in the situation of the time he -lrb- steinmeier -rrb- acted absolutely correctly and in sync with the political line that was my responsibility , " schröder said , adding that he would have taken the exact same decisions in light of the atmosphere and events of the time . the former chancellor said he was not informed personally about the case of murat kurnaz , who was seized by us forces in pakistan after the sept .
11 , 2001 attacks and sent to guantanamo bay in 2002 .
" but i take responsibility for the then security policy , " he said . schröder pointed out that given the fear of further attacks in the wake of the sept .
11 atrocity , germany 's internal security had the highest priority at the time , along with a strict regard for legal principles and human rights . " in light of the fact that a few perpetrators of the sept .
11 attacks had lived in germany , we had to be highly alert , " he said . steinmeier to testify on march 8 schröder 's defense of steinmeier will be a welcome respite for the foreign minister who is increasingly under pressure over the kurnaz case . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : murat kurnaz says he was tortured at guantanamo bay steinmeier faces allegations of not having done enough , and in certain cases having blocked , kurnaz ' release from the us prison camp on cuba .
the german-born turkish national , who has claimed he was abused and tortured in the prison , was released last year after the intervention of current chancellor angela merkel . on thursday , it emerged that steinmeier , who has consistently rejected any allegations of wrongdoing , will be testifying on march 8 before an independent parliamentary committee set up to investigate the case .
critics have complained that given the mounting evidence which points to steinmeier 's role in the affair , the foreign minister should testify earlier than march . the glare of the media increased on the minister this week when a german court issued arrest warrants for 13 people in connection with the alleged cia-backed kidnapping of a lebanese-born german citizen , khaled el-masri . minister rebuffs allegations in the latest of a series of interviews to defend his actions , steinmeier said claims that the german government received a formal offer from the us administration to free kurnaz in 2002 were " made-up . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the affair has given steinmeier a major headache he told die zeit weekly newspaper that washington had simply suggested cutting a deal with kurnaz to use him to infiltrate extremist muslim groups in germany .
the german government rejected the idea on the advice of security experts and the foreign intelligence services , steinmeier said . he said it was easy to forget the highly charged atmosphere at the time , with the west bracing for islamist attacks .
the german government had " the responsibility to ensure that no further attacks took place , " steinmeier told die zeit .
he pointed out that germany has to this day remained free from a major terrorist attack since the suicide hijackings of september 11 . merkel 's grand coalition of conservatives and social democrats is closing ranks around steinmeier , a member of the social democratic party . thomas de maiziere , a conservative who now holds steinmeier 's old job of chief of staff at the chancellery , warned against harshly judging the kurnaz case in hindsight . " it is very easy with the witness statements and documents to judge the incident four or five years later .
but it is far harder to make decisions at a highly complex point in time , " he said . three members of the german intelligence services who questioned kurnaz in guantanamo were to give evidence on thursday to the parliamentary committee investigating the case . dw staff -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german court orders arrest of 13 over cia kidnapping a german court ordered the arrest of 13 people behind the alleged cia-backed kidnapping of a german citizen , believed to be one of the most notorious us " renditions " of a terror suspect , prosecutors said wednesday .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de sports -pipe- 01.02.2007 sponsors follow own path in fight against doping großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : urine testing is one way to check for illegal substances .
a doping scandal is a nightmare for athletes and fans , but corporate sponsors may be the ones who suffer most .
marketers hope new international rules and corporate vigilance will aid in damage control . on thursday , an international unesco convention on doping goes into effect .
while the agreement is unlikely to put a stop to doping in sports any time soon , it represents the first time that governments around the world have agreed to throw the force of international law behind the problem . " until now , doping cases have been handled by sporting authorities .
this puts it in the countries ' courts of law , " said christoph breuer , a professor of sports management at the athletics college of cologne . the international accord can be seen as a vote of confidence in german 's national anti-doping agency , nada , and its international offshoot , world anti doping agency -lrb- wada -rrb- . dancing to their own tune bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ullrich , right , no longer wears the t-mobile jersey .
he was fired amid doping allegations but corporate sponsors , who may have millions riding on the image of cleanliness in sports , have stayed out of the fray , mostly dealing with the issue in their own way . " as far as i know , sponsors have been fairly reluctant to join in the active fight against doping , " said christian sachs , a spokesman for the federal interior ministry committee that supported the un treaty .
" we want to encourage sponsors within the field of sport to contribute to the funding of nada , which they have hardly done up to now . " indeed , corporate sponsors generally take a reactive , not a proactive , stance , said breuer from the athletics college . the upside of scandal bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : cycling and track and field are the two sports where doping is said to be rampant " often , when an athlete is first suspected of doping , a corporate sponsor 's first reaction is to stand behind them and protect them , " he said .
" but once the charges are proven , the sponsors often separate from the athlete . " yet , breuer added , there are certain instances in which doping allegations can actually work in a sponsor 's favor : " for an unknown firm , a doping case might serve to boost its profile .
even if its negative publicity , the name will be known . " for the past several years , it has been the norm in the sports marketing world for sponsors to put an escape clause in their contract that ends the sponsorship if an athlete or team is accused or convicted of doping . still , the bad taste of a doping accusation can linger , and become an image nightmare for a company that has the misfortune to back the wrong athletes . the case of jan ullrich bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : german biathlete thomas oelsner was suspended from the paralympics for alleged doping " this is the most castastrophic thing that can happen in sports sponsoring , and we advise our clients to be very careful before they get into any endorsement contracts , " said stephan schröder , who is on the managing board of the cologne-based sports marketing consultancy sport + markt . schröder cited as an example the case of jan ullrich .
the german cycling star was booted by his sponsor t-mobile after he was implicated in a highly publicized doping investigation shortly before last summer 's tour de france .
after losing his german racing license , ullrich moved to switzerland and has been busy fending off both german and swiss allegations ever since . t-mobile , meanwhile , was saddled with an enormous image problem - which it fought with an intensive public relations offensive , according to schröder . t-mobile reacts bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bodybuilders are often said to turn to steroid use " the company took a very aggressive stance and went straight to the press , " schröder added .
" they distanced themselves from ullrich , and said they were working hard to clean up the image of the rest of the team . " indeed , shortly after the ullrich scandal broke , t-mobile announced plans to take a " tough stance in the fight against doping " by putting a german physician in charge of the team and " consistently evaluating and monitoring the training methods " of the riders .
t-mobile also committed some financial support to the anti-doping agency nada , among other measures . according to schröder , " actively supporting the image of fair play in sports " could be a good solution to the problem sponsors are faced with when fighting an image soiled by doping allegations . pr vs marketing bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the agony and the extasy : a sponsor 's image is linked to that of its star athletes but others say it is unlikely that voluntary funding for anti-doping agencies would ever take an important role in corporate image building . " companies have two marketing goals when they go into corporate sports sponsorship : becoming better known , and improving their image .
funding nada and wada would fall more under social sponsoring , and pr , than sports sponsoring , " cologne athletic college 's breuer said . " you ca n't expect companies to invest in that , it would n't be an efficient way of meeting their goals , " he added . but wouldn ’ t the entire sporting world benefit from cleaner sports all around ? in principle , yes , said breuer .
but in business , he added , " people tend to think in the short term , not the long term .

he will be challenged by pro-democracy activist alan leong , but analysts say mr tsang is almost certain to win .
the territory 's leader is chosen by an 800-member election committee loyal to beijing - and beijing is known to approve of mr tsang .
but the election , in march , will be the first time that more than one candidate has gone for the post .
pressure for reform " yes , i 'm ready , " mr tsang told a press conference on thursday morning , officially confirming that he was running for another term .
the news will come as little surprise to the people of hong kong , who widely expected mr tsang to run .
he currently enjoys high public approval ratings , partly due to a buoyant economy .
but correspondents say that while mr tsang may be in favour at the moment , many people are growing increasingly impatient for democratic reform .
mr tsang said he favoured an open democratic system and would work for a new constitution , but provided no specific proposal for how and when the territory should become fully democratic .
since hong kong returned to chinese rule in 1997 , it has been governed under a " one country , two systems " system , which gives the territory a wide-degree of autonomy .
but many people want full democracy - something beijing has promised will eventually happen , although no date has been given .

he will be challenged by pro-democracy activist alan leong , but analysts say mr tsang is almost certain to win .
the territory 's leader is chosen by an 800-member election committee loyal to beijing - and beijing is known to approve of mr tsang .
but the election , in march , will be the first time that more than one candidate has gone for the post .
pressure for reform " yes , i 'm ready , " mr tsang told a press conference on thursday morning , officially confirming that he was running for another term .
the news will come as little surprise to the people of hong kong , who widely expected mr tsang to run .
he currently enjoys high public approval ratings , partly due to a buoyant economy .
but correspondents say that while mr tsang may be in favour at the moment , many people are growing increasingly impatient for democratic reform .
mr tsang said he favoured an open democratic system and would work for a new constitution , but provided no specific proposal for how and when the territory should become fully democratic .
since hong kong returned to chinese rule in 1997 , it has been governed under a " one country , two systems " system , which gives the territory a wide-degree of autonomy .
but many people want full democracy - something beijing has promised will eventually happen , although no date has been given .

the news that mr dell is returning to the chief executive position came as the firm warned its current quarterly results would miss market expectations .
hit by disappointing profits , dell is facing an increasing challenge from its main rival hewlett-packard .
mr dell founded dell in 1984 while at college .

he did , however , remain as the company 's chairman , a position he will now continue to keep alongside the chief executive job .
' new blood ' mr dell , 41 , is replacing his successor kevin rollins , who leaves the firm with immediate effect .
analysts said mr dell would have to work hard to turn the firm around .
" he has to bring in new blood , " said endpoint technologies associates analyst roger kay .
" they need to bring in new people who are creative , energetic , who can bring spice to the company . "

the takeover is set to create the world 's fifth largest steel group .
but india 's media has also sounded a note of caution on whether the indian conglomerate paid too much to win .
the deal has made front-page news in papers all over the country .
india on song , takes corus along , headlined the times of india .
tatas outgun brazilians , take world by storm , it added .
have you slept at all , the newspaper asked tata steel chief ratan tata after outbidding brazil 's csn for corus .
" not a wink .
but i was n't alone , " he replied .
were you nervous , the newspaper asked .
" not nervous , but apprehensive through the night that something could go wrong .
we did n't have an indication of which way the bidding was headed to , " mr tata said .
what was the most you were willing to pay for corus , the newspaper asked .
" let me put it this way .
at 608 pence , we had n't reached the limit we had set ourselves , " the tata chief said .
the newspaper said in an editorial that the deal was a " cause of celebration , but not euphoria " - it said the tata steel share lost value " on fears that the transaction was overpriced " .
but the newspaper agreed that the deal was a " watershed " - " it reaffirms the arrival of india as a big player in the globalisation game , one that looks upon companies and markets of the world as its playground " .
global player ratan is king corus , headlined the asian age , saying that a " relaxed mr tata betrayed no exuberance over this largest single acquisition deal nor did he display any tiredness . "
singing the corus , headlined the indian express .
" -lsb- the deal -rsb- outlines the potential of liberalisation and globalisation in transforming the country 's future , " the paper said .
describing the deal as an " outstanding global foray " , the hindu said that by taking control of corus , " tata steel has shown that it can do business with a quintessentially european company and command respect from banks and financial markets around the world , not to speak of the shareholders " .
the newspaper wondered , quoting industry observers , whether tatas had " paid way too much " , but chairman ratan tata " justified it saying the acquisition of corus , which marks tata steel 's first expansion outside asia was worth it " .
signed , steeled , headlined hindustan times .
" by staking $ 12.1bn to acquire corus , he has put the future of tata steel - and the group 's business - on the line " .
" this single deal is worth $ 2bn more than the total $ 10bn spent by all of india inc last year in 190 overseas acquisitions put together .
" only time will tell whether mr tata is right in his assertion that the asking price was well worth the advantage of acquiring capacity and a set brand in the developed european market , and the gamble of taking on a huge load of debt on the assumption of a sustained demand of steel over , at least , the next decade . "
mint , a new business paper , also sounded a note of caution .
" corus is a notoriously cyclical business where cash flows are volatile .
a downturn in the steel industry could threaten this leveraged buyout . "
indian hat-trick the financial times echoed a similar sentiment , saying , " you ca n't tell yet if tata overpaid " .
" -lsb- tata shareholders -rsb- have a simple question : is corus worth 608 pence a share , " the newspaper asked in an editorial .
" what does tata see in corus that other investors do n't ?
" the simplest answer , perhaps is that the group had little choice .
with a 100-milion-tonne-plus giant in -lsb- ln -rsb- mittal , it had to buy its way into the global big league , anyway , or give up steel - which the world 's ' lowest-cost steelmaker ' would understandably be loath to , " the newspaper said .
business standard said nobody really knows whether tata paid too much to clinch the deal .
" the answer ... depends fundamentally on how the steel market evolves over time and whether steel prices remain buoyant .
" but it is precisely the risk that makes mr tata 's gamble exciting , " said the telegraph newspaper .
" the low cost of hot metal made in jamshedpur -lsb- tata 's flagship steel plant in india -rsb- should bring down the average costs of corus ; conversely , the high prices for flat products in europe should raise the value of raw steel made at home , " it said .
five pence gives india a pound of uk , headlined a triumphant the economic times .
" corus , the erstwhile british steel and one of the icons of her majesty 's empire will now fly the -lsb- indian -rsb- tricolour , " the paper said .
" the tatas are expected to run corus better in the long run than the existing management .
one of the stunning aspects of the deal has been the trust reposed in capabilities of indian management . "
world 's no 5 , india 's no 1 , headlined the financial express , alluding to tatas becoming the world 's fifth largest steel maker after the deal , while retaining its position as the premier steel maker in india .
" the house of tatas is generally considered conservative and ratan tata did not give an impression to the contrary .
aggression is a more recent attribute of tata .
it is born out of the developments in india and also the global scenario , " former federal finance minister yashwant sinha wrote in the paper .
the telegraph newspaper quoted an ecstatic unnamed member of the tata team which negotiated the deal as saying : " after -lsb- writer -rsb- kiran desai 's booker win and shilpa 's -lsb- shetty -rsb- in celebrity big brother , this is an indian hat-trick in london . "

the takeover is set to create the world 's fifth largest steel group .

the deal has made front-page news in papers all over the country .
india on song , takes corus along , headlined the times of india .
tatas outgun brazilians , take world by storm , it added .
have you slept at all , the newspaper asked tata steel chief ratan tata after outbidding brazil 's csn for corus .

were you nervous , the newspaper asked .

we did n't have an indication of which way the bidding was headed to , " mr tata said .
what was the most you were willing to pay for corus , the newspaper asked .
" let me put it this way .
at 608 pence , we had n't reached the limit we had set ourselves , " the tata chief said .
the newspaper said in an editorial that the deal was a " cause of celebration , but not euphoria " - it said the tata steel share lost value " on fears that the transaction was overpriced " .
but the newspaper agreed that the deal was a " watershed " - " it reaffirms the arrival of india as a big player in the globalisation game , one that looks upon companies and markets of the world as its playground " .
global player ratan is king corus , headlined the asian age , saying that a " relaxed mr tata betrayed no exuberance over this largest single acquisition deal nor did he display any tiredness . "
most newspapers ran detailed accounts on how the deal was swung singing the corus , headlined the indian express .
" -lsb- the deal -rsb- outlines the potential of liberalisation and globalisation in transforming the country 's future , " the paper said .

" only time will tell whether mr tata is right in his assertion that the asking price was well worth the advantage of acquiring capacity and a set brand in the developed european market , and the gamble of taking on a huge load of debt on the assumption of a sustained demand of steel over , at least , the next decade . "
mint , a new business paper , also sounded a note of caution .
" corus is a notoriously cyclical business where cash flows are volatile .

in a series of posts throughout the day , bbc news technology reporter andrew gruen gives his first impressions of the new operating system .
1400 gmt wednesday a reader wrote in to tell me he was running windows live messenger on his vista machine without issue .
so i booted our vista laptop back up and did a repair install of messenger .
after relaunching the application , it asked to install a new version of flash , which i did -lrb- who knew that messenger used flash ? -rrb- .
i launched it again and was presented with my buddy list .
windows vista and windows live messenger ; together at last for this bbc reporter .
1800 gmt tuesday to round out the day , i downloaded all my favourite free applications from the web to see if they were vista compatible .
to my pleasant surprise all but one worked marvellously .
trillian 3 , aim 5 and 6 , yahoo messenger , skype , google talk , bittorrent , firefox , netscape , itunes , real player , and even gimp work well .
some , like aim , look a bit out of place and antiquated when surrounded by aero 'ed applications , but they work just as expected .
so what 's the lone , non-compliant download ?
microsoft 's own windows live messenger .
mr right hand , meet ms left .
1700 gmt tuesday though i 'm generally in favour of as much computer security as possible , bill gates ' " most secure operating system ever " might actually go too far for those who are already security savvy .
when i first started with vista , i followed the security practices i learned in my linux days : set up an administrative account , but use the computer for everyday activities on a limited one .
unfortunately , vista takes " limited " a bit too literally .
if you 're using such an account , get ready to be inundated with the yellow security warning windows like the one pictured .
using an administrative account alleviates most of these problems .
another side effect of vista 's enhanced security is that it asks for authentication to change just about any setting , install any program or download any updates .
although it sounds like this would be just as obnoxious as the yellow security warnings , it 's not .
instead , i find it comforting to know that applications ca n't be installed nor settings changed without my explicit permission .
vista also tightly integrates the windows update service , a spyware removal tool that scans for " unwanted software " in real time , a firewall that 's enabled by default -lrb- finally ! -rrb- , full drive encryption , and parental controls .
1600 gmt tuesday once the sole province of the super-nerds among us , networking has now found its way into the home with the proliferation of broadband and wi-fi .
microsoft 's last major update to windows xp , sp2 , made networking easier , but it has been improved again in vista .
hovering over the networking icon in the system tray shows whether any wi-fi is in range and clicking on it presents an option to connect .
a double click on my network and i 'm online .
however , for those new to networking the most useful feature is the network map in the network and sharing centre .
diagnosing network issues often requires an idea of where the problem lies .
this visual representation of a home network lets me see the path information takes to get from my pc to the internet and precisely where problems occur .
1500 gmt tuesday digital media plays a big role in my life and vista aims to make using it easier , but does it succeed ?
sort of .
microsoft updated pre-existing media applications and added some new ones to vista , but for people like me who already use applications to manage their music and photos and edit digital video , they may not get much use .
the windows photo gallery application is reminiscent of almost every other photo manager i 've ever used .
it features a source list on the left and the photos themselves on the right and has a small set of photo correction tools that perform the most basic tweaks including colour correction , red-eye reduction , and cropping .
for people who 've never used an application like it before , though , it should prove useful .
windows movie maker has been updated to fit the vista look , but it still seems underwhelming when compared to offerings from other companies .
the transitions and titles still look amateurish and working with media inside the movie -lrb- adjusting the volume of a sound track , for example -rrb- took me far too long to figure out .
media centre , however , is a welcome addition to the standard vista package .
formerly relegated to its own edition , media centre is a " 10-foot interface " -lrb- it can be used without a keyboard and mouse if the pc has a remote control -rrb- to all the music , photos and video stored on the computer .
since i have a pc in the bedroom , media centre should be extremely useful for watching tv programmes or listening to music before bed .
1200gmt tuesday 30 january getting started with vista is a bit disconcerting .
at first blush i felt right at home with a start menu , task bar and recycle bin , but as soon as i started working i found things just slightly out of place .
the run option has been removed from the start menu -lrb- but entering commands into the search bar that now inhabits run 's old real estate works -rrb- and my computer , is now just computer .
then there 's aero - the shiny , glass-like , transparent new visual style .
it 's a refreshing change from windows xp 's fisher-price-like interface and looks great on newer high-gloss lcd displays like the one i 'm using .
there is also a spate of new visual effects ranging from flip 3d which shows all the open windows -lrb- pictured -rrb- to the zooming window minimization animation .
i 'm a particular fan of flip 3d because unlike the window switcher in old versions of windows which only let you page through windows sequentially , it lets me grab a window from far in the background just by clicking on it .
using office 2007 takes a period of adjustment .
gone are venerable menus like file and edit ; they 've been replaced with a new menu system called the ribbon .
it makes many more functions available with fewer clicks , but it took me a few minutes of hunt-and-peck to re-learn where things are .
additionally , almost all functions are accessible by hitting alt followed by a series of other letters and numbers - a very nice feature for the keyboard inclined like myself .
the default office font is also new .
it has changed from the serifed times new roman to the sans serif calibri .
next i 'll take a look at vista 's search features .
1110gmt tuesday 30 january i 'm using the search feature a lot .
it 's superb .
as a mac user , i 've been using system-wide search for quite some time and have grown increasingly dependent on it .
vista does n't leave me wanting for features .
first , it searches within documents and other application data files meaning , for example , i can type an outlook contact 's name into the start menu and hover the mouse over it to see their email address and phone number - very handy for quick calls .
second , i 've saved a search to the desktop that collects up all my music files and " stacks " them up by artist .
these saved searches can be dynamically reshuffled based on file attributes called metadata , or data about data .
but the best feature of search is a non-advertised feature : application launching .
by hitting the windows key , typing " word " and hitting return , i can pull up a blank document .
same goes for any application on my machine .
this is a very fast way to launch programs .
goodbye " all programs " list , i wo n't miss you .
0950 gmt tuesday 30 january in the interests of full disclosure i 'll admit it : i 'm a mac os x user at home .
i 've always appreciated windows and linux but ended up using the mac for my daily tasks .
and , strangely enough , that 's why i 'm excited to give vista a try .
five years on from windows xp , there are a host of new features that have been integrated into mac os x for some time or were difficult to use in linux .
now they 're enhanced and built in .
but before i can report back , i 've got to go and try it out .
first on the docket : the new windows and office interfaces .

windows vista and windows live messenger ; together at last for this bbc reporter .
1800 gmt tuesday windows live messenger failed to work to round out the day , i downloaded all my favourite free applications from the web to see if they were vista compatible .
to my pleasant surprise all but one worked marvellously .
trillian 3 , aim 5 and 6 , yahoo messenger , skype , google talk , bittorrent , firefox , netscape , itunes , real player , and even gimp work well .
some , like aim , look a bit out of place and antiquated when surrounded by aero 'ed applications , but they work just as expected .
so what 's the lone , non-compliant download ?
microsoft 's own windows live messenger .
mr right hand , meet ms left .
1700 gmt tuesday security warnings are frequent on vista though i 'm generally in favour of as much computer security as possible , bill gates ' " most secure operating system ever " might actually go too far for those who are already security savvy .
when i first started with vista , i followed the security practices i learned in my linux days : set up an administrative account , but use the computer for everyday activities on a limited one .
unfortunately , vista takes " limited " a bit too literally .
if you 're using such an account , get ready to be inundated with the yellow security warning windows like the one pictured .
using an administrative account alleviates most of these problems .
another side effect of vista 's enhanced security is that it asks for authentication to change just about any setting , install any program or download any updates .
although it sounds like this would be just as obnoxious as the yellow security warnings , it 's not .
instead , i find it comforting to know that applications ca n't be installed nor settings changed without my explicit permission .
vista also tightly integrates the windows update service , a spyware removal tool that scans for " unwanted software " in real time , a firewall that 's enabled by default -lrb- finally ! -rrb- , full drive encryption , and parental controls .
1600 gmt tuesday networking has been improved under vista once the sole province of the super-nerds among us , networking has now found its way into the home with the proliferation of broadband and wi-fi .
microsoft 's last major update to windows xp , sp2 , made networking easier , but it has been improved again in vista .
hovering over the networking icon in the system tray shows whether any wi-fi is in range and clicking on it presents an option to connect .
a double click on my network and i 'm online .
however , for those new to networking the most useful feature is the network map in the network and sharing centre .
diagnosing network issues often requires an idea of where the problem lies .
this visual representation of a home network lets me see the path information takes to get from my pc to the internet and precisely where problems occur .
1500 gmt tuesday digital media plays a big role in my life and vista aims to make using it easier , but does it succeed ?
sort of .
vista aims to make photo management easier microsoft updated pre-existing media applications and added some new ones to vista , but for people like me who already use applications to manage their music and photos and edit digital video , they may not get much use .
the windows photo gallery application is reminiscent of almost every other photo manager i 've ever used .
it features a source list on the left and the photos themselves on the right and has a small set of photo correction tools that perform the most basic tweaks including colour correction , red-eye reduction , and cropping .
for people who 've never used an application like it before , though , it should prove useful .
windows movie maker has been updated to fit the vista look , but it still seems underwhelming when compared to offerings from other companies .
the transitions and titles still look amateurish and working with media inside the movie -lrb- adjusting the volume of a sound track , for example -rrb- took me far too long to figure out .
media centre , however , is a welcome addition to the standard vista package .
formerly relegated to its own edition , media centre is a " 10-foot interface " -lrb- it can be used without a keyboard and mouse if the pc has a remote control -rrb- to all the music , photos and video stored on the computer .
since i have a pc in the bedroom , media centre should be extremely useful for watching tv programmes or listening to music before bed .
1200gmt tuesday 30 january " flip 3d " allows for faster access to windows by clicking on them getting started with vista is a bit disconcerting .
at first blush i felt right at home with a start menu , task bar and recycle bin , but as soon as i started working i found things just slightly out of place .
the run option has been removed from the start menu -lrb- but entering commands into the search bar that now inhabits run 's old real estate works -rrb- and my computer , is now just computer .
then there 's aero - the shiny , glass-like , transparent new visual style .
it 's a refreshing change from windows xp 's fisher-price-like interface and looks great on newer high-gloss lcd displays like the one i 'm using .
there is also a spate of new visual effects ranging from flip 3d which shows all the open windows -lrb- pictured -rrb- to the zooming window minimization animation .
i 'm a particular fan of flip 3d because unlike the window switcher in old versions of windows which only let you page through windows sequentially , it lets me grab a window from far in the background just by clicking on it .
it takes a bit of time to re-learn where common features are on the ribbon using office 2007 takes a period of adjustment .
gone are venerable menus like file and edit ; they 've been replaced with a new menu system called the ribbon .
it makes many more functions available with fewer clicks , but it took me a few minutes of hunt-and-peck to re-learn where things are .
additionally , almost all functions are accessible by hitting alt followed by a series of other letters and numbers - a very nice feature for the keyboard inclined like myself .
the default office font is also new .
it has changed from the serifed times new roman to the sans serif calibri .
next i 'll take a look at vista 's search features .
1110gmt tuesday 30 january the search box does so much more than search i 'm using the search feature a lot .
it 's superb .
as a mac user , i 've been using system-wide search for quite some time and have grown increasingly dependent on it .
vista does n't leave me wanting for features .
first , it searches within documents and other application data files meaning , for example , i can type an outlook contact 's name into the start menu and hover the mouse over it to see their email address and phone number - very handy for quick calls .
second , i 've saved a search to the desktop that collects up all my music files and " stacks " them up by artist .
these saved searches can be dynamically reshuffled based on file attributes called metadata , or data about data .
but the best feature of search is a non-advertised feature : application launching .
by hitting the windows key , typing " word " and hitting return , i can pull up a blank document .
same goes for any application on my machine .
this is a very fast way to launch programs .
goodbye " all programs " list , i wo n't miss you .
0950 gmt tuesday 30 january booting into windows vista feels more friendly from the outset in the interests of full disclosure i 'll admit it : i 'm a mac os x user at home .
i 've always appreciated windows and linux but ended up using the mac for my daily tasks .
and , strangely enough , that 's why i 'm excited to give vista a try .
five years on from windows xp , there are a host of new features that have been integrated into mac os x for some time or were difficult to use in linux .
now they 're enhanced and built in .
but before i can report back , i 've got to go and try it out .
first on the docket : the new windows and office interfaces .

another side effect of vista 's enhanced security is that it asks for authentication to change just about any setting , install any program or download any updates .
although it sounds like this would be just as obnoxious as the yellow security warnings , it 's not .
instead , i find it comforting to know that applications ca n't be installed nor settings changed without my explicit permission .
vista also tightly integrates the windows update service , a spyware removal tool that scans for " unwanted software " in real time , a firewall that 's enabled by default -lrb- finally ! -rrb- , full drive encryption , and parental controls .
1600 gmt tuesday networking has been improved under vista once the sole province of the super-nerds among us , networking has now found its way into the home with the proliferation of broadband and wi-fi .
microsoft 's last major update to windows xp , sp2 , made networking easier , but it has been improved again in vista .
hovering over the networking icon in the system tray shows whether any wi-fi is in range and clicking on it presents an option to connect .
a double click on my network and i 'm online .
however , for those new to networking the most useful feature is the network map in the network and sharing centre .
diagnosing network issues often requires an idea of where the problem lies .
this visual representation of a home network lets me see the path information takes to get from my pc to the internet and precisely where problems occur .
1500 gmt tuesday digital media plays a big role in my life and vista aims to make using it easier , but does it succeed ?
sort of .
vista aims to make photo management easier microsoft updated pre-existing media applications and added some new ones to vista , but for people like me who already use applications to manage their music and photos and edit digital video , they may not get much use .
the windows photo gallery application is reminiscent of almost every other photo manager i 've ever used .
it features a source list on the left and the photos themselves on the right and has a small set of photo correction tools that perform the most basic tweaks including colour correction , red-eye reduction , and cropping .
for people who 've never used an application like it before , though , it should prove useful .
windows movie maker has been updated to fit the vista look , but it still seems underwhelming when compared to offerings from other companies .
the transitions and titles still look amateurish and working with media inside the movie -lrb- adjusting the volume of a sound track , for example -rrb- took me far too long to figure out .
media centre , however , is a welcome addition to the standard vista package .
formerly relegated to its own edition , media centre is a " 10-foot interface " -lrb- it can be used without a keyboard and mouse if the pc has a remote control -rrb- to all the music , photos and video stored on the computer .
since i have a pc in the bedroom , media centre should be extremely useful for watching tv programmes or listening to music before bed .
1200gmt tuesday 30 january " flip 3d " allows for faster access to windows by clicking on them getting started with vista is a bit disconcerting .
at first blush i felt right at home with a start menu , task bar and recycle bin , but as soon as i started working i found things just slightly out of place .
the run option has been removed from the start menu -lrb- but entering commands into the search bar that now inhabits run 's old real estate works -rrb- and my computer , is now just computer .
then there 's aero - the shiny , glass-like , transparent new visual style .
it 's a refreshing change from windows xp 's fisher-price-like interface and looks great on newer high-gloss lcd displays like the one i 'm using .
there is also a spate of new visual effects ranging from flip 3d which shows all the open windows -lrb- pictured -rrb- to the zooming window minimization animation .
i 'm a particular fan of flip 3d because unlike the window switcher in old versions of windows which only let you page through windows sequentially , it lets me grab a window from far in the background just by clicking on it .
it takes a bit of time to re-learn where common features are on the ribbon using office 2007 takes a period of adjustment .
gone are venerable menus like file and edit ; they 've been replaced with a new menu system called the ribbon .
it makes many more functions available with fewer clicks , but it took me a few minutes of hunt-and-peck to re-learn where things are .
additionally , almost all functions are accessible by hitting alt followed by a series of other letters and numbers - a very nice feature for the keyboard inclined like myself .
the default office font is also new .
it has changed from the serifed times new roman to the sans serif calibri .
next i 'll take a look at vista 's search features .
1110gmt tuesday 30 january the search box does so much more than search i 'm using the search feature a lot .
it 's superb .
as a mac user , i 've been using system-wide search for quite some time and have grown increasingly dependent on it .
vista does n't leave me wanting for features .
first , it searches within documents and other application data files meaning , for example , i can type an outlook contact 's name into the start menu and hover the mouse over it to see their email address and phone number - very handy for quick calls .
second , i 've saved a search to the desktop that collects up all my music files and " stacks " them up by artist .
these saved searches can be dynamically reshuffled based on file attributes called metadata , or data about data .
but the best feature of search is a non-advertised feature : application launching .
by hitting the windows key , typing " word " and hitting return , i can pull up a blank document .
same goes for any application on my machine .
this is a very fast way to launch programs .
goodbye " all programs " list , i wo n't miss you .
0950 gmt tuesday 30 january booting into windows vista feels more friendly from the outset in the interests of full disclosure i 'll admit it : i 'm a mac os x user at home .
i 've always appreciated windows and linux but ended up using the mac for my daily tasks .
and , strangely enough , that 's why i 'm excited to give vista a try .
five years on from windows xp , there are a host of new features that have been integrated into mac os x for some time or were difficult to use in linux .
now they 're enhanced and built in .
but before i can report back , i 've got to go and try it out .
first on the docket : the new windows and office interfaces .

the windows photo gallery application is reminiscent of almost every other photo manager i 've ever used .
it features a source list on the left and the photos themselves on the right and has a small set of photo correction tools that perform the most basic tweaks including colour correction , red-eye reduction , and cropping .
for people who 've never used an application like it before , though , it should prove useful .
windows movie maker has been updated to fit the vista look , but it still seems underwhelming when compared to offerings from other companies .
the transitions and titles still look amateurish and working with media inside the movie -lrb- adjusting the volume of a sound track , for example -rrb- took me far too long to figure out .
media centre , however , is a welcome addition to the standard vista package .
formerly relegated to its own edition , media centre is a " 10-foot interface " -lrb- it can be used without a keyboard and mouse if the pc has a remote control -rrb- to all the music , photos and video stored on the computer .
since i have a pc in the bedroom , media centre should be extremely useful for watching tv programmes or listening to music before bed .
1200gmt tuesday 30 january " flip 3d " allows for faster access to windows by clicking on them getting started with vista is a bit disconcerting .
at first blush i felt right at home with a start menu , task bar and recycle bin , but as soon as i started working i found things just slightly out of place .
the run option has been removed from the start menu -lrb- but entering commands into the search bar that now inhabits run 's old real estate works -rrb- and my computer , is now just computer .
then there 's aero - the shiny , glass-like , transparent new visual style .
it 's a refreshing change from windows xp 's fisher-price-like interface and looks great on newer high-gloss lcd displays like the one i 'm using .
there is also a spate of new visual effects ranging from flip 3d which shows all the open windows -lrb- pictured -rrb- to the zooming window minimization animation .
i 'm a particular fan of flip 3d because unlike the window switcher in old versions of windows which only let you page through windows sequentially , it lets me grab a window from far in the background just by clicking on it .
it takes a bit of time to re-learn where common features are on the ribbon using office 2007 takes a period of adjustment .
gone are venerable menus like file and edit ; they 've been replaced with a new menu system called the ribbon .
it makes many more functions available with fewer clicks , but it took me a few minutes of hunt-and-peck to re-learn where things are .
additionally , almost all functions are accessible by hitting alt followed by a series of other letters and numbers - a very nice feature for the keyboard inclined like myself .
the default office font is also new .
it has changed from the serifed times new roman to the sans serif calibri .
next i 'll take a look at vista 's search features .
1110gmt tuesday 30 january the search box does so much more than search i 'm using the search feature a lot .
it 's superb .
as a mac user , i 've been using system-wide search for quite some time and have grown increasingly dependent on it .
vista does n't leave me wanting for features .
first , it searches within documents and other application data files meaning , for example , i can type an outlook contact 's name into the start menu and hover the mouse over it to see their email address and phone number - very handy for quick calls .
second , i 've saved a search to the desktop that collects up all my music files and " stacks " them up by artist .
these saved searches can be dynamically reshuffled based on file attributes called metadata , or data about data .
but the best feature of search is a non-advertised feature : application launching .
by hitting the windows key , typing " word " and hitting return , i can pull up a blank document .
same goes for any application on my machine .
this is a very fast way to launch programs .
goodbye " all programs " list , i wo n't miss you .
0950 gmt tuesday 30 january booting into windows vista feels more friendly from the outset in the interests of full disclosure i 'll admit it : i 'm a mac os x user at home .
i 've always appreciated windows and linux but ended up using the mac for my daily tasks .
and , strangely enough , that 's why i 'm excited to give vista a try .
five years on from windows xp , there are a host of new features that have been integrated into mac os x for some time or were difficult to use in linux .
now they 're enhanced and built in .
but before i can report back , i 've got to go and try it out .
first on the docket : the new windows and office interfaces .

in a series of posts throughout the day , bbc news technology reporter andrew gruen gives his first impressions of the new operating system .
1400 gmt wednesday a reader wrote in to tell me he was running windows live messenger on his vista machine without issue .
so i booted our vista laptop back up and did a repair install of messenger .
after relaunching the application , it asked to install a new version of flash , which i did -lrb- who knew that messenger used flash ? -rrb- .
i launched it again and was presented with my buddy list .
windows vista and windows live messenger ; together at last for this bbc reporter .
1800 gmt tuesday windows live messenger failed to work to round out the day , i downloaded all my favourite free applications from the web to see if they were vista compatible .
to my pleasant surprise all but one worked marvellously .
trillian 3 , aim 5 and 6 , yahoo messenger , skype , google talk , bittorrent , firefox , netscape , itunes , real player , and even gimp work well .
some , like aim , look a bit out of place and antiquated when surrounded by aero 'ed applications , but they work just as expected .
so what 's the lone , non-compliant download ?
microsoft 's own windows live messenger .
mr right hand , meet ms left .
1700 gmt tuesday security warnings are frequent on vista though i 'm generally in favour of as much computer security as possible , bill gates ' " most secure operating system ever " might actually go too far for those who are already security savvy .
when i first started with vista , i followed the security practices i learned in my linux days : set up an administrative account , but use the computer for everyday activities on a limited one .
unfortunately , vista takes " limited " a bit too literally .
if you 're using such an account , get ready to be inundated with the yellow security warning windows like the one pictured .
using an administrative account alleviates most of these problems .
another side effect of vista 's enhanced security is that it asks for authentication to change just about any setting , install any program or download any updates .
although it sounds like this would be just as obnoxious as the yellow security warnings , it 's not .
instead , i find it comforting to know that applications ca n't be installed nor settings changed without my explicit permission .
vista also tightly integrates the windows update service , a spyware removal tool that scans for " unwanted software " in real time , a firewall that 's enabled by default -lrb- finally ! -rrb- , full drive encryption , and parental controls .
1600 gmt tuesday networking has been improved under vista once the sole province of the super-nerds among us , networking has now found its way into the home with the proliferation of broadband and wi-fi .
microsoft 's last major update to windows xp , sp2 , made networking easier , but it has been improved again in vista .
hovering over the networking icon in the system tray shows whether any wi-fi is in range and clicking on it presents an option to connect .
a double click on my network and i 'm online .
however , for those new to networking the most useful feature is the network map in the network and sharing centre .
diagnosing network issues often requires an idea of where the problem lies .
this visual representation of a home network lets me see the path information takes to get from my pc to the internet and precisely where problems occur .
1500 gmt tuesday digital media plays a big role in my life and vista aims to make using it easier , but does it succeed ?

fishing boats will be banned from trawling in central hubei province and chongqing municipality , according to the official xinhua news agency .
bans covering two other stretches will take effect from april .
the government says it has imposed the bans to make sure that stocks of fish are not wiped out .
but a bbc correspondent in beijing says hundreds of fishermen will have to find another way to earn a living while the bans are in place .
controlling and monitoring the state of the yangtze - and what is in it - has been a central concern of chinese leaders for many hundreds of years .
environmental experts accuse the government of failing to keep the river clean .
they say that industrial waste and sewage have made the river seriously polluted .

researchers studied 66,000 women in and around 36 us cities , finding pollution levels varied between four to nearly 20 micrograms per cubic metre .
the university of washington team said each 10 microgram rise was matched by a 76 % rise in the chances of dying from heart disease or stroke .
it was not clear whether women are more susceptible to pollution than men , the new england journal of medicine said .
however , women 's coronary arteries are smaller and this might render them more vulnerable .
for women living within , rather than between , cities , the risk more than doubled , increasing by 128 % , with each step up in pollution levels .
preventing these effects requires reducing the pollution at the source professor joel kaufman , lead researcher all the participants were aged 50 to 79 and part of the women 's health initiative , a major us investigation into the causes of heart disease in women .
none of the women initially had any sign of heart disease .
they were monitored for up to nine years to see which of them went on to suffer a heart attack or stroke , undergo bypass surgery , or die from cardiovascular causes .
a total of 1,816 women suffered one or more cardiovascular events .
data on the women 's health were compared with air pollution readings from 36 metropolitan areas .
scientists focused on tiny airborne particles called particulates , which are less than 2.5 microns across , and can lodge in the lungs .
about 30 or 40 of the particles equal the width of a human hair .
normally invisible , they can be seen as dense clouds as they emerge from an exhaust pipe , smokestack or chimney , and are responsible for urban haze .
hazardous it was already known that fine particulates are associated with heart disease , but earlier studies did not look at the effect of local air pollution on previously healthy individuals .
researchers said the results suggested that for older women fine particulates are far more hazardous than was previously thought .
lead researcher professor joel kaufman , from the university of washington in seattle , said : " these soot particles , which are typically created by fossil-fuel combustion in vehicles and power plants , can contain a complex mix of chemicals .
" the tiny particles , and the pollutant gases that travel along with them , cause harmful effects once they are breathed in . "
the researchers said it was unclear precisely how fine sooty particles might trigger heart disease , but one thought was that they accelerated the hardening and narrowing of arteries .
professor kaufman added : " preventing these effects requires reducing the pollution at the source . "
professor jeremy pearson , associate medical director of the british heart foundation , said the study suggested the risk was " greater than previously thought " .
" this adds to the mounting evidence that air pollution should be taken seriously as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease .
" when localised air pollution is particularly high , people with chronic lung disease or coronary heart disease should avoid staying outside for long periods . "

they were monitored for up to nine years to see which of them went on to suffer a heart attack or stroke , undergo bypass surgery , or die from cardiovascular causes .
a total of 1,816 women suffered one or more cardiovascular events .
data on the women 's health were compared with air pollution readings from 36 metropolitan areas .
scientists focused on tiny airborne particles called particulates , which are less than 2.5 microns across , and can lodge in the lungs .
about 30 or 40 of the particles equal the width of a human hair .
normally invisible , they can be seen as dense clouds as they emerge from an exhaust pipe , smokestack or chimney , and are responsible for urban haze .
hazardous it was already known that fine particulates are associated with heart disease , but earlier studies did not look at the effect of local air pollution on previously healthy individuals .
researchers said the results suggested that for older women fine particulates are far more hazardous than was previously thought .
lead researcher professor joel kaufman , from the university of washington in seattle , said : " these soot particles , which are typically created by fossil-fuel combustion in vehicles and power plants , can contain a complex mix of chemicals .
" the tiny particles , and the pollutant gases that travel along with them , cause harmful effects once they are breathed in . "
the researchers said it was unclear precisely how fine sooty particles might trigger heart disease , but one thought was that they accelerated the hardening and narrowing of arteries .
professor kaufman added : " preventing these effects requires reducing the pollution at the source . "
professor jeremy pearson , associate medical director of the british heart foundation , said the study suggested the risk was " greater than previously thought " .
" this adds to the mounting evidence that air pollution should be taken seriously as a risk factor for cardiovascular disease .
" when localised air pollution is particularly high , people with chronic lung disease or coronary heart disease should avoid staying outside for long periods . "

researchers studied 66,000 women in and around 36 us cities , finding pollution levels varied between four to nearly 20 micrograms per cubic metre .
the university of washington team said each 10 microgram rise was matched by a 76 % rise in the chances of dying from heart disease or stroke .
it was not clear whether women are more susceptible to pollution than men , the new england journal of medicine said .
however , women 's coronary arteries are smaller and this might render them more vulnerable .
for women living within , rather than between , cities , the risk more than doubled , increasing by 128 % , with each step up in pollution levels . "

mark durkan is following charismatic political giant john hume it 's also the kind of clever remark mr durkan himself might have come up with .
he once accused anti-agreement unionists of " antics , pedantics and semantics " and often complains his political opponents in the dup and sinn fein are " starring in their own stand-off . "
his critics in turn complain that his pithy one-liners are often buried in tediously long paragraphs .
since taking over the leadership of the sdlp in 2001 , mark durkan has had the onerous burden of following a charismatic political giant , the nobel laureate , john hume .
some say mr durkan was brave to succeed mr hume - particularly when he inherited a party that was losing its place as the largest nationalist party .
when mr durkan took over the leadership he was the only contender and his " coronation " followed the devastating 2001 election which saw sinn fein overtake the sdlp , winning westminster seats in west tyrone and fermanagh-south tyrone .
having been groomed by john hume for years , mr durkan no doubt felt the pressures of office but he did not shirk from the challenge .
if mr hume was the architect of the good friday agreement , and his deputy seamus mallon , the builder , then mr durkan was the chief draftsman .
few can recite key passages of the deal as ably as him .
nor has any other party leader clung as ruthlessly to the letter of the agreement in negotiations .
as a fellow londonderry man , mr durkan became mr hume 's protege when he dropped out of queen 's university in 1983 to work for the newly-elected mp for foyle .
mr durkan was already a student politician while studying politics and philosophy .
indeed , mr durkan has never worked outside politics .
he joined the sdlp rather than sinn fein as he had long abhorred violence , having witnessed at first hand the worst of the troubles as a young boy .
the polarisation , and what he calls the " manipulation " wrought by the hunger strikes , drew him towards moderate nationalism .
with his family by his side , mr durkan smiled through a difficult election campaign in may 2005 born in 1960 , mr durkan was the youngest of seven children .
he was raised by his mother , isobel , after his father brendan , an ruc inspector , was killed in a road accident in 1961 .
the young durkan was doted on by his mother by all accounts , and she even led a schools ' campaign in the pennysburn estate where they lived when she realised her son and other children were suffering from overcrowding in the local catholic school .
his mother also took him to hear john hume speak in the heyday of the civil rights movement .
like mr hume , mr durkan draws inspiration from the black civil rights activist martin luther king , whose portrait is displayed in his office in foyle .
he has also worked closely with senator ted kennedy having served an internship with the leading us democrat in washington in 1985 .
from senator kennedy , he learned this lesson : " you should never go into any issue on any angle unless you know how you are going to get out of it . "
while mr hume was not a leader who shared his secrets within the party , he did entrust his young protege with the details of his confidential talks with the sinn fein leader , talks which led to the 1994 ira ceasefire .
by this time mr durkan was a derry city councillor , and was serving as party chairman , a post he held from 1990-1995 .
during this time he was also a key negotiator in talks , hence his role in the good friday agreement , forged in 1998 .
it was mr durkan who reputedly came up with the concept of the first and deputy first minister .
he was inspired by a joint visit made to the murder scene at poytnzpass by david trimble and seamus mallon .
he viewed the joint office as " binding the wounds . "
as the engineers of the agreement our role has been a very real one , a very responsible one mark durkan sdlp leader when the power-sharing executive was finally formed in december 1999 , mr durkan , who had won an assembly seat in foyle , became finance minister .
he was nominally in charge of more than £ 8bn and managed to negotiate the budget with ministers from four different parties .
" quality and equality , " was what he promised .
he was widely regarded as a tough but fair minister .
mr durkan lapped up the post , which was rife with the kind of details he can absorb easily and his officials were impressed with his grasp of his portfolio .
with the change in the sdlp leadership in 2001 , mr durkan reluctantly relinquished finance for the post of deputy first minister .
his relationship with the first minister , david trimble , began cordially but by the end of their first year in office together , the relationship was strained .
when faced with the suspension of the 2002 assembly when the ira was accused of spying at stormont , mr durkan , during a private discussion in downing street , refused tony blair 's suggestion that he might vote sinn fein out of the assembly .
mr durkan told the prime minister he wanted to see the evidence of foul play before moving .
' rock bottom ' with the suspension of power-sharing , mr durkan focused his efforts on restoration , and trying to re-organise his party .
he fell foul of some long-standing members , including annie courtney , a fellow derry person and staunch hume supporter .
she failed to win a nomination and when the party refused to include her on the ticket , she stood as an independent .
despite the new leader 's efforts , the sdlp seemed ill-equipped to take on the sinn fein electoral machine .
this was proven to be correct when the party lost six assembly seats and was pushed into fourth place , from a position of first place in 1998 .
confidence in the new leadership was eroded further when in 2004 , the sdlp lost its euro seat , long held by john hume , to sinn fein .
by then party morale was rock bottom but mr durkan was no doubt buoyed by good news in his personal life .
he and his wife , jackie , to whom he had been introduced by hume , celebrated the birth of a much longed-for child , dearbhail , who was born in january 2005 .
with his family by his side , mr durkan smiled through a difficult election campaign in may 2005 .
commentators were writing off the " nice guy " of northern ireland politics and the sdlp , expecting a rout by sinn fein in the westminster poll .
but mr durkan surprised many when he won a landslide in foyle , successfully defending john hume 's old seat .
mark was sdlp chairperson form 1990 to 1995 .
before the outcome , sinn fein sources had boasted the seat was " in the bag . "
mr durkan refused to give up however and defied his critics .
the foyle ulster unionist candidate earl storey , remarked at the time : " mark durkan stopped a juggernaut . "
mr durkan 's victory , coupled with a win in south belfast for his deputy alasdair mcdonnell , eased the pain of losing newry and armagh and buoyed the party faithful .
having emerged from the 2005 election with three mps , including south down 's eddie mcgrady , mr durkan achieved the kind of bridgehead he needed to fight the growth of sinn fein .
with a power base in his own right , mr durkan now has the time and space he needs to mount his long-term comeback strategy .
what he may lack in charisma , he seems to make up for in determination .
mr durkan 's critics - republicans included - concede the sdlp is becoming revitalised .
time is also on durkan 's side in that he is the youngest of the party leaders .
mr durkan has long accepted that he must demonstrate that the sdlp is about more than just the peace process itself .
in an interview with the bbc news website , mr durkan said : " as a party we have been taken for granted in the peace process .
poll challenge " as the engineers of the agreement our role has been a very real one , a very responsible one .
it might not have been as noisy or visible -lrb- as other parties -rrb- but it has been much more vital and constructive . "
now that sinn fein are poised to sign up to policing , subject to party approval , mr durkan will have to work harder to distinguish his party .
he has so far refused any notion of merging with a political party in the irish republic .
instead , he has focused on issues where he judges sinn fein to be vulnerable .
he has been particularly critical of sinn fein 's negotiating efforts post-agreement on issues such as republicans on-the-run and policing .
the forthcoming assembly election will be a challenge and no-one expects huge gains from the sdlp and no-one is expecting the once-predicted meltdown .
as for mr durkan , he often recalls his mother 's advice in times of trouble : " sanity not vanity . "

his mother also took him to hear john hume speak in the heyday of the civil rights movement .
like mr hume , mr durkan draws inspiration from the black civil rights activist martin luther king , whose portrait is displayed in his office in foyle .
he has also worked closely with senator ted kennedy having served an internship with the leading us democrat in washington in 1985 .
from senator kennedy , he learned this lesson : " you should never go into any issue on any angle unless you know how you are going to get out of it . "
while mr hume was not a leader who shared his secrets within the party , he did entrust his young protege with the details of his confidential talks with the sinn fein leader , talks which led to the 1994 ira ceasefire .
by this time mr durkan was a derry city councillor , and was serving as party chairman , a post he held from 1990-1995 .
during this time he was also a key negotiator in talks , hence his role in the good friday agreement , forged in 1998 .
it was mr durkan who reputedly came up with the concept of the first and deputy first minister .
he was inspired by a joint visit made to the murder scene at poytnzpass by david trimble and seamus mallon .
he viewed the joint office as " binding the wounds . "
as the engineers of the agreement our role has been a very real one , a very responsible one mark durkan sdlp leader when the power-sharing executive was finally formed in december 1999 , mr durkan , who had won an assembly seat in foyle , became finance minister .
he was nominally in charge of more than £ 8bn and managed to negotiate the budget with ministers from four different parties .
" quality and equality , " was what he promised .
he was widely regarded as a tough but fair minister .
mr durkan lapped up the post , which was rife with the kind of details he can absorb easily and his officials were impressed with his grasp of his portfolio .
with the change in the sdlp leadership in 2001 , mr durkan reluctantly relinquished finance for the post of deputy first minister .
his relationship with the first minister , david trimble , began cordially but by the end of their first year in office together , the relationship was strained .
when faced with the suspension of the 2002 assembly when the ira was accused of spying at stormont , mr durkan , during a private discussion in downing street , refused tony blair 's suggestion that he might vote sinn fein out of the assembly .
mr durkan told the prime minister he wanted to see the evidence of foul play before moving .
' rock bottom ' with the suspension of power-sharing , mr durkan focused his efforts on restoration , and trying to re-organise his party .
he fell foul of some long-standing members , including annie courtney , a fellow derry person and staunch hume supporter .
she failed to win a nomination and when the party refused to include her on the ticket , she stood as an independent .
despite the new leader 's efforts , the sdlp seemed ill-equipped to take on the sinn fein electoral machine .
this was proven to be correct when the party lost six assembly seats and was pushed into fourth place , from a position of first place in 1998 .
confidence in the new leadership was eroded further when in 2004 , the sdlp lost its euro seat , long held by john hume , to sinn fein .
by then party morale was rock bottom but mr durkan was no doubt buoyed by good news in his personal life .
he and his wife , jackie , to whom he had been introduced by hume , celebrated the birth of a much longed-for child , dearbhail , who was born in january 2005 .
with his family by his side , mr durkan smiled through a difficult election campaign in may 2005 .
commentators were writing off the " nice guy " of northern ireland politics and the sdlp , expecting a rout by sinn fein in the westminster poll .
but mr durkan surprised many when he won a landslide in foyle , successfully defending john hume 's old seat .
mark was sdlp chairperson form 1990 to 1995 .
before the outcome , sinn fein sources had boasted the seat was " in the bag . "
mr durkan refused to give up however and defied his critics .
the foyle ulster unionist candidate earl storey , remarked at the time : " mark durkan stopped a juggernaut . "
mr durkan 's victory , coupled with a win in south belfast for his deputy alasdair mcdonnell , eased the pain of losing newry and armagh and buoyed the party faithful .
having emerged from the 2005 election with three mps , including south down 's eddie mcgrady , mr durkan achieved the kind of bridgehead he needed to fight the growth of sinn fein .
with a power base in his own right , mr durkan now has the time and space he needs to mount his long-term comeback strategy .
what he may lack in charisma , he seems to make up for in determination .
mr durkan 's critics - republicans included - concede the sdlp is becoming revitalised .
time is also on durkan 's side in that he is the youngest of the party leaders .
mr durkan has long accepted that he must demonstrate that the sdlp is about more than just the peace process itself .
in an interview with the bbc news website , mr durkan said : " as a party we have been taken for granted in the peace process .
poll challenge " as the engineers of the agreement our role has been a very real one , a very responsible one .
it might not have been as noisy or visible -lrb- as other parties -rrb- but it has been much more vital and constructive . "
now that sinn fein are poised to sign up to policing , subject to party approval , mr durkan will have to work harder to distinguish his party .
he has so far refused any notion of merging with a political party in the irish republic .
instead , he has focused on issues where he judges sinn fein to be vulnerable .
he has been particularly critical of sinn fein 's negotiating efforts post-agreement on issues such as republicans on-the-run and policing .
the forthcoming assembly election will be a challenge and no-one expects huge gains from the sdlp and no-one is expecting the once-predicted meltdown .
as for mr durkan , he often recalls his mother 's advice in times of trouble : " sanity not vanity . "

since taking over the leadership of the sdlp in 2001 , mark durkan has had the onerous burden of following a charismatic political giant , the nobel laureate , john hume .
some say mr durkan was brave to succeed mr hume - particularly when he inherited a party that was losing its place as the largest nationalist party .
when mr durkan took over the leadership he was the only contender and his " coronation " followed the devastating 2001 election which saw sinn fein overtake the sdlp , winning westminster seats in west tyrone and fermanagh-south tyrone .
having been groomed by john hume for years , mr durkan no doubt felt the pressures of office but he did not shirk from the challenge .
if mr hume was the architect of the good friday agreement , and his deputy seamus mallon , the builder , then mr durkan was the chief draftsman .
few can recite key passages of the deal as ably as him .
nor has any other party leader clung as ruthlessly to the letter of the agreement in negotiations .
as a fellow londonderry man , mr durkan became mr hume 's protege when he dropped out of queen 's university in 1983 to work for the newly-elected mp for foyle .
mr durkan was already a student politician while studying politics and philosophy .
indeed , mr durkan has never worked outside politics .
he joined the sdlp rather than sinn fein as he had long abhorred violence , having witnessed at first hand the worst of the troubles as a young boy .
the polarisation , and what he calls the " manipulation " wrought by the hunger strikes , drew him towards moderate nationalism .

the young durkan was doted on by his mother by all accounts , and she even led a schools ' campaign in the pennysburn estate where they lived when she realised her son and other children were suffering from overcrowding in the local catholic school .
his mother also took him to hear john hume speak in the heyday of the civil rights movement .
like mr hume , mr durkan draws inspiration from the black civil rights activist martin luther king , whose portrait is displayed in his office in foyle .
he has also worked closely with senator ted kennedy having served an internship with the leading us democrat in washington in 1985 .
from senator kennedy , he learned this lesson : " you should never go into any issue on any angle unless you know how you are going to get out of it . "
while mr hume was not a leader who shared his secrets within the party , he did entrust his young protege with the details of his confidential talks with the sinn fein leader , talks which led to the 1994 ira ceasefire .
by this time mr durkan was a derry city councillor , and was serving as party chairman , a post he held from 1990-1995 .
during this time he was also a key negotiator in talks , hence his role in the good friday agreement , forged in 1998 .
it was mr durkan who reputedly came up with the concept of the first and deputy first minister .
he was inspired by a joint visit made to the murder scene at poytnzpass by david trimble and seamus mallon .
he viewed the joint office as " binding the wounds . "
as the engineers of the agreement our role has been a very real one , a very responsible one mark durkan sdlp leader when the power-sharing executive was finally formed in december 1999 , mr durkan , who had won an assembly seat in foyle , became finance minister .
he was nominally in charge of more than £ 8bn and managed to negotiate the budget with ministers from four different parties .
" quality and equality , " was what he promised .
he was widely regarded as a tough but fair minister .
mr durkan lapped up the post , which was rife with the kind of details he can absorb easily and his officials were impressed with his grasp of his portfolio .
with the change in the sdlp leadership in 2001 , mr durkan reluctantly relinquished finance for the post of deputy first minister .
his relationship with the first minister , david trimble , began cordially but by the end of their first year in office together , the relationship was strained .
when faced with the suspension of the 2002 assembly when the ira was accused of spying at stormont , mr durkan , during a private discussion in downing street , refused tony blair 's suggestion that he might vote sinn fein out of the assembly .
mr durkan told the prime minister he wanted to see the evidence of foul play before moving .
' rock bottom ' with the suspension of power-sharing , mr durkan focused his efforts on restoration , and trying to re-organise his party .
he fell foul of some long-standing members , including annie courtney , a fellow derry person and staunch hume supporter .
she failed to win a nomination and when the party refused to include her on the ticket , she stood as an independent .
despite the new leader 's efforts , the sdlp seemed ill-equipped to take on the sinn fein electoral machine .
this was proven to be correct when the party lost six assembly seats and was pushed into fourth place , from a position of first place in 1998 .
confidence in the new leadership was eroded further when in 2004 , the sdlp lost its euro seat , long held by john hume , to sinn fein .
by then party morale was rock bottom but mr durkan was no doubt buoyed by good news in his personal life .
he and his wife , jackie , to whom he had been introduced by hume , celebrated the birth of a much longed-for child , dearbhail , who was born in january 2005 .
with his family by his side , mr durkan smiled through a difficult election campaign in may 2005 .
commentators were writing off the " nice guy " of northern ireland politics and the sdlp , expecting a rout by sinn fein in the westminster poll .
but mr durkan surprised many when he won a landslide in foyle , successfully defending john hume 's old seat .
mark was sdlp chairperson form 1990 to 1995 .
before the outcome , sinn fein sources had boasted the seat was " in the bag . "
mr durkan refused to give up however and defied his critics .
the foyle ulster unionist candidate earl storey , remarked at the time : " mark durkan stopped a juggernaut . "
mr durkan 's victory , coupled with a win in south belfast for his deputy alasdair mcdonnell , eased the pain of losing newry and armagh and buoyed the party faithful .
having emerged from the 2005 election with three mps , including south down 's eddie mcgrady , mr durkan achieved the kind of bridgehead he needed to fight the growth of sinn fein .
with a power base in his own right , mr durkan now has the time and space he needs to mount his long-term comeback strategy .
what he may lack in charisma , he seems to make up for in determination .
mr durkan 's critics - republicans included - concede the sdlp is becoming revitalised .
time is also on durkan 's side in that he is the youngest of the party leaders .
mr durkan has long accepted that he must demonstrate that the sdlp is about more than just the peace process itself .
in an interview with the bbc news website , mr durkan said : " as a party we have been taken for granted in the peace process .
poll challenge " as the engineers of the agreement our role has been a very real one , a very responsible one .
it might not have been as noisy or visible -lrb- as other parties -rrb- but it has been much more vital and constructive . "
now that sinn fein are poised to sign up to policing , subject to party approval , mr durkan will have to work harder to distinguish his party .
he has so far refused any notion of merging with a political party in the irish republic .
instead , he has focused on issues where he judges sinn fein to be vulnerable .
he has been particularly critical of sinn fein 's negotiating efforts post-agreement on issues such as republicans on-the-run and policing .
the forthcoming assembly election will be a challenge and no-one expects huge gains from the sdlp and no-one is expecting the once-predicted meltdown .
as for mr durkan , he often recalls his mother 's advice in times of trouble : " sanity not vanity . "

his critics in turn complain that his pithy one-liners are often buried in tediously long paragraphs .
since taking over the leadership of the sdlp in 2001 , mark durkan has had the onerous burden of following a charismatic political giant , the nobel laureate , john hume .
some say mr durkan was brave to succeed mr hume - particularly when he inherited a party that was losing its place as the largest nationalist party .
when mr durkan took over the leadership he was the only contender and his " coronation " followed the devastating 2001 election which saw sinn fein overtake the sdlp , winning westminster seats in west tyrone and fermanagh-south tyrone .
having been groomed by john hume for years , mr durkan no doubt felt the pressures of office but he did not shirk from the challenge .
if mr hume was the architect of the good friday agreement , and his deputy seamus mallon , the builder , then mr durkan was the chief draftsman .
few can recite key passages of the deal as ably as him .
nor has any other party leader clung as ruthlessly to the letter of the agreement in negotiations .
as a fellow londonderry man , mr durkan became mr hume 's protege when he dropped out of queen 's university in 1983 to work for the newly-elected mp for foyle .
mr durkan was already a student politician while studying politics and philosophy .
indeed , mr durkan has never worked outside politics .
he joined the sdlp rather than sinn fein as he had long abhorred violence , having witnessed at first hand the worst of the troubles as a young boy .
the polarisation , and what he calls the " manipulation " wrought by the hunger strikes , drew him towards moderate nationalism .

the young durkan was doted on by his mother by all accounts , and she even led a schools ' campaign in the pennysburn estate where they lived when she realised her son and other children were suffering from overcrowding in the local catholic school .
his mother also took him to hear john hume speak in the heyday of the civil rights movement .
like mr hume , mr durkan draws inspiration from the black civil rights activist martin luther king , whose portrait is displayed in his office in foyle .
he has also worked closely with senator ted kennedy having served an internship with the leading us democrat in washington in 1985 .
from senator kennedy , he learned this lesson : " you should never go into any issue on any angle unless you know how you are going to get out of it . "
while mr hume was not a leader who shared his secrets within the party , he did entrust his young protege with the details of his confidential talks with the sinn fein leader , talks which led to the 1994 ira ceasefire .
by this time mr durkan was a derry city councillor , and was serving as party chairman , a post he held from 1990-1995 .
during this time he was also a key negotiator in talks , hence his role in the good friday agreement , forged in 1998 .
it was mr durkan who reputedly came up with the concept of the first and deputy first minister .
he was inspired by a joint visit made to the murder scene at poytnzpass by david trimble and seamus mallon .
he viewed the joint office as " binding the wounds . "
as the engineers of the agreement our role has been a very real one , a very responsible one mark durkan sdlp leader when the power-sharing executive was finally formed in december 1999 , mr durkan , who had won an assembly seat in foyle , became finance minister .
he was nominally in charge of more than £ 8bn and managed to negotiate the budget with ministers from four different parties .
" quality and equality , " was what he promised .
he was widely regarded as a tough but fair minister .
mr durkan lapped up the post , which was rife with the kind of details he can absorb easily and his officials were impressed with his grasp of his portfolio .
with the change in the sdlp leadership in 2001 , mr durkan reluctantly relinquished finance for the post of deputy first minister .
his relationship with the first minister , david trimble , began cordially but by the end of their first year in office together , the relationship was strained .
when faced with the suspension of the 2002 assembly when the ira was accused of spying at stormont , mr durkan , during a private discussion in downing street , refused tony blair 's suggestion that he might vote sinn fein out of the assembly .
mr durkan told the prime minister he wanted to see the evidence of foul play before moving .
' rock bottom ' with the suspension of power-sharing , mr durkan focused his efforts on restoration , and trying to re-organise his party .
he fell foul of some long-standing members , including annie courtney , a fellow derry person and staunch hume supporter .
she failed to win a nomination and when the party refused to include her on the ticket , she stood as an independent .
despite the new leader 's efforts , the sdlp seemed ill-equipped to take on the sinn fein electoral machine .
this was proven to be correct when the party lost six assembly seats and was pushed into fourth place , from a position of first place in 1998 .
confidence in the new leadership was eroded further when in 2004 , the sdlp lost its euro seat , long held by john hume , to sinn fein .
by then party morale was rock bottom but mr durkan was no doubt buoyed by good news in his personal life .
he and his wife , jackie , to whom he had been introduced by hume , celebrated the birth of a much longed-for child , dearbhail , who was born in january 2005 .
with his family by his side , mr durkan smiled through a difficult election campaign in may 2005 .
commentators were writing off the " nice guy " of northern ireland politics and the sdlp , expecting a rout by sinn fein in the westminster poll .
but mr durkan surprised many when he won a landslide in foyle , successfully defending john hume 's old seat .
mark was sdlp chairperson form 1990 to 1995 .
before the outcome , sinn fein sources had boasted the seat was " in the bag . "
mr durkan refused to give up however and defied his critics .
the foyle ulster unionist candidate earl storey , remarked at the time : " mark durkan stopped a juggernaut . "
mr durkan 's victory , coupled with a win in south belfast for his deputy alasdair mcdonnell , eased the pain of losing newry and armagh and buoyed the party faithful .
having emerged from the 2005 election with three mps , including south down 's eddie mcgrady , mr durkan achieved the kind of bridgehead he needed to fight the growth of sinn fein .
with a power base in his own right , mr durkan now has the time and space he needs to mount his long-term comeback strategy .
what he may lack in charisma , he seems to make up for in determination .
mr durkan 's critics - republicans included - concede the sdlp is becoming revitalised .
time is also on durkan 's side in that he is the youngest of the party leaders .
mr durkan has long accepted that he must demonstrate that the sdlp is about more than just the peace process itself .
in an interview with the bbc news website , mr durkan said : " as a party we have been taken for granted in the peace process .
poll challenge " as the engineers of the agreement our role has been a very real one , a very responsible one .
it might not have been as noisy or visible -lrb- as other parties -rrb- but it has been much more vital and constructive . "
now that sinn fein are poised to sign up to policing , subject to party approval , mr durkan will have to work harder to distinguish his party .
he has so far refused any notion of merging with a political party in the irish republic .
instead , he has focused on issues where he judges sinn fein to be vulnerable .
he has been particularly critical of sinn fein 's negotiating efforts post-agreement on issues such as republicans on-the-run and policing .
the forthcoming assembly election will be a challenge and no-one expects huge gains from the sdlp and no-one is expecting the once-predicted meltdown .
as for mr durkan , he often recalls his mother 's advice in times of trouble : " sanity not vanity . "

it 's also the kind of clever remark mr durkan himself might have come up with .
he once accused anti-agreement unionists of " antics , pedantics and semantics " and often complains his political opponents in the dup and sinn fein are " starring in their own stand-off . "
his critics in turn complain that his pithy one-liners are often buried in tediously long paragraphs .
since taking over the leadership of the sdlp in 2001 , mark durkan has had the onerous burden of following a charismatic political giant , the nobel laureate , john hume .
some say mr durkan was brave to succeed mr hume - particularly when he inherited a party that was losing its place as the largest nationalist party .
when mr durkan took over the leadership he was the only contender and his " coronation " followed the devastating 2001 election which saw sinn fein overtake the sdlp , winning westminster seats in west tyrone and fermanagh-south tyrone .
having been groomed by john hume for years , mr durkan no doubt felt the pressures of office but he did not shirk from the challenge .
if mr hume was the architect of the good friday agreement , and his deputy seamus mallon , the builder , then mr durkan was the chief draftsman .
few can recite key passages of the deal as ably as him .
nor has any other party leader clung as ruthlessly to the letter of the agreement in negotiations .
as a fellow londonderry man , mr durkan became mr hume 's protege when he dropped out of queen 's university in 1983 to work for the newly-elected mp for foyle .
mr durkan was already a student politician while studying politics and philosophy .
indeed , mr durkan has never worked outside politics .
he joined the sdlp rather than sinn fein as he had long abhorred violence , having witnessed at first hand the worst of the troubles as a young boy .
the polarisation , and what he calls the " manipulation " wrought by the hunger strikes , drew him towards moderate nationalism . "
with his family by his side , mr durkan smiled through a difficult election campaign in may 2005 " born in 1960 , mr durkan was the youngest of seven children .
he was raised by his mother , isobel , after his father brendan , an ruc inspector , was killed in a road accident in 1961 .

unlike his predecessor , sir reg was neither a nobel prize winner nor an mp .
moreover , he was taking over a party in shock after a clear election defeat at the hands of the dup .
from having 10 mps in 1997 , the ulster unionists slumped to a single survivor in the house of commons in 2005 - with only lady sylvia hermon hanging on in north down .
sir reg 's challenge has been to carve out a role on the sidelines for a party which , for decades , assumed it would always be the dominant force in northern ireland politics .
resentful at what they see as the dup stealing their clothes , the ulster unionists have had to perform a balancing act , criticising dup tactics without alienating moderate unionists who favour stability and agreement .
his supporters say sir reg 's studiously polite style gives him the " people skills " to repair a fractured party .
but he did run into strong internal criticism for considering an assembly alliance with the loyalist progressive unionists .
born in east belfast on 26 october 1947 , reg empey 's family were retailers , and his uncle was a stormont ulster unionist mp .
after attending the royal school in armagh , sir reg went to queen 's university in belfast , where his contemporaries included the future mp bernadette devlin .
once he graduated , he went into retailing , a dangerous trade in 1970s belfast .
when his royal avenue store , which was opposite the army barracks , was destroyed in an explosion , and looted , he expressed his outrage on television . "
sir reg pledged to continue trying to bring the uvf and the uda out of the political cold arguing that completing that task would provide a suitable legacy for loyalism 's lost leader " sir reg has been involved in unionism since his student days .
in the mid-70s , like david trimble , he was a supporter of the hard-line vanguard movement .
he opposed the power-sharing sunningdale executive and played a backroom role in the ulster workers ' council strike which brought it down .
he became a belfast councillor and served two terms as the city 's lord mayor .
he participated in the campaign against the 1985 anglo-irish agreement .
but when irish prime minister charles haughey visited the city in 1989 to address a business conference , he refused to bow to pressure from fellow unionists to boycott the event .
instead , he braved loyalist protests to open the conference telling his audience that the taoiseach 's territorial claim to northern ireland was " not on " .
he has been a member of successive ulster unionist negotiating teams since the brooke-mayhew talks in the early 1990s .
in 1995 , he attempted to win his party 's nomination to fight the westminster seat of north down but lost out to one of his rivals for the party leadership alan mcfarland .
this left him to fight the less promising east belfast seat .
the dup deputy leader , peter robinson , beat him there in 1997 and again in 2005 .
in 1998 , sir reg played a key role in negotiating the good friday agreement .
the year after the agreement was signed he received a knighthood and david trimble appointed him minister for trade and enterprise in the stormont executive .
as a businessman himself , he was well liked by local entrepreneurs , and was noted for his efforts to develop a north-south gas pipeline and his attempts to save the harland and wolff shipyard .
as unionists became increasingly disenchanted with the agreement , sir reg stayed loyal to david trimble .
but he disagreed with the party 's decision to suspend the rebel mp , jeffrey donaldson , after he quit the ulster unionist whip at westminster .
sir reg engaged in talks with the lagan valley mp , which he defended as an " attempt to heal internal divisions " .
however , those close to david trimble believed the two men were plotting a " dream team " challenge to the leader .
the north down mp , sylvia hermon , made no secret of her disappointment , claiming sir reg had done " a great deal of damage to his own reputation " .
resignations when david trimble stood down as party leader , lady sylvia backed her north down colleague alan mcfarland .
but sir reg 's campaign clearly demonstrated a broader swathe of support amongst the party 's well known names - former mps david burnside and lord maginnis rallied to his cause , as did the euro mp jim nicholson .
in 2006 , sir reg surprised observers by agreeing a deal with the late david ervine , the east belfast assembly member whose progressive unionist party is linked to the uvf .
the assembly arrangement promised to secure the ulster unionists an extra ministerial seat in a future executive .
but some party members , like lady sylvia hermon , regarded any link with the uvf as unacceptable at a time when their ceasefire was not recognised .
some uup members resigned over the deal .
however , the assembly arrangement was ruled out of order by the stormont speaker .
then there were plaudits from all political quarters for david ervine when the pup leader died after suffering a heart attack in january 2007 .
sir reg pledged to continue trying to bring the uvf and the uda out of the political cold , arguing that completing that task would provide a suitable legacy for loyalism 's lost leader .

unlike his predecessor , sir reg was neither a nobel prize winner nor an mp .
sir reg has a " studiously polite " style moreover , he was taking over a party in shock after a clear election defeat at the hands of the dup .
from having 10 mps in 1997 , the ulster unionists slumped to a single survivor in the house of commons in 2005 - with only lady sylvia hermon hanging on in north down .
sir reg 's challenge has been to carve out a role on the sidelines for a party which , for decades , assumed it would always be the dominant force in northern ireland politics .
resentful at what they see as the dup stealing their clothes , the ulster unionists have had to perform a balancing act , criticising dup tactics without alienating moderate unionists who favour stability and agreement .
his supporters say sir reg 's studiously polite style gives him the " people skills " to repair a fractured party .
but he did run into strong internal criticism for considering an assembly alliance with the loyalist progressive unionists .
born in east belfast on 26 october 1947 , reg empey 's family were retailers , and his uncle was a stormont ulster unionist mp .
after attending the royal school in armagh , sir reg went to queen 's university in belfast , where his contemporaries included the future mp bernadette devlin .
once he graduated , he went into retailing , a dangerous trade in 1970s belfast .
when his royal avenue store , which was opposite the army barracks , was destroyed in an explosion , and looted , he expressed his outrage on television .
sir reg pledged to continue trying to bring the uvf and the uda out of the political cold arguing that completing that task would provide a suitable legacy for loyalism 's lost leader sir reg has been involved in unionism since his student days .
in the mid-70s , like david trimble , he was a supporter of the hard-line vanguard movement .
he opposed the power-sharing sunningdale executive and played a backroom role in the ulster workers ' council strike which brought it down .
he became a belfast councillor and served two terms as the city 's lord mayor .
he participated in the campaign against the 1985 anglo-irish agreement .
but when irish prime minister charles haughey visited the city in 1989 to address a business conference , he refused to bow to pressure from fellow unionists to boycott the event .
instead , he braved loyalist protests to open the conference telling his audience that the taoiseach 's territorial claim to northern ireland was " not on " .
he has been a member of successive ulster unionist negotiating teams since the brooke-mayhew talks in the early 1990s .
in 1995 , he attempted to win his party 's nomination to fight the westminster seat of north down but lost out to one of his rivals for the party leadership alan mcfarland .
this left him to fight the less promising east belfast seat .
the dup deputy leader , peter robinson , beat him there in 1997 and again in 2005 .
in 1998 , sir reg played a key role in negotiating the good friday agreement .
the year after the agreement was signed he received a knighthood and david trimble appointed him minister for trade and enterprise in the stormont executive .
sir reg was noted for his attempts to save the harland and wolff shipyard as a businessman himself , he was well liked by local entrepreneurs , and was noted for his efforts to develop a north-south gas pipeline and his attempts to save the harland and wolff shipyard .
as unionists became increasingly disenchanted with the agreement , sir reg stayed loyal to david trimble .
but he disagreed with the party 's decision to suspend the rebel mp , jeffrey donaldson , after he quit the ulster unionist whip at westminster .
sir reg engaged in talks with the lagan valley mp , which he defended as an " attempt to heal internal divisions " .
however , those close to david trimble believed the two men were plotting a " dream team " challenge to the leader .
the north down mp , sylvia hermon , made no secret of her disappointment , claiming sir reg had done " a great deal of damage to his own reputation " .
resignations when david trimble stood down as party leader , lady sylvia backed her north down colleague alan mcfarland .
but sir reg 's campaign clearly demonstrated a broader swathe of support amongst the party 's well known names - former mps david burnside and lord maginnis rallied to his cause , as did the euro mp jim nicholson .
in 2006 , sir reg surprised observers by agreeing a deal with the late david ervine , the east belfast assembly member whose progressive unionist party is linked to the uvf .
the assembly arrangement promised to secure the ulster unionists an extra ministerial seat in a future executive .
but some party members , like lady sylvia hermon , regarded any link with the uvf as unacceptable at a time when their ceasefire was not recognised .
some uup members resigned over the deal .
however , the assembly arrangement was ruled out of order by the stormont speaker .
then there were plaudits from all political quarters for david ervine when the pup leader died after suffering a heart attack in january 2007 .
sir reg pledged to continue trying to bring the uvf and the uda out of the political cold , arguing that completing that task would provide a suitable legacy for loyalism 's lost leader .

for some he was a hate figure , an apologist for ira violence .
gerry adams uses close supporters to test controversial issues for others he is northern ireland 's nelson mandela , the man who was unlucky not to win a nobel prize for shifting his movement from armed struggle to peaceful politics .
one thing sinn fein president gerry adams has never shied away from is taking big decisions .
in the 1980s he was a key player in the ira hunger strikes .
in the 1990s he brokered the ira ceasefire and the acceptance of places in a northern ireland assembly .
in the 21st century he was ready to abandon another long held republican shibboleth - opposition to the police in northern ireland .
given the personal and political risks he has taken , gerry adams 's leadership skills in navigating these sea changes in policy can not be underestimated .
historically , disagreements between republicans led to violent feuding , but during the peace process , major splits have largely been avoided .
gerry adams is always careful to use close supporters to test controversial ground in advance , ruthless in isolating and marginalising his opponents and far-sighted in never allowing the swirl of events to knock the strategic direction of his " project " off course .
born in october 1948 , in his youth he worked as a barman in a belfast city centre bar where he was fascinated by the political gossip traded among its clientele of journalists and lawyers .
however , as the civil rights movement gathered pace in the late 1960s , the young adams did not spend long pulling pints .
soon he was out on the streets , involved in the protests of the time .
according to his own account , he was purely a political activist .
gerry adams -lrb- right -rrb- at a republican meeting on policing but his family was steeped in the traditions of the ira .
his father was jailed in the organisation 's campaign during world war ii .
security sources insist young gerry followed suit and was a leading member of the ira in belfast at the time of the bloody friday bombings in 1972 .
during the prison hunger strikes of the 1980s , gerry adams recognised the lessons of bobby sands 's election as mp for fermanagh-south tyrone .
after the hunger strikes , the ira did not reduce its commitment to " armed struggle " but its political wing , sinn fein , increasingly looked to the propaganda potential of fighting elections .
gerry adams 's own election victory in west belfast in 1983 marked a major achievement for this dual " armalite and ballot box " strategy .
soon afterwards , gerry adams brushed aside the old southern leadership of sinn fein , led by ruairi o bradaigh .
in the 1980s gerry adams survived an assassination attempt by the uda , who sprayed his car with bullets while he drove through central belfast .
together with martin mcguinness , he was now in an unrivalled position to guide republican strategy .
sinn fein 's electoral successes unnerved the british and irish governments .
they came up with the 1985 anglo-irish agreement , partly in an attempt to shore up the constitutional nationalism of john hume 's sdlp .
however , within three years of the agreement , john hume and gerry adams held private talks .
the hume-adams process eventually delivered the 1994 ira ceasefire which ultimately provided the relatively peaceful backdrop against which the good friday agreement was brokered .
in 1986 , mr adams dropped sinn fein 's policy of refusing to sit in the irish parliament .
in 1998 , 90 % of the party backed their president in taking seats in the new northern ireland assembly at stormont - a remarkable piece of political management given sinn fein 's " no return to stormont " slogan in the 1997 general election campaign .
mr adams stayed out of the stormont power-sharing executive , letting martin mcguinness take a ministerial post .
when the power-sharing deal collapsed amidst recriminations over ira activity and its failure to disarm , gerry adams became a key player in the government 's attempts to broker a new agreement between him and his bete noire , ian paisley .
mr adams ' embrace of mr ervine 's widow was " highly symbolic " the negotiations foundered at the end of 2004 , but in october 2006 both mr adams and mr paisley indicated their support for the st andrews agreement , drawn up after intensive talks in scotland .
a key element of the deal was sinn fein support for the police , who the ira had once deemed " legitimate targets " .
mr adams had already signalled his intent by meeting northern ireland 's chief constable hugh orde in december 2004 .
a further meeting took place on camera at stormont as the sinn fein president signalled that backing the forces of law and order was " the right thing to do " .

for some he was a hate figure , an apologist for ira violence .
gerry adams uses close supporters to test controversial issues for others he is northern ireland 's nelson mandela , the man who was unlucky not to win a nobel prize for shifting his movement from armed struggle to peaceful politics .
one thing sinn fein president gerry adams has never shied away from is taking big decisions .
in the 1980s he was a key player in the ira hunger strikes .
in the 1990s he brokered the ira ceasefire and the acceptance of places in a northern ireland assembly .
in the 21st century he was ready to abandon another long held republican shibboleth - opposition to the police in northern ireland .
given the personal and political risks he has taken , gerry adams 's leadership skills in navigating these sea changes in policy can not be underestimated .
historically , disagreements between republicans led to violent feuding , but during the peace process , major splits have largely been avoided .
gerry adams is always careful to use close supporters to test controversial ground in advance , ruthless in isolating and marginalising his opponents and far-sighted in never allowing the swirl of events to knock the strategic direction of his " project " off course .
born in october 1948 , in his youth he worked as a barman in a belfast city centre bar where he was fascinated by the political gossip traded among its clientele of journalists and lawyers .
however , as the civil rights movement gathered pace in the late 1960s , the young adams did not spend long pulling pints .
soon he was out on the streets , involved in the protests of the time .
according to his own account , he was purely a political activist .
gerry adams -lrb- right -rrb- at a republican meeting on policing but his family was steeped in the traditions of the ira .
his father was jailed in the organisation 's campaign during world war ii .
security sources insist young gerry followed suit and was a leading member of the ira in belfast at the time of the bloody friday bombings in 1972 .
during the prison hunger strikes of the 1980s , gerry adams recognised the lessons of bobby sands 's election as mp for fermanagh-south tyrone .
after the hunger strikes , the ira did not reduce its commitment to " armed struggle " but its political wing , sinn fein , increasingly looked to the propaganda potential of fighting elections .
gerry adams 's own election victory in west belfast in 1983 marked a major achievement for this dual " armalite and ballot box " strategy .
soon afterwards , gerry adams brushed aside the old southern leadership of sinn fein , led by ruairi o bradaigh .
in the 1980s gerry adams survived an assassination attempt by the uda , who sprayed his car with bullets while he drove through central belfast .
together with martin mcguinness , he was now in an unrivalled position to guide republican strategy .
sinn fein 's electoral successes unnerved the british and irish governments .
they came up with the 1985 anglo-irish agreement , partly in an attempt to shore up the constitutional nationalism of john hume 's sdlp .
however , within three years of the agreement , john hume and gerry adams held private talks .
the hume-adams process eventually delivered the 1994 ira ceasefire which ultimately provided the relatively peaceful backdrop against which the good friday agreement was brokered .
in 1986 , mr adams dropped sinn fein 's policy of refusing to sit in the irish parliament .
in 1998 , 90 % of the party backed their president in taking seats in the new northern ireland assembly at stormont - a remarkable piece of political management given sinn fein 's " no return to stormont " slogan in the 1997 general election campaign .
mr adams stayed out of the stormont power-sharing executive , letting martin mcguinness take a ministerial post .
when the power-sharing deal collapsed amidst recriminations over ira activity and its failure to disarm , gerry adams became a key player in the government 's attempts to broker a new agreement between him and his bete noire , ian paisley .
mr adams ' embrace of mr ervine 's widow was " highly symbolic " the negotiations foundered at the end of 2004 , but in october 2006 both mr adams and mr paisley indicated their support for the st andrews agreement , drawn up after intensive talks in scotland .
a key element of the deal was sinn fein support for the police , who the ira had once deemed " legitimate targets " .
mr adams had already signalled his intent by meeting northern ireland 's chief constable hugh orde in december 2004 .
a further meeting took place on camera at stormont as the sinn fein president signalled that backing the forces of law and order was " the right thing to do " .

in the 1980s he was a key player in the ira hunger strikes .
in the 1990s he brokered the ira ceasefire and the acceptance of places in a northern ireland assembly .
in the 21st century he was ready to abandon another long held republican shibboleth - opposition to the police in northern ireland .
given the personal and political risks he has taken , gerry adams 's leadership skills in navigating these sea changes in policy can not be underestimated .
historically , disagreements between republicans led to violent feuding , but during the peace process , major splits have largely been avoided .
gerry adams is always careful to use close supporters to test controversial ground in advance , ruthless in isolating and marginalising his opponents and far-sighted in never allowing the swirl of events to knock the strategic direction of his " project " off course .
born in october 1948 , in his youth he worked as a barman in a belfast city centre bar where he was fascinated by the political gossip traded among its clientele of journalists and lawyers .
however , as the civil rights movement gathered pace in the late 1960s , the young adams did not spend long pulling pints .
soon he was out on the streets , involved in the protests of the time .
according to his own account , he was purely a political activist .
gerry adams -lrb- right -rrb- at a republican meeting on policing but his family was steeped in the traditions of the ira .
his father was jailed in the organisation 's campaign during world war ii .
security sources insist young gerry followed suit and was a leading member of the ira in belfast at the time of the bloody friday bombings in 1972 .
during the prison hunger strikes of the 1980s , gerry adams recognised the lessons of bobby sands 's election as mp for fermanagh-south tyrone .
after the hunger strikes , the ira did not reduce its commitment to " armed struggle " but its political wing , sinn fein , increasingly looked to the propaganda potential of fighting elections .
gerry adams 's own election victory in west belfast in 1983 marked a major achievement for this dual " armalite and ballot box " strategy .
soon afterwards , gerry adams brushed aside the old southern leadership of sinn fein , led by ruairi o bradaigh .
in the 1980s gerry adams survived an assassination attempt by the uda , who sprayed his car with bullets while he drove through central belfast .
together with martin mcguinness , he was now in an unrivalled position to guide republican strategy .
sinn fein 's electoral successes unnerved the british and irish governments .
they came up with the 1985 anglo-irish agreement , partly in an attempt to shore up the constitutional nationalism of john hume 's sdlp .
however , within three years of the agreement , john hume and gerry adams held private talks .
the hume-adams process eventually delivered the 1994 ira ceasefire which ultimately provided the relatively peaceful backdrop against which the good friday agreement was brokered .
in 1986 , mr adams dropped sinn fein 's policy of refusing to sit in the irish parliament .
in 1998 , 90 % of the party backed their president in taking seats in the new northern ireland assembly at stormont - a remarkable piece of political management given sinn fein 's " no return to stormont " slogan in the 1997 general election campaign .
mr adams stayed out of the stormont power-sharing executive , letting martin mcguinness take a ministerial post .
when the power-sharing deal collapsed amidst recriminations over ira activity and its failure to disarm , gerry adams became a key player in the government 's attempts to broker a new agreement between him and his bete noire , ian paisley .
mr adams ' embrace of mr ervine 's widow was " highly symbolic " the negotiations foundered at the end of 2004 , but in october 2006 both mr adams and mr paisley indicated their support for the st andrews agreement , drawn up after intensive talks in scotland .
a key element of the deal was sinn fein support for the police , who the ira had once deemed " legitimate targets " .
mr adams had already signalled his intent by meeting northern ireland 's chief constable hugh orde in december 2004 .
a further meeting took place on camera at stormont as the sinn fein president signalled that backing the forces of law and order was " the right thing to do " .
for some former followers this was a step too far .
in the 1980s , gerry adams survived an assassination attempt by the loyalist paramilitary uda , who sprayed his car with bullets while he drove through central belfast .
this was just one of many loyalist plots to murder him .
but in january 2007 , he visited loyalist east belfast to attend the funeral of david ervine , the former uvf prisoner who became a strong advocate of the peace process .
such a visit would have once been inconceivable , but adams ' embrace of mr ervine 's widow appeared highly symbolic of the sinn fein president 's political trajectory .

the negotiations foundered at the end of 2004 , but in october 2006 both mr adams and mr paisley indicated their support for the st andrews agreement , drawn up after intensive talks in scotland .
a key element of the deal was sinn fein support for the police , who the ira had once deemed " legitimate targets " .
mr adams had already signalled his intent by meeting northern ireland 's chief constable hugh orde in december 2004 .
a further meeting took place on camera at stormont as the sinn fein president signalled that backing the forces of law and order was " the right thing to do " .
for some former followers this was a step too far .
in the 1980s , gerry adams survived an assassination attempt by the loyalist paramilitary uda , who sprayed his car with bullets while he drove through central belfast .
this was just one of many loyalist plots to murder him .
but in january 2007 , he visited loyalist east belfast to attend the funeral of david ervine , the former uvf prisoner who became a strong advocate of the peace process .
such a visit would have once been inconceivable , but adams ' embrace of mr ervine 's widow appeared highly symbolic of the sinn fein president 's political trajectory .

now he 's famous for not saying it .
indeed , the dup leader is no longer the most predictable of politicians when it comes to political compromise with his traditional enemies .
at the age of 80 he is showing clear signs he wants to settle into power-sharing rather than retirement .
the politician who famously declared " never , never , never " in 1986 is no longer setting his face against change .
never , in fact has become whenever .
that is , whenever sinn fein meets its promises on policing , he 'll share power .
mr paisley has moved from not an inch , to inch by inch , to a giant leap at st andrew 's when he declared his willingness to give the deal a fair wind .
his speech in october 2006 , made on his 50th wedding anniversary , recalled the troubled past and looked forward to a bright future .
ian paisley 's declaration since that his party " will not be found wanting " if republicans , in his words , " complete the transition to democracy and the rule of law " , has been welcomed by pro-agreement politicians but it has rocked sections of his party and his traditional supporters .
just a few years ago , ian paisley told the bbc journalist , peter taylor , that he would not be changing .
" i 'll go to the grave with the convictions i have , " said the dup leader .
and just last july , at a twelfth demonstration in ballycastle , the dup leader seemed set to end his days as the great no-man when he told cheering supporters that " ira / sinn fein " would never get into a power-sharing government . "
now aged 80 , this often controversial personality is poised to lead his party into a power-sharing coalition with sinn fein 's martin mcguinness " he used the words " over our dead bodies . "
it seems the explanation offered by other party members that mr paisley was referring to " ira / sinn fein " and not sinn fein was on the mark .
now mr paisley , an often controversial personality , is poised to lead his party into a power-sharing coalition with sinn fein 's martin mcguinness .
he has the benefit of not having a paisley-type figure to oppose him , although there is evidence he will have to overcome considerable resistance within his own party - and he may lose long-time supporters on his journey to stormont .
having seen off every unionist leader since terence o 'neill , ian paisley now has the first minister 's job within his grasp .
the question he is faced with is whether or not he can muster sufficient support within unionism and within his party to achieve it .
in making his move , he must also consider the impact of his move in the free presbyterian church , elements of which are appalled by the st andrew 's agreement .
the rev ian paisley 1926 : born armagh , ni 1946 : ordained 1951 : founded free presbyterian church 1974 : entered parliament 1979 : european parliament 2004 stepped down as mep 1998 ni assembly ian paisley 's shift towards accommodation has come late - and in fits and starts after decades of firebrand attacks on both catholicism and irish republicanism .
having condemned the pope and the roman catholic church as the " whore of babylon " , ian paisley astounded his critics by meeting the irish catholic primate sean brady at stormont in october 2006 .
he has also u-turned on his attitude to dublin , having built his career on attacking the irish republic and nationalism .
famously , he once branded then ulster unionist leader jim molyneaux -lrb- now lord molyneaux -rrb- as a " judas " over his budding relationship with dublin .
more infamously , he threw snowballs in 1965 at then irish prime minister sean lemass when he came to stormont .
yet mr paisley - bold and unblushing - went to leinster house to meet the irish prime minister , bertie ahern , for the first time in the autumn of 2004 and talked of " friendly relations " .
what a contrast this was with 1964 , when mr paisley demanded an irish tricolour be removed from divis street in west belfast .
when the ruc removed it , it led to rioting .
the sinn fein leader , gerry adams , then a young man , remembers the incident as shaping his political development .
now the inevitable outcome of the political negotiations is that ian paisley will be meeting the sinn fein leader for a historic meeting .
it seems to be a matter of when , not if .
mr paisley has blocked power-sharing with moderate nationalists for years , most markedly in 1974 , when he supported a strike involving loyalist paramilitaries to wreck sunningdale .
the ulster unionist leader who headed the failed sunningdale power-sharing executive , brian faulkner , attacked mr paisley as the " demon doctor " .
his doctorate is an honorary one , bestowed by the bob jones university , in south carolina but he likes to use the title .
' shadowy groups ' he is also quite capable of verbal combat with his critics and his political enemies .
while the dup leader has condemned violence , both loyalist and republican , he has been criticised for his own past involvement with shadowy groups .
in 1981 , he appeared on a hillside in the dead of night with 500 men brandishing firearms licences and later had a brief dalliance with ulster resistance .
with the peace process came attempts by loyalist paramilitaries to organise politically - and challenge the dup .
but neither the progressive unionist party nor the now disbanded ulster democratic party made much impact electorally .
when the loyalist paramilitaries supported the 1998 good friday agreement , mr paisley found himself verbally abused by members of the uda and uvf .
back then , ian paisley seemed to have been defeated .
he suffered the humiliation of seeing a majority of unionists , however slim , embrace a deal he had vowed to wreck .
that may have been ian paisley 's epiphany - a moment of truth , that the landscape demanded a new brand of unionism , tough but compromising .
despite his hard-line stance over sunningdale , his views have been evolving for years .
as the troubles drew to a close , the dup seemed willing to accommodate constitutional nationalists in power-sharing .
failure to fully implement the 1998 deal allowed the dup to make a comeback - winning the lion 's share of the seats in the 2003 assembly poll .
in the months after this election , ian paisley struggled with ill-health and despite party denials he was gravely ill , admitted in 2004 that he had " walked in death 's shadow " .
while still recovering from his illness , mr paisley travelled to leed 's castle to take part in multi-party negotiations , involving sinn fein .
he maintained his distance , however , insisting he was only negotiating with the british government .
he gave up his job as an mep to concentrate on the political talks - making way for his successor jim allister , who is a politician very much in the mould of the traditional dup .
political analysts believe mr paisley will have a job persuading mr allister to acquiesce in power-sharing by march , as the mep has already criticised this timeframe as " insufficient " to test the ira .
and 12 members of the party 's assembly team , including four mps , issued a signed statement on 24 november 2006 insisting their party leader 's remarks in the assembly that day must not be interpreted as a nomination as first minister .
this move was seen as evidence of tensions in the party over the strategy . "
following st andrews , it now appears that mr paisley would like to be first minister before he retires , even if the price of that is martin mcguinness as partner " mr paisley has said that if there was power-sharing with sinn fein , he would have a lot to swallow .
those are the words of a man who has clearly thought about the notion .
while his old enemies in the republican movement have changed - and grown politically stronger - the dup leader is no longer keeping observers guessing as to whether he too can change .
that seems obvious now .
the question is can his party ?
and can ian paisley wield the kind of influence that has become legend in dup circles ?
it 's possible his hard-line stance all these years was merely a tool to win power .
but it 's also possible that it 's the change in circumstances that is leading to a changed paisley .
first minister how can he justify saying no if there is a chance to get rid of the ira ?
mr paisley may know that the deal will eventually be done and prefer to do it himself .
there was a time when some thought ian paisley with nine mps at westminster to the ulster unionist party 's one , would have happily settled for this status .
certainly it has brought him privileges and enabled him to nominate his wife , eileen paisley , for a peerage .
she is now baroness paisley of st george .
the power couple happily accepted a wooden bowl , made from a tree at the battle of the boyne site , from taoiseach bertie ahern at the st andrews talks , to mark their golden wedding anniversary .
following st andrews , it now appears that mr paisley would like to be first minister before he retires , even if the price of that is martin mcguinness as partner .
if he remains undisputed unionist leader , mr paisley may be free to cut a deal .
the danger for the dup leader is that , like david trimble , he fails to deliver and in the process splits his party .
mr paisley seems self-evident he does not have the time any longer for slow change .

now he 's famous for not saying it .
indeed , the dup leader is no longer the most predictable of politicians when it comes to political compromise with his traditional enemies .
ian paisley , aged 80 , could lead his party into power-sharing at the age of 80 he is showing clear signs he wants to settle into power-sharing rather than retirement .
the politician who famously declared " never , never , never " in 1986 is no longer setting his face against change .
never , in fact has become whenever .
that is , whenever sinn fein meets its promises on policing , he 'll share power .
mr paisley has moved from not an inch , to inch by inch , to a giant leap at st andrew 's when he declared his willingness to give the deal a fair wind .
his speech in october 2006 , made on his 50th wedding anniversary , recalled the troubled past and looked forward to a bright future .
ian paisley 's declaration since that his party " will not be found wanting " if republicans , in his words , " complete the transition to democracy and the rule of law " , has been welcomed by pro-agreement politicians but it has rocked sections of his party and his traditional supporters .
just a few years ago , ian paisley told the bbc journalist , peter taylor , that he would not be changing .
" i 'll go to the grave with the convictions i have , " said the dup leader .
and just last july , at a twelfth demonstration in ballycastle , the dup leader seemed set to end his days as the great no-man when he told cheering supporters that " ira / sinn fein " would never get into a power-sharing government .
now aged 80 , this often controversial personality is poised to lead his party into a power-sharing coalition with sinn fein 's martin mcguinness he used the words " over our dead bodies . "
it seems the explanation offered by other party members that mr paisley was referring to " ira / sinn fein " and not sinn fein was on the mark .
now mr paisley , an often controversial personality , is poised to lead his party into a power-sharing coalition with sinn fein 's martin mcguinness .
he has the benefit of not having a paisley-type figure to oppose him , although there is evidence he will have to overcome considerable resistance within his own party - and he may lose long-time supporters on his journey to stormont .
having seen off every unionist leader since terence o 'neill , ian paisley now has the first minister 's job within his grasp .
the question he is faced with is whether or not he can muster sufficient support within unionism and within his party to achieve it .
in making his move , he must also consider the impact of his move in the free presbyterian church , elements of which are appalled by the st andrew 's agreement .
the rev ian paisley 1926 : born armagh , ni 1946 : ordained 1951 : founded free presbyterian church 1974 : entered parliament 1979 : european parliament 2004 stepped down as mep 1998 ni assembly ian paisley 's shift towards accommodation has come late - and in fits and starts after decades of firebrand attacks on both catholicism and irish republicanism .
having condemned the pope and the roman catholic church as the " whore of babylon " , ian paisley astounded his critics by meeting the irish catholic primate sean brady at stormont in october 2006 .
he has also u-turned on his attitude to dublin , having built his career on attacking the irish republic and nationalism .
famously , he once branded then ulster unionist leader jim molyneaux -lrb- now lord molyneaux -rrb- as a " judas " over his budding relationship with dublin .
more infamously , he threw snowballs in 1965 at then irish prime minister sean lemass when he came to stormont .
yet mr paisley - bold and unblushing - went to leinster house to meet the irish prime minister , bertie ahern , for the first time in the autumn of 2004 and talked of " friendly relations " .
what a contrast this was with 1964 , when mr paisley demanded an irish tricolour be removed from divis street in west belfast .
when the ruc removed it , it led to rioting .
ian paisley at a press conference on 31 may 1983 the sinn fein leader , gerry adams , then a young man , remembers the incident as shaping his political development .
now the inevitable outcome of the political negotiations is that ian paisley will be meeting the sinn fein leader for a historic meeting .
it seems to be a matter of when , not if .
mr paisley has blocked power-sharing with moderate nationalists for years , most markedly in 1974 , when he supported a strike involving loyalist paramilitaries to wreck sunningdale .
the ulster unionist leader who headed the failed sunningdale power-sharing executive , brian faulkner , attacked mr paisley as the " demon doctor " .
his doctorate is an honorary one , bestowed by the bob jones university , in south carolina but he likes to use the title .
' shadowy groups ' he is also quite capable of verbal combat with his critics and his political enemies .
while the dup leader has condemned violence , both loyalist and republican , he has been criticised for his own past involvement with shadowy groups .
in 1981 , he appeared on a hillside in the dead of night with 500 men brandishing firearms licences and later had a brief dalliance with ulster resistance .
with the peace process came attempts by loyalist paramilitaries to organise politically - and challenge the dup .
but neither the progressive unionist party nor the now disbanded ulster democratic party made much impact electorally .
when the loyalist paramilitaries supported the 1998 good friday agreement , mr paisley found himself verbally abused by members of the uda and uvf .
back then , ian paisley seemed to have been defeated .
he suffered the humiliation of seeing a majority of unionists , however slim , embrace a deal he had vowed to wreck .
that may have been ian paisley 's epiphany - a moment of truth , that the landscape demanded a new brand of unionism , tough but compromising .
despite his hard-line stance over sunningdale , his views have been evolving for years .
as the troubles drew to a close , the dup seemed willing to accommodate constitutional nationalists in power-sharing .
ian paisley electioneering in northern ireland in october 1974 failure to fully implement the 1998 deal allowed the dup to make a comeback - winning the lion 's share of the seats in the 2003 assembly poll .
in the months after this election , ian paisley struggled with ill-health and despite party denials he was gravely ill , admitted in 2004 that he had " walked in death 's shadow " .
while still recovering from his illness , mr paisley travelled to leed 's castle to take part in multi-party negotiations , involving sinn fein .
he maintained his distance , however , insisting he was only negotiating with the british government .
he gave up his job as an mep to concentrate on the political talks - making way for his successor jim allister , who is a politician very much in the mould of the traditional dup .
political analysts believe mr paisley will have a job persuading mr allister to acquiesce in power-sharing by march , as the mep has already criticised this timeframe as " insufficient " to test the ira .
and 12 members of the party 's assembly team , including four mps , issued a signed statement on 24 november 2006 insisting their party leader 's remarks in the assembly that day must not be interpreted as a nomination as first minister .
this move was seen as evidence of tensions in the party over the strategy .
following st andrews , it now appears that mr paisley would like to be first minister before he retires , even if the price of that is martin mcguinness as partner mr paisley has said that if there was power-sharing with sinn fein , he would have a lot to swallow .
those are the words of a man who has clearly thought about the notion .
while his old enemies in the republican movement have changed - and grown politically stronger - the dup leader is no longer keeping observers guessing as to whether he too can change .
that seems obvious now .
the question is can his party ?
and can ian paisley wield the kind of influence that has become legend in dup circles ?
it 's possible his hard-line stance all these years was merely a tool to win power .
but it 's also possible that it 's the change in circumstances that is leading to a changed paisley .
first minister how can he justify saying no if there is a chance to get rid of the ira ?
mr paisley may know that the deal will eventually be done and prefer to do it himself .
there was a time when some thought ian paisley with nine mps at westminster to the ulster unionist party 's one , would have happily settled for this status .
certainly it has brought him privileges and enabled him to nominate his wife , eileen paisley , for a peerage .
she is now baroness paisley of st george .
the power couple happily accepted a wooden bowl , made from a tree at the battle of the boyne site , from taoiseach bertie ahern at the st andrews talks , to mark their golden wedding anniversary .
following st andrews , it now appears that mr paisley would like to be first minister before he retires , even if the price of that is martin mcguinness as partner .
if he remains undisputed unionist leader , mr paisley may be free to cut a deal .
the danger for the dup leader is that , like david trimble , he fails to deliver and in the process splits his party .
mr paisley seems self-evident he does not have the time any longer for slow change .

the ulster unionist leader who headed the failed sunningdale power-sharing executive , brian faulkner , attacked mr paisley as the " demon doctor " .
his doctorate is an honorary one , bestowed by the bob jones university , in south carolina but he likes to use the title .
' shadowy groups ' he is also quite capable of verbal combat with his critics and his political enemies .
while the dup leader has condemned violence , both loyalist and republican , he has been criticised for his own past involvement with shadowy groups .
in 1981 , he appeared on a hillside in the dead of night with 500 men brandishing firearms licences and later had a brief dalliance with ulster resistance .
with the peace process came attempts by loyalist paramilitaries to organise politically - and challenge the dup .
but neither the progressive unionist party nor the now disbanded ulster democratic party made much impact electorally .
when the loyalist paramilitaries supported the 1998 good friday agreement , mr paisley found himself verbally abused by members of the uda and uvf .
back then , ian paisley seemed to have been defeated .
he suffered the humiliation of seeing a majority of unionists , however slim , embrace a deal he had vowed to wreck .
that may have been ian paisley 's epiphany - a moment of truth , that the landscape demanded a new brand of unionism , tough but compromising .
despite his hard-line stance over sunningdale , his views have been evolving for years .
as the troubles drew to a close , the dup seemed willing to accommodate constitutional nationalists in power-sharing .
ian paisley electioneering in northern ireland in october 1974 failure to fully implement the 1998 deal allowed the dup to make a comeback - winning the lion 's share of the seats in the 2003 assembly poll .
in the months after this election , ian paisley struggled with ill-health and despite party denials he was gravely ill , admitted in 2004 that he had " walked in death 's shadow " .
while still recovering from his illness , mr paisley travelled to leed 's castle to take part in multi-party negotiations , involving sinn fein .
he maintained his distance , however , insisting he was only negotiating with the british government .
he gave up his job as an mep to concentrate on the political talks - making way for his successor jim allister , who is a politician very much in the mould of the traditional dup .
political analysts believe mr paisley will have a job persuading mr allister to acquiesce in power-sharing by march , as the mep has already criticised this timeframe as " insufficient " to test the ira .
and 12 members of the party 's assembly team , including four mps , issued a signed statement on 24 november 2006 insisting their party leader 's remarks in the assembly that day must not be interpreted as a nomination as first minister .
this move was seen as evidence of tensions in the party over the strategy .
following st andrews , it now appears that mr paisley would like to be first minister before he retires , even if the price of that is martin mcguinness as partner mr paisley has said that if there was power-sharing with sinn fein , he would have a lot to swallow .
those are the words of a man who has clearly thought about the notion .
while his old enemies in the republican movement have changed - and grown politically stronger - the dup leader is no longer keeping observers guessing as to whether he too can change .
that seems obvious now .
the question is can his party ?
and can ian paisley wield the kind of influence that has become legend in dup circles ?
it 's possible his hard-line stance all these years was merely a tool to win power .
but it 's also possible that it 's the change in circumstances that is leading to a changed paisley .
first minister how can he justify saying no if there is a chance to get rid of the ira ?
mr paisley may know that the deal will eventually be done and prefer to do it himself .
there was a time when some thought ian paisley with nine mps at westminster to the ulster unionist party 's one , would have happily settled for this status .
certainly it has brought him privileges and enabled him to nominate his wife , eileen paisley , for a peerage .
she is now baroness paisley of st george .
the power couple happily accepted a wooden bowl , made from a tree at the battle of the boyne site , from taoiseach bertie ahern at the st andrews talks , to mark their golden wedding anniversary .
following st andrews , it now appears that mr paisley would like to be first minister before he retires , even if the price of that is martin mcguinness as partner .
if he remains undisputed unionist leader , mr paisley may be free to cut a deal .
the danger for the dup leader is that , like david trimble , he fails to deliver and in the process splits his party .
mr paisley seems self-evident he does not have the time any longer for slow change .

now he 's famous for not saying it .
indeed , the dup leader is no longer the most predictable of politicians when it comes to political compromise with his traditional enemies .
ian paisley , aged 80 , could lead his party into power-sharing at the age of 80 he is showing clear signs he wants to settle into power-sharing rather than retirement .
the politician who famously declared " never , never , never " in 1986 is no longer setting his face against change .
never , in fact has become whenever .
that is , whenever sinn fein meets its promises on policing , he 'll share power .
mr paisley has moved from not an inch , to inch by inch , to a giant leap at st andrew 's when he declared his willingness to give the deal a fair wind .
his speech in october 2006 , made on his 50th wedding anniversary , recalled the troubled past and looked forward to a bright future .
ian paisley 's declaration since that his party " will not be found wanting " if republicans , in his words , " complete the transition to democracy and the rule of law " , has been welcomed by pro-agreement politicians but it has rocked sections of his party and his traditional supporters .
just a few years ago , ian paisley told the bbc journalist , peter taylor , that he would not be changing .
" i 'll go to the grave with the convictions i have , " said the dup leader .
and just last july , at a twelfth demonstration in ballycastle , the dup leader seemed set to end his days as the great no-man when he told cheering supporters that " ira / sinn fein " would never get into a power-sharing government .
now aged 80 , this often controversial personality is poised to lead his party into a power-sharing coalition with sinn fein 's martin mcguinness he used the words " over our dead bodies . "
it seems the explanation offered by other party members that mr paisley was referring to " ira / sinn fein " and not sinn fein was on the mark .
now mr paisley , an often controversial personality , is poised to lead his party into a power-sharing coalition with sinn fein 's martin mcguinness .
he has the benefit of not having a paisley-type figure to oppose him , although there is evidence he will have to overcome considerable resistance within his own party - and he may lose long-time supporters on his journey to stormont .
having seen off every unionist leader since terence o 'neill , ian paisley now has the first minister 's job within his grasp .
the question he is faced with is whether or not he can muster sufficient support within unionism and within his party to achieve it .
in making his move , he must also consider the impact of his move in the free presbyterian church , elements of which are appalled by the st andrew 's agreement .
the rev ian paisley 1926 : born armagh , ni 1946 : ordained 1951 : founded free presbyterian church 1974 : entered parliament 1979 : european parliament 2004 stepped down as mep 1998 ni assembly ian paisley 's shift towards accommodation has come late - and in fits and starts after decades of firebrand attacks on both catholicism and irish republicanism .
having condemned the pope and the roman catholic church as the " whore of babylon " , ian paisley astounded his critics by meeting the irish catholic primate sean brady at stormont in october 2006 .
he has also u-turned on his attitude to dublin , having built his career on attacking the irish republic and nationalism .
famously , he once branded then ulster unionist leader jim molyneaux -lrb- now lord molyneaux -rrb- as a " judas " over his budding relationship with dublin .
more infamously , he threw snowballs in 1965 at then irish prime minister sean lemass when he came to stormont .
yet mr paisley - bold and unblushing - went to leinster house to meet the irish prime minister , bertie ahern , for the first time in the autumn of 2004 and talked of " friendly relations " .
what a contrast this was with 1964 , when mr paisley demanded an irish tricolour be removed from divis street in west belfast .
when the ruc removed it , it led to rioting .
ian paisley at a press conference on 31 may 1983 the sinn fein leader , gerry adams , then a young man , remembers the incident as shaping his political development .
now the inevitable outcome of the political negotiations is that ian paisley will be meeting the sinn fein leader for a historic meeting .

and just last july , at a twelfth demonstration in ballycastle , the dup leader seemed set to end his days as the great no-man when he told cheering supporters that " ira / sinn fein " would never get into a power-sharing government .
now aged 80 , this often controversial personality is poised to lead his party into a power-sharing coalition with sinn fein 's martin mcguinness he used the words " over our dead bodies . "
it seems the explanation offered by other party members that mr paisley was referring to " ira / sinn fein " and not sinn fein was on the mark .
now mr paisley , an often controversial personality , is poised to lead his party into a power-sharing coalition with sinn fein 's martin mcguinness .
he has the benefit of not having a paisley-type figure to oppose him , although there is evidence he will have to overcome considerable resistance within his own party - and he may lose long-time supporters on his journey to stormont .
having seen off every unionist leader since terence o 'neill , ian paisley now has the first minister 's job within his grasp .
the question he is faced with is whether or not he can muster sufficient support within unionism and within his party to achieve it .
in making his move , he must also consider the impact of his move in the free presbyterian church , elements of which are appalled by the st andrew 's agreement .
the rev ian paisley 1926 : born armagh , ni 1946 : ordained 1951 : founded free presbyterian church 1974 : entered parliament 1979 : european parliament 2004 stepped down as mep 1998 ni assembly ian paisley 's shift towards accommodation has come late - and in fits and starts after decades of firebrand attacks on both catholicism and irish republicanism .
having condemned the pope and the roman catholic church as the " whore of babylon " , ian paisley astounded his critics by meeting the irish catholic primate sean brady at stormont in october 2006 .
he has also u-turned on his attitude to dublin , having built his career on attacking the irish republic and nationalism .
famously , he once branded then ulster unionist leader jim molyneaux -lrb- now lord molyneaux -rrb- as a " judas " over his budding relationship with dublin .
more infamously , he threw snowballs in 1965 at then irish prime minister sean lemass when he came to stormont .
yet mr paisley - bold and unblushing - went to leinster house to meet the irish prime minister , bertie ahern , for the first time in the autumn of 2004 and talked of " friendly relations " .
what a contrast this was with 1964 , when mr paisley demanded an irish tricolour be removed from divis street in west belfast .
when the ruc removed it , it led to rioting .
ian paisley at a press conference on 31 may 1983 the sinn fein leader , gerry adams , then a young man , remembers the incident as shaping his political development .
now the inevitable outcome of the political negotiations is that ian paisley will be meeting the sinn fein leader for a historic meeting .
it seems to be a matter of when , not if .
mr paisley has blocked power-sharing with moderate nationalists for years , most markedly in 1974 , when he supported a strike involving loyalist paramilitaries to wreck sunningdale .
the ulster unionist leader who headed the failed sunningdale power-sharing executive , brian faulkner , attacked mr paisley as the " demon doctor " .
his doctorate is an honorary one , bestowed by the bob jones university , in south carolina but he likes to use the title .
' shadowy groups ' he is also quite capable of verbal combat with his critics and his political enemies .
while the dup leader has condemned violence , both loyalist and republican , he has been criticised for his own past involvement with shadowy groups .
in 1981 , he appeared on a hillside in the dead of night with 500 men brandishing firearms licences and later had a brief dalliance with ulster resistance .
with the peace process came attempts by loyalist paramilitaries to organise politically - and challenge the dup .
but neither the progressive unionist party nor the now disbanded ulster democratic party made much impact electorally .
when the loyalist paramilitaries supported the 1998 good friday agreement , mr paisley found himself verbally abused by members of the uda and uvf .
back then , ian paisley seemed to have been defeated .
he suffered the humiliation of seeing a majority of unionists , however slim , embrace a deal he had vowed to wreck .
that may have been ian paisley 's epiphany - a moment of truth , that the landscape demanded a new brand of unionism , tough but compromising .
despite his hard-line stance over sunningdale , his views have been evolving for years .
as the troubles drew to a close , the dup seemed willing to accommodate constitutional nationalists in power-sharing .
ian paisley electioneering in northern ireland in october 1974 failure to fully implement the 1998 deal allowed the dup to make a comeback - winning the lion 's share of the seats in the 2003 assembly poll .
in the months after this election , ian paisley struggled with ill-health and despite party denials he was gravely ill , admitted in 2004 that he had " walked in death 's shadow " .
while still recovering from his illness , mr paisley travelled to leed 's castle to take part in multi-party negotiations , involving sinn fein .
he maintained his distance , however , insisting he was only negotiating with the british government .
he gave up his job as an mep to concentrate on the political talks - making way for his successor jim allister , who is a politician very much in the mould of the traditional dup .
political analysts believe mr paisley will have a job persuading mr allister to acquiesce in power-sharing by march , as the mep has already criticised this timeframe as " insufficient " to test the ira .
and 12 members of the party 's assembly team , including four mps , issued a signed statement on 24 november 2006 insisting their party leader 's remarks in the assembly that day must not be interpreted as a nomination as first minister .
this move was seen as evidence of tensions in the party over the strategy .
following st andrews , it now appears that mr paisley would like to be first minister before he retires , even if the price of that is martin mcguinness as partner mr paisley has said that if there was power-sharing with sinn fein , he would have a lot to swallow .
those are the words of a man who has clearly thought about the notion .
while his old enemies in the republican movement have changed - and grown politically stronger - the dup leader is no longer keeping observers guessing as to whether he too can change .
that seems obvious now .
the question is can his party ?
and can ian paisley wield the kind of influence that has become legend in dup circles ?
it 's possible his hard-line stance all these years was merely a tool to win power .
but it 's also possible that it 's the change in circumstances that is leading to a changed paisley .
first minister how can he justify saying no if there is a chance to get rid of the ira ?
mr paisley may know that the deal will eventually be done and prefer to do it himself .
there was a time when some thought ian paisley with nine mps at westminster to the ulster unionist party 's one , would have happily settled for this status .
certainly it has brought him privileges and enabled him to nominate his wife , eileen paisley , for a peerage .
she is now baroness paisley of st george .
the power couple happily accepted a wooden bowl , made from a tree at the battle of the boyne site , from taoiseach bertie ahern at the st andrews talks , to mark their golden wedding anniversary .
following st andrews , it now appears that mr paisley would like to be first minister before he retires , even if the price of that is martin mcguinness as partner .
if he remains undisputed unionist leader , mr paisley may be free to cut a deal .
the danger for the dup leader is that , like david trimble , he fails to deliver and in the process splits his party .
mr paisley seems self-evident he does not have the time any longer for slow change .

now he 's famous for not saying it .
indeed , the dup leader is no longer the most predictable of politicians when it comes to political compromise with his traditional enemies .
ian paisley , aged 80 , could lead his party into power-sharing at the age of 80 he is showing clear signs he wants to settle into power-sharing rather than retirement .
the politician who famously declared " never , never , never " in 1986 is no longer setting his face against change .
never , in fact has become whenever .
that is , whenever sinn fein meets its promises on policing , he 'll share power .
mr paisley has moved from not an inch , to inch by inch , to a giant leap at st andrew 's when he declared his willingness to give the deal a fair wind .
his speech in october 2006 , made on his 50th wedding anniversary , recalled the troubled past and looked forward to a bright future .
ian paisley 's declaration since that his party " will not be found wanting " if republicans , in his words , " complete the transition to democracy and the rule of law " , has been welcomed by pro-agreement politicians but it has rocked sections of his party and his traditional supporters .
just a few years ago , ian paisley told the bbc journalist , peter taylor , that he would not be changing .
" i 'll go to the grave with the convictions i have , " said the dup leader .
and just last july , at a twelfth demonstration in ballycastle , the dup leader seemed set to end his days as the great no-man when he told cheering supporters that " ira / sinn fein " would never get into a power-sharing government .

bbc news -pipe- americas -pipe- the american hostility towards iran bbc news / americas graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- thursday , 1 february 2007 , 09:00 gmt the american hostility towards iran analysis by paul reynolds world affairs correspondent , bbc news website american accusations against iran are becoming more specific by the day , raising a question about how far this confrontation will go .
the charges are on two fronts - the first concerns alleged iranian activities in iraq -lrb- and in lebanon -rrb- and the second is about iran 's nuclear programme .
the latest charge over iraq , from under secretary of state nicholas burns , is that members of the iranian revolutionary guard had been arrested there .
" they 're people who are engaged in sectarian warfare , " he told the bbc .
he also re-stated the accusation that iran was supplying technology for the shaped charges that were being used by shia attackers on us and british forces .
public criticism of iran was one of the notable features of president bush 's state of the union speech on 23 january .
a second aircraft carrier is now in the gulf in what vice-president cheney said was a " strong signal " to iran .
however mr bush has played down suggestions that a us attack on iran is in preparation .
what does appear to be in force right now is a new harder-edged diplomacy , one aimed at further isolating iran , with the ultimate hope perhaps that there will be a change of government .
whether such an approach will in due course develop into something military remains to be seen .
drum beat references to iran ran like a drum beat through the state of the union speech , adding a wider element to the president 's appeal for support for what he called his " new strategy " in iraq .
he accused the " regime " in iran of arming " terrorists like hezbollah " and of directing " shia extremists " in iraq .
he raised the prospect of a larger conflict in the middle east in which iran would be central .
" if american forces step back before baghdad is secure , the iraqi government would be overrun by extremists on all sides , " he said . "
the world will not allow the regime in tehran to acquire nuclear weapons " president bush most computers will open this document automatically , but you may need adobe reader " we could expect an epic battle between shia extremists backed by iran , and sunni extremists aided by al-qaeda and supporters of the old regime .
" a contagion of violence could spill out across the country - and in time , the entire region could be drawn into the conflict . "
and he did not leave out the nuclear issue : " the world will not allow the regime in tehran to acquire nuclear weapons . "
he referred only to the " regime " in iran , not the government .
trend such rhetoric is used partly to lay the blame for the chaos in iraq on others but it is not just rhetoric .
the state of the union speech is a carefully considered declaration .
the new chairman of the senate intelligence committee senator john rockefeller , a democrat , has spoken out against the verbal attacks on iran and compared them to what happened before the invasion of iraq in 2003 .
" to be quite honest , i 'm a little concerned that it 's iraq again , " senator rockefeller told the new york times .
the anti-iran trend in the administration was already evident when mr bush announced the increase in troops in iraq on 10 january .
in that speech he rejected the recommendations of the advisory iraq study group that the united states should engage diplomatically with iran -lrb- and syria -rrb- . "
the president has said very clearly that the issues we have with iran should be solved diplomatically " stephen hadley national security adviser instead he accused iran and syria of " allowing terrorists and insurgents to use their territory to move in and out of iraq " .
us failure in iraq , he claimed , would have a consequence : " iran would be emboldened in its pursuit of nuclear weapons . "
and he added : " we will work with others to prevent iran from gaining nuclear weapons and dominating the region . "
that phrase " will work with others " is primarily a reference to the un security council which has imposed sanctions on iran , aimed at preventing it from getting technology useful for its nuclear enrichment and missile programmes .
the line from the white house , as expressed recently by the national security adviser stephen hadley , is that the us is seeking a diplomatic solution .
asked on abc television if the us was preparing an attack on iran , he replied : " no , the president has said very clearly that the issues we have with iran should be solved diplomatically . "
this may be true but such a formulation does not rule out a future decision to move from a diplomatic approach to a military one , if diplomacy is held to have failed .
israeli fears the mood in the administration coincides with some strong talk in israel about the dangers from iran .
the israeli likud party leader binyamin netanyahu has called the iranian government " genocidal " and has said : " no-one will come to defend the jews if they do not defend themselves . "
an example of the fears in israel was a remarkable recent article in the jerusalem post by the israeli historian benny morris , who raised the spectre of " the second holocaust " .
" one bright morning , in five or 10 years , perhaps during a regional crisis , perhaps out of the blue , a day or a year or five years after iran 's acquisition of the bomb , the mullahs in qom will convene in secret session , under a portrait of the steely-eyed ayatollah khomeini , and give president mahmoud ahmadinejad , by then in his second or third term , the go-ahead , " he wrote .
" with a country the size and shape of israel -lrb- an elongated 20,000 sq km -rrb- , probably four or five hits will suffice : no more israel . "
iranian position iran itself continues its dual policy of developing enrichment and denying any intention of using that expertise to build a bomb .
there are signs that some in iran are worried about the combative approach of president ahmadinejad .
a critical cleric , grand ayatollah hussein ali montazeri , said : " one has to deal with the enemy with wisdom .
we should not provoke the enemy , otherwise the country will be faced with problems . "
not that president ahmadinejad is impressed .
he dismisses the security council resolution as " born dead " .
he states that iran 's efforts to enrich uranium are an expression of its right to develop nuclear power under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty of which it is a member .
under the treaty , non-nuclear weapons states area are allowed to acquire nuclear technology for civil purposes but commit themselves not to build a bomb .

us failure in iraq , he claimed , would have a consequence : " iran would be emboldened in its pursuit of nuclear weapons . "
and he added : " we will work with others to prevent iran from gaining nuclear weapons and dominating the region . "
that phrase " will work with others " is primarily a reference to the un security council which has imposed sanctions on iran , aimed at preventing it from getting technology useful for its nuclear enrichment and missile programmes .
the line from the white house , as expressed recently by the national security adviser stephen hadley , is that the us is seeking a diplomatic solution .
asked on abc television if the us was preparing an attack on iran , he replied : " no , the president has said very clearly that the issues we have with iran should be solved diplomatically . "
this may be true but such a formulation does not rule out a future decision to move from a diplomatic approach to a military one , if diplomacy is held to have failed .
israeli fears the mood in the administration coincides with some strong talk in israel about the dangers from iran .
iran 's president has dismissed the security council resolution the israeli likud party leader binyamin netanyahu has called the iranian government " genocidal " and has said : " no-one will come to defend the jews if they do not defend themselves . "
an example of the fears in israel was a remarkable recent article in the jerusalem post by the israeli historian benny morris , who raised the spectre of " the second holocaust " .
" one bright morning , in five or 10 years , perhaps during a regional crisis , perhaps out of the blue , a day or a year or five years after iran 's acquisition of the bomb , the mullahs in qom will convene in secret session , under a portrait of the steely-eyed ayatollah khomeini , and give president mahmoud ahmadinejad , by then in his second or third term , the go-ahead , " he wrote .
" with a country the size and shape of israel -lrb- an elongated 20,000 sq km -rrb- , probably four or five hits will suffice : no more israel . "
iranian position iran itself continues its dual policy of developing enrichment and denying any intention of using that expertise to build a bomb .
there are signs that some in iran are worried about the combative approach of president ahmadinejad .
a critical cleric , grand ayatollah hussein ali montazeri , said : " one has to deal with the enemy with wisdom .
we should not provoke the enemy , otherwise the country will be faced with problems . "
not that president ahmadinejad is impressed .
he dismisses the security council resolution as " born dead " .
he states that iran 's efforts to enrich uranium are an expression of its right to develop nuclear power under the nuclear non-proliferation treaty of which it is a member .
under the treaty , non-nuclear weapons states area are allowed to acquire nuclear technology for civil purposes but commit themselves not to build a bomb .

the latest charge over iraq , from under secretary of state nicholas burns , is that members of the iranian revolutionary guard had been arrested there .

as more and more people put their own content online , they are also being invited to tag it with descriptive keywords to help organise their data .
according to the pew internet and american life project , the trend in tagging is growing among us web users .
it found that over a quarter of online americans - 28 % - had tagged content such as a photo , news story or blog .
the business of intelligently tagging content is seen as a crucial element for a next-stage , so-called " semantic web " .
but for users of social networking sites it is just an obvious tool to navigate around the sites they visit .
social networking tagging is the process of creating labels for online content .
somebody creating an account on a site such as flickr is invited to upload photos and then apply labels to the pictures that make sense to them - for instance , labelling a picture of the sun going down as " sunset " . "
tagging allows social groups to form around similarities of interests and points of view " david weinberger , harvard 's berkman center for internet and society once the labels are applied , anyone entering the term " sunset " into flickr 's search will find the photo and any other pictures with the tag .
in this way , tagging makes it easier to organise information for all the users of a site and this social dimension means tagging is becoming a hallmark of the so-called web 2.0 - the social networking element to the net that encourages sharing and collaboration .
new hierarchy tagging comes in many forms .
google 's tagging feature is called " bookmark " , while other sites offer the ability to label content so effortlessly that people may not be aware they are doing it .
david weinberger , a fellow at harvard 's berkman center for internet and society and a prominent blogger , told pew that tagging was becoming increasingly important for the web .
mr weinberger makes the case for tagging in his book everything is miscellaneous : the power of the new digital disorder .
this new way of organising information in the digital age , he argues , is a classic example of how the web is enabling the bottom-up building of categories rather than having such things imposed on users .
' vastness ' " tagging lets us organise the vastness of the web , and even our e-mail , as gmail has shown , using the categories that matter to us as individuals , " he said .
some have criticised tagging as being too imprecise or ambiguous but mr weinberger is not concerned that one person may tag , say , a stephen king story as " horror " while someone else calls it " ghost story " .
" tagging allows social groups to form around similarities of interests and points of view .
if you 're using the same tags as i do , we probably share some deep commonalities , " he told pew internet .
data from web-tracking firm hitwise shows that tagging sites such as flickr and del.icio.us - a bookmarking site that lets users tag websites with descriptive terms - are gaining popularity as people become more aware of them .

somebody creating an account on a site such as flickr is invited to upload photos and then apply labels to the pictures that make sense to them - for instance , labelling a picture of the sun going down as " sunset " .
tagging allows social groups to form around similarities of interests and points of view david weinberger , harvard 's berkman center for internet and society once the labels are applied , anyone entering the term " sunset " into flickr 's search will find the photo and any other pictures with the tag .
in this way , tagging makes it easier to organise information for all the users of a site and this social dimension means tagging is becoming a hallmark of the so-called web 2.0 - the social networking element to the net that encourages sharing and collaboration .
new hierarchy tagging comes in many forms .
google 's tagging feature is called " bookmark " , while other sites offer the ability to label content so effortlessly that people may not be aware they are doing it .
david weinberger , a fellow at harvard 's berkman center for internet and society and a prominent blogger , told pew that tagging was becoming increasingly important for the web .
mr weinberger makes the case for tagging in his book everything is miscellaneous : the power of the new digital disorder .
this new way of organising information in the digital age , he argues , is a classic example of how the web is enabling the bottom-up building of categories rather than having such things imposed on users .
' vastness ' " tagging lets us organise the vastness of the web , and even our e-mail , as gmail has shown , using the categories that matter to us as individuals , " he said .
some have criticised tagging as being too imprecise or ambiguous but mr weinberger is not concerned that one person may tag , say , a stephen king story as " horror " while someone else calls it " ghost story " .
" tagging allows social groups to form around similarities of interests and points of view .
if you 're using the same tags as i do , we probably share some deep commonalities , " he told pew internet .
data from web-tracking firm hitwise shows that tagging sites such as flickr and del.icio.us - a bookmarking site that lets users tag websites with descriptive terms - are gaining popularity as people become more aware of them .

as more and more people put their own content online , they are also being invited to tag it with descriptive keywords to help organise their data .
according to the pew internet and american life project , the trend in tagging is growing among us web users .
it found that over a quarter of online americans - 28 % - had tagged content such as a photo , news story or blog .
the business of intelligently tagging content is seen as a crucial element for a next-stage , so-called " semantic web " .
but for users of social networking sites it is just an obvious tool to navigate around the sites they visit .
social networking tagging is the process of creating labels for online content .
somebody creating an account on a site such as flickr is invited to upload photos and then apply labels to the pictures that make sense to them - for instance , labelling a picture of the sun going down as " sunset " .
tagging allows social groups to form around similarities of interests and points of view david weinberger , harvard 's berkman center for internet and society once the labels are applied , anyone entering the term " sunset " into flickr 's search will find the photo and any other pictures with the tag .
in this way , tagging makes it easier to organise information for all the users of a site and this social dimension means tagging is becoming a hallmark of the so-called web 2.0 - the social networking element to the net that encourages sharing and collaboration .
new hierarchy tagging comes in many forms .
google 's tagging feature is called " bookmark " , while other sites offer the ability to label content so effortlessly that people may not be aware they are doing it .
david weinberger , a fellow at harvard 's berkman center for internet and society and a prominent blogger , told pew that tagging was becoming increasingly important for the web .
mr weinberger makes the case for tagging in his book everything is miscellaneous : the power of the new digital disorder .
this new way of organising information in the digital age , he argues , is a classic example of how the web is enabling the bottom-up building of categories rather than having such things imposed on users .
' vastness ' " tagging lets us organise the vastness of the web , and even our e-mail , as gmail has shown , using the categories that matter to us as individuals , " he said .
some have criticised tagging as being too imprecise or ambiguous but mr weinberger is not concerned that one person may tag , say , a stephen king story as " horror " while someone else calls it " ghost story " .
" tagging allows social groups to form around similarities of interests and points of view .
if you 're using the same tags as i do , we probably share some deep commonalities , " he told pew internet .
data from web-tracking firm hitwise shows that tagging sites such as flickr and del.icio.us - a bookmarking site that lets users tag websites with descriptive terms - are gaining popularity as people become more aware of them .
