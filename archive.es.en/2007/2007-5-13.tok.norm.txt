program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de film -pipe- 13.05.2007 film director tackles turkish politics head-on großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : fatih akin is getting passionate about politics his last film has just been selected for the cannes film fest , but turkish-german director fatih akin is already hard at work on his next project - a political docuthriller . researching his new film - which has the working title " rubbish in the garden of eden " - hamburg-based film director fatih akin decided to call up the turkish environment minister osman pepe in ankara . the response was less than warm .
" you might know about making films , but you do n't know anything about environmental issues , " the minister said . akin might just prove him wrong , and is currently making a docu-thriller which charts the war against a planned landfill site being waged by the 3,500 inhabitants of camburnu , a village in the tea-growing region near the turkish black sea coast . he soon realized he could n't expect much help from the authorities .
" this chapter has long been closed , " pepe told him . a personal project akin was not allowed to film the run-in with the environment minister , but the first shots from the black sea coast are already in the can . " if we can step up enough pressure for the project to be halted , there could be a happy ending , " the 33-year old director said in an interview with deutsche-presse agentur dpa in istanbul , " but it could also end in tragedy , with the death of the village . " the turkish-german film director feels personally involved in the villagers ' resistance . " it 's my grandfather 's village .
i 've been fighting together with its inhabitants for the past two years , " said akin . foreign pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community needs to put pressure on erdogan 's government with so much at stake , he is pulling out all the stops both in turkey and in germany . according to the hurriyet newspaper , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan allegedly asked his environment minister " what 's all this about , osman ? " when he received a letter from german green party leader claudia roth , pointing to the environmental risks of the planned landfill site . " i think the only chance the village still has is political pressure from abroad , " akin says , stressing that turkey has to understand the full implications .
" there 's no place for it in the european union if it ca n't sort out its environmental problems , " he says . making movies the moore way does this mean that akin , who won the golden bear at the 2004 berlin film festival for his hard-hitting drama " gegen die wand " -lrb- head-on -rrb- , has suddenly discovered politics ? " the times are too irritating , too disturbing at the moment for me to be able to ignore it in my art , " the director says .
" i 'm not interested in anything else right now . " he also believes in trying to combine political education and entertainment - although he 's aware of the risks , and knows a film should never seem didactic . " first of all i want to entertain , " he says .
" that 's my job , i 'm a storyteller . " so he 's unlikely to be following in the footsteps of michael moore , who won the palme d 'or at the 2004 cannes film festival for " fahrenheit 9/11 . " " it 's my questions and my voice that you can hear -lrb- in the film -rrb- , and sometimes i 'm in the picture too , " akin says .
that 's where the similarities end .
he has no intention of going as far as moore does with his political message , and says he prefers to work more with the means of the classic documentary . " i try to find images that a 12-year old could understand , " akin says . valuable lessons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : akin also filmed " crossing the bridge " in turkey the heroes of his film are the villagers , tea pickers , a primary school teacher , the village photographer . " i 've learn from the modest dignity of these people , " he explains .
" they live in fear that the garbage heap near their village will poison their water , attract pests and bring disease . " he has particular respect for camburno mayor huseyin alioglu .
after the village community 's court appeals against the landfill site repeatedly failed , alioglu has been charged " for acting in an un-turkish way , against the national interest .

" alarms , wires , clocks and bangers " were uncovered during raids targeting 21 people suspected of " seriously trying to disrupt or prevent , " the june 6 to 8 summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm , german weekly news magazine focus reported .
in an issue due to appear on monday , it said police found " non-conventional explosives " at a farm near berlin .
fake identity cards were found at the home of another suspect in the northern city of hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to throw a tight security ring around the baltic coast town where the g8 summit will take place berlin is expecting up to 100,000 left-wing protestors to demonstrate at the meeting of leaders of the group of eight most industrialized nations .
authorities are planning to deploy 16,000 police in heiligendamm and the nearby city of rostock and put up a 12-kilometre-long -lrb- 7.5-mile-long -rrb- security fence .
german magazine der spiegel weekly said several retired people were on the list of the 21 suspects , adding that the oldest among them was 68 .
" a show of force " on wednesday , 900 police officers raided 40 sites in northern germany linked to left-wing activists believed to be preparing arson attacks and other violent protests during the summit .
the massive security operation has been slammed by critics as overblown and an unnecessary show of force by the german state .
peter ritter of the opposition left party told news agency dpa on sunday said the government by deliberately criminalizing g8 opponents was also discrediting their criticism of the policies of industrialized nations .
" if anti-globalization activists are collectively painted as being violent , then it 's a statement on their goals which are shared by many people , " ritter said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationwide raids on leftwing groups have been strongly criticized in an editorial on sunday , the zurich-based sonntagszeitung said the german raids on left-wing bookshops and offices was " a show of force by the german state . "
the paper added that the move had only served to fuel discontent among left-wing groups and bolster their readiness to protest violently .
in response to the raids , more than 5,000 protestors later took to the streets of berlin , hamburg and smaller german cities .
anti-globalization group attac said on friday the police clampdown had only served to encourage protestors .
" one of the consequences of the police operations was to mobilize people , " peter wahl from attac told zdf television .
critics incensed by security measures what has also angered critics is a controversial proposal by interior minister wolfgang schäuble to place potential troublemakers in preventative custody .
schäuble said potential troublemakers could be detained for up to two weeks if there were firm indications they are planning criminal actions .
in germany , people can be put behind bars for 14 days if police find evidence that they are planning a crime .
the government threatened to do this with hooligans during the soccer world cup in germany last summer .
the minister has already announced that germany was re-imposing border checks to stop potential offenders , mainly opponents of globalization , from entering germany to protest at the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble is under fire over the weekend , schäuble said he was not responsible for the recent nationwide raids on left-wing groups - a decision , he said , was taken by the federal state prosecutor - but he defended the measure .
" i do n't have the slightest doubt that the measures were absolutely right , " schäuble said on the sidelines of an eu interior minister meeting in venice on saturday .
police expert warns against ignoring other threats schäuble said germany expected an increased security threat during the summit .
he said the fact that germany was not subject to terrorist attacks during major events such as last year 's world cup " does not mean we will be spared this time . "
fears about security were raised when opponents of the summit claimed responsibility for torching a car on the property of a german finance ministry official in the northern city of hamburg in december .
protesters have also splashed paint on the summit hotel .
however , some have warned against focusing excessive attention on the threat of violent left-wing demonstrations and threats in the run-up to the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombs exploded on london 's bus and underground system during a g8 summit in 2005 " we should n't underestimate the immense dangers posed by islamic terrorists , " said konrad freiberg , head of the police union , in an article for the bild am sonntag paper .
" it was while the g8 summit was taking place in gleneagles in scottland in 2005 that bombs planted by islamic terrorists exploded in the london subway . "
freiberg also warned that police forces would be overstretched during the security operation for the g8 .
freiberg called the g8 summit a " herculean task " and said it would constitute the " biggest police operation of all times . "
several g8 summits in recent years have been scarred by violence , most notably the meeting in the italian city of genoa in 2001 when an anti-capitalist protester was killed by police during riots .
demonstrations at recent g8 summits have been kept well away from the venue , although violence has broken out in nearby towns . dw staff with news wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de interior minister advocates preventative custody for g8 rowdies extremists planning to disrupt next month 's group of eight summit of the world 's richest nations could be placed in preventative custody ahead of the meeting , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said friday .

" alarms , wires , clocks and bangers " were uncovered during raids targeting 21 people suspected of " seriously trying to disrupt or prevent , " the june 6 to 8 summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm , german weekly news magazine focus reported .
in an issue due to appear on monday , it said police found " non-conventional explosives " at a farm near berlin .
fake identity cards were found at the home of another suspect in the northern city of hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to throw a tight security ring around the baltic coast town where the g8 summit will take place berlin is expecting up to 100,000 left-wing protestors to demonstrate at the meeting of leaders of the group of eight most industrialized nations .
authorities are planning to deploy 16,000 police in heiligendamm and the nearby city of rostock and put up a 12-kilometre-long -lrb- 7.5-mile-long -rrb- security fence .
german magazine der spiegel weekly said several retired people were on the list of the 21 suspects , adding that the oldest among them was 68 .
" a show of force " on wednesday , 900 police officers raided 40 sites in northern germany linked to left-wing activists believed to be preparing arson attacks and other violent protests during the summit .
the massive security operation has been slammed by critics as overblown and an unnecessary show of force by the german state .
peter ritter of the opposition left party told news agency dpa on sunday said the government by deliberately criminalizing g8 opponents was also discrediting their criticism of the policies of industrialized nations .
" if anti-globalization activists are collectively painted as being violent , then it 's a statement on their goals which are shared by many people , " ritter said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationwide raids on leftwing groups have been strongly criticized in an editorial on sunday , the zurich-based sonntagszeitung said the german raids on left-wing bookshops and offices was " a show of force by the german state . "
the paper added that the move had only served to fuel discontent among left-wing groups and bolster their readiness to protest violently .
in response to the raids , more than 5,000 protestors later took to the streets of berlin , hamburg and smaller german cities .
anti-globalization group attac said on friday the police clampdown had only served to encourage protestors .
" one of the consequences of the police operations was to mobilize people , " peter wahl from attac told zdf television .
critics incensed by security measures what has also angered critics is a controversial proposal by interior minister wolfgang schäuble to place potential troublemakers in preventative custody .
schäuble said potential troublemakers could be detained for up to two weeks if there were firm indications they are planning criminal actions .
in germany , people can be put behind bars for 14 days if police find evidence that they are planning a crime .
the government threatened to do this with hooligans during the soccer world cup in germany last summer .
the minister has already announced that germany was re-imposing border checks to stop potential offenders , mainly opponents of globalization , from entering germany to protest at the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble is under fire over the weekend , schäuble said he was not responsible for the recent nationwide raids on left-wing groups - a decision , he said , was taken by the federal state prosecutor - but he defended the measure .
" i do n't have the slightest doubt that the measures were absolutely right , " schäuble said on the sidelines of an eu interior minister meeting in venice on saturday .
police expert warns against ignoring other threats schäuble said germany expected an increased security threat during the summit .
he said the fact that germany was not subject to terrorist attacks during major events such as last year 's world cup " does not mean we will be spared this time . "
fears about security were raised when opponents of the summit claimed responsibility for torching a car on the property of a german finance ministry official in the northern city of hamburg in december .
protesters have also splashed paint on the summit hotel .
however , some have warned against focusing excessive attention on the threat of violent left-wing demonstrations and threats in the run-up to the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombs exploded on london 's bus and underground system during a g8 summit in 2005 " we should n't underestimate the immense dangers posed by islamic terrorists , " said konrad freiberg , head of the police union , in an article for the bild am sonntag paper .
" it was while the g8 summit was taking place in gleneagles in scottland in 2005 that bombs planted by islamic terrorists exploded in the london subway . "
freiberg also warned that police forces would be overstretched during the security operation for the g8 .

" you might know about making films , but you do n't know anything about environmental issues , " the minister said . akin might just prove him wrong , and is currently making a docu-thriller which charts the war against a planned landfill site being waged by the 3,500 inhabitants of camburnu , a village in the tea-growing region near the turkish black sea coast . he soon realized he could n't expect much help from the authorities .
" this chapter has long been closed , " pepe told him . a personal project akin was not allowed to film the run-in with the environment minister , but the first shots from the black sea coast are already in the can . " if we can step up enough pressure for the project to be halted , there could be a happy ending , " the 33-year old director said in an interview with deutsche-presse agentur dpa in istanbul , " but it could also end in tragedy , with the death of the village . " the turkish-german film director feels personally involved in the villagers ' resistance . " it 's my grandfather 's village .
i 've been fighting together with its inhabitants for the past two years , " said akin . foreign pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community needs to put pressure on erdogan 's government with so much at stake , he is pulling out all the stops both in turkey and in germany . according to the hurriyet newspaper , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan allegedly asked his environment minister " what 's all this about , osman ? " when he received a letter from german green party leader claudia roth , pointing to the environmental risks of the planned landfill site . " i think the only chance the village still has is political pressure from abroad , " akin says , stressing that turkey has to understand the full implications .
" there 's no place for it in the european union if it ca n't sort out its environmental problems , " he says . making movies the moore way does this mean that akin , who won the golden bear at the 2004 berlin film festival for his hard-hitting drama " gegen die wand " -lrb- head-on -rrb- , has suddenly discovered politics ? " the times are too irritating , too disturbing at the moment for me to be able to ignore it in my art , " the director says .
" i 'm not interested in anything else right now . " he also believes in trying to combine political education and entertainment - although he 's aware of the risks , and knows a film should never seem didactic . " first of all i want to entertain , " he says .
" that 's my job , i 'm a storyteller . " so he 's unlikely to be following in the footsteps of michael moore , who won the palme d 'or at the 2004 cannes film festival for " fahrenheit 9/11 . " " it 's my questions and my voice that you can hear -lrb- in the film -rrb- , and sometimes i 'm in the picture too , " akin says .
that 's where the similarities end .
he has no intention of going as far as moore does with his political message , and says he prefers to work more with the means of the classic documentary . " i try to find images that a 12-year old could understand , " akin says . valuable lessons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : akin also filmed " crossing the bridge " in turkey the heroes of his film are the villagers , tea pickers , a primary school teacher , the village photographer . " i 've learn from the modest dignity of these people , " he explains .
" they live in fear that the garbage heap near their village will poison their water , attract pests and bring disease . " he has particular respect for camburno mayor huseyin alioglu .
after the village community 's court appeals against the landfill site repeatedly failed , alioglu has been charged " for acting in an un-turkish way , against the national interest . " " he is without doubt the tragic hero of the film , " says akin . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-turkish director in competition at 60th cannes festival director fatih akin will be heading to the french riviera in may for the 60th edition of the world 's premiere film festival .

" you might know about making films , but you do n't know anything about environmental issues , " the minister said . akin might just prove him wrong , and is currently making a docu-thriller which charts the war against a planned landfill site being waged by the 3,500 inhabitants of camburnu , a village in the tea-growing region near the turkish black sea coast . he soon realized he could n't expect much help from the authorities .

" there is still a lot of work to be done , " said stuttgart coach armin veh .
" it will all be counted up at the end next week .
we will just work hard to stay focused and keep our concentration , which we have done all season .
it will come down to who holds their nerve next weekend .

it 's our job to lift them to do a good job against arminia bielefeld to secure at least second place . " there is still 90 minutes left of the season , so we have to win at bielefeld to at least give us a chance , " slomka added . bremen out of the race werder bremen are now out of the title race after they went down 2-1 at home to eintracht frankfurt , which leaves them an unreachable four points behind stuttgart . frankfurt 's greek international defender ioannis amanatidis gave eintracht a 13th minute lead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's pierre wome , right , tackles frankfurt 's ioannis amanatidis from greece bremen 's striker aaron hunt equalized for the hosts on 34 minutes , only for brazilian defender naldo to turn the ball into his own net on 69 minutes . although they are just playing for pride this season having missed out on a champions league spot next season , fourth-placed bayern munich took a 3-0 win at energie cottbus thanks to two goals in three minutes . dutch striker roy makaay cooly slotted his goal past cottbus 's bosnian keeper tomislav piplica for the opening goal after 32 minutes before belgian defender daniel van buyten thundered is his shot from 20 metres out .

and bayern striker roque santa cruz bagged a third in the 61st minute . dutch midfielder rafael van der vaart put mid-table hamburg 1-0 up at nuremberg with a well-struck free-kick on 39 minutes and midfielder david jarolim scored just before the break as it finished 2-0 . both mainz 05 and alemannia aachen are now virtually sure of relegation after saturday 's results . alemannia aachen took a 2-0 lead at home to vfl wolfsburg , only for the visitors to get back on level terms as the game finished 2-2 . only a miracle will keep aachen from relegation .
they have to pray wolfsburg lose at bremen next weekend , while they must win at hamburg and overturn a 13 goal difference to avoid the drop . and even though mainz managed a 3-0 win over already relegated bottom-side borussia mönchengladbach , they also have to hope wolfsburg lose and they can pull back a huge goal difference . bayern leverkusen enjoyed a 3-2 win over hertha berlin , while arminia bielefeld 's 3-1 win over hanover leaves them well clear of the relegation zone . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga becomes mathematical problem in final fortnight coaches say they never look at the other team 's results but concentrate on their own .

" you might know about making films , but you do n't know anything about environmental issues , " the minister said . akin might just prove him wrong , and is currently making a docu-thriller which charts the war against a planned landfill site being waged by the 3,500 inhabitants of camburnu , a village in the tea-growing region near the turkish black sea coast . he soon realized he could n't expect much help from the authorities .
" this chapter has long been closed , " pepe told him . a personal project akin was not allowed to film the run-in with the environment minister , but the first shots from the black sea coast are already in the can . " if we can step up enough pressure for the project to be halted , there could be a happy ending , " the 33-year old director said in an interview with deutsche-presse agentur dpa in istanbul , " but it could also end in tragedy , with the death of the village .

" when he received a letter from german green party leader claudia roth , pointing to the environmental risks of the planned landfill site . " i think the only chance the village still has is political pressure from abroad , " akin says , stressing that turkey has to understand the full implications .
" there 's no place for it in the european union if it ca n't sort out its environmental problems , " he says . making movies the moore way does this mean that akin , who won the golden bear at the 2004 berlin film festival for his hard-hitting drama " gegen die wand " -lrb- head-on -rrb- , has suddenly discovered politics ? " the times are too irritating , too disturbing at the moment for me to be able to ignore it in my art , " the director says .

" " it 's my questions and my voice that you can hear -lrb- in the film -rrb- , and sometimes i 'm in the picture too , " akin says .
that 's where the similarities end .
he has no intention of going as far as moore does with his political message , and says he prefers to work more with the means of the classic documentary .

authorities are planning to deploy 16,000 police in heiligendamm and the nearby city of rostock and put up a 12-kilometre-long -lrb- 7.5-mile-long -rrb- security fence .
german magazine der spiegel weekly said several retired people were on the list of the 21 suspects , adding that the oldest among them was 68 .
" a show of force " on wednesday , 900 police officers raided 40 sites in northern germany linked to left-wing activists believed to be preparing arson attacks and other violent protests during the summit .
the massive security operation has been slammed by critics as overblown and an unnecessary show of force by the german state .
peter ritter of the opposition left party told news agency dpa on sunday said the government by deliberately criminalizing g8 opponents was also discrediting their criticism of the policies of industrialized nations .
" if anti-globalization activists are collectively painted as being violent , then it 's a statement on their goals which are shared by many people , " ritter said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationwide raids on leftwing groups have been strongly criticized in an editorial on sunday , the zurich-based sonntagszeitung said the german raids on left-wing bookshops and offices was " a show of force by the german state . "
the paper added that the move had only served to fuel discontent among left-wing groups and bolster their readiness to protest violently .
in response to the raids , more than 5,000 protestors later took to the streets of berlin , hamburg and smaller german cities .
anti-globalization group attac said on friday the police clampdown had only served to encourage protestors .
" one of the consequences of the police operations was to mobilize people , " peter wahl from attac told zdf television .
critics incensed by security measures what has also angered critics is a controversial proposal by interior minister wolfgang schäuble to place potential troublemakers in preventative custody .
schäuble said potential troublemakers could be detained for up to two weeks if there were firm indications they are planning criminal actions .
in germany , people can be put behind bars for 14 days if police find evidence that they are planning a crime .
the government threatened to do this with hooligans during the soccer world cup in germany last summer .
the minister has already announced that germany was re-imposing border checks to stop potential offenders , mainly opponents of globalization , from entering germany to protest at the summit .

police expert warns against ignoring other threats schäuble said germany expected an increased security threat during the summit .
he said the fact that germany was not subject to terrorist attacks during major events such as last year 's world cup " does not mean we will be spared this time . "
fears about security were raised when opponents of the summit claimed responsibility for torching a car on the property of a german finance ministry official in the northern city of hamburg in december .
protesters have also splashed paint on the summit hotel .
however , some have warned against focusing excessive attention on the threat of violent left-wing demonstrations and threats in the run-up to the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombs exploded on london 's bus and underground system during a g8 summit in 2005 " we should n't underestimate the immense dangers posed by islamic terrorists , " said konrad freiberg , head of the police union , in an article for the bild am sonntag paper .
" it was while the g8 summit was taking place in gleneagles in scottland in 2005 that bombs planted by islamic terrorists exploded in the london subway . "
freiberg also warned that police forces would be overstretched during the security operation for the g8 .
freiberg called the g8 summit a " herculean task " and said it would constitute the " biggest police operation of all times . "
several g8 summits in recent years have been scarred by violence , most notably the meeting in the italian city of genoa in 2001 when an anti-capitalist protester was killed by police during riots .

bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationwide raids on leftwing groups have been strongly criticized in an editorial on sunday , the zurich-based sonntagszeitung said the german raids on left-wing bookshops and offices was " a show of force by the german state . "
the paper added that the move had only served to fuel discontent among left-wing groups and bolster their readiness to protest violently .
in response to the raids , more than 5,000 protestors later took to the streets of berlin , hamburg and smaller german cities .
anti-globalization group attac said on friday the police clampdown had only served to encourage protestors .
" one of the consequences of the police operations was to mobilize people , " peter wahl from attac told zdf television .
critics incensed by security measures what has also angered critics is a controversial proposal by interior minister wolfgang schäuble to place potential troublemakers in preventative custody .
schäuble said potential troublemakers could be detained for up to two weeks if there were firm indications they are planning criminal actions .
in germany , people can be put behind bars for 14 days if police find evidence that they are planning a crime .
the government threatened to do this with hooligans during the soccer world cup in germany last summer .
the minister has already announced that germany was re-imposing border checks to stop potential offenders , mainly opponents of globalization , from entering germany to protest at the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble is under fire over the weekend , schäuble said he was not responsible for the recent nationwide raids on left-wing groups - a decision , he said , was taken by the federal state prosecutor - but he defended the measure .
" i do n't have the slightest doubt that the measures were absolutely right , " schäuble said on the sidelines of an eu interior minister meeting in venice on saturday .
police expert warns against ignoring other threats schäuble said germany expected an increased security threat during the summit .
he said the fact that germany was not subject to terrorist attacks during major events such as last year 's world cup " does not mean we will be spared this time . "
fears about security were raised when opponents of the summit claimed responsibility for torching a car on the property of a german finance ministry official in the northern city of hamburg in december .
protesters have also splashed paint on the summit hotel .
however , some have warned against focusing excessive attention on the threat of violent left-wing demonstrations and threats in the run-up to the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombs exploded on london 's bus and underground system during a g8 summit in 2005 " we should n't underestimate the immense dangers posed by islamic terrorists , " said konrad freiberg , head of the police union , in an article for the bild am sonntag paper .
" it was while the g8 summit was taking place in gleneagles in scottland in 2005 that bombs planted by islamic terrorists exploded in the london subway . "
freiberg also warned that police forces would be overstretched during the security operation for the g8 .
freiberg called the g8 summit a " herculean task " and said it would constitute the " biggest police operation of all times . "
several g8 summits in recent years have been scarred by violence , most notably the meeting in the italian city of genoa in 2001 when an anti-capitalist protester was killed by police during riots .

" alarms , wires , clocks and bangers " were uncovered during raids targeting 21 people suspected of " seriously trying to disrupt or prevent , " the june 6 to 8 summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm , german weekly news magazine focus reported .
in an issue due to appear on monday , it said police found " non-conventional explosives " at a farm near berlin .
fake identity cards were found at the home of another suspect in the northern city of hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to throw a tight security ring around the baltic coast town where the g8 summit will take place berlin is expecting up to 100,000 left-wing protestors to demonstrate at the meeting of leaders of the group of eight most industrialized nations .
authorities are planning to deploy 16,000 police in heiligendamm and the nearby city of rostock and put up a 12-kilometre-long -lrb- 7.5-mile-long -rrb- security fence .
german magazine der spiegel weekly said several retired people were on the list of the 21 suspects , adding that the oldest among them was 68 .
" a show of force " on wednesday , 900 police officers raided 40 sites in northern germany linked to left-wing activists believed to be preparing arson attacks and other violent protests during the summit .
the massive security operation has been slammed by critics as overblown and an unnecessary show of force by the german state .
peter ritter of the opposition left party told news agency dpa on sunday said the government by deliberately criminalizing g8 opponents was also discrediting their criticism of the policies of industrialized nations .
" if anti-globalization activists are collectively painted as being violent , then it 's a statement on their goals which are shared by many people , " ritter said .

but stuttgart 's goalkeeper timo hildebrand was a late hero after he pulled off a stunning save from point-blank range in the dying seconds to protect the lead . schalke must now win at arminia bielefeld , and hope stuttgart lose , to have any hope of picking up their first bundesliga title after their 2-0 defeat to neighbors borussia dortmund . swiss striker alexander frei slotted home on 44 minutes before polish striker euzebiusz smolarek scored five minutes from time to seal dortmund 's win . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : schalke 's kevin kuranyi sums up the mood at schalke " we are only second in the table , that is bad enough , " said coach mirko slomka .

it 's our job to lift them to do a good job against arminia bielefeld to secure at least second place . " there is still 90 minutes left of the season , so we have to win at bielefeld to at least give us a chance , " slomka added . bremen out of the race werder bremen are now out of the title race after they went down 2-1 at home to eintracht frankfurt , which leaves them an unreachable four points behind stuttgart . frankfurt 's greek international defender ioannis amanatidis gave eintracht a 13th minute lead . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bremen 's pierre wome , right , tackles frankfurt 's ioannis amanatidis from greece bremen 's striker aaron hunt equalized for the hosts on 34 minutes , only for brazilian defender naldo to turn the ball into his own net on 69 minutes . although they are just playing for pride this season having missed out on a champions league spot next season , fourth-placed bayern munich took a 3-0 win at energie cottbus thanks to two goals in three minutes . dutch striker roy makaay cooly slotted his goal past cottbus 's bosnian keeper tomislav piplica for the opening goal after 32 minutes before belgian defender daniel van buyten thundered is his shot from 20 metres out .

they have to pray wolfsburg lose at bremen next weekend , while they must win at hamburg and overturn a 13 goal difference to avoid the drop . and even though mainz managed a 3-0 win over already relegated bottom-side borussia mönchengladbach , they also have to hope wolfsburg lose and they can pull back a huge goal difference . bayern leverkusen enjoyed a 3-2 win over hertha berlin , while arminia bielefeld 's 3-1 win over hanover leaves them well clear of the relegation zone . dw staff / afp -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bundesliga becomes mathematical problem in final fortnight coaches say they never look at the other team 's results but concentrate on their own .

authorities are planning to deploy 16,000 police in heiligendamm and the nearby city of rostock and put up a 12-kilometre-long -lrb- 7.5-mile-long -rrb- security fence .
german magazine der spiegel weekly said several retired people were on the list of the 21 suspects , adding that the oldest among them was 68 .
" a show of force " on wednesday , 900 police officers raided 40 sites in northern germany linked to left-wing activists believed to be preparing arson attacks and other violent protests during the summit .
the massive security operation has been slammed by critics as overblown and an unnecessary show of force by the german state .
peter ritter of the opposition left party told news agency dpa on sunday said the government by deliberately criminalizing g8 opponents was also discrediting their criticism of the policies of industrialized nations .
" if anti-globalization activists are collectively painted as being violent , then it 's a statement on their goals which are shared by many people , " ritter said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationwide raids on leftwing groups have been strongly criticized in an editorial on sunday , the zurich-based sonntagszeitung said the german raids on left-wing bookshops and offices was " a show of force by the german state . "
the paper added that the move had only served to fuel discontent among left-wing groups and bolster their readiness to protest violently .
in response to the raids , more than 5,000 protestors later took to the streets of berlin , hamburg and smaller german cities .
anti-globalization group attac said on friday the police clampdown had only served to encourage protestors .
" one of the consequences of the police operations was to mobilize people , " peter wahl from attac told zdf television .
critics incensed by security measures what has also angered critics is a controversial proposal by interior minister wolfgang schäuble to place potential troublemakers in preventative custody .
schäuble said potential troublemakers could be detained for up to two weeks if there were firm indications they are planning criminal actions .
in germany , people can be put behind bars for 14 days if police find evidence that they are planning a crime .
the government threatened to do this with hooligans during the soccer world cup in germany last summer .
the minister has already announced that germany was re-imposing border checks to stop potential offenders , mainly opponents of globalization , from entering germany to protest at the summit .

he said the fact that germany was not subject to terrorist attacks during major events such as last year 's world cup " does not mean we will be spared this time . "
fears about security were raised when opponents of the summit claimed responsibility for torching a car on the property of a german finance ministry official in the northern city of hamburg in december .
protesters have also splashed paint on the summit hotel .
however , some have warned against focusing excessive attention on the threat of violent left-wing demonstrations and threats in the run-up to the summit .

freiberg also warned that police forces would be overstretched during the security operation for the g8 .
freiberg called the g8 summit a " herculean task " and said it would constitute the " biggest police operation of all times . "
several g8 summits in recent years have been scarred by violence , most notably the meeting in the italian city of genoa in 2001 when an anti-capitalist protester was killed by police during riots .

" alarms , wires , clocks and bangers " were uncovered during raids targeting 21 people suspected of " seriously trying to disrupt or prevent , " the june 6 to 8 summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm , german weekly news magazine focus reported .
in an issue due to appear on monday , it said police found " non-conventional explosives " at a farm near berlin .
fake identity cards were found at the home of another suspect in the northern city of hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to throw a tight security ring around the baltic coast town where the g8 summit will take place berlin is expecting up to 100,000 left-wing protestors to demonstrate at the meeting of leaders of the group of eight most industrialized nations .
authorities are planning to deploy 16,000 police in heiligendamm and the nearby city of rostock and put up a 12-kilometre-long -lrb- 7.5-mile-long -rrb- security fence .
german magazine der spiegel weekly said several retired people were on the list of the 21 suspects , adding that the oldest among them was 68 .
" a show of force " on wednesday , 900 police officers raided 40 sites in northern germany linked to left-wing activists believed to be preparing arson attacks and other violent protests during the summit .
the massive security operation has been slammed by critics as overblown and an unnecessary show of force by the german state .
peter ritter of the opposition left party told news agency dpa on sunday said the government by deliberately criminalizing g8 opponents was also discrediting their criticism of the policies of industrialized nations .
" if anti-globalization activists are collectively painted as being violent , then it 's a statement on their goals which are shared by many people , " ritter said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationwide raids on leftwing groups have been strongly criticized in an editorial on sunday , the zurich-based sonntagszeitung said the german raids on left-wing bookshops and offices was " a show of force by the german state . "
the paper added that the move had only served to fuel discontent among left-wing groups and bolster their readiness to protest violently .
in response to the raids , more than 5,000 protestors later took to the streets of berlin , hamburg and smaller german cities .
anti-globalization group attac said on friday the police clampdown had only served to encourage protestors .
" one of the consequences of the police operations was to mobilize people , " peter wahl from attac told zdf television .
critics incensed by security measures what has also angered critics is a controversial proposal by interior minister wolfgang schäuble to place potential troublemakers in preventative custody .
schäuble said potential troublemakers could be detained for up to two weeks if there were firm indications they are planning criminal actions .
in germany , people can be put behind bars for 14 days if police find evidence that they are planning a crime .
the government threatened to do this with hooligans during the soccer world cup in germany last summer .
the minister has already announced that germany was re-imposing border checks to stop potential offenders , mainly opponents of globalization , from entering germany to protest at the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble is under fire over the weekend , schäuble said he was not responsible for the recent nationwide raids on left-wing groups - a decision , he said , was taken by the federal state prosecutor - but he defended the measure .
" i do n't have the slightest doubt that the measures were absolutely right , " schäuble said on the sidelines of an eu interior minister meeting in venice on saturday .
police expert warns against ignoring other threats schäuble said germany expected an increased security threat during the summit .
he said the fact that germany was not subject to terrorist attacks during major events such as last year 's world cup " does not mean we will be spared this time . "
fears about security were raised when opponents of the summit claimed responsibility for torching a car on the property of a german finance ministry official in the northern city of hamburg in december .
protesters have also splashed paint on the summit hotel .
however , some have warned against focusing excessive attention on the threat of violent left-wing demonstrations and threats in the run-up to the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombs exploded on london 's bus and underground system during a g8 summit in 2005 " we should n't underestimate the immense dangers posed by islamic terrorists , " said konrad freiberg , head of the police union , in an article for the bild am sonntag paper .
" it was while the g8 summit was taking place in gleneagles in scottland in 2005 that bombs planted by islamic terrorists exploded in the london subway . "
freiberg also warned that police forces would be overstretched during the security operation for the g8 .
freiberg called the g8 summit a " herculean task " and said it would constitute the " biggest police operation of all times . "
several g8 summits in recent years have been scarred by violence , most notably the meeting in the italian city of genoa in 2001 when an anti-capitalist protester was killed by police during riots .
demonstrations at recent g8 summits have been kept well away from the venue , although violence has broken out in nearby towns . dw staff with news wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de interior minister advocates preventative custody for g8 rowdies extremists planning to disrupt next month 's group of eight summit of the world 's richest nations could be placed in preventative custody ahead of the meeting , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said friday .

" alarms , wires , clocks and bangers " were uncovered during raids targeting 21 people suspected of " seriously trying to disrupt or prevent , " the june 6 to 8 summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm , german weekly news magazine focus reported .
in an issue due to appear on monday , it said police found " non-conventional explosives " at a farm near berlin .
fake identity cards were found at the home of another suspect in the northern city of hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to throw a tight security ring around the baltic coast town where the g8 summit will take place berlin is expecting up to 100,000 left-wing protestors to demonstrate at the meeting of leaders of the group of eight most industrialized nations .
authorities are planning to deploy 16,000 police in heiligendamm and the nearby city of rostock and put up a 12-kilometre-long -lrb- 7.5-mile-long -rrb- security fence .
german magazine der spiegel weekly said several retired people were on the list of the 21 suspects , adding that the oldest among them was 68 .
" a show of force " on wednesday , 900 police officers raided 40 sites in northern germany linked to left-wing activists believed to be preparing arson attacks and other violent protests during the summit .
the massive security operation has been slammed by critics as overblown and an unnecessary show of force by the german state .
peter ritter of the opposition left party told news agency dpa on sunday said the government by deliberately criminalizing g8 opponents was also discrediting their criticism of the policies of industrialized nations .
" if anti-globalization activists are collectively painted as being violent , then it 's a statement on their goals which are shared by many people , " ritter said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationwide raids on leftwing groups have been strongly criticized in an editorial on sunday , the zurich-based sonntagszeitung said the german raids on left-wing bookshops and offices was " a show of force by the german state . "
the paper added that the move had only served to fuel discontent among left-wing groups and bolster their readiness to protest violently .
in response to the raids , more than 5,000 protestors later took to the streets of berlin , hamburg and smaller german cities .
anti-globalization group attac said on friday the police clampdown had only served to encourage protestors .
" one of the consequences of the police operations was to mobilize people , " peter wahl from attac told zdf television .
critics incensed by security measures what has also angered critics is a controversial proposal by interior minister wolfgang schäuble to place potential troublemakers in preventative custody .
schäuble said potential troublemakers could be detained for up to two weeks if there were firm indications they are planning criminal actions .
in germany , people can be put behind bars for 14 days if police find evidence that they are planning a crime .
the government threatened to do this with hooligans during the soccer world cup in germany last summer .
the minister has already announced that germany was re-imposing border checks to stop potential offenders , mainly opponents of globalization , from entering germany to protest at the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble is under fire over the weekend , schäuble said he was not responsible for the recent nationwide raids on left-wing groups - a decision , he said , was taken by the federal state prosecutor - but he defended the measure .
" i do n't have the slightest doubt that the measures were absolutely right , " schäuble said on the sidelines of an eu interior minister meeting in venice on saturday .
police expert warns against ignoring other threats schäuble said germany expected an increased security threat during the summit .
he said the fact that germany was not subject to terrorist attacks during major events such as last year 's world cup " does not mean we will be spared this time . "
fears about security were raised when opponents of the summit claimed responsibility for torching a car on the property of a german finance ministry official in the northern city of hamburg in december .
protesters have also splashed paint on the summit hotel .
however , some have warned against focusing excessive attention on the threat of violent left-wing demonstrations and threats in the run-up to the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombs exploded on london 's bus and underground system during a g8 summit in 2005 " we should n't underestimate the immense dangers posed by islamic terrorists , " said konrad freiberg , head of the police union , in an article for the bild am sonntag paper .
" it was while the g8 summit was taking place in gleneagles in scottland in 2005 that bombs planted by islamic terrorists exploded in the london subway . "
freiberg also warned that police forces would be overstretched during the security operation for the g8 .
freiberg called the g8 summit a " herculean task " and said it would constitute the " biggest police operation of all times . "
several g8 summits in recent years have been scarred by violence , most notably the meeting in the italian city of genoa in 2001 when an anti-capitalist protester was killed by police during riots .
demonstrations at recent g8 summits have been kept well away from the venue , although violence has broken out in nearby towns . dw staff with news wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de interior minister advocates preventative custody for g8 rowdies extremists planning to disrupt next month 's group of eight summit of the world 's richest nations could be placed in preventative custody ahead of the meeting , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said friday .

" alarms , wires , clocks and bangers " were uncovered during raids targeting 21 people suspected of " seriously trying to disrupt or prevent , " the june 6 to 8 summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm , german weekly news magazine focus reported .
in an issue due to appear on monday , it said police found " non-conventional explosives " at a farm near berlin .
fake identity cards were found at the home of another suspect in the northern city of hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to throw a tight security ring around the baltic coast town where the g8 summit will take place berlin is expecting up to 100,000 left-wing protestors to demonstrate at the meeting of leaders of the group of eight most industrialized nations .
authorities are planning to deploy 16,000 police in heiligendamm and the nearby city of rostock and put up a 12-kilometre-long -lrb- 7.5-mile-long -rrb- security fence .
german magazine der spiegel weekly said several retired people were on the list of the 21 suspects , adding that the oldest among them was 68 .
" a show of force " on wednesday , 900 police officers raided 40 sites in northern germany linked to left-wing activists believed to be preparing arson attacks and other violent protests during the summit .
the massive security operation has been slammed by critics as overblown and an unnecessary show of force by the german state .
peter ritter of the opposition left party told news agency dpa on sunday said the government by deliberately criminalizing g8 opponents was also discrediting their criticism of the policies of industrialized nations .
" if anti-globalization activists are collectively painted as being violent , then it 's a statement on their goals which are shared by many people , " ritter said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationwide raids on leftwing groups have been strongly criticized in an editorial on sunday , the zurich-based sonntagszeitung said the german raids on left-wing bookshops and offices was " a show of force by the german state . "
the paper added that the move had only served to fuel discontent among left-wing groups and bolster their readiness to protest violently .
in response to the raids , more than 5,000 protestors later took to the streets of berlin , hamburg and smaller german cities .
anti-globalization group attac said on friday the police clampdown had only served to encourage protestors .
" one of the consequences of the police operations was to mobilize people , " peter wahl from attac told zdf television .
critics incensed by security measures what has also angered critics is a controversial proposal by interior minister wolfgang schäuble to place potential troublemakers in preventative custody .
schäuble said potential troublemakers could be detained for up to two weeks if there were firm indications they are planning criminal actions .
in germany , people can be put behind bars for 14 days if police find evidence that they are planning a crime .
the government threatened to do this with hooligans during the soccer world cup in germany last summer .
the minister has already announced that germany was re-imposing border checks to stop potential offenders , mainly opponents of globalization , from entering germany to protest at the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble is under fire over the weekend , schäuble said he was not responsible for the recent nationwide raids on left-wing groups - a decision , he said , was taken by the federal state prosecutor - but he defended the measure .
" i do n't have the slightest doubt that the measures were absolutely right , " schäuble said on the sidelines of an eu interior minister meeting in venice on saturday .
police expert warns against ignoring other threats schäuble said germany expected an increased security threat during the summit .
he said the fact that germany was not subject to terrorist attacks during major events such as last year 's world cup " does not mean we will be spared this time . "
fears about security were raised when opponents of the summit claimed responsibility for torching a car on the property of a german finance ministry official in the northern city of hamburg in december .
protesters have also splashed paint on the summit hotel .
however , some have warned against focusing excessive attention on the threat of violent left-wing demonstrations and threats in the run-up to the summit .

we will just work hard to stay focused and keep our concentration , which we have done all season .

in an issue due to appear on monday , it said police found " non-conventional explosives " at a farm near berlin .
fake identity cards were found at the home of another suspect in the northern city of hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to throw a tight security ring around the baltic coast town where the g8 summit will take place berlin is expecting up to 100,000 left-wing protestors to demonstrate at the meeting of leaders of the group of eight most industrialized nations .
authorities are planning to deploy 16,000 police in heiligendamm and the nearby city of rostock and put up a 12-kilometre-long -lrb- 7.5-mile-long -rrb- security fence .
german magazine der spiegel weekly said several retired people were on the list of the 21 suspects , adding that the oldest among them was 68 .
" a show of force " on wednesday , 900 police officers raided 40 sites in northern germany linked to left-wing activists believed to be preparing arson attacks and other violent protests during the summit .
the massive security operation has been slammed by critics as overblown and an unnecessary show of force by the german state .
peter ritter of the opposition left party told news agency dpa on sunday said the government by deliberately criminalizing g8 opponents was also discrediting their criticism of the policies of industrialized nations .
" if anti-globalization activists are collectively painted as being violent , then it 's a statement on their goals which are shared by many people , " ritter said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationwide raids on leftwing groups have been strongly criticized in an editorial on sunday , the zurich-based sonntagszeitung said the german raids on left-wing bookshops and offices was " a show of force by the german state . "
the paper added that the move had only served to fuel discontent among left-wing groups and bolster their readiness to protest violently .
in response to the raids , more than 5,000 protestors later took to the streets of berlin , hamburg and smaller german cities .
anti-globalization group attac said on friday the police clampdown had only served to encourage protestors .
" one of the consequences of the police operations was to mobilize people , " peter wahl from attac told zdf television .
critics incensed by security measures what has also angered critics is a controversial proposal by interior minister wolfgang schäuble to place potential troublemakers in preventative custody .
schäuble said potential troublemakers could be detained for up to two weeks if there were firm indications they are planning criminal actions .
in germany , people can be put behind bars for 14 days if police find evidence that they are planning a crime .
the government threatened to do this with hooligans during the soccer world cup in germany last summer .
the minister has already announced that germany was re-imposing border checks to stop potential offenders , mainly opponents of globalization , from entering germany to protest at the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble is under fire over the weekend , schäuble said he was not responsible for the recent nationwide raids on left-wing groups - a decision , he said , was taken by the federal state prosecutor - but he defended the measure .
" i do n't have the slightest doubt that the measures were absolutely right , " schäuble said on the sidelines of an eu interior minister meeting in venice on saturday .
police expert warns against ignoring other threats schäuble said germany expected an increased security threat during the summit .
he said the fact that germany was not subject to terrorist attacks during major events such as last year 's world cup " does not mean we will be spared this time . "
fears about security were raised when opponents of the summit claimed responsibility for torching a car on the property of a german finance ministry official in the northern city of hamburg in december .
protesters have also splashed paint on the summit hotel .
however , some have warned against focusing excessive attention on the threat of violent left-wing demonstrations and threats in the run-up to the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombs exploded on london 's bus and underground system during a g8 summit in 2005 " we should n't underestimate the immense dangers posed by islamic terrorists , " said konrad freiberg , head of the police union , in an article for the bild am sonntag paper .
" it was while the g8 summit was taking place in gleneagles in scottland in 2005 that bombs planted by islamic terrorists exploded in the london subway . "
freiberg also warned that police forces would be overstretched during the security operation for the g8 .
freiberg called the g8 summit a " herculean task " and said it would constitute the " biggest police operation of all times . "
several g8 summits in recent years have been scarred by violence , most notably the meeting in the italian city of genoa in 2001 when an anti-capitalist protester was killed by police during riots .

the paper added that the move had only served to fuel discontent among left-wing groups and bolster their readiness to protest violently .
in response to the raids , more than 5,000 protestors later took to the streets of berlin , hamburg and smaller german cities .
anti-globalization group attac said on friday the police clampdown had only served to encourage protestors .
" one of the consequences of the police operations was to mobilize people , " peter wahl from attac told zdf television .
critics incensed by security measures what has also angered critics is a controversial proposal by interior minister wolfgang schäuble to place potential troublemakers in preventative custody .
schäuble said potential troublemakers could be detained for up to two weeks if there were firm indications they are planning criminal actions .
in germany , people can be put behind bars for 14 days if police find evidence that they are planning a crime .
the government threatened to do this with hooligans during the soccer world cup in germany last summer .
the minister has already announced that germany was re-imposing border checks to stop potential offenders , mainly opponents of globalization , from entering germany to protest at the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble is under fire over the weekend , schäuble said he was not responsible for the recent nationwide raids on left-wing groups - a decision , he said , was taken by the federal state prosecutor - but he defended the measure .
" i do n't have the slightest doubt that the measures were absolutely right , " schäuble said on the sidelines of an eu interior minister meeting in venice on saturday .
police expert warns against ignoring other threats schäuble said germany expected an increased security threat during the summit .
he said the fact that germany was not subject to terrorist attacks during major events such as last year 's world cup " does not mean we will be spared this time . "
fears about security were raised when opponents of the summit claimed responsibility for torching a car on the property of a german finance ministry official in the northern city of hamburg in december .
protesters have also splashed paint on the summit hotel .
however , some have warned against focusing excessive attention on the threat of violent left-wing demonstrations and threats in the run-up to the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombs exploded on london 's bus and underground system during a g8 summit in 2005 " we should n't underestimate the immense dangers posed by islamic terrorists , " said konrad freiberg , head of the police union , in an article for the bild am sonntag paper .
" it was while the g8 summit was taking place in gleneagles in scottland in 2005 that bombs planted by islamic terrorists exploded in the london subway . "
freiberg also warned that police forces would be overstretched during the security operation for the g8 .
freiberg called the g8 summit a " herculean task " and said it would constitute the " biggest police operation of all times . "
several g8 summits in recent years have been scarred by violence , most notably the meeting in the italian city of genoa in 2001 when an anti-capitalist protester was killed by police during riots .
demonstrations at recent g8 summits have been kept well away from the venue , although violence has broken out in nearby towns . dw staff with news wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de interior minister advocates preventative custody for g8 rowdies extremists planning to disrupt next month 's group of eight summit of the world 's richest nations could be placed in preventative custody ahead of the meeting , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said friday .

" alarms , wires , clocks and bangers " were uncovered during raids targeting 21 people suspected of " seriously trying to disrupt or prevent , " the june 6 to 8 summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm , german weekly news magazine focus reported .
in an issue due to appear on monday , it said police found " non-conventional explosives " at a farm near berlin .
fake identity cards were found at the home of another suspect in the northern city of hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to throw a tight security ring around the baltic coast town where the g8 summit will take place berlin is expecting up to 100,000 left-wing protestors to demonstrate at the meeting of leaders of the group of eight most industrialized nations .
authorities are planning to deploy 16,000 police in heiligendamm and the nearby city of rostock and put up a 12-kilometre-long -lrb- 7.5-mile-long -rrb- security fence .
german magazine der spiegel weekly said several retired people were on the list of the 21 suspects , adding that the oldest among them was 68 .
" a show of force " on wednesday , 900 police officers raided 40 sites in northern germany linked to left-wing activists believed to be preparing arson attacks and other violent protests during the summit .
the massive security operation has been slammed by critics as overblown and an unnecessary show of force by the german state .
peter ritter of the opposition left party told news agency dpa on sunday said the government by deliberately criminalizing g8 opponents was also discrediting their criticism of the policies of industrialized nations .
" if anti-globalization activists are collectively painted as being violent , then it 's a statement on their goals which are shared by many people , " ritter said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationwide raids on leftwing groups have been strongly criticized in an editorial on sunday , the zurich-based sonntagszeitung said the german raids on left-wing bookshops and offices was " a show of force by the german state . "
the paper added that the move had only served to fuel discontent among left-wing groups and bolster their readiness to protest violently .
in response to the raids , more than 5,000 protestors later took to the streets of berlin , hamburg and smaller german cities .
anti-globalization group attac said on friday the police clampdown had only served to encourage protestors .
" one of the consequences of the police operations was to mobilize people , " peter wahl from attac told zdf television .
critics incensed by security measures what has also angered critics is a controversial proposal by interior minister wolfgang schäuble to place potential troublemakers in preventative custody .
schäuble said potential troublemakers could be detained for up to two weeks if there were firm indications they are planning criminal actions .
in germany , people can be put behind bars for 14 days if police find evidence that they are planning a crime .
the government threatened to do this with hooligans during the soccer world cup in germany last summer .
the minister has already announced that germany was re-imposing border checks to stop potential offenders , mainly opponents of globalization , from entering germany to protest at the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble is under fire over the weekend , schäuble said he was not responsible for the recent nationwide raids on left-wing groups - a decision , he said , was taken by the federal state prosecutor - but he defended the measure .
" i do n't have the slightest doubt that the measures were absolutely right , " schäuble said on the sidelines of an eu interior minister meeting in venice on saturday .
police expert warns against ignoring other threats schäuble said germany expected an increased security threat during the summit .
he said the fact that germany was not subject to terrorist attacks during major events such as last year 's world cup " does not mean we will be spared this time . "
fears about security were raised when opponents of the summit claimed responsibility for torching a car on the property of a german finance ministry official in the northern city of hamburg in december .
protesters have also splashed paint on the summit hotel .
however , some have warned against focusing excessive attention on the threat of violent left-wing demonstrations and threats in the run-up to the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombs exploded on london 's bus and underground system during a g8 summit in 2005 " we should n't underestimate the immense dangers posed by islamic terrorists , " said konrad freiberg , head of the police union , in an article for the bild am sonntag paper .
" it was while the g8 summit was taking place in gleneagles in scottland in 2005 that bombs planted by islamic terrorists exploded in the london subway . "
freiberg also warned that police forces would be overstretched during the security operation for the g8 .
freiberg called the g8 summit a " herculean task " and said it would constitute the " biggest police operation of all times . "
several g8 summits in recent years have been scarred by violence , most notably the meeting in the italian city of genoa in 2001 when an anti-capitalist protester was killed by police during riots .
demonstrations at recent g8 summits have been kept well away from the venue , although violence has broken out in nearby towns . dw staff with news wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de interior minister advocates preventative custody for g8 rowdies extremists planning to disrupt next month 's group of eight summit of the world 's richest nations could be placed in preventative custody ahead of the meeting , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said friday .

" you might know about making films , but you do n't know anything about environmental issues , " the minister said . akin might just prove him wrong , and is currently making a docu-thriller which charts the war against a planned landfill site being waged by the 3,500 inhabitants of camburnu , a village in the tea-growing region near the turkish black sea coast . he soon realized he could n't expect much help from the authorities .
" this chapter has long been closed , " pepe told him . a personal project akin was not allowed to film the run-in with the environment minister , but the first shots from the black sea coast are already in the can . " if we can step up enough pressure for the project to be halted , there could be a happy ending , " the 33-year old director said in an interview with deutsche-presse agentur dpa in istanbul , " but it could also end in tragedy , with the death of the village . " the turkish-german film director feels personally involved in the villagers ' resistance . " it 's my grandfather 's village .
i 've been fighting together with its inhabitants for the past two years , " said akin . foreign pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community needs to put pressure on erdogan 's government with so much at stake , he is pulling out all the stops both in turkey and in germany . according to the hurriyet newspaper , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan allegedly asked his environment minister " what 's all this about , osman ? " when he received a letter from german green party leader claudia roth , pointing to the environmental risks of the planned landfill site . " i think the only chance the village still has is political pressure from abroad , " akin says , stressing that turkey has to understand the full implications .
" there 's no place for it in the european union if it ca n't sort out its environmental problems , " he says . making movies the moore way does this mean that akin , who won the golden bear at the 2004 berlin film festival for his hard-hitting drama " gegen die wand " -lrb- head-on -rrb- , has suddenly discovered politics ? " the times are too irritating , too disturbing at the moment for me to be able to ignore it in my art , " the director says .
" i 'm not interested in anything else right now . " he also believes in trying to combine political education and entertainment - although he 's aware of the risks , and knows a film should never seem didactic . " first of all i want to entertain , " he says .
" that 's my job , i 'm a storyteller . " so he 's unlikely to be following in the footsteps of michael moore , who won the palme d 'or at the 2004 cannes film festival for " fahrenheit 9/11 . " " it 's my questions and my voice that you can hear -lrb- in the film -rrb- , and sometimes i 'm in the picture too , " akin says .
that 's where the similarities end .
he has no intention of going as far as moore does with his political message , and says he prefers to work more with the means of the classic documentary . " i try to find images that a 12-year old could understand , " akin says . valuable lessons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : akin also filmed " crossing the bridge " in turkey the heroes of his film are the villagers , tea pickers , a primary school teacher , the village photographer . " i 've learn from the modest dignity of these people , " he explains .
" they live in fear that the garbage heap near their village will poison their water , attract pests and bring disease . " he has particular respect for camburno mayor huseyin alioglu .
after the village community 's court appeals against the landfill site repeatedly failed , alioglu has been charged " for acting in an un-turkish way , against the national interest .

" alarms , wires , clocks and bangers " were uncovered during raids targeting 21 people suspected of " seriously trying to disrupt or prevent , " the june 6 to 8 summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm , german weekly news magazine focus reported .
in an issue due to appear on monday , it said police found " non-conventional explosives " at a farm near berlin .
fake identity cards were found at the home of another suspect in the northern city of hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to throw a tight security ring around the baltic coast town where the g8 summit will take place berlin is expecting up to 100,000 left-wing protestors to demonstrate at the meeting of leaders of the group of eight most industrialized nations .
authorities are planning to deploy 16,000 police in heiligendamm and the nearby city of rostock and put up a 12-kilometre-long -lrb- 7.5-mile-long -rrb- security fence .
german magazine der spiegel weekly said several retired people were on the list of the 21 suspects , adding that the oldest among them was 68 .
" a show of force " on wednesday , 900 police officers raided 40 sites in northern germany linked to left-wing activists believed to be preparing arson attacks and other violent protests during the summit .
the massive security operation has been slammed by critics as overblown and an unnecessary show of force by the german state .
peter ritter of the opposition left party told news agency dpa on sunday said the government by deliberately criminalizing g8 opponents was also discrediting their criticism of the policies of industrialized nations .
" if anti-globalization activists are collectively painted as being violent , then it 's a statement on their goals which are shared by many people , " ritter said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationwide raids on leftwing groups have been strongly criticized in an editorial on sunday , the zurich-based sonntagszeitung said the german raids on left-wing bookshops and offices was " a show of force by the german state . "
the paper added that the move had only served to fuel discontent among left-wing groups and bolster their readiness to protest violently .
in response to the raids , more than 5,000 protestors later took to the streets of berlin , hamburg and smaller german cities .
anti-globalization group attac said on friday the police clampdown had only served to encourage protestors .
" one of the consequences of the police operations was to mobilize people , " peter wahl from attac told zdf television .
critics incensed by security measures what has also angered critics is a controversial proposal by interior minister wolfgang schäuble to place potential troublemakers in preventative custody .
schäuble said potential troublemakers could be detained for up to two weeks if there were firm indications they are planning criminal actions .
in germany , people can be put behind bars for 14 days if police find evidence that they are planning a crime .
the government threatened to do this with hooligans during the soccer world cup in germany last summer .
the minister has already announced that germany was re-imposing border checks to stop potential offenders , mainly opponents of globalization , from entering germany to protest at the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble is under fire over the weekend , schäuble said he was not responsible for the recent nationwide raids on left-wing groups - a decision , he said , was taken by the federal state prosecutor - but he defended the measure .
" i do n't have the slightest doubt that the measures were absolutely right , " schäuble said on the sidelines of an eu interior minister meeting in venice on saturday .
police expert warns against ignoring other threats schäuble said germany expected an increased security threat during the summit .
he said the fact that germany was not subject to terrorist attacks during major events such as last year 's world cup " does not mean we will be spared this time . "
fears about security were raised when opponents of the summit claimed responsibility for torching a car on the property of a german finance ministry official in the northern city of hamburg in december .
protesters have also splashed paint on the summit hotel .
however , some have warned against focusing excessive attention on the threat of violent left-wing demonstrations and threats in the run-up to the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombs exploded on london 's bus and underground system during a g8 summit in 2005 " we should n't underestimate the immense dangers posed by islamic terrorists , " said konrad freiberg , head of the police union , in an article for the bild am sonntag paper .
" it was while the g8 summit was taking place in gleneagles in scottland in 2005 that bombs planted by islamic terrorists exploded in the london subway . "
freiberg also warned that police forces would be overstretched during the security operation for the g8 .
freiberg called the g8 summit a " herculean task " and said it would constitute the " biggest police operation of all times . "
several g8 summits in recent years have been scarred by violence , most notably the meeting in the italian city of genoa in 2001 when an anti-capitalist protester was killed by police during riots .

" you might know about making films , but you do n't know anything about environmental issues , " the minister said . akin might just prove him wrong , and is currently making a docu-thriller which charts the war against a planned landfill site being waged by the 3,500 inhabitants of camburnu , a village in the tea-growing region near the turkish black sea coast . he soon realized he could n't expect much help from the authorities .
" this chapter has long been closed , " pepe told him . a personal project akin was not allowed to film the run-in with the environment minister , but the first shots from the black sea coast are already in the can . " if we can step up enough pressure for the project to be halted , there could be a happy ending , " the 33-year old director said in an interview with deutsche-presse agentur dpa in istanbul , " but it could also end in tragedy , with the death of the village . " the turkish-german film director feels personally involved in the villagers ' resistance . " it 's my grandfather 's village .
i 've been fighting together with its inhabitants for the past two years , " said akin . foreign pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community needs to put pressure on erdogan 's government with so much at stake , he is pulling out all the stops both in turkey and in germany . according to the hurriyet newspaper , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan allegedly asked his environment minister " what 's all this about , osman ? " when he received a letter from german green party leader claudia roth , pointing to the environmental risks of the planned landfill site . " i think the only chance the village still has is political pressure from abroad , " akin says , stressing that turkey has to understand the full implications .
" there 's no place for it in the european union if it ca n't sort out its environmental problems , " he says . making movies the moore way does this mean that akin , who won the golden bear at the 2004 berlin film festival for his hard-hitting drama " gegen die wand " -lrb- head-on -rrb- , has suddenly discovered politics ? " the times are too irritating , too disturbing at the moment for me to be able to ignore it in my art , " the director says .
" i 'm not interested in anything else right now . " he also believes in trying to combine political education and entertainment - although he 's aware of the risks , and knows a film should never seem didactic . " first of all i want to entertain , " he says .
" that 's my job , i 'm a storyteller . " so he 's unlikely to be following in the footsteps of michael moore , who won the palme d 'or at the 2004 cannes film festival for " fahrenheit 9/11 . " " it 's my questions and my voice that you can hear -lrb- in the film -rrb- , and sometimes i 'm in the picture too , " akin says .
that 's where the similarities end .
he has no intention of going as far as moore does with his political message , and says he prefers to work more with the means of the classic documentary . " i try to find images that a 12-year old could understand , " akin says . valuable lessons bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : akin also filmed " crossing the bridge " in turkey the heroes of his film are the villagers , tea pickers , a primary school teacher , the village photographer . " i 've learn from the modest dignity of these people , " he explains .
" they live in fear that the garbage heap near their village will poison their water , attract pests and bring disease . " he has particular respect for camburno mayor huseyin alioglu .
after the village community 's court appeals against the landfill site repeatedly failed , alioglu has been charged " for acting in an un-turkish way , against the national interest . " " he is without doubt the tragic hero of the film , " says akin . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german-turkish director in competition at 60th cannes festival director fatih akin will be heading to the french riviera in may for the 60th edition of the world 's premiere film festival .

" there is still a lot of work to be done , " said stuttgart coach armin veh .
" it will all be counted up at the end next week .
we will just work hard to stay focused and keep our concentration , which we have done all season .
it will come down to who holds their nerve next weekend .

it 's our job to lift them to do a good job against arminia bielefeld to secure at least second place .

" you might know about making films , but you do n't know anything about environmental issues , " the minister said . akin might just prove him wrong , and is currently making a docu-thriller which charts the war against a planned landfill site being waged by the 3,500 inhabitants of camburnu , a village in the tea-growing region near the turkish black sea coast . he soon realized he could n't expect much help from the authorities .
" this chapter has long been closed , " pepe told him . a personal project akin was not allowed to film the run-in with the environment minister , but the first shots from the black sea coast are already in the can . " if we can step up enough pressure for the project to be halted , there could be a happy ending , " the 33-year old director said in an interview with deutsche-presse agentur dpa in istanbul , " but it could also end in tragedy , with the death of the village . " the turkish-german film director feels personally involved in the villagers ' resistance . " it 's my grandfather 's village .

" when he received a letter from german green party leader claudia roth , pointing to the environmental risks of the planned landfill site . " i think the only chance the village still has is political pressure from abroad , " akin says , stressing that turkey has to understand the full implications .
" there 's no place for it in the european union if it ca n't sort out its environmental problems , " he says . making movies the moore way does this mean that akin , who won the golden bear at the 2004 berlin film festival for his hard-hitting drama " gegen die wand " -lrb- head-on -rrb- , has suddenly discovered politics ? " the times are too irritating , too disturbing at the moment for me to be able to ignore it in my art , " the director says .
" i 'm not interested in anything else right now . " he also believes in trying to combine political education and entertainment - although he 's aware of the risks , and knows a film should never seem didactic . " first of all i want to entertain , " he says .
" that 's my job , i 'm a storyteller . " so he 's unlikely to be following in the footsteps of michael moore , who won the palme d 'or at the 2004 cannes film festival for " fahrenheit 9/11 . " " it 's my questions and my voice that you can hear -lrb- in the film -rrb- , and sometimes i 'm in the picture too , " akin says .
that 's where the similarities end .
he has no intention of going as far as moore does with his political message , and says he prefers to work more with the means of the classic documentary .

" you might know about making films , but you do n't know anything about environmental issues , " the minister said . akin might just prove him wrong , and is currently making a docu-thriller which charts the war against a planned landfill site being waged by the 3,500 inhabitants of camburnu , a village in the tea-growing region near the turkish black sea coast . he soon realized he could n't expect much help from the authorities .
" this chapter has long been closed , " pepe told him . a personal project akin was not allowed to film the run-in with the environment minister , but the first shots from the black sea coast are already in the can . " if we can step up enough pressure for the project to be halted , there could be a happy ending , " the 33-year old director said in an interview with deutsche-presse agentur dpa in istanbul , " but it could also end in tragedy , with the death of the village .

" when he received a letter from german green party leader claudia roth , pointing to the environmental risks of the planned landfill site .

" you might know about making films , but you do n't know anything about environmental issues , " the minister said . akin might just prove him wrong , and is currently making a docu-thriller which charts the war against a planned landfill site being waged by the 3,500 inhabitants of camburnu , a village in the tea-growing region near the turkish black sea coast . he soon realized he could n't expect much help from the authorities .
" this chapter has long been closed , " pepe told him . a personal project akin was not allowed to film the run-in with the environment minister , but the first shots from the black sea coast are already in the can . " if we can step up enough pressure for the project to be halted , there could be a happy ending , " the 33-year old director said in an interview with deutsche-presse agentur dpa in istanbul , " but it could also end in tragedy , with the death of the village . " the turkish-german film director feels personally involved in the villagers ' resistance . " it 's my grandfather 's village .
i 've been fighting together with its inhabitants for the past two years , " said akin . foreign pressure bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the international community needs to put pressure on erdogan 's government with so much at stake , he is pulling out all the stops both in turkey and in germany . according to the hurriyet newspaper , prime minister recep tayyip erdogan allegedly asked his environment minister " what 's all this about , osman ? " when he received a letter from german green party leader claudia roth , pointing to the environmental risks of the planned landfill site . " i think the only chance the village still has is political pressure from abroad , " akin says , stressing that turkey has to understand the full implications .
" there 's no place for it in the european union if it ca n't sort out its environmental problems , " he says . making movies the moore way does this mean that akin , who won the golden bear at the 2004 berlin film festival for his hard-hitting drama " gegen die wand " -lrb- head-on -rrb- , has suddenly discovered politics ? " the times are too irritating , too disturbing at the moment for me to be able to ignore it in my art , " the director says .
" i 'm not interested in anything else right now . " he also believes in trying to combine political education and entertainment - although he 's aware of the risks , and knows a film should never seem didactic . " first of all i want to entertain , " he says .
" that 's my job , i 'm a storyteller . " so he 's unlikely to be following in the footsteps of michael moore , who won the palme d 'or at the 2004 cannes film festival for " fahrenheit 9/11 . " " it 's my questions and my voice that you can hear -lrb- in the film -rrb- , and sometimes i 'm in the picture too , " akin says .
that 's where the similarities end .
he has no intention of going as far as moore does with his political message , and says he prefers to work more with the means of the classic documentary .

" they live in fear that the garbage heap near their village will poison their water , attract pests and bring disease . " he has particular respect for camburno mayor huseyin alioglu .

" alarms , wires , clocks and bangers " were uncovered during raids targeting 21 people suspected of " seriously trying to disrupt or prevent , " the june 6 to 8 summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm , german weekly news magazine focus reported .
in an issue due to appear on monday , it said police found " non-conventional explosives " at a farm near berlin .
fake identity cards were found at the home of another suspect in the northern city of hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to throw a tight security ring around the baltic coast town where the g8 summit will take place berlin is expecting up to 100,000 left-wing protestors to demonstrate at the meeting of leaders of the group of eight most industrialized nations .
authorities are planning to deploy 16,000 police in heiligendamm and the nearby city of rostock and put up a 12-kilometre-long -lrb- 7.5-mile-long -rrb- security fence .
german magazine der spiegel weekly said several retired people were on the list of the 21 suspects , adding that the oldest among them was 68 .
" a show of force " on wednesday , 900 police officers raided 40 sites in northern germany linked to left-wing activists believed to be preparing arson attacks and other violent protests during the summit .
the massive security operation has been slammed by critics as overblown and an unnecessary show of force by the german state .
peter ritter of the opposition left party told news agency dpa on sunday said the government by deliberately criminalizing g8 opponents was also discrediting their criticism of the policies of industrialized nations .
" if anti-globalization activists are collectively painted as being violent , then it 's a statement on their goals which are shared by many people , " ritter said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationwide raids on leftwing groups have been strongly criticized in an editorial on sunday , the zurich-based sonntagszeitung said the german raids on left-wing bookshops and offices was " a show of force by the german state . "
the paper added that the move had only served to fuel discontent among left-wing groups and bolster their readiness to protest violently .
in response to the raids , more than 5,000 protestors later took to the streets of berlin , hamburg and smaller german cities .
anti-globalization group attac said on friday the police clampdown had only served to encourage protestors .
" one of the consequences of the police operations was to mobilize people , " peter wahl from attac told zdf television .
critics incensed by security measures what has also angered critics is a controversial proposal by interior minister wolfgang schäuble to place potential troublemakers in preventative custody .
schäuble said potential troublemakers could be detained for up to two weeks if there were firm indications they are planning criminal actions .
in germany , people can be put behind bars for 14 days if police find evidence that they are planning a crime .
the government threatened to do this with hooligans during the soccer world cup in germany last summer .
the minister has already announced that germany was re-imposing border checks to stop potential offenders , mainly opponents of globalization , from entering germany to protest at the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble is under fire over the weekend , schäuble said he was not responsible for the recent nationwide raids on left-wing groups - a decision , he said , was taken by the federal state prosecutor - but he defended the measure .
" i do n't have the slightest doubt that the measures were absolutely right , " schäuble said on the sidelines of an eu interior minister meeting in venice on saturday .
police expert warns against ignoring other threats schäuble said germany expected an increased security threat during the summit .
he said the fact that germany was not subject to terrorist attacks during major events such as last year 's world cup " does not mean we will be spared this time . "
fears about security were raised when opponents of the summit claimed responsibility for torching a car on the property of a german finance ministry official in the northern city of hamburg in december .
protesters have also splashed paint on the summit hotel .
however , some have warned against focusing excessive attention on the threat of violent left-wing demonstrations and threats in the run-up to the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombs exploded on london 's bus and underground system during a g8 summit in 2005 " we should n't underestimate the immense dangers posed by islamic terrorists , " said konrad freiberg , head of the police union , in an article for the bild am sonntag paper .
" it was while the g8 summit was taking place in gleneagles in scottland in 2005 that bombs planted by islamic terrorists exploded in the london subway . "
freiberg also warned that police forces would be overstretched during the security operation for the g8 .
freiberg called the g8 summit a " herculean task " and said it would constitute the " biggest police operation of all times . "
several g8 summits in recent years have been scarred by violence , most notably the meeting in the italian city of genoa in 2001 when an anti-capitalist protester was killed by police during riots .
demonstrations at recent g8 summits have been kept well away from the venue , although violence has broken out in nearby towns . dw staff with news wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de interior minister advocates preventative custody for g8 rowdies extremists planning to disrupt next month 's group of eight summit of the world 's richest nations could be placed in preventative custody ahead of the meeting , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said friday .

" alarms , wires , clocks and bangers " were uncovered during raids targeting 21 people suspected of " seriously trying to disrupt or prevent , " the june 6 to 8 summit in the baltic sea resort of heiligendamm , german weekly news magazine focus reported .
in an issue due to appear on monday , it said police found " non-conventional explosives " at a farm near berlin .
fake identity cards were found at the home of another suspect in the northern city of hamburg .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany plans to throw a tight security ring around the baltic coast town where the g8 summit will take place berlin is expecting up to 100,000 left-wing protestors to demonstrate at the meeting of leaders of the group of eight most industrialized nations .
authorities are planning to deploy 16,000 police in heiligendamm and the nearby city of rostock and put up a 12-kilometre-long -lrb- 7.5-mile-long -rrb- security fence .
german magazine der spiegel weekly said several retired people were on the list of the 21 suspects , adding that the oldest among them was 68 .
" a show of force " on wednesday , 900 police officers raided 40 sites in northern germany linked to left-wing activists believed to be preparing arson attacks and other violent protests during the summit .
the massive security operation has been slammed by critics as overblown and an unnecessary show of force by the german state .
peter ritter of the opposition left party told news agency dpa on sunday said the government by deliberately criminalizing g8 opponents was also discrediting their criticism of the policies of industrialized nations .
" if anti-globalization activists are collectively painted as being violent , then it 's a statement on their goals which are shared by many people , " ritter said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : nationwide raids on leftwing groups have been strongly criticized in an editorial on sunday , the zurich-based sonntagszeitung said the german raids on left-wing bookshops and offices was " a show of force by the german state . "
the paper added that the move had only served to fuel discontent among left-wing groups and bolster their readiness to protest violently .
in response to the raids , more than 5,000 protestors later took to the streets of berlin , hamburg and smaller german cities .
anti-globalization group attac said on friday the police clampdown had only served to encourage protestors .
" one of the consequences of the police operations was to mobilize people , " peter wahl from attac told zdf television .
critics incensed by security measures what has also angered critics is a controversial proposal by interior minister wolfgang schäuble to place potential troublemakers in preventative custody .
schäuble said potential troublemakers could be detained for up to two weeks if there were firm indications they are planning criminal actions .
in germany , people can be put behind bars for 14 days if police find evidence that they are planning a crime .
the government threatened to do this with hooligans during the soccer world cup in germany last summer .
the minister has already announced that germany was re-imposing border checks to stop potential offenders , mainly opponents of globalization , from entering germany to protest at the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : interior minister schäuble is under fire over the weekend , schäuble said he was not responsible for the recent nationwide raids on left-wing groups - a decision , he said , was taken by the federal state prosecutor - but he defended the measure .
" i do n't have the slightest doubt that the measures were absolutely right , " schäuble said on the sidelines of an eu interior minister meeting in venice on saturday .
police expert warns against ignoring other threats schäuble said germany expected an increased security threat during the summit .
he said the fact that germany was not subject to terrorist attacks during major events such as last year 's world cup " does not mean we will be spared this time . "
fears about security were raised when opponents of the summit claimed responsibility for torching a car on the property of a german finance ministry official in the northern city of hamburg in december .
protesters have also splashed paint on the summit hotel .
however , some have warned against focusing excessive attention on the threat of violent left-wing demonstrations and threats in the run-up to the summit .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bombs exploded on london 's bus and underground system during a g8 summit in 2005 " we should n't underestimate the immense dangers posed by islamic terrorists , " said konrad freiberg , head of the police union , in an article for the bild am sonntag paper .
" it was while the g8 summit was taking place in gleneagles in scottland in 2005 that bombs planted by islamic terrorists exploded in the london subway . "
freiberg also warned that police forces would be overstretched during the security operation for the g8 .
freiberg called the g8 summit a " herculean task " and said it would constitute the " biggest police operation of all times . "
several g8 summits in recent years have been scarred by violence , most notably the meeting in the italian city of genoa in 2001 when an anti-capitalist protester was killed by police during riots .
demonstrations at recent g8 summits have been kept well away from the venue , although violence has broken out in nearby towns . dw staff with news wire reports -lrb- sp -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de interior minister advocates preventative custody for g8 rowdies extremists planning to disrupt next month 's group of eight summit of the world 's richest nations could be placed in preventative custody ahead of the meeting , german interior minister wolfgang schäuble said friday .

it comes days after a un report with similar warnings said that biofuels are more effective when used for heat and power , rather than in transport .
biofuels can be anything made with vegetable matter that burns .
they are seen as a potential solution to climate change because they can reduce emissions of greenhouse gases .
' radical effects ' the co-op report claims there is a future for biofuels , but current targets for growing so much fuel could have unintended consequences , bbc correspondent damian kahya says .
professor dieter helm , a senior advisor to the british government , told the bbc : " the sort of targets being set for biofuels will have quite radical effects on agriculture and therefore will have very substantial consequences for food prices and agriculture more generally . "
the report says that around nine per cent of the world 's agricultural land may be needed to replace just 10 % of the world 's transport fuels .
this means the production of biofuels could lead to a decrease in land available for food production in countries where famine already exists .
" people are felling rainforests to plant crops to grow energy fuels , biofuels , " professor helm said .

the army began escorting hundreds of teenagers off the moor at first light , with 112 of the six-person teams evacuated by 0813 bst .
all the 2,400 participants are expected to have been taken off the moor by mid-afternoon on sunday .
among those involved were team-mates of a teenage girl who died training for the event , now in its 47th year .
charlotte shaw , 14 , from edgehill college , north devon , died in march after falling into a swollen stream .
the 400 teams of six young people on the moor range in age from 14 to 20 and compete on 35 , 45 and 55-mile routes .
' so disappointed ' two sea king helicopters from rnas yeovilton in somerset joined the operation on sunday morning , taking four teams in each airlift .
others were walking off the moor or being taken off by road to okehampton camp in devon .
parents were asked not to pick up their children until midday .
helicopters from rnas yeovilton joined the airlift one participant , rosie , told bbc news : " we have been training for this for so long .
" we are so disappointed . "
a statement from the organisers said the decision to end the event early was taken at 2130 bst on saturday because of " deteriorating weather conditions " .
the decision was also influenced by the high drop-out rate of 15 % on saturday .
an army spokesman said : " our priority is to ensure all the people involved are as safe as possible .
the weather forecast indicates that the rivers , which are already at their peak , will become increasingly swollen . "
" all participants will remain where they are currently camped - safe and with shelter and food .
" they will be moved off the moor in an orderly and controlled manner . "
the event was last severely affected by bad weather in 1996 when 2,100 of the 2,400 taking part were evacuated .
three boys and eight girls from edgehill , the college attended by charlotte shaw , were in this year 's event .
' more determined ' charlotte died when she was swept away after she dropped some of her kit into the walla brook .
she fell in when she leaned over to retrieve it .
edgehill college head teacher stuart nicholson said they had been given special permission by the organisers to enter a team larger than the normal six members .
speaking before the event , he said : " we have worked very closely with all concerned to understand the emotional impact both of participation and of not participating .
" as a school , we have made it possible for the group to continue the usual training , with additional support , whilst recognising that at any stage any of them might feel unable to continue .
" in practice , as the weeks have gone by the group has become more determined that they want to take part .
" we know that charlotte 's spirit of endeavour will be with them all . "
for the first time each team was allowed to carry one mobile phone , for emergencies only .

the decision was also influenced by the high drop-out rate of 15 % on saturday .
an army spokesman said : " our priority is to ensure all the people involved are as safe as possible .
the weather forecast indicates that the rivers , which are already at their peak , will become increasingly swollen . "
" all participants will remain where they are currently camped - safe and with shelter and food .
" they will be moved off the moor in an orderly and controlled manner . "
the event was last severely affected by bad weather in 1996 when 2,100 of the 2,400 taking part were evacuated .
three boys and eight girls from edgehill , the college attended by charlotte shaw , were in this year 's event .
' more determined ' charlotte died when she was swept away after she dropped some of her kit into the walla brook .
she fell in when she leaned over to retrieve it .
edgehill college head teacher stuart nicholson said they had been given special permission by the organisers to enter a team larger than the normal six members .
speaking before the event , he said : " we have worked very closely with all concerned to understand the emotional impact both of participation and of not participating .
" as a school , we have made it possible for the group to continue the usual training , with additional support , whilst recognising that at any stage any of them might feel unable to continue .
" in practice , as the weeks have gone by the group has become more determined that they want to take part .
" we know that charlotte 's spirit of endeavour will be with them all . "
for the first time each team was allowed to carry one mobile phone , for emergencies only .

the army began escorting hundreds of teenagers off the moor at first light , with 112 of the six-person teams evacuated by 0813 bst .
all the 2,400 participants are expected to have been taken off the moor by mid-afternoon on sunday .
among those involved were team-mates of a teenage girl who died training for the event , now in its 47th year .
charlotte shaw , 14 , from edgehill college , north devon , died in march after falling into a swollen stream .
the 400 teams of six young people on the moor range in age from 14 to 20 and compete on 35 , 45 and 55-mile routes .
' so disappointed ' two sea king helicopters from rnas yeovilton in somerset joined the operation on sunday morning , taking four teams in each airlift .
others were walking off the moor or being taken off by road to okehampton camp in devon .
parents were asked not to pick up their children until midday .
helicopters from rnas yeovilton joined the airlift one participant , rosie , told bbc news : " we have been training for this for so long .
" we are so disappointed . "
a statement from the organisers said the decision to end the event early was taken at 2130 bst on saturday because of " deteriorating weather conditions " .
the decision was also influenced by the high drop-out rate of 15 % on saturday .
an army spokesman said : " our priority is to ensure all the people involved are as safe as possible .
the weather forecast indicates that the rivers , which are already at their peak , will become increasingly swollen . "
" all participants will remain where they are currently camped - safe and with shelter and food .
" they will be moved off the moor in an orderly and controlled manner . "
the event was last severely affected by bad weather in 1996 when 2,100 of the 2,400 taking part were evacuated .
three boys and eight girls from edgehill , the college attended by charlotte shaw , were in this year 's event .
' more determined ' charlotte died when she was swept away after she dropped some of her kit into the walla brook .
she fell in when she leaned over to retrieve it .
edgehill college head teacher stuart nicholson said they had been given special permission by the organisers to enter a team larger than the normal six members .
speaking before the event , he said : " we have worked very closely with all concerned to understand the emotional impact both of participation and of not participating .
" as a school , we have made it possible for the group to continue the usual training , with additional support , whilst recognising that at any stage any of them might feel unable to continue .
" in practice , as the weeks have gone by the group has become more determined that they want to take part .
" we know that charlotte 's spirit of endeavour will be with them all . "

the bbc 's mark savage has been reporting from helsinki on the atmosphere at one of the world 's biggest and most colourful music events .
sunday 13 may 1230 local time -lrb- 1030 bst -rrb- well , the eurovision carnival has wrapped up for another year .
dissections of last night 's performances took place over breakfast at the hotel , with the serbian delegation still delighted at their victory .
marija serifovic , a 23-year-old from serbia , was the eurovision winner others were in a more philosophical mood .
there was a brief moment of excitement as scooch appeared in full costume in the hotel lobby - but it turned out to be a finnair crew checking in after an early morning flight .
many eurovision veterans say the voting process needs to be refined next year , but no-one has a constructive alternative to the current system .
in the cold light of day , it 's clear that serbia picked up high scores from around europe - and probably would have won even if its balkan neighbours had n't lent a helping hand .
but , while marija serifovic embarks on a winner 's tour , the uk delegation is going home to lick its wounds - again .
it 's five years since we managed to break the top 10 , but jessica garlick 's third place success showed that the " big four " sponsors of the eurovision - france , germany , spain and the uk - can still make an impact .
perhaps a more traditional song can guide us to victory in belgrade next may .
sunday 13 may 0345 local time -lrb- 0145 bst -rrb- natalie has just got back from interviewing scooch , and they were n't downhearted at all .
here 's what they had to say .
russ : " we 're scooch - maltese favourites ! "
natalie : " we love malta !
and maltesers ! "
russ : " where are you going on holiday next year , caz ? "
caroline : " malta ! "
russ : " where are you going natalie ? "
natalie : " malta ! "
russ : " me too ! "
dour-faced serbian spoilsport marija serifovic was much more serious at the winner 's press conference - revealing how it was god 's plan for her to win , and praising voters for choosing songcraft over showbiz glamour .
perhaps she 's right .
maybe i 've been too harsh on the song .
but have you noticed that serbia has borders with more countries than any other nation in the eurovision ?
sunday 13 may 0110 local time -lrb- 2310 bst -rrb- oh dear .
for the life of me , i do not know who was voting for serbia and their bizarre liturgical dancing .
perhaps it was a clerical error .
bbc radio 1 's natalie jamieson has drawn the short straw and has to head off to interview scooch on behalf of the bbc .
they came joint second-last and i do n't envy her that job one little bit .
see you in belgrade next year .
saturday 12 may 2350 local time -lrb- 2150 bst -rrb- well , the acts have all strutted their stuff on the eurovision stage .
if the reaction in helsinki is anything to go by , ukraine are the clear winners .
we 'll find out in about half an hour .
saturday 12 may 2200 local time -lrb- 2000 bst -rrb- we 're all set - the bbc 's reporting and production team , from left to right , are : helen fawkes , paul henley , natalie jamieson , me , betty redondo and james earl .
here we go !
saturday 12 may 2130 local time -lrb- 1930 bst -rrb- well , it 's half an hour until the whole shebang kicks off .
bosnia-herzegovinan act maria will be singing nameless river i do n't want to spoil any surprises , but if you 're recording the programme to watch tomorrow , fast-forward through bosnia , macedonia and armenia .
you wo n't be missing anything you could n't recreate at home by putting your mum in a purple frock and telling her to shout " bananas " at the dog .
secretly , i 'm hoping scooch do well .
having met them several times over the last week , i 've been won over by their enthusiasm and , let 's be honest , their song .
but germany have got to win .
i put a tenner on them when the odds were 66/1 .
saturday 12 may 1945 local time -lrb- 1745 bst -rrb- here in the press centre , you 're never more than a minute away from a debate about who 's going to win eurovision .
" our song is catchy and it stands out , " say latvian act bonaparti.lv one name that keeps coming up is latvia 's six-piece tenor vocal group , bonaparti.lv.
in fact , several of my colleagues have just placed an obscenely large bet on them to win ...
as one of the 10 acts put through from thursday 's semi-final , bonaparti have been rehearsing their performance since last week , and they 're beginning to get bored .
gathered together for an interview , three of the singers feign sleep , letting " italian-born , latvian by choice " roberto miloni do most of the talking .
perhaps they are just reserving their energy for tonight 's showdown .
" it will be hard work but , like napoleon , we are generals , " says miloni .
" we ca n't be tired , we need to be ready " .
" our song is catchy and it stands out in relation to the others , " pipes up andreas abelite , recently voted latvia 's sexiest man by the country 's leading gay magazine .
" we simply go out on stage with a smile and the emotion of love .
there are no pyrotechnics , just the fire from our voices . "
saturday 12 may 1800 local time -lrb- 1600 bst -rrb- it 's not just eurovision which has got finland talking this weekend .
earlier today , the country went up against russia in the semi-finals of the ice hockey world cup .
fans have begun gathering to watch the show on big tv screens it was an important battle : moscow conquered the country in 1809 and ruled it for more than a century , engendering a fierce rivalry that exists to this day .
against the odds , finland won the match 2-1 , beating russia on home soil .
but the locals are n't expecting a double victory today .
the party line is that hanna pakarinen 's eurovision entry -lrb- leave me alone - a soft rock ballad performed , for no good reason , in a ballgown -rrb- is good enough to make the top 10 , but not strong enough to win .
nonetheless , finn fans have started to congregate on the steps of the city 's senate - where they can follow tonight 's contest on big screens dotted around the square .
" we simply had to come and sample the atmosphere , " one told me .
" after all , it could be another 45 years before we win again . "
saturday 12 may 1500 local time -lrb- 1300 bst -rrb- ukraine 's verka serduchka is hotly tipped to win tonight in helsinki .
verka serduchka has a special message for the uk the drag queen , played by comedian andriy danylkohas , has one of the more energetic stage routines , and has been driving the crowd crazy during dress rehearsals .
personally , i do n't see the attraction .
serduchka reminds me of nothing more than les dawson trying to sing gina g. anyway , one of my colleagues in bbc radio has spoken to the star , who wanted us to pass on the following message .
" hello england , i am verka serduchka .
i love you !
" elton john !
the beatles !
madonna ! "
no , me neither .
saturday 12 may 1200 local time -lrb- 1000 bst -rrb- for the past four months , ola melzig has devoted his life to the eurovision .
he 's the production manager for spectra stage event and technologies , which means he 's responsible for the lighting in the show and running the mammoth video wall which dominates this year 's set .
ola melzig has kept an online diary of his work for the show backstage in his office , he 's set up home with a sofa , a " sadly underused " ps3 and two , yes two , espresso machines .
" we 've been in helsinki for four weeks but i started travelling back and forth in january for pre-production , " the affable swede tells me .
throughout the process , melzig has kept an online diary -lrb- www.eurovisiondiary.com -rrb- which tells of the trials and tribulations of setting up such a massive show .
at the start of the week , things were still a bit hairy - as melzig discovered the underfoot video screens were generating too much heat .
this made the fog effects heat up , resulting in several acts being lost in a murky mist .
but , despite the occasional hiccup , he says " surprisingly little has gone wrong " .
" although one day the stage guys put a drum kit in the wrong place and a lighting rig landed on it and smashed it . "
with innumerable rehearsals and run-throughs , melzig is probably more familiar with the 42 eurovision songs than anyone , but he claims not to have a favourite .
" without noticing , you force yourself to love the songs because you 'd go mental if you did n't like them .
" but the ukraine is fantastic because it 's so fun , the uk is fantastic because it 's so gay , and i love finland because they 're so hardcore . "
friday 11 may 1900 local time -lrb- 1700bst -rrb- georgia 's representative , sopho , has just dropped by the press centre for a chat -lrb- she 's the one with the make-up , in case you 're having trouble distinguishing between us -rrb- .
at 20 years old , she 's the youngest singer in this year 's competition - but she sailed through the qualifying round to make it into the finals , despite the fact that georgia has never entered the competition before .
the bbc 's mark savage meets georgian singer sopho " i really appreciate all the support the european countries provided for me .
thank you for putting me through , " she told me through her interpreter .
" you should see what 's going on in georgia 's capital right now , " she tells me with wide eyes .
" thousands of people are on the street supporting me and this has very symbolic value .
" this is our future - it 's important that all of europe knows that our country is looking forward to getting united with all of europe . "
but i was n't interested in sopho 's messages of political harmony .
no , i wanted to know if she was worried about those dancers with the swords .
" i 'm not afraid at all !
they 're professional dancers and i trust that they 're not going to hurt me . "
so there you go .
friday 11 may 1630 local time -lrb- 1430 bst -rrb- our eurovision voting analyst did n't perform too well last night - only five of the 10 countries he predicted would get through to tomorrow 's final actually made the grade .
without the aid of a sophisticated computer model , i managed to guess six .
but derek gatherer 's analysis of eurovision voting trends still makes interesting reading .
he says 82 % of countries now engage in vote exchanges .
in fact , the only eurovision participants who can claim a clean slate are israel , switzerland , hungary and france .
" people are making a political point , " says gatherer , " and the practice has been steadily increasing since the introduction of phone voting in the mid-90s . "
the worst culprits are the countries that make up the so-called " balkan bloc " , which centres around croatia , serbia and fyr macedonia .
coincidentally , the latter two were both promoted to the final after last night 's phone vote .
but gatherer says the political votes are n't strong enough to influence the winning song .
" last year , finland were strongly backed by their friends , " he says , " but their act was very distinctive " .
" but the last time there was a winner who was n't part of a voting bloc was israel in 1998 . "
friday 11 may 1600 local time -lrb- 1400 bst -rrb- i 've just come back from the first full dress rehearsal for saturday 's big eurovision showdown , and the atmosphere was electric .
scooch are facing an uphill battle to win over the crowd unlike last night 's semi-final , the hartwall arena was packed to the rafters , and the crowd were dancing around like sandy shaw 's proverbial puppet on a string .
the best reactions were reserved for sweden 's glam rock dandies , the ark and ukraine 's grotesque drag queen verka seduchka .
unfortunately , the crowd sat still , arms folded and scowls painted across their faces during scooch 's routine .
one of the uk fans who 's travelled over to helsinki texted me as the band traipsed off stage : " kill me now " .
what have we done to anger the rest of europe so ?
for the last couple of years we 've put our poor performances down to the war in iraq , but tony blair resigned yesterday and it still is n't good enough .
maybe next year we should write a song called " look , we 're really quite sorry about all that stuff we did " and see if that sorts things out .

thursday 10 may 2100 local time -lrb- 1900 bst -rrb- rehearsals have been held at the arena since 3 may i 'm about to go to the helsinki hartwall arena to watch the semi-finals .
to many fans , this is as important as the main event - and the ticket prices reflect it .

one person who 'll be paying close attention is academic derek gatherer .
for the past couple of years , he 's been studying eurovision voting patterns , and says the semi-finals are the place where block voting has the biggest influence .

i 'm actually a bit late to the party - rehearsals started seven days ago and reporters from the more fervent eurovision nations have been following the proceedings ever since .
the media representatives all hard at work in all , there are about 1,600 media representatives here in helsinki , and many of them are sitting around the hall on beanbags , sipping coffee and watching the dress rehearsals for tonight 's semi-final .
after every song a small but enthusiastic cheer erupts from a different corner of the room .
do n't they have work to do ?
as an aside - several seasoned euro hacks warned me that the eurovision attracts a fair share of fans in search of " someone to spend the weekend with " .
i 'm no prude , but i had no idea the mating rituals would start before i even got here .
at seven o 'clock this morning a rather flustered young woman was ushered to the head of my check-in queue at heathrow by a security officer .
" because you 're late ? " inquired the man whose place she had taken , " or because you 're good-looking ? "
" i think it 's a bit of both . "
yikes !
thursday 10 may 1400 local time -lrb- 1200 bst -rrb- tonight 's semi-finals are a big deal .
28 countries perform , but only 10 get through to the main event on saturday .
before i left , i caught up with paddy o 'connell , who presents the semi-finals on bbc three .
o 'connell hosts the bbc coverage of the semi-final from 2000bst he 's a passionate advocate for the eurovision , and says the contest is a stark reminder that europe is n't all about " men in suits and arguments over fish quotas " .
" europe is about the different clothes , the different food and the foreign girls and boys we fall in love with , " he says .

what i do know is that there are a breathtaking 42 acts vying for eurovision glory this year - and i 'm going to have to listen to all of them at least once .

the bbc 's mark savage has been reporting from helsinki on the atmosphere at one of the world 's biggest and most colourful music events .
sunday 13 may 1230 local time -lrb- 1030 bst -rrb- well , the eurovision carnival has wrapped up for another year .
dissections of last night 's performances took place over breakfast at the hotel , with the serbian delegation still delighted at their victory .
marija serifovic , a 23-year-old from serbia , was the eurovision winner others were in a more philosophical mood .
there was a brief moment of excitement as scooch appeared in full costume in the hotel lobby - but it turned out to be a finnair crew checking in after an early morning flight .
many eurovision veterans say the voting process needs to be refined next year , but no-one has a constructive alternative to the current system .
in the cold light of day , it 's clear that serbia picked up high scores from around europe - and probably would have won even if its balkan neighbours had n't lent a helping hand .
but , while marija serifovic embarks on a winner 's tour , the uk delegation is going home to lick its wounds - again .
it 's five years since we managed to break the top 10 , but jessica garlick 's third place success showed that the " big four " sponsors of the eurovision - france , germany , spain and the uk - can still make an impact .
perhaps a more traditional song can guide us to victory in belgrade next may .
sunday 13 may 0345 local time -lrb- 0145 bst -rrb- natalie has just got back from interviewing scooch , and they were n't downhearted at all .
here 's what they had to say .
russ : " we 're scooch - maltese favourites ! "
natalie : " we love malta !
and maltesers ! "
russ : " where are you going on holiday next year , caz ? "
caroline : " malta ! "
russ : " where are you going natalie ? "
natalie : " malta ! "
russ : " me too ! "
dour-faced serbian spoilsport marija serifovic was much more serious at the winner 's press conference - revealing how it was god 's plan for her to win , and praising voters for choosing songcraft over showbiz glamour .
perhaps she 's right .
maybe i 've been too harsh on the song .
but have you noticed that serbia has borders with more countries than any other nation in the eurovision ?
sunday 13 may 0110 local time -lrb- 2310 bst -rrb- oh dear .
for the life of me , i do not know who was voting for serbia and their bizarre liturgical dancing .
perhaps it was a clerical error .
bbc radio 1 's natalie jamieson has drawn the short straw and has to head off to interview scooch on behalf of the bbc .
they came joint second-last and i do n't envy her that job one little bit .
see you in belgrade next year .
saturday 12 may 2350 local time -lrb- 2150 bst -rrb- well , the acts have all strutted their stuff on the eurovision stage .
if the reaction in helsinki is anything to go by , ukraine are the clear winners .
we 'll find out in about half an hour .
saturday 12 may 2200 local time -lrb- 2000 bst -rrb- we 're all set - the bbc 's reporting and production team , from left to right , are : helen fawkes , paul henley , natalie jamieson , me , betty redondo and james earl .
here we go !
saturday 12 may 2130 local time -lrb- 1930 bst -rrb- well , it 's half an hour until the whole shebang kicks off .
bosnia-herzegovinan act maria will be singing nameless river i do n't want to spoil any surprises , but if you 're recording the programme to watch tomorrow , fast-forward through bosnia , macedonia and armenia .
you wo n't be missing anything you could n't recreate at home by putting your mum in a purple frock and telling her to shout " bananas " at the dog .
secretly , i 'm hoping scooch do well .
having met them several times over the last week , i 've been won over by their enthusiasm and , let 's be honest , their song .
but germany have got to win .
i put a tenner on them when the odds were 66/1 .
saturday 12 may 1945 local time -lrb- 1745 bst -rrb- here in the press centre , you 're never more than a minute away from a debate about who 's going to win eurovision .
" our song is catchy and it stands out , " say latvian act bonaparti.lv one name that keeps coming up is latvia 's six-piece tenor vocal group , bonaparti.lv.
in fact , several of my colleagues have just placed an obscenely large bet on them to win ...
as one of the 10 acts put through from thursday 's semi-final , bonaparti have been rehearsing their performance since last week , and they 're beginning to get bored .
gathered together for an interview , three of the singers feign sleep , letting " italian-born , latvian by choice " roberto miloni do most of the talking .
perhaps they are just reserving their energy for tonight 's showdown .
" it will be hard work but , like napoleon , we are generals , " says miloni .
" we ca n't be tired , we need to be ready " .
" our song is catchy and it stands out in relation to the others , " pipes up andreas abelite , recently voted latvia 's sexiest man by the country 's leading gay magazine .
" we simply go out on stage with a smile and the emotion of love .
there are no pyrotechnics , just the fire from our voices . "
saturday 12 may 1800 local time -lrb- 1600 bst -rrb- it 's not just eurovision which has got finland talking this weekend .
earlier today , the country went up against russia in the semi-finals of the ice hockey world cup .
fans have begun gathering to watch the show on big tv screens it was an important battle : moscow conquered the country in 1809 and ruled it for more than a century , engendering a fierce rivalry that exists to this day .
against the odds , finland won the match 2-1 , beating russia on home soil .
but the locals are n't expecting a double victory today .
the party line is that hanna pakarinen 's eurovision entry -lrb- leave me alone - a soft rock ballad performed , for no good reason , in a ballgown -rrb- is good enough to make the top 10 , but not strong enough to win .
nonetheless , finn fans have started to congregate on the steps of the city 's senate - where they can follow tonight 's contest on big screens dotted around the square .
" we simply had to come and sample the atmosphere , " one told me .
" after all , it could be another 45 years before we win again . "
saturday 12 may 1500 local time -lrb- 1300 bst -rrb- ukraine 's verka serduchka is hotly tipped to win tonight in helsinki .
verka serduchka has a special message for the uk the drag queen , played by comedian andriy danylkohas , has one of the more energetic stage routines , and has been driving the crowd crazy during dress rehearsals .
personally , i do n't see the attraction .
serduchka reminds me of nothing more than les dawson trying to sing gina g. anyway , one of my colleagues in bbc radio has spoken to the star , who wanted us to pass on the following message .
" hello england , i am verka serduchka .
i love you !
" elton john !
the beatles !
madonna ! "
no , me neither .
saturday 12 may 1200 local time -lrb- 1000 bst -rrb- for the past four months , ola melzig has devoted his life to the eurovision .
he 's the production manager for spectra stage event and technologies , which means he 's responsible for the lighting in the show and running the mammoth video wall which dominates this year 's set .
ola melzig has kept an online diary of his work for the show backstage in his office , he 's set up home with a sofa , a " sadly underused " ps3 and two , yes two , espresso machines .
" we 've been in helsinki for four weeks but i started travelling back and forth in january for pre-production , " the affable swede tells me .

the bbc 's mark savage has been reporting from helsinki on the atmosphere at one of the world 's biggest and most colourful music events .
sunday 13 may 1230 local time -lrb- 1030 bst -rrb- well , the eurovision carnival has wrapped up for another year .
dissections of last night 's performances took place over breakfast at the hotel , with the serbian delegation still delighted at their victory .
marija serifovic , a 23-year-old from serbia , was the eurovision winner others were in a more philosophical mood .
there was a brief moment of excitement as scooch appeared in full costume in the hotel lobby - but it turned out to be a finnair crew checking in after an early morning flight .
many eurovision veterans say the voting process needs to be refined next year , but no-one has a constructive alternative to the current system .
in the cold light of day , it 's clear that serbia picked up high scores from around europe - and probably would have won even if its balkan neighbours had n't lent a helping hand .
but , while marija serifovic embarks on a winner 's tour , the uk delegation is going home to lick its wounds - again .
it 's five years since we managed to break the top 10 , but jessica garlick 's third place success showed that the " big four " sponsors of the eurovision - france , germany , spain and the uk - can still make an impact .
perhaps a more traditional song can guide us to victory in belgrade next may .
sunday 13 may 0345 local time -lrb- 0145 bst -rrb- natalie has just got back from interviewing scooch , and they were n't downhearted at all .
here 's what they had to say .
russ : " we 're scooch - maltese favourites ! "
natalie : " we love malta !
and maltesers ! "
russ : " where are you going on holiday next year , caz ? "
caroline : " malta ! "
russ : " where are you going natalie ? "
natalie : " malta ! "
russ : " me too ! "
dour-faced serbian spoilsport marija serifovic was much more serious at the winner 's press conference - revealing how it was god 's plan for her to win , and praising voters for choosing songcraft over showbiz glamour .
perhaps she 's right .
maybe i 've been too harsh on the song .
but have you noticed that serbia has borders with more countries than any other nation in the eurovision ?
sunday 13 may 0110 local time -lrb- 2310 bst -rrb- oh dear .
for the life of me , i do not know who was voting for serbia and their bizarre liturgical dancing .
perhaps it was a clerical error .
bbc radio 1 's natalie jamieson has drawn the short straw and has to head off to interview scooch on behalf of the bbc .
they came joint second-last and i do n't envy her that job one little bit .
see you in belgrade next year .
saturday 12 may 2350 local time -lrb- 2150 bst -rrb- well , the acts have all strutted their stuff on the eurovision stage .
if the reaction in helsinki is anything to go by , ukraine are the clear winners .
we 'll find out in about half an hour .
saturday 12 may 2200 local time -lrb- 2000 bst -rrb- we 're all set - the bbc 's reporting and production team , from left to right , are : helen fawkes , paul henley , natalie jamieson , me , betty redondo and james earl .
here we go !
saturday 12 may 2130 local time -lrb- 1930 bst -rrb- well , it 's half an hour until the whole shebang kicks off .
bosnia-herzegovinan act maria will be singing nameless river i do n't want to spoil any surprises , but if you 're recording the programme to watch tomorrow , fast-forward through bosnia , macedonia and armenia .
you wo n't be missing anything you could n't recreate at home by putting your mum in a purple frock and telling her to shout " bananas " at the dog .
secretly , i 'm hoping scooch do well .
having met them several times over the last week , i 've been won over by their enthusiasm and , let 's be honest , their song .
but germany have got to win .
i put a tenner on them when the odds were 66/1 .
saturday 12 may 1945 local time -lrb- 1745 bst -rrb- here in the press centre , you 're never more than a minute away from a debate about who 's going to win eurovision .
" our song is catchy and it stands out , " say latvian act bonaparti.lv one name that keeps coming up is latvia 's six-piece tenor vocal group , bonaparti.lv.
in fact , several of my colleagues have just placed an obscenely large bet on them to win ...
as one of the 10 acts put through from thursday 's semi-final , bonaparti have been rehearsing their performance since last week , and they 're beginning to get bored .
gathered together for an interview , three of the singers feign sleep , letting " italian-born , latvian by choice " roberto miloni do most of the talking .
perhaps they are just reserving their energy for tonight 's showdown .
" it will be hard work but , like napoleon , we are generals , " says miloni .
" we ca n't be tired , we need to be ready " .
" our song is catchy and it stands out in relation to the others , " pipes up andreas abelite , recently voted latvia 's sexiest man by the country 's leading gay magazine .
" we simply go out on stage with a smile and the emotion of love .
there are no pyrotechnics , just the fire from our voices . "
saturday 12 may 1800 local time -lrb- 1600 bst -rrb- it 's not just eurovision which has got finland talking this weekend .
earlier today , the country went up against russia in the semi-finals of the ice hockey world cup .
fans have begun gathering to watch the show on big tv screens it was an important battle : moscow conquered the country in 1809 and ruled it for more than a century , engendering a fierce rivalry that exists to this day .
against the odds , finland won the match 2-1 , beating russia on home soil .
but the locals are n't expecting a double victory today .
the party line is that hanna pakarinen 's eurovision entry -lrb- leave me alone - a soft rock ballad performed , for no good reason , in a ballgown -rrb- is good enough to make the top 10 , but not strong enough to win .
nonetheless , finn fans have started to congregate on the steps of the city 's senate - where they can follow tonight 's contest on big screens dotted around the square .
" we simply had to come and sample the atmosphere , " one told me .
" after all , it could be another 45 years before we win again . "
saturday 12 may 1500 local time -lrb- 1300 bst -rrb- ukraine 's verka serduchka is hotly tipped to win tonight in helsinki .
verka serduchka has a special message for the uk the drag queen , played by comedian andriy danylkohas , has one of the more energetic stage routines , and has been driving the crowd crazy during dress rehearsals .
personally , i do n't see the attraction .
serduchka reminds me of nothing more than les dawson trying to sing gina g. anyway , one of my colleagues in bbc radio has spoken to the star , who wanted us to pass on the following message .
" hello england , i am verka serduchka .
i love you !
" elton john !
the beatles !
madonna ! "
no , me neither .
saturday 12 may 1200 local time -lrb- 1000 bst -rrb- for the past four months , ola melzig has devoted his life to the eurovision .
he 's the production manager for spectra stage event and technologies , which means he 's responsible for the lighting in the show and running the mammoth video wall which dominates this year 's set .
ola melzig has kept an online diary of his work for the show backstage in his office , he 's set up home with a sofa , a " sadly underused " ps3 and two , yes two , espresso machines .
" we 've been in helsinki for four weeks but i started travelling back and forth in january for pre-production , " the affable swede tells me .
throughout the process , melzig has kept an online diary -lrb- www.eurovisiondiary.com -rrb- which tells of the trials and tribulations of setting up such a massive show .
at the start of the week , things were still a bit hairy - as melzig discovered the underfoot video screens were generating too much heat .
this made the fog effects heat up , resulting in several acts being lost in a murky mist .
but , despite the occasional hiccup , he says " surprisingly little has gone wrong " .
" although one day the stage guys put a drum kit in the wrong place and a lighting rig landed on it and smashed it . "
with innumerable rehearsals and run-throughs , melzig is probably more familiar with the 42 eurovision songs than anyone , but he claims not to have a favourite .
" without noticing , you force yourself to love the songs because you 'd go mental if you did n't like them .
" but the ukraine is fantastic because it 's so fun , the uk is fantastic because it 's so gay , and i love finland because they 're so hardcore . "
friday 11 may 1900 local time -lrb- 1700bst -rrb- georgia 's representative , sopho , has just dropped by the press centre for a chat -lrb- she 's the one with the make-up , in case you 're having trouble distinguishing between us -rrb- .
at 20 years old , she 's the youngest singer in this year 's competition - but she sailed through the qualifying round to make it into the finals , despite the fact that georgia has never entered the competition before .
the bbc 's mark savage meets georgian singer sopho " i really appreciate all the support the european countries provided for me .
thank you for putting me through , " she told me through her interpreter .
" you should see what 's going on in georgia 's capital right now , " she tells me with wide eyes .
" thousands of people are on the street supporting me and this has very symbolic value .
" this is our future - it 's important that all of europe knows that our country is looking forward to getting united with all of europe . "
but i was n't interested in sopho 's messages of political harmony .
no , i wanted to know if she was worried about those dancers with the swords .
" i 'm not afraid at all !
they 're professional dancers and i trust that they 're not going to hurt me . "
so there you go .
friday 11 may 1630 local time -lrb- 1430 bst -rrb- our eurovision voting analyst did n't perform too well last night - only five of the 10 countries he predicted would get through to tomorrow 's final actually made the grade .
without the aid of a sophisticated computer model , i managed to guess six .
but derek gatherer 's analysis of eurovision voting trends still makes interesting reading .
he says 82 % of countries now engage in vote exchanges .
in fact , the only eurovision participants who can claim a clean slate are israel , switzerland , hungary and france .
" people are making a political point , " says gatherer , " and the practice has been steadily increasing since the introduction of phone voting in the mid-90s . "
the worst culprits are the countries that make up the so-called " balkan bloc " , which centres around croatia , serbia and fyr macedonia .
coincidentally , the latter two were both promoted to the final after last night 's phone vote .
but gatherer says the political votes are n't strong enough to influence the winning song .
" last year , finland were strongly backed by their friends , " he says , " but their act was very distinctive " .
" but the last time there was a winner who was n't part of a voting bloc was israel in 1998 . "
friday 11 may 1600 local time -lrb- 1400 bst -rrb- i 've just come back from the first full dress rehearsal for saturday 's big eurovision showdown , and the atmosphere was electric .
scooch are facing an uphill battle to win over the crowd unlike last night 's semi-final , the hartwall arena was packed to the rafters , and the crowd were dancing around like sandy shaw 's proverbial puppet on a string .
the best reactions were reserved for sweden 's glam rock dandies , the ark and ukraine 's grotesque drag queen verka seduchka .
unfortunately , the crowd sat still , arms folded and scowls painted across their faces during scooch 's routine .
one of the uk fans who 's travelled over to helsinki texted me as the band traipsed off stage : " kill me now " .
what have we done to anger the rest of europe so ?
for the last couple of years we 've put our poor performances down to the war in iraq , but tony blair resigned yesterday and it still is n't good enough .
maybe next year we should write a song called " look , we 're really quite sorry about all that stuff we did " and see if that sorts things out .
friday 11 may 0900 local time -lrb- 0700 bst -rrb- the semi-finals gave everyone a taste of the big day after the excitement of last night 's semi-final , i managed to have a look through some of the e-mails you 've been sending .
mark campbell-howes wrote : " i 'm travelling to helsinki tomorrow for the weekend but i have n't managed to secure tickets for the main event .
" do you know if there are there any plans to show the contest on big screens in the city centre ? "
yes , mark , there are .
helsinki 's senate square is playing host to a huge screen filled with eurovision broadcasts .
some of finland 's top acts will also be playing on stage in the square .
meanwhile , ken edwards has written in to suggest i visit the storyville jazz bar in downtown helsinki when i need a break from all this europop .
thanks ken !
i expect to be there in , oooh , five or 10 minutes .
keep the e-mails coming - just use the form at the bottom of this page !
thursday 10 may 2100 local time -lrb- 1900 bst -rrb- rehearsals have been held at the arena since 3 may i 'm about to go to the helsinki hartwall arena to watch the semi-finals .
to many fans , this is as important as the main event - and the ticket prices reflect it .
it costs 130 euros -lrb- about £ 88 -rrb- to get a seat for the three-hour extravaganza .
one person who 'll be paying close attention is academic derek gatherer .
for the past couple of years , he 's been studying eurovision voting patterns , and says the semi-finals are the place where block voting has the biggest influence .
derek has used a computer model to predict the ten acts who will make it through from tonight 's contest to saturday 's final .
if you 're watching the proceedings on bbc three , here 's what to expect : latvia - bonaparti.lv albania - frederik ndoci croatia - dragonfly featuring dado topic denmark - dq hungary - magdi ruzsa malta - olivia lewis moldova - natalia barbu norway - guri schanke serbia - marija serifovic turkey - kenan dogulu i 'll speak to derek again after tonight 's contest - and tell you a little bit more about his views on how certain countries affect the results by voting for their neighbours .
thursday 10 may 1445 local time -lrb- 1245 bst -rrb- " you 're from england ? " inquired my taxi driver on the way from helsinki 's vantaa airport .
" your song is a joke . "
i do hope this does n't become a regular conversational gambit ...
for now , i 've decided to hide away from any other potential eurocritics by hanging out in the press centre at the hartwall arena .
i 'm actually a bit late to the party - rehearsals started seven days ago and reporters from the more fervent eurovision nations have been following the proceedings ever since .
the media representatives all hard at work in all , there are about 1,600 media representatives here in helsinki , and many of them are sitting around the hall on beanbags , sipping coffee and watching the dress rehearsals for tonight 's semi-final .
after every song a small but enthusiastic cheer erupts from a different corner of the room .
do n't they have work to do ?
as an aside - several seasoned euro hacks warned me that the eurovision attracts a fair share of fans in search of " someone to spend the weekend with " .
i 'm no prude , but i had no idea the mating rituals would start before i even got here .
at seven o 'clock this morning a rather flustered young woman was ushered to the head of my check-in queue at heathrow by a security officer .
" because you 're late ? " inquired the man whose place she had taken , " or because you 're good-looking ? "
" i think it 's a bit of both . "
yikes !
thursday 10 may 1400 local time -lrb- 1200 bst -rrb- tonight 's semi-finals are a big deal .
28 countries perform , but only 10 get through to the main event on saturday .
before i left , i caught up with paddy o 'connell , who presents the semi-finals on bbc three .
o 'connell hosts the bbc coverage of the semi-final from 2000bst he 's a passionate advocate for the eurovision , and says the contest is a stark reminder that europe is n't all about " men in suits and arguments over fish quotas " .
" europe is about the different clothes , the different food and the foreign girls and boys we fall in love with , " he says .
" it 's hotter , it 's colder , it 's a vibrant continent .
" for me , eurovision is a relief from wanging on about european food mountains and everything else .
" it 's probably not a true representation of europe either - it 's sort of about women in big dresses and suspect drag acts in sequins .
" but there are british people who can sing all the songs in swedish .
it belies everything we 're told about the language barrier . "
thursday 10 may 0800 local time -lrb- 0600 bst -rrb- as i sit waiting for the taxi to take me to heathrow , i 'm contemplating what 's in store once i reach helsinki .
all the eurovision veterans i 've spoken to tell me the event is " a unique experience " but i do n't know why they keep twitching like that .
what i do know is that there are a breathtaking 42 acts vying for eurovision glory this year - and i 'm going to have to listen to all of them at least once .
my ipod is stuffed full of the entries , and early favourites include georgia -lrb- like bjork with a more outlandish dress sense -rrb- and sweden -lrb- t-rex by way of the rocky horror picture show -rrb- .
but that could all change before saturday 's final .
along the way , i 'll be interviewing both the hopefuls and the hopeless - and -lrb- fingers crossed -rrb- spending some time in the commentary booth with sir terry wogan .
if you 've got any burning questions you want answered , or any eurovision recommendations , drop me a line using the form below .

he 's the production manager for spectra stage event and technologies , which means he 's responsible for the lighting in the show and running the mammoth video wall which dominates this year 's set .
ola melzig has kept an online diary of his work for the show backstage in his office , he 's set up home with a sofa , a " sadly underused " ps3 and two , yes two , espresso machines .
" we 've been in helsinki for four weeks but i started travelling back and forth in january for pre-production , " the affable swede tells me .
throughout the process , melzig has kept an online diary -lrb- www.eurovisiondiary.com -rrb- which tells of the trials and tribulations of setting up such a massive show .
at the start of the week , things were still a bit hairy - as melzig discovered the underfoot video screens were generating too much heat .
this made the fog effects heat up , resulting in several acts being lost in a murky mist .
but , despite the occasional hiccup , he says " surprisingly little has gone wrong " .
" although one day the stage guys put a drum kit in the wrong place and a lighting rig landed on it and smashed it . "
with innumerable rehearsals and run-throughs , melzig is probably more familiar with the 42 eurovision songs than anyone , but he claims not to have a favourite .
" without noticing , you force yourself to love the songs because you 'd go mental if you did n't like them .
" but the ukraine is fantastic because it 's so fun , the uk is fantastic because it 's so gay , and i love finland because they 're so hardcore . "
friday 11 may 1900 local time -lrb- 1700bst -rrb- georgia 's representative , sopho , has just dropped by the press centre for a chat -lrb- she 's the one with the make-up , in case you 're having trouble distinguishing between us -rrb- .
at 20 years old , she 's the youngest singer in this year 's competition - but she sailed through the qualifying round to make it into the finals , despite the fact that georgia has never entered the competition before .
the bbc 's mark savage meets georgian singer sopho " i really appreciate all the support the european countries provided for me .
thank you for putting me through , " she told me through her interpreter .
" you should see what 's going on in georgia 's capital right now , " she tells me with wide eyes .
" thousands of people are on the street supporting me and this has very symbolic value .
" this is our future - it 's important that all of europe knows that our country is looking forward to getting united with all of europe . "
but i was n't interested in sopho 's messages of political harmony .
no , i wanted to know if she was worried about those dancers with the swords .
" i 'm not afraid at all !
they 're professional dancers and i trust that they 're not going to hurt me . "
so there you go .
friday 11 may 1630 local time -lrb- 1430 bst -rrb- our eurovision voting analyst did n't perform too well last night - only five of the 10 countries he predicted would get through to tomorrow 's final actually made the grade .
without the aid of a sophisticated computer model , i managed to guess six .
but derek gatherer 's analysis of eurovision voting trends still makes interesting reading .
he says 82 % of countries now engage in vote exchanges .
in fact , the only eurovision participants who can claim a clean slate are israel , switzerland , hungary and france .
" people are making a political point , " says gatherer , " and the practice has been steadily increasing since the introduction of phone voting in the mid-90s . "
the worst culprits are the countries that make up the so-called " balkan bloc " , which centres around croatia , serbia and fyr macedonia .
coincidentally , the latter two were both promoted to the final after last night 's phone vote .
but gatherer says the political votes are n't strong enough to influence the winning song .
" last year , finland were strongly backed by their friends , " he says , " but their act was very distinctive " .
" but the last time there was a winner who was n't part of a voting bloc was israel in 1998 . "
friday 11 may 1600 local time -lrb- 1400 bst -rrb- i 've just come back from the first full dress rehearsal for saturday 's big eurovision showdown , and the atmosphere was electric .
scooch are facing an uphill battle to win over the crowd unlike last night 's semi-final , the hartwall arena was packed to the rafters , and the crowd were dancing around like sandy shaw 's proverbial puppet on a string .
the best reactions were reserved for sweden 's glam rock dandies , the ark and ukraine 's grotesque drag queen verka seduchka .
unfortunately , the crowd sat still , arms folded and scowls painted across their faces during scooch 's routine .
one of the uk fans who 's travelled over to helsinki texted me as the band traipsed off stage : " kill me now " .
what have we done to anger the rest of europe so ?
for the last couple of years we 've put our poor performances down to the war in iraq , but tony blair resigned yesterday and it still is n't good enough .
maybe next year we should write a song called " look , we 're really quite sorry about all that stuff we did " and see if that sorts things out .
friday 11 may 0900 local time -lrb- 0700 bst -rrb- the semi-finals gave everyone a taste of the big day after the excitement of last night 's semi-final , i managed to have a look through some of the e-mails you 've been sending .
mark campbell-howes wrote : " i 'm travelling to helsinki tomorrow for the weekend but i have n't managed to secure tickets for the main event .
" do you know if there are there any plans to show the contest on big screens in the city centre ? "
yes , mark , there are .
helsinki 's senate square is playing host to a huge screen filled with eurovision broadcasts .
some of finland 's top acts will also be playing on stage in the square .
meanwhile , ken edwards has written in to suggest i visit the storyville jazz bar in downtown helsinki when i need a break from all this europop .
thanks ken !
i expect to be there in , oooh , five or 10 minutes .
keep the e-mails coming - just use the form at the bottom of this page !
thursday 10 may 2100 local time -lrb- 1900 bst -rrb- rehearsals have been held at the arena since 3 may i 'm about to go to the helsinki hartwall arena to watch the semi-finals .
to many fans , this is as important as the main event - and the ticket prices reflect it .
it costs 130 euros -lrb- about £ 88 -rrb- to get a seat for the three-hour extravaganza .
one person who 'll be paying close attention is academic derek gatherer .
for the past couple of years , he 's been studying eurovision voting patterns , and says the semi-finals are the place where block voting has the biggest influence .
derek has used a computer model to predict the ten acts who will make it through from tonight 's contest to saturday 's final .
if you 're watching the proceedings on bbc three , here 's what to expect : latvia - bonaparti.lv albania - frederik ndoci croatia - dragonfly featuring dado topic denmark - dq hungary - magdi ruzsa malta - olivia lewis moldova - natalia barbu norway - guri schanke serbia - marija serifovic turkey - kenan dogulu i 'll speak to derek again after tonight 's contest - and tell you a little bit more about his views on how certain countries affect the results by voting for their neighbours .
thursday 10 may 1445 local time -lrb- 1245 bst -rrb- " you 're from england ? " inquired my taxi driver on the way from helsinki 's vantaa airport .
" your song is a joke . "
i do hope this does n't become a regular conversational gambit ...
for now , i 've decided to hide away from any other potential eurocritics by hanging out in the press centre at the hartwall arena .
i 'm actually a bit late to the party - rehearsals started seven days ago and reporters from the more fervent eurovision nations have been following the proceedings ever since .
the media representatives all hard at work in all , there are about 1,600 media representatives here in helsinki , and many of them are sitting around the hall on beanbags , sipping coffee and watching the dress rehearsals for tonight 's semi-final .
after every song a small but enthusiastic cheer erupts from a different corner of the room .
do n't they have work to do ?
as an aside - several seasoned euro hacks warned me that the eurovision attracts a fair share of fans in search of " someone to spend the weekend with " .
i 'm no prude , but i had no idea the mating rituals would start before i even got here .
at seven o 'clock this morning a rather flustered young woman was ushered to the head of my check-in queue at heathrow by a security officer .
" because you 're late ? " inquired the man whose place she had taken , " or because you 're good-looking ? "
" i think it 's a bit of both . "
yikes !
thursday 10 may 1400 local time -lrb- 1200 bst -rrb- tonight 's semi-finals are a big deal .
28 countries perform , but only 10 get through to the main event on saturday .
before i left , i caught up with paddy o 'connell , who presents the semi-finals on bbc three .
o 'connell hosts the bbc coverage of the semi-final from 2000bst he 's a passionate advocate for the eurovision , and says the contest is a stark reminder that europe is n't all about " men in suits and arguments over fish quotas " .
" europe is about the different clothes , the different food and the foreign girls and boys we fall in love with , " he says .
" it 's hotter , it 's colder , it 's a vibrant continent .
" for me , eurovision is a relief from wanging on about european food mountains and everything else .
" it 's probably not a true representation of europe either - it 's sort of about women in big dresses and suspect drag acts in sequins .
" but there are british people who can sing all the songs in swedish .
it belies everything we 're told about the language barrier . "
thursday 10 may 0800 local time -lrb- 0600 bst -rrb- as i sit waiting for the taxi to take me to heathrow , i 'm contemplating what 's in store once i reach helsinki .
all the eurovision veterans i 've spoken to tell me the event is " a unique experience " but i do n't know why they keep twitching like that .
what i do know is that there are a breathtaking 42 acts vying for eurovision glory this year - and i 'm going to have to listen to all of them at least once .
my ipod is stuffed full of the entries , and early favourites include georgia -lrb- like bjork with a more outlandish dress sense -rrb- and sweden -lrb- t-rex by way of the rocky horror picture show -rrb- .
but that could all change before saturday 's final .
along the way , i 'll be interviewing both the hopefuls and the hopeless - and -lrb- fingers crossed -rrb- spending some time in the commentary booth with sir terry wogan .
if you 've got any burning questions you want answered , or any eurovision recommendations , drop me a line using the form below .
see you in helsinki !

the bbc 's mark savage has been reporting from helsinki on the atmosphere at one of the world 's biggest and most colourful music events .
sunday 13 may 1230 local time -lrb- 1030 bst -rrb- well , the eurovision carnival has wrapped up for another year .
dissections of last night 's performances took place over breakfast at the hotel , with the serbian delegation still delighted at their victory .
marija serifovic , a 23-year-old from serbia , was the eurovision winner others were in a more philosophical mood .
there was a brief moment of excitement as scooch appeared in full costume in the hotel lobby - but it turned out to be a finnair crew checking in after an early morning flight .
many eurovision veterans say the voting process needs to be refined next year , but no-one has a constructive alternative to the current system .
in the cold light of day , it 's clear that serbia picked up high scores from around europe - and probably would have won even if its balkan neighbours had n't lent a helping hand .
but , while marija serifovic embarks on a winner 's tour , the uk delegation is going home to lick its wounds - again .
it 's five years since we managed to break the top 10 , but jessica garlick 's third place success showed that the " big four " sponsors of the eurovision - france , germany , spain and the uk - can still make an impact .
perhaps a more traditional song can guide us to victory in belgrade next may .
sunday 13 may 0345 local time -lrb- 0145 bst -rrb- natalie has just got back from interviewing scooch , and they were n't downhearted at all .
here 's what they had to say .
russ : " we 're scooch - maltese favourites ! "
natalie : " we love malta !
and maltesers ! "
russ : " where are you going on holiday next year , caz ? "
caroline : " malta ! "
russ : " where are you going natalie ? "
natalie : " malta ! "
russ : " me too ! "
dour-faced serbian spoilsport marija serifovic was much more serious at the winner 's press conference - revealing how it was god 's plan for her to win , and praising voters for choosing songcraft over showbiz glamour .
perhaps she 's right .
maybe i 've been too harsh on the song .
but have you noticed that serbia has borders with more countries than any other nation in the eurovision ?
sunday 13 may 0110 local time -lrb- 2310 bst -rrb- oh dear .
for the life of me , i do not know who was voting for serbia and their bizarre liturgical dancing .
perhaps it was a clerical error .
bbc radio 1 's natalie jamieson has drawn the short straw and has to head off to interview scooch on behalf of the bbc .
they came joint second-last and i do n't envy her that job one little bit .
see you in belgrade next year .
saturday 12 may 2350 local time -lrb- 2150 bst -rrb- well , the acts have all strutted their stuff on the eurovision stage .
if the reaction in helsinki is anything to go by , ukraine are the clear winners .
we 'll find out in about half an hour .
saturday 12 may 2200 local time -lrb- 2000 bst -rrb- we 're all set - the bbc 's reporting and production team , from left to right , are : helen fawkes , paul henley , natalie jamieson , me , betty redondo and james earl .
here we go !
saturday 12 may 2130 local time -lrb- 1930 bst -rrb- well , it 's half an hour until the whole shebang kicks off .
bosnia-herzegovinan act maria will be singing nameless river i do n't want to spoil any surprises , but if you 're recording the programme to watch tomorrow , fast-forward through bosnia , macedonia and armenia .
you wo n't be missing anything you could n't recreate at home by putting your mum in a purple frock and telling her to shout " bananas " at the dog .
secretly , i 'm hoping scooch do well .
having met them several times over the last week , i 've been won over by their enthusiasm and , let 's be honest , their song .
but germany have got to win .
i put a tenner on them when the odds were 66/1 .
saturday 12 may 1945 local time -lrb- 1745 bst -rrb- here in the press centre , you 're never more than a minute away from a debate about who 's going to win eurovision .
" our song is catchy and it stands out , " say latvian act bonaparti.lv one name that keeps coming up is latvia 's six-piece tenor vocal group , bonaparti.lv.
in fact , several of my colleagues have just placed an obscenely large bet on them to win ...
as one of the 10 acts put through from thursday 's semi-final , bonaparti have been rehearsing their performance since last week , and they 're beginning to get bored .
gathered together for an interview , three of the singers feign sleep , letting " italian-born , latvian by choice " roberto miloni do most of the talking .
perhaps they are just reserving their energy for tonight 's showdown .
" it will be hard work but , like napoleon , we are generals , " says miloni .
" we ca n't be tired , we need to be ready " .
" our song is catchy and it stands out in relation to the others , " pipes up andreas abelite , recently voted latvia 's sexiest man by the country 's leading gay magazine .
" we simply go out on stage with a smile and the emotion of love .
there are no pyrotechnics , just the fire from our voices . "
saturday 12 may 1800 local time -lrb- 1600 bst -rrb- it 's not just eurovision which has got finland talking this weekend .
earlier today , the country went up against russia in the semi-finals of the ice hockey world cup .
fans have begun gathering to watch the show on big tv screens it was an important battle : moscow conquered the country in 1809 and ruled it for more than a century , engendering a fierce rivalry that exists to this day .
against the odds , finland won the match 2-1 , beating russia on home soil .
but the locals are n't expecting a double victory today .
the party line is that hanna pakarinen 's eurovision entry -lrb- leave me alone - a soft rock ballad performed , for no good reason , in a ballgown -rrb- is good enough to make the top 10 , but not strong enough to win .
nonetheless , finn fans have started to congregate on the steps of the city 's senate - where they can follow tonight 's contest on big screens dotted around the square .
" we simply had to come and sample the atmosphere , " one told me .
" after all , it could be another 45 years before we win again . "
saturday 12 may 1500 local time -lrb- 1300 bst -rrb- ukraine 's verka serduchka is hotly tipped to win tonight in helsinki .
verka serduchka has a special message for the uk the drag queen , played by comedian andriy danylkohas , has one of the more energetic stage routines , and has been driving the crowd crazy during dress rehearsals .
personally , i do n't see the attraction .
serduchka reminds me of nothing more than les dawson trying to sing gina g. anyway , one of my colleagues in bbc radio has spoken to the star , who wanted us to pass on the following message .
" hello england , i am verka serduchka .
i love you !
" elton john !
the beatles !
madonna ! "
no , me neither .
saturday 12 may 1200 local time -lrb- 1000 bst -rrb- for the past four months , ola melzig has devoted his life to the eurovision .

scooch are facing an uphill battle to win over the crowd unlike last night 's semi-final , the hartwall arena was packed to the rafters , and the crowd were dancing around like sandy shaw 's proverbial puppet on a string .

the bbc 's mark savage has been reporting from helsinki on the atmosphere at one of the world 's biggest and most colourful music events .
sunday 13 may 1230 local time -lrb- 1030 bst -rrb- well , the eurovision carnival has wrapped up for another year .
dissections of last night 's performances took place over breakfast at the hotel , with the serbian delegation still delighted at their victory .
marija serifovic , a 23-year-old from serbia , was the eurovision winner others were in a more philosophical mood .
there was a brief moment of excitement as scooch appeared in full costume in the hotel lobby - but it turned out to be a finnair crew checking in after an early morning flight .
many eurovision veterans say the voting process needs to be refined next year , but no-one has a constructive alternative to the current system .
in the cold light of day , it 's clear that serbia picked up high scores from around europe - and probably would have won even if its balkan neighbours had n't lent a helping hand .
but , while marija serifovic embarks on a winner 's tour , the uk delegation is going home to lick its wounds - again .
it 's five years since we managed to break the top 10 , but jessica garlick 's third place success showed that the " big four " sponsors of the eurovision - france , germany , spain and the uk - can still make an impact .
perhaps a more traditional song can guide us to victory in belgrade next may .
sunday 13 may 0345 local time -lrb- 0145 bst -rrb- natalie has just got back from interviewing scooch , and they were n't downhearted at all .
here 's what they had to say .
russ : " we 're scooch - maltese favourites ! "
natalie : " we love malta !
and maltesers ! "
russ : " where are you going on holiday next year , caz ? "
caroline : " malta ! "
russ : " where are you going natalie ? "
natalie : " malta ! "
russ : " me too ! "
dour-faced serbian spoilsport marija serifovic was much more serious at the winner 's press conference - revealing how it was god 's plan for her to win , and praising voters for choosing songcraft over showbiz glamour .
perhaps she 's right .
maybe i 've been too harsh on the song .
but have you noticed that serbia has borders with more countries than any other nation in the eurovision ?
sunday 13 may 0110 local time -lrb- 2310 bst -rrb- oh dear .
for the life of me , i do not know who was voting for serbia and their bizarre liturgical dancing .
perhaps it was a clerical error .
bbc radio 1 's natalie jamieson has drawn the short straw and has to head off to interview scooch on behalf of the bbc .
they came joint second-last and i do n't envy her that job one little bit .
see you in belgrade next year .
saturday 12 may 2350 local time -lrb- 2150 bst -rrb- well , the acts have all strutted their stuff on the eurovision stage .
if the reaction in helsinki is anything to go by , ukraine are the clear winners .
we 'll find out in about half an hour .
saturday 12 may 2200 local time -lrb- 2000 bst -rrb- we 're all set - the bbc 's reporting and production team , from left to right , are : helen fawkes , paul henley , natalie jamieson , me , betty redondo and james earl .
here we go !
saturday 12 may 2130 local time -lrb- 1930 bst -rrb- well , it 's half an hour until the whole shebang kicks off .
bosnia-herzegovinan act maria will be singing nameless river i do n't want to spoil any surprises , but if you 're recording the programme to watch tomorrow , fast-forward through bosnia , macedonia and armenia .
you wo n't be missing anything you could n't recreate at home by putting your mum in a purple frock and telling her to shout " bananas " at the dog .
secretly , i 'm hoping scooch do well .
having met them several times over the last week , i 've been won over by their enthusiasm and , let 's be honest , their song .
but germany have got to win .
i put a tenner on them when the odds were 66/1 .
saturday 12 may 1945 local time -lrb- 1745 bst -rrb- here in the press centre , you 're never more than a minute away from a debate about who 's going to win eurovision .
" our song is catchy and it stands out , " say latvian act bonaparti.lv one name that keeps coming up is latvia 's six-piece tenor vocal group , bonaparti.lv.
in fact , several of my colleagues have just placed an obscenely large bet on them to win ...
as one of the 10 acts put through from thursday 's semi-final , bonaparti have been rehearsing their performance since last week , and they 're beginning to get bored .
gathered together for an interview , three of the singers feign sleep , letting " italian-born , latvian by choice " roberto miloni do most of the talking .
perhaps they are just reserving their energy for tonight 's showdown .
" it will be hard work but , like napoleon , we are generals , " says miloni .
" we ca n't be tired , we need to be ready " .
" our song is catchy and it stands out in relation to the others , " pipes up andreas abelite , recently voted latvia 's sexiest man by the country 's leading gay magazine .
" we simply go out on stage with a smile and the emotion of love .
there are no pyrotechnics , just the fire from our voices . "
saturday 12 may 1800 local time -lrb- 1600 bst -rrb- it 's not just eurovision which has got finland talking this weekend .
earlier today , the country went up against russia in the semi-finals of the ice hockey world cup .
fans have begun gathering to watch the show on big tv screens it was an important battle : moscow conquered the country in 1809 and ruled it for more than a century , engendering a fierce rivalry that exists to this day .
against the odds , finland won the match 2-1 , beating russia on home soil .
but the locals are n't expecting a double victory today .
the party line is that hanna pakarinen 's eurovision entry -lrb- leave me alone - a soft rock ballad performed , for no good reason , in a ballgown -rrb- is good enough to make the top 10 , but not strong enough to win .
nonetheless , finn fans have started to congregate on the steps of the city 's senate - where they can follow tonight 's contest on big screens dotted around the square .
" we simply had to come and sample the atmosphere , " one told me .
" after all , it could be another 45 years before we win again . "
saturday 12 may 1500 local time -lrb- 1300 bst -rrb- ukraine 's verka serduchka is hotly tipped to win tonight in helsinki .
verka serduchka has a special message for the uk the drag queen , played by comedian andriy danylkohas , has one of the more energetic stage routines , and has been driving the crowd crazy during dress rehearsals .
personally , i do n't see the attraction .
serduchka reminds me of nothing more than les dawson trying to sing gina g. anyway , one of my colleagues in bbc radio has spoken to the star , who wanted us to pass on the following message .
" hello england , i am verka serduchka .
i love you !
" elton john !
the beatles !
madonna ! "
no , me neither .
saturday 12 may 1200 local time -lrb- 1000 bst -rrb- for the past four months , ola melzig has devoted his life to the eurovision .
he 's the production manager for spectra stage event and technologies , which means he 's responsible for the lighting in the show and running the mammoth video wall which dominates this year 's set .
ola melzig has kept an online diary of his work for the show backstage in his office , he 's set up home with a sofa , a " sadly underused " ps3 and two , yes two , espresso machines .
" we 've been in helsinki for four weeks but i started travelling back and forth in january for pre-production , " the affable swede tells me .
throughout the process , melzig has kept an online diary -lrb- www.eurovisiondiary.com -rrb- which tells of the trials and tribulations of setting up such a massive show .
at the start of the week , things were still a bit hairy - as melzig discovered the underfoot video screens were generating too much heat .
this made the fog effects heat up , resulting in several acts being lost in a murky mist .
but , despite the occasional hiccup , he says " surprisingly little has gone wrong " .
" although one day the stage guys put a drum kit in the wrong place and a lighting rig landed on it and smashed it . "
with innumerable rehearsals and run-throughs , melzig is probably more familiar with the 42 eurovision songs than anyone , but he claims not to have a favourite .
" without noticing , you force yourself to love the songs because you 'd go mental if you did n't like them .
" but the ukraine is fantastic because it 's so fun , the uk is fantastic because it 's so gay , and i love finland because they 're so hardcore . "
friday 11 may 1900 local time -lrb- 1700bst -rrb- georgia 's representative , sopho , has just dropped by the press centre for a chat -lrb- she 's the one with the make-up , in case you 're having trouble distinguishing between us -rrb- .
at 20 years old , she 's the youngest singer in this year 's competition - but she sailed through the qualifying round to make it into the finals , despite the fact that georgia has never entered the competition before .
the bbc 's mark savage meets georgian singer sopho " i really appreciate all the support the european countries provided for me .
thank you for putting me through , " she told me through her interpreter .
" you should see what 's going on in georgia 's capital right now , " she tells me with wide eyes .
" thousands of people are on the street supporting me and this has very symbolic value .
" this is our future - it 's important that all of europe knows that our country is looking forward to getting united with all of europe . "
but i was n't interested in sopho 's messages of political harmony .
no , i wanted to know if she was worried about those dancers with the swords .
" i 'm not afraid at all !
they 're professional dancers and i trust that they 're not going to hurt me . "
so there you go .
friday 11 may 1630 local time -lrb- 1430 bst -rrb- our eurovision voting analyst did n't perform too well last night - only five of the 10 countries he predicted would get through to tomorrow 's final actually made the grade .
without the aid of a sophisticated computer model , i managed to guess six .
but derek gatherer 's analysis of eurovision voting trends still makes interesting reading .
he says 82 % of countries now engage in vote exchanges .
in fact , the only eurovision participants who can claim a clean slate are israel , switzerland , hungary and france .
" people are making a political point , " says gatherer , " and the practice has been steadily increasing since the introduction of phone voting in the mid-90s . "
the worst culprits are the countries that make up the so-called " balkan bloc " , which centres around croatia , serbia and fyr macedonia .
coincidentally , the latter two were both promoted to the final after last night 's phone vote .
but gatherer says the political votes are n't strong enough to influence the winning song .
" last year , finland were strongly backed by their friends , " he says , " but their act was very distinctive " .
" but the last time there was a winner who was n't part of a voting bloc was israel in 1998 . "
friday 11 may 1600 local time -lrb- 1400 bst -rrb- i 've just come back from the first full dress rehearsal for saturday 's big eurovision showdown , and the atmosphere was electric .
scooch are facing an uphill battle to win over the crowd unlike last night 's semi-final , the hartwall arena was packed to the rafters , and the crowd were dancing around like sandy shaw 's proverbial puppet on a string .
the best reactions were reserved for sweden 's glam rock dandies , the ark and ukraine 's grotesque drag queen verka seduchka .
unfortunately , the crowd sat still , arms folded and scowls painted across their faces during scooch 's routine .
one of the uk fans who 's travelled over to helsinki texted me as the band traipsed off stage : " kill me now " .
what have we done to anger the rest of europe so ?
for the last couple of years we 've put our poor performances down to the war in iraq , but tony blair resigned yesterday and it still is n't good enough .
maybe next year we should write a song called " look , we 're really quite sorry about all that stuff we did " and see if that sorts things out .
friday 11 may 0900 local time -lrb- 0700 bst -rrb- the semi-finals gave everyone a taste of the big day after the excitement of last night 's semi-final , i managed to have a look through some of the e-mails you 've been sending .
mark campbell-howes wrote : " i 'm travelling to helsinki tomorrow for the weekend but i have n't managed to secure tickets for the main event .
" do you know if there are there any plans to show the contest on big screens in the city centre ? "
yes , mark , there are .
helsinki 's senate square is playing host to a huge screen filled with eurovision broadcasts .
some of finland 's top acts will also be playing on stage in the square .
meanwhile , ken edwards has written in to suggest i visit the storyville jazz bar in downtown helsinki when i need a break from all this europop .
thanks ken !
i expect to be there in , oooh , five or 10 minutes .
keep the e-mails coming - just use the form at the bottom of this page !
thursday 10 may 2100 local time -lrb- 1900 bst -rrb- rehearsals have been held at the arena since 3 may i 'm about to go to the helsinki hartwall arena to watch the semi-finals .
to many fans , this is as important as the main event - and the ticket prices reflect it .
it costs 130 euros -lrb- about £ 88 -rrb- to get a seat for the three-hour extravaganza .
one person who 'll be paying close attention is academic derek gatherer .
for the past couple of years , he 's been studying eurovision voting patterns , and says the semi-finals are the place where block voting has the biggest influence .
derek has used a computer model to predict the ten acts who will make it through from tonight 's contest to saturday 's final .
if you 're watching the proceedings on bbc three , here 's what to expect : latvia - bonaparti.lv albania - frederik ndoci croatia - dragonfly featuring dado topic denmark - dq hungary - magdi ruzsa malta - olivia lewis moldova - natalia barbu norway - guri schanke serbia - marija serifovic turkey - kenan dogulu i 'll speak to derek again after tonight 's contest - and tell you a little bit more about his views on how certain countries affect the results by voting for their neighbours .
thursday 10 may 1445 local time -lrb- 1245 bst -rrb- " you 're from england ? " inquired my taxi driver on the way from helsinki 's vantaa airport .
" your song is a joke . "
i do hope this does n't become a regular conversational gambit ...
for now , i 've decided to hide away from any other potential eurocritics by hanging out in the press centre at the hartwall arena .
i 'm actually a bit late to the party - rehearsals started seven days ago and reporters from the more fervent eurovision nations have been following the proceedings ever since .
the media representatives all hard at work in all , there are about 1,600 media representatives here in helsinki , and many of them are sitting around the hall on beanbags , sipping coffee and watching the dress rehearsals for tonight 's semi-final .
after every song a small but enthusiastic cheer erupts from a different corner of the room .
do n't they have work to do ?
as an aside - several seasoned euro hacks warned me that the eurovision attracts a fair share of fans in search of " someone to spend the weekend with " .
i 'm no prude , but i had no idea the mating rituals would start before i even got here .
at seven o 'clock this morning a rather flustered young woman was ushered to the head of my check-in queue at heathrow by a security officer .
" because you 're late ? " inquired the man whose place she had taken , " or because you 're good-looking ? "
" i think it 's a bit of both . "
yikes !
thursday 10 may 1400 local time -lrb- 1200 bst -rrb- tonight 's semi-finals are a big deal .
28 countries perform , but only 10 get through to the main event on saturday .
before i left , i caught up with paddy o 'connell , who presents the semi-finals on bbc three .
o 'connell hosts the bbc coverage of the semi-final from 2000bst he 's a passionate advocate for the eurovision , and says the contest is a stark reminder that europe is n't all about " men in suits and arguments over fish quotas " .
" europe is about the different clothes , the different food and the foreign girls and boys we fall in love with , " he says .
" it 's hotter , it 's colder , it 's a vibrant continent .
" for me , eurovision is a relief from wanging on about european food mountains and everything else .
" it 's probably not a true representation of europe either - it 's sort of about women in big dresses and suspect drag acts in sequins .
" but there are british people who can sing all the songs in swedish .
it belies everything we 're told about the language barrier . "
thursday 10 may 0800 local time -lrb- 0600 bst -rrb- as i sit waiting for the taxi to take me to heathrow , i 'm contemplating what 's in store once i reach helsinki .
all the eurovision veterans i 've spoken to tell me the event is " a unique experience " but i do n't know why they keep twitching like that .
what i do know is that there are a breathtaking 42 acts vying for eurovision glory this year - and i 'm going to have to listen to all of them at least once .
my ipod is stuffed full of the entries , and early favourites include georgia -lrb- like bjork with a more outlandish dress sense -rrb- and sweden -lrb- t-rex by way of the rocky horror picture show -rrb- .
but that could all change before saturday 's final .
along the way , i 'll be interviewing both the hopefuls and the hopeless - and -lrb- fingers crossed -rrb- spending some time in the commentary booth with sir terry wogan .
if you 've got any burning questions you want answered , or any eurovision recommendations , drop me a line using the form below .

serduchka reminds me of nothing more than les dawson trying to sing gina g. anyway , one of my colleagues in bbc radio has spoken to the star , who wanted us to pass on the following message .
" hello england , i am verka serduchka .
i love you !
" elton john !
the beatles !
madonna ! "
no , me neither .
saturday 12 may 1200 local time -lrb- 1000 bst -rrb- for the past four months , ola melzig has devoted his life to the eurovision .
he 's the production manager for spectra stage event and technologies , which means he 's responsible for the lighting in the show and running the mammoth video wall which dominates this year 's set .
ola melzig has kept an online diary of his work for the show backstage in his office , he 's set up home with a sofa , a " sadly underused " ps3 and two , yes two , espresso machines .
" we 've been in helsinki for four weeks but i started travelling back and forth in january for pre-production , " the affable swede tells me .
throughout the process , melzig has kept an online diary -lrb- www.eurovisiondiary.com -rrb- which tells of the trials and tribulations of setting up such a massive show .
at the start of the week , things were still a bit hairy - as melzig discovered the underfoot video screens were generating too much heat .
this made the fog effects heat up , resulting in several acts being lost in a murky mist .
but , despite the occasional hiccup , he says " surprisingly little has gone wrong " .
" although one day the stage guys put a drum kit in the wrong place and a lighting rig landed on it and smashed it . "
with innumerable rehearsals and run-throughs , melzig is probably more familiar with the 42 eurovision songs than anyone , but he claims not to have a favourite .
" without noticing , you force yourself to love the songs because you 'd go mental if you did n't like them .
" but the ukraine is fantastic because it 's so fun , the uk is fantastic because it 's so gay , and i love finland because they 're so hardcore . "
friday 11 may 1900 local time -lrb- 1700bst -rrb- georgia 's representative , sopho , has just dropped by the press centre for a chat -lrb- she 's the one with the make-up , in case you 're having trouble distinguishing between us -rrb- .
at 20 years old , she 's the youngest singer in this year 's competition - but she sailed through the qualifying round to make it into the finals , despite the fact that georgia has never entered the competition before .
the bbc 's mark savage meets georgian singer sopho " i really appreciate all the support the european countries provided for me .
thank you for putting me through , " she told me through her interpreter .
" you should see what 's going on in georgia 's capital right now , " she tells me with wide eyes .
" thousands of people are on the street supporting me and this has very symbolic value .
" this is our future - it 's important that all of europe knows that our country is looking forward to getting united with all of europe . "
but i was n't interested in sopho 's messages of political harmony .
no , i wanted to know if she was worried about those dancers with the swords .
" i 'm not afraid at all !
they 're professional dancers and i trust that they 're not going to hurt me . "
so there you go .
friday 11 may 1630 local time -lrb- 1430 bst -rrb- our eurovision voting analyst did n't perform too well last night - only five of the 10 countries he predicted would get through to tomorrow 's final actually made the grade .
without the aid of a sophisticated computer model , i managed to guess six .
but derek gatherer 's analysis of eurovision voting trends still makes interesting reading .
he says 82 % of countries now engage in vote exchanges .
in fact , the only eurovision participants who can claim a clean slate are israel , switzerland , hungary and france .
" people are making a political point , " says gatherer , " and the practice has been steadily increasing since the introduction of phone voting in the mid-90s . "
the worst culprits are the countries that make up the so-called " balkan bloc " , which centres around croatia , serbia and fyr macedonia .
coincidentally , the latter two were both promoted to the final after last night 's phone vote .
but gatherer says the political votes are n't strong enough to influence the winning song .
" last year , finland were strongly backed by their friends , " he says , " but their act was very distinctive " .
" but the last time there was a winner who was n't part of a voting bloc was israel in 1998 . "
friday 11 may 1600 local time -lrb- 1400 bst -rrb- i 've just come back from the first full dress rehearsal for saturday 's big eurovision showdown , and the atmosphere was electric .
scooch are facing an uphill battle to win over the crowd unlike last night 's semi-final , the hartwall arena was packed to the rafters , and the crowd were dancing around like sandy shaw 's proverbial puppet on a string .
the best reactions were reserved for sweden 's glam rock dandies , the ark and ukraine 's grotesque drag queen verka seduchka .
unfortunately , the crowd sat still , arms folded and scowls painted across their faces during scooch 's routine .
one of the uk fans who 's travelled over to helsinki texted me as the band traipsed off stage : " kill me now " .
what have we done to anger the rest of europe so ?
for the last couple of years we 've put our poor performances down to the war in iraq , but tony blair resigned yesterday and it still is n't good enough .
maybe next year we should write a song called " look , we 're really quite sorry about all that stuff we did " and see if that sorts things out .
friday 11 may 0900 local time -lrb- 0700 bst -rrb- the semi-finals gave everyone a taste of the big day after the excitement of last night 's semi-final , i managed to have a look through some of the e-mails you 've been sending .
mark campbell-howes wrote : " i 'm travelling to helsinki tomorrow for the weekend but i have n't managed to secure tickets for the main event .
" do you know if there are there any plans to show the contest on big screens in the city centre ? "
yes , mark , there are .
helsinki 's senate square is playing host to a huge screen filled with eurovision broadcasts .
some of finland 's top acts will also be playing on stage in the square .
meanwhile , ken edwards has written in to suggest i visit the storyville jazz bar in downtown helsinki when i need a break from all this europop .
thanks ken !
i expect to be there in , oooh , five or 10 minutes .
keep the e-mails coming - just use the form at the bottom of this page !
thursday 10 may 2100 local time -lrb- 1900 bst -rrb- rehearsals have been held at the arena since 3 may i 'm about to go to the helsinki hartwall arena to watch the semi-finals .
to many fans , this is as important as the main event - and the ticket prices reflect it .
it costs 130 euros -lrb- about £ 88 -rrb- to get a seat for the three-hour extravaganza .
one person who 'll be paying close attention is academic derek gatherer .
for the past couple of years , he 's been studying eurovision voting patterns , and says the semi-finals are the place where block voting has the biggest influence .
derek has used a computer model to predict the ten acts who will make it through from tonight 's contest to saturday 's final .
if you 're watching the proceedings on bbc three , here 's what to expect : latvia - bonaparti.lv albania - frederik ndoci croatia - dragonfly featuring dado topic denmark - dq hungary - magdi ruzsa malta - olivia lewis moldova - natalia barbu norway - guri schanke serbia - marija serifovic turkey - kenan dogulu i 'll speak to derek again after tonight 's contest - and tell you a little bit more about his views on how certain countries affect the results by voting for their neighbours .
thursday 10 may 1445 local time -lrb- 1245 bst -rrb- " you 're from england ? " inquired my taxi driver on the way from helsinki 's vantaa airport .
" your song is a joke . "
i do hope this does n't become a regular conversational gambit ...
for now , i 've decided to hide away from any other potential eurocritics by hanging out in the press centre at the hartwall arena .
i 'm actually a bit late to the party - rehearsals started seven days ago and reporters from the more fervent eurovision nations have been following the proceedings ever since .
the media representatives all hard at work in all , there are about 1,600 media representatives here in helsinki , and many of them are sitting around the hall on beanbags , sipping coffee and watching the dress rehearsals for tonight 's semi-final .
after every song a small but enthusiastic cheer erupts from a different corner of the room .
do n't they have work to do ?
as an aside - several seasoned euro hacks warned me that the eurovision attracts a fair share of fans in search of " someone to spend the weekend with " .
i 'm no prude , but i had no idea the mating rituals would start before i even got here .
at seven o 'clock this morning a rather flustered young woman was ushered to the head of my check-in queue at heathrow by a security officer .
" because you 're late ? " inquired the man whose place she had taken , " or because you 're good-looking ? "
" i think it 's a bit of both . "
yikes !
thursday 10 may 1400 local time -lrb- 1200 bst -rrb- tonight 's semi-finals are a big deal .
28 countries perform , but only 10 get through to the main event on saturday .
before i left , i caught up with paddy o 'connell , who presents the semi-finals on bbc three .
o 'connell hosts the bbc coverage of the semi-final from 2000bst he 's a passionate advocate for the eurovision , and says the contest is a stark reminder that europe is n't all about " men in suits and arguments over fish quotas " .
" europe is about the different clothes , the different food and the foreign girls and boys we fall in love with , " he says .
" it 's hotter , it 's colder , it 's a vibrant continent .
" for me , eurovision is a relief from wanging on about european food mountains and everything else .
" it 's probably not a true representation of europe either - it 's sort of about women in big dresses and suspect drag acts in sequins .
" but there are british people who can sing all the songs in swedish .
it belies everything we 're told about the language barrier . "
thursday 10 may 0800 local time -lrb- 0600 bst -rrb- as i sit waiting for the taxi to take me to heathrow , i 'm contemplating what 's in store once i reach helsinki .
all the eurovision veterans i 've spoken to tell me the event is " a unique experience " but i do n't know why they keep twitching like that .
what i do know is that there are a breathtaking 42 acts vying for eurovision glory this year - and i 'm going to have to listen to all of them at least once .
my ipod is stuffed full of the entries , and early favourites include georgia -lrb- like bjork with a more outlandish dress sense -rrb- and sweden -lrb- t-rex by way of the rocky horror picture show -rrb- .
but that could all change before saturday 's final .
along the way , i 'll be interviewing both the hopefuls and the hopeless - and -lrb- fingers crossed -rrb- spending some time in the commentary booth with sir terry wogan .
if you 've got any burning questions you want answered , or any eurovision recommendations , drop me a line using the form below .
see you in helsinki !

mohammad ali hosseini said that , like anyone else , iran did not accept kidnapping and rejected it as a matter of principle .
he is the first iranian official to comment on the case since mr johnston was abducted at gunpoint in gaza city on 12 march .
a tape allegedly made by mr johnston 's kidnappers was released last week .
issued by a group calling itself the jaish al-islam -lrb- army of islam -rrb- , the tape showed the 44-year-old 's bbc id card , and also demanded the release of muslim prisoners in british jails .
media independence meanwhile , the international press institute -lrb- ipi -rrb- has renewed a call for mr johnston 's immediate release at its world congress in istanbul , turkey .
the press freedom organisation adopted a resolution which said : " the ipi condemns all those who kidnap journalists and calls on them to respect the media 's independence and to release their captives immediately .
" in particular , at this time , the ipi voices its grave concern for alan johnston , the bbc journalist kidnapped in gaza on 12 march , and appeals for him to be released now - safe and unharmed .
the ipi calls on the palestinian authority to work to that end . "
the organisation is among a growing number of individuals and groups calling for mr johnston 's release .
on saturday evening , the archbishop of york appealed to mr johnston 's captors to free him immediately in an interview broadcast on al-jazeera television .
in the broadcast dr john sentamu stressed mr johnston 's role in giving a voice to the palestinian people , adding that people were suffering as a result of his abduction .
earlier appeals for his freedom have come from tony blair and united nations secretary general ban ki-moon .
mr johnston has lived and worked in gaza for three years and was the only western reporter permanently based in the territory .

montgomeryshire am mick bates said this arrangement should be bound by a policy agreement signed by all four main parties .
mr bates told the bbc that a coalition with labour would be " a non-starter " .
meanwhile , labour mep eluned morgan said the party could reach an " informal deal " on policy options without a formal coalition .
mr bates is the second member of the six-strong liberal democrat assembly group to publically oppose the idea of a coalition with the labour party , who have 26 seats - five short of an overall majority .
he told the bbc politics show that he wants to see a contract on issues agreed between parties , rather than a coaltion of power . "
i am working hard to make sure that wales has a government at the assembly which takes us forward over the next four years " rhodri morgan he feels such a deal would be electorally damaging when the lib dems come to defend their running of four welsh councils against labour opponents at the local government elections next year .
south wales west am peter black also made his opposition to such a coalition clear last week .
mr bates said he was worried that some politicians seemed more concerned about gaining power than about implementing policy to benefit the people of wales .
' progressive parties ' meanwwhile , new zealand 's health minister and labour mp pete hodgson has been briefing the executive of the wales labour party on how parties can work together in order to form a stable government .
new zealand has a similar electoral proportional representation system as wales .
there they have both a formal coalition and a system of cooperation between other parties outside government , which guarantees stability by doing deals on various policy issues .
first minister rhodri morgan said that that the new zealand experience demonstrated " that stable and successful government can be achieved in a system like ours .
" but that this outcome depends on progressive parties being willing to work together in arrangements which are more flexible than those produced by conventional first-past-the-post politics " .
mr morgan added : " we are having to learn those lessons very fast in wales , and i am working hard to make sure that wales has a government at the assembly which takes us forward over the next four years " .
labour mep eluned morgan said an " informal deal " could involve either plaid or the liberal dems .
in terms of the " least worst option " for labour , ms morgan acknowledged that it depended on which part of the party you spoke to and that there " will be tensions " no matter which direction they took .
