the eu says , give the council more time . cuba is leading a bid by a number of countries to strip the human rights council of its power to investigate and condemn violations of human rights , a move some activists warn could jeopardize the entire un 's credibility , the news agency reuters reported .
the 47 member states of the new un watchdog , which was set up last year to replace its discredited predecessor , are quietly negotiating a package of measures which will define its role .
at stake is the fate of " special procedures " - independent investigators appointed to report on countries where abuses are suspected .
the former secretary general kofi annan described these rapporteurs as the " crown jewels " of the un human rights machinery .
" our fear is that some governments are trying to sell the crown jewels , trying to undermine the independence of special procedures , " irene khan , secretary general of amnesty international , told reporters in geneva .
" there are huge stakes here for human rights , not only for survivors of abuses but the credibility of the council and the larger credibility of the united nations , " she said .

still , some countries singled out for this attention , and their allies such as china , say such finger-pointing is selective and politically motivated .
they want to abolish the investigators .
cuba - which has never allowed a visit by the special rapporteur on cuba , christine chanet - is leading the charge to dismantle country investigators .
those opposed want that countries should submit their own reports on their domestic records .
they add there intrusive investigators are unnecessary .
" the perpetuation of country-specific mandates , imposed by force and blackmail , would maintain the spiraling confrontation that did away with the authority and credibility of the defunct commission on human rights , " cuban foreign minister felipe perez roque said in a speech last week .
eu supportive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both kofi annan and ban ki-moon worried over the council the european union says that it is fighting to preserve the special procedures , as well as the forum 's ability to adopt resolutions condemning countries for the worst violations .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.03.2007 eu demands release of british troops ; marines allegedly confess großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british claim their troops were in international waters but iran contests this germany , in its role as eu president , called on iran to immediately release 15 british troops seized in disputed waters near iraq on friday .
tehran claims the soldiers have confessed to being in iranian waters . the european union would underline its position in a statement to be issued later in the day , german foreign minister frank walter steinmeier said in berlin .
steinmeier told reporters the eu would " make clear we want an immediate liberation " of the british soldiers held by iran . the 15 servicemen were detained on friday after inspecting a vessel in the mouth of the shatt al-arab waterway that marks the southern stretch of iraq 's border with iran .
iran claimed they had violated its territorial waters , but britain said they were in international waters and demanded their release . as the diplomatic to-ing and fro-ing continued , iran said on announced that the soldiers had admitted to violating its territorial waters , rejecting demands from london for their swift release . tehran claims soldiers confessed to entering iranian waters the semi-official fars news agency said the personnel had been brought to the capital tehran for questioning about what they were doing during what britain insists was a " routine " anti-smuggling patrol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british marines carry out un missions in the gulf armed forces general staff spokesman general alireza afshar said the 15 had admitted to their interrogators that they knew they were inside iranian waters , contrary to the insistence of the british defense ministry that they had remained in iraqi waters . " they are currently being questioned and have admitted to violating the territorial waters of the islamic republic , " afshar told the fars agency . he told the arabic language service of state television : " we have solid evidence that they were detained in our territorial waters .
they themselves have confessed and admitted their mistake . " he accused the british military of seeking to " create a climate of tension at a moment when a -lrb- un security council -rrb- resolution on iran -lrb- over its controversial nuclear program -rrb- is to be put to the vote despite the fact that iran seeks calm and stability in the region " . " the questioning of the british sailors is continuing to try to establish their real intentions , " he added . earlier another iranian official told the fars agency that the authorities had proof from the seized vessels ' navigation equipment that the sailors had knowingly entered iranian waters . " the british troops who are in iran 's hands knew perfectly well that they were in iranian territorial waters .
their navigation equipment proves it , " said the official , whom the news agency did not name .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 24.03.2007 fringe opinion : the cult of knut großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knut has become a media pro in recent weeks since hitting the headlines knut the polar bear cub is the darling of the world 's media at the moment - and with his unbearable cuteness and heart-warming story of survival , rightly so .
but what does his elevation to superstardom say about us ? could it be that i slipped unnoticed into some kind of news narcolepsy over the last week ?
while other aspects of life seem to have carried on as normal in the past few days , there is a huge black hole in my memory concerning the most pertinent international current affairs stories . i must have slept peacefully through the release of the german hostages in iraq ; snored and dribbled through the resolution of the iran nuclear crisis and twitched fitfully as middle east peace broke out .
there can be no other reason for the dearth of serious topics on the front page of the international press and the omnipresent fuzzy visage of a baby polar bear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bono should have thought about doing this years ago do n't get me wrong .
if the first public appearance of knut the polar bear cub at berlin 's zoo is the most dramatic event facing mankind this week then i am truly happy .
his stumpy little moon-boot legs are much more appealing than the effects of car bombs in baghdad and when he rolled about with that soccer ball , well … it was like i 'd never heard of the third world .
so , " hooray " in all honesty and authenticity for knut . it says much for the state of the world that a cuddly polar bear cub can demand so much attention when there are so many uglier things going on .
knut 's arrival on the planet has had much more impact than 9-kilograms of arctic predator should realistically have .
sure , he is unbelievably cute ; yes , his story of survival is a heart-warming one , and of course , death threats aimed at the bundle of razor-clawed fun by activists should make headlines .
but front page news ?
annie liebowitz photo-shoots ?
imminent vanity fair cover stardom ?
read my lips : it 's … a … bear . nasty current affairs pushed to the sidelines bildunterschrift : the un security council debate on iran , the russian supreme court 's ban on one of last political parties left which opposes president putin , the 50th anniversary of the european union : all these stories were replaced on the front pages of the international press on saturday by cuddly knut .
and while he is much more appealing than comrade vlad , one has to ask why ? is it because , as germany 's opportunist environment minister sigmar gabriel said as he nervously interacted with the bear in front of the world 's media , knut is a symbol for global change ?
is the cub a beacon of hope for an ailing planet ?
is his survival against the odds a message that the human race should champion ?
possibly .
but i think there 's more to it than that … humans , like polar bears , are pretty hardy creatures .
we have to be to live in the world that we do .
if we were to actually sit and think about all the things going wrong around us and all the events which appear to be out of our control , there would be mass panic and chronic depression .
thankfully , we are blessed with the ability to crawl under a warm , mental blanket of denial when things get too much . knut the savior in a world gone mad ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forget your troubles by indulging yourself in some knut nothing helps more in the creation of denial than a distraction .
why worry about the state of the planet , when you can read about a cuddly polar bear cub discovering that sand does n't taste very nice ?
just as those pictures of knut taking his first drink from his enclosure 's moat pushed harder news to page four , so his big black eyes and innocent journey of discovery can push the realities of life further to the back of your mind . the current cult of knut , while it throws up many interesting questions , is really nothing to worry about .
his elevation to superstardom and worldwide fame is just the latest in a long line of respites which we should all embrace and enjoy .
knut 's time in the sun should be celebrated for as long as it lasts because before you know it , the front pages are going to be full of death and destruction again . so once again , " hooray " for knut for making the world - even for a short time - a fuzzier place . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is faces some serious issues , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .
read up on a selection on recent articles about funny events in germany .
-lrb- 22.03.2007 -rrb- white bambi hoping to avoid brown bruno 's fate killing a male bear with a thirst for blood is one thing .
killing a rare albino deer because it may dilute the gene pool is another .
the state of saxony is in a stir over white bambi with the pain of bruno still raw .

it 's an issue that divides member states down the middle as they work towards ratification . when she took over the rotating eu presidency in january this year , german chancellor angela merkel declared it her aim to revive the eu constitution , but she also opened another can of worms , reviving the debate on whether to mention europe 's christian heritage in the proposed constitution . following a meeting with pope benedict xvi in 2006 , merkel reaffirmed her support for a christian values clause . " i believe this treaty should be linked to christianity and god because christianity was decisive in the formation of europe , " she said . two sides who can never agree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliament agreed on the text , but not without discontent from some . the debate around europe 's common history and beliefs polarizes christians and secularists .
christian democrats hans-gert pöttering , the german mep who took over the european parliament 's presidency in 2006 , sees his christian faith as intrinsic to his politics and stated the eu constitution was a " holy text " . pöttering is the leader of the european people 's party , a grouping which is the largest europe-wide party in the parliament and a coalition of center-right , christian democratic national parties . staunchly catholic poland also made it clear that it would like to see christian values enshrined in the constitution as did seven other national governments who were pressed on the subject - italy , lithuania , malta , portugal , czech republic , slovakia and ireland . ultimately however , they found themselves in the minority , and the compromise position reached by the eu was a simple reference to europe 's " cultural , religious and humanist heritage . " committed believers wo n't give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch -lrb- and their cows -rrb- voted no . that proponents have refused to fall silent following their defeat on this issue , is an indication the passion the christian values debate arouses .
opponents are just as committed to keeping the so-called " god clause " out , and they are frustrated at the revival of a battle they thought had been won . " the chancellor 's statement brings into question once more a compromise that was difficult enough to achieve .
it is not helpful to reopen a discussion that has been closed , " said martin schulz , the german mep and socialist leader in the european parliament , following merkel 's statements . because this debate centers on personal belief , both sides struggle to make concessions or understand conflicting viewpoints .
dr jan palmowski , senior lecturer in european and german politics at kings college , london says it is " hard for secularists to understand why those who feel so strongly about religion can not compromise . " treaty stuck in legal limbo the eu constitution , drafted by the european convention amid furious wrangling in 2004 , is in a state of political limbo after being rejected by the french and dutch in referenda held in mid-2005 .
proponents of the constitution argue it is necessary to give the eu workable mechanisms for reaching decisions . sweden , denmark and belgium lined up firmly behind france , which holds fast to long established secular principles . the 2004 french foreign minister michel barnier said firmly during initial negotiations " europe is not a judaeo-christian club . " palmowski also argues , as do other commentators , that there is the political question of turkey 's application for eu membership in this debate .
if europe is defined as being christian , then clearly islamic turkey is n't a european country .
and while merkel has stressed that she does n't believe that the european union is a " christian club " , conservative opposition to turkey 's membership is well-known . many do n't want to talk about it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestant and catholic - two german leaders both want god in constitution . defining who is and is n't entitled to be called european also concerns the european network against racism -lrb- enar -rrb- , a network of ngos across eu member states . " there is no denying that christianity has made a decisive contribution to european identity , but then so has judaism and islam , both present for centuries on european soil , " said enar chair bashy quraishy , who would like to see all religions included or none at all . but despite passionate debate , the members recognise that the constitution has a is about more than just values .
" religion not a make or break issue here , " palmowski says .
" even in 2004 the tensions were really about the weighting given to spain and poland in the voting structure , religion is not a decisive factor . " hanneli ebding , director of federal europe , an independent ngo lobby in brussels for the constitution in its present form , does n't see the religion debate intruding on a practical level .
" it 's just not being visibly discussed , " she said . reviving the constitutional process most analysts believe that the defeats in france and the netherlands were as a result of dissatisfaction with the constitution 's plans for expansion of members , the euro-zone , and national governments .
statements about religion do not seem to have been a significant factor .
the french were demonstrating their discontent with president jacques chirac , while many dutch felt that european integration was moving too fast . merkel has declared she will use germany 's presidency of the eu , which it holds until the end of june 2007 , to get the constitution back on the rails .

it 's an issue that divides member states down the middle as they work towards ratification . when she took over the rotating eu presidency in january this year , german chancellor angela merkel declared it her aim to revive the eu constitution , but she also opened another can of worms , reviving the debate on whether to mention europe 's christian heritage in the proposed constitution . following a meeting with pope benedict xvi in 2006 , merkel reaffirmed her support for a christian values clause . " i believe this treaty should be linked to christianity and god because christianity was decisive in the formation of europe , " she said . two sides who can never agree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliament agreed on the text , but not without discontent from some . the debate around europe 's common history and beliefs polarizes christians and secularists .
christian democrats hans-gert pöttering , the german mep who took over the european parliament 's presidency in 2006 , sees his christian faith as intrinsic to his politics and stated the eu constitution was a " holy text " . pöttering is the leader of the european people 's party , a grouping which is the largest europe-wide party in the parliament and a coalition of center-right , christian democratic national parties . staunchly catholic poland also made it clear that it would like to see christian values enshrined in the constitution as did seven other national governments who were pressed on the subject - italy , lithuania , malta , portugal , czech republic , slovakia and ireland . ultimately however , they found themselves in the minority , and the compromise position reached by the eu was a simple reference to europe 's " cultural , religious and humanist heritage . " committed believers wo n't give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch -lrb- and their cows -rrb- voted no . that proponents have refused to fall silent following their defeat on this issue , is an indication the passion the christian values debate arouses .
opponents are just as committed to keeping the so-called " god clause " out , and they are frustrated at the revival of a battle they thought had been won . " the chancellor 's statement brings into question once more a compromise that was difficult enough to achieve .
it is not helpful to reopen a discussion that has been closed , " said martin schulz , the german mep and socialist leader in the european parliament , following merkel 's statements . because this debate centers on personal belief , both sides struggle to make concessions or understand conflicting viewpoints .
dr jan palmowski , senior lecturer in european and german politics at kings college , london says it is " hard for secularists to understand why those who feel so strongly about religion can not compromise . " treaty stuck in legal limbo the eu constitution , drafted by the european convention amid furious wrangling in 2004 , is in a state of political limbo after being rejected by the french and dutch in referenda held in mid-2005 .
proponents of the constitution argue it is necessary to give the eu workable mechanisms for reaching decisions . sweden , denmark and belgium lined up firmly behind france , which holds fast to long established secular principles . the 2004 french foreign minister michel barnier said firmly during initial negotiations " europe is not a judaeo-christian club . " palmowski also argues , as do other commentators , that there is the political question of turkey 's application for eu membership in this debate .
if europe is defined as being christian , then clearly islamic turkey is n't a european country .
and while merkel has stressed that she does n't believe that the european union is a " christian club " , conservative opposition to turkey 's membership is well-known . many do n't want to talk about it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestant and catholic - two german leaders both want god in constitution . defining who is and is n't entitled to be called european also concerns the european network against racism -lrb- enar -rrb- , a network of ngos across eu member states . " there is no denying that christianity has made a decisive contribution to european identity , but then so has judaism and islam , both present for centuries on european soil , " said enar chair bashy quraishy , who would like to see all religions included or none at all . but despite passionate debate , the members recognise that the constitution has a is about more than just values .
" religion not a make or break issue here , " palmowski says .
" even in 2004 the tensions were really about the weighting given to spain and poland in the voting structure , religion is not a decisive factor . " hanneli ebding , director of federal europe , an independent ngo lobby in brussels for the constitution in its present form , does n't see the religion debate intruding on a practical level .
" it 's just not being visibly discussed , " she said . reviving the constitutional process most analysts believe that the defeats in france and the netherlands were as a result of dissatisfaction with the constitution 's plans for expansion of members , the euro-zone , and national governments .
statements about religion do not seem to have been a significant factor .
the french were demonstrating their discontent with president jacques chirac , while many dutch felt that european integration was moving too fast . merkel has declared she will use germany 's presidency of the eu , which it holds until the end of june 2007 , to get the constitution back on the rails .
she faces a tough sell even without the " god clause " issue , with the czechs , poles , british , dutch and french expected to be the most difficult countries to win over , she may be hoping for divine intervention . emma wynne send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german eu constitution plans get mixed reception in berlin german plans to put forward new proposals on the stalled eu constitutional process drew support from denmark but hesitancy from the czech republic tuesday .

" the questioning of the british sailors is continuing to try to establish their real intentions , " he added . earlier another iranian official told the fars agency that the authorities had proof from the seized vessels ' navigation equipment that the sailors had knowingly entered iranian waters . " the british troops who are in iran 's hands knew perfectly well that they were in iranian territorial waters .
their navigation equipment proves it , " said the official , whom the news agency did not name . " besides the explanations of the british sailors , data from the computerized navigation equipment on board the vessels seized shows that they knowingly entered iranian waters and stayed there . " our border guards did their duty , " he said , adding that the british navy should " pay more attention to its navigation equipment .

" fars also said the captured britons included some women .
neither of these claims have been clarified .
" we have n't had any confirmation of that , " a british foreign office spokesman in london told reporters . " the foreign ministry 's spokesman called the illegal and interfering entry of british forces into iranian territorial waters a suspicious act and against international laws and rules and has harshly condemned it , " irna said . iran claims british had " unusual aims " the news agency also quoted foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini as saying : " violating the territory of other countries and non-permitted entrance ... show unusual aims and is against international treaties and there are no excuses for ignoring and not accepting the responsibility for that . " britain has claimed that the soldiers were detained in iraqi waters .
the foreign ministry has said that two boatloads of royal navy sailors and marines had searched a merchant vessel on a un approved mission in iraqi waters when iranian gunboats encircled and captured them . " we demanded they be released swiftly and safely , " the foreign office spokesman said .
" we are keeping a very close on it .
we are in contact with other governments in the region . " relations between iran and britain have deteriorated further in recent months after it was claimed that tehran was providing training and arms to shia insurgents in the south of iraq where the british are deployed . fragments of shell and bomb cases used in attacks on british troops are alleged to carry iranian stamps .

tehran claims the soldiers have confessed to being in iranian waters . the european union would underline its position in a statement to be issued later in the day , german foreign minister frank walter steinmeier said in berlin .
steinmeier told reporters the eu would " make clear we want an immediate liberation " of the british soldiers held by iran . the 15 servicemen were detained on friday after inspecting a vessel in the mouth of the shatt al-arab waterway that marks the southern stretch of iraq 's border with iran .
iran claimed they had violated its territorial waters , but britain said they were in international waters and demanded their release . as the diplomatic to-ing and fro-ing continued , iran said on announced that the soldiers had admitted to violating its territorial waters , rejecting demands from london for their swift release . tehran claims soldiers confessed to entering iranian waters the semi-official fars news agency said the personnel had been brought to the capital tehran for questioning about what they were doing during what britain insists was a " routine " anti-smuggling patrol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british marines carry out un missions in the gulf armed forces general staff spokesman general alireza afshar said the 15 had admitted to their interrogators that they knew they were inside iranian waters , contrary to the insistence of the british defense ministry that they had remained in iraqi waters . " they are currently being questioned and have admitted to violating the territorial waters of the islamic republic , " afshar told the fars agency . he told the arabic language service of state television : " we have solid evidence that they were detained in our territorial waters .
they themselves have confessed and admitted their mistake . " he accused the british military of seeking to " create a climate of tension at a moment when a -lrb- un security council -rrb- resolution on iran -lrb- over its controversial nuclear program -rrb- is to be put to the vote despite the fact that iran seeks calm and stability in the region " . " the questioning of the british sailors is continuing to try to establish their real intentions , " he added . earlier another iranian official told the fars agency that the authorities had proof from the seized vessels ' navigation equipment that the sailors had knowingly entered iranian waters . " the british troops who are in iran 's hands knew perfectly well that they were in iranian territorial waters .
their navigation equipment proves it , " said the official , whom the news agency did not name . " besides the explanations of the british sailors , data from the computerized navigation equipment on board the vessels seized shows that they knowingly entered iranian waters and stayed there . " our border guards did their duty , " he said , adding that the british navy should " pay more attention to its navigation equipment . " diplomats meet to end stand-off britain summoned iran 's ambassador in london for a second day running to hear a demand for the swift release of the britons . rasoul movahedian was seen by a senior civil servant at the foreign office on friday but was to be seen by junior minister lord david triesman for the new audience , a spokeswoman said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's elite revolutionary guard also patrol the gulf iran originally called the british operation an " illegal entry " into iranian waters as a " suspicious act " , the official irna news agency said on saturday , while fars said the british soldiers had been transferred to the capital tehran to explain their " aggressive action . " fars also said the captured britons included some women .
neither of these claims have been clarified .
" we have n't had any confirmation of that , " a british foreign office spokesman in london told reporters . " the foreign ministry 's spokesman called the illegal and interfering entry of british forces into iranian territorial waters a suspicious act and against international laws and rules and has harshly condemned it , " irna said . iran claims british had " unusual aims " the news agency also quoted foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini as saying : " violating the territory of other countries and non-permitted entrance ... show unusual aims and is against international treaties and there are no excuses for ignoring and not accepting the responsibility for that . " britain has claimed that the soldiers were detained in iraqi waters .
the foreign ministry has said that two boatloads of royal navy sailors and marines had searched a merchant vessel on a un approved mission in iraqi waters when iranian gunboats encircled and captured them . " we demanded they be released swiftly and safely , " the foreign office spokesman said .
" we are keeping a very close on it .
we are in contact with other governments in the region . " relations between iran and britain have deteriorated further in recent months after it was claimed that tehran was providing training and arms to shia insurgents in the south of iraq where the british are deployed . fragments of shell and bomb cases used in attacks on british troops are alleged to carry iranian stamps .
in turn , iran has accused british troops of carrying out missions over the iraqi border . abduction on eve of un vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emyr jones parry , britain 's un ambassador , is in new york for the vote the incident increases tensions in the region as iran faces un sanctions over its nuclear program that western governments believe is geared to making weapons . german foreign minister steinmeier said he was hopeful that the un security council would be able to agree this weekend on a resolution tightening sanctions against teheran . he said talks were under way with five non-permanent members of the security council who were not happy with the wording of the resolution .

his stumpy little moon-boot legs are much more appealing than the effects of car bombs in baghdad and when he rolled about with that soccer ball , well … it was like i 'd never heard of the third world .
so , " hooray " in all honesty and authenticity for knut . it says much for the state of the world that a cuddly polar bear cub can demand so much attention when there are so many uglier things going on .
knut 's arrival on the planet has had much more impact than 9-kilograms of arctic predator should realistically have .
sure , he is unbelievably cute ; yes , his story of survival is a heart-warming one , and of course , death threats aimed at the bundle of razor-clawed fun by activists should make headlines .

" any suggestion that visa issues are the cause of president ahmadinejad 's decision not to travel to new york is false , " us deputy state department spokesman tom casey announdced saturday . on friday evening , the 15-member security council was still involved in last-minute haggling , with indonesia and qatar insisting on inserting a paragraph on the goal of establishing a " middle east free from weapons of mass destruction and all missiles for their delivery " into the draft . chinese ambassador wang guangya , whose country was among the six major powers which crafted the latest sanctions resolution , said efforts were continuing to accommodate south africa , indonesia and qatar , three non-permanent council members still unhappy with the latest amended text . " we have to see how council members react to the text put in blue -lrb- meaning readied for an imminent vote thursday -rrb- and see whether there are areas that can be improved to get more support , " he told reporters .
" i want all 15 council members on board . " britain 's un ambassador emyr jones parry , one of the draft 's co-sponsors , said thursday the plan was to have a vote on the text saturday . a western diplomat , speaking on condition of anonymity , said the text has the support of at least 12 council members . president passes up chance to present proposals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before issuing his cancellation , ahmadinejad had told french television thursday that he wanted to present what he called " new proposals " about the islamic republic 's nuclear program , which the major powers fear is a covert grab for an atomic bomb . he called the proposed un sanctions illegal , adding he was " not worried " by the prospect of us strikes against his country over the issue . the delicate diplomatic maneuvering here was unfolding amid fears for 15 british navy sailors seized by iran as they were conducting " routine " anti-smuggling checks in iraqi waters friday , according to the british ministry of defense . diplomats said the incident has no bearing on the sanctions debate here , but it comes amid rising tensions between iran and other countries . broad consensus on draft sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is broad , but not unanimous , support for sanctions late thursday , the security council members had fine-tuned minor changes made to the text agreed last week by the five veto-wielding permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany . but south africa expressed disappointment that its suggestions for a 90-day suspension of un sanctions to allow political negotiations with tehran , to remove the weapons ban and other financial sanctions were rejected . south africa , which dismantled its nuclear weapons program during its 1990s transition to democracy , has consistently defended iran 's right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes . indonesian ambassador rezlan ishar jenie also said friday : " we are not happy with the text .
there are important things that we see as not there . " he said the insertion of a paragraph on the middle east calling for a nuclear-free zone was " one important aspect i want to discuss today " . his qatari counterpart nassir abdulaziz al-nasser said he also wanted the paragraph included . trade , arms and travel restrictions planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran could be banned from exporting weapons the draft resolution under consideration would ban tehran from exporting arms , calls for voluntary trade sanctions and expands a list of officials and companies targeted for financial and travel restrictions . it builds on sanctions already adopted by the security council in december , including a ban on the sale of nuclear and ballistic missile-related materials to iran and a freeze on financial assets of iranians involved in illicit atomic and ballistic missile work . defying un demands , iran has refused to suspend its uranium enrichment work and rejected accusations that it is striving to produce nuclear weapons , insisting its program is designed to generate electricity . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de international crisis brews as iran awaits security council fate the un security council plus germany will meet on saturday to decide on possible sanctions against iran for failing to halt its contested uranium enrichment program .

instead of protecting their group d lead , the germans will go all out for the win . german captain michael ballack insisted on friday his side are only thinking of victory over the czech republic in prague on saturday to make sure they stay top of their euro 2008 qualifying group . germany top group d ahead of the czechs only by virtue of goal difference , and with both sides on ten points there is no margin for error in the race to guarantee qualification . a win in prague would put the germans in the driving seat , but with bundesliga top-scorer mario gomez of vfb stuttgart out with a knee injury , chelsea midfielder ballack says his deputy - bayern munich 's lukas podolski - is a more than adequate substitute . " we have to take any injuries in our stride , a striker has dropped out , but the guys who will play can step in seamlessly .
we respect our opponents , but we are just focused on getting the win , " said the 30-year-old german captain . even without gomez , the germans have an abundance of talented strikers to choose from with 21-year-old podolski , voted the best young player of the 2006 world cup , boasting an impressive record of 22 goals in 37 internationals . strikers poldi and kuranyi confident of win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski aims to grab his chance back in the team " we 'll win because we have the better players , " said the confident podolski , who will partner schalke 04 's kevin kuranyi up front for the germans .

instead of protecting their group d lead , the germans will go all out for the win . german captain michael ballack insisted on friday his side are only thinking of victory over the czech republic in prague on saturday to make sure they stay top of their euro 2008 qualifying group . germany top group d ahead of the czechs only by virtue of goal difference , and with both sides on ten points there is no margin for error in the race to guarantee qualification . a win in prague would put the germans in the driving seat , but with bundesliga top-scorer mario gomez of vfb stuttgart out with a knee injury , chelsea midfielder ballack says his deputy - bayern munich 's lukas podolski - is a more than adequate substitute . " we have to take any injuries in our stride , a striker has dropped out , but the guys who will play can step in seamlessly .
we respect our opponents , but we are just focused on getting the win , " said the 30-year-old german captain . even without gomez , the germans have an abundance of talented strikers to choose from with 21-year-old podolski , voted the best young player of the 2006 world cup , boasting an impressive record of 22 goals in 37 internationals . strikers poldi and kuranyi confident of win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski aims to grab his chance back in the team " we 'll win because we have the better players , " said the confident podolski , who will partner schalke 04 's kevin kuranyi up front for the germans . " if we win , we will have a bit more breathing space , " said national team manager oliver bierhoff , looking forward to the next two qualifying games against san marino and slovakia in june .
" but if we lose , other teams behind us will be back in it , " he warned . meanwhile midfielder bastian schweinsteiger said germany aims to ruthlessly exploit any weakness in the czech republic 's defense to stay top of the group .
bayern munich star schweinsteiger wants to make sure of three qualifying points to give his side some breathing space . " we have had a good look at the way they play and we know where their weaknesses are , we have to be ruthless against them , " said the 22-year-old . löw places emphasis on attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw wants germany to target the czech defense german coach joachim löw has told his side to attack the czechs at every opportunity , but took time this week to organize his defense to cope with the towering threat of the hosts ' striker jan koller . at 6ft 8ins -lrb- 2.03m -rrb- , koller is a defenders ' nightmare in the air , even topping england 's 6ft 7ins bean-pole peter crouch , but with 75 caps and 48 goals to his name , his german minders per mertesacker and christoph metzelder will have their work cut out . metzelder played with koller at borussia dortmund before the czech switched to french side monaco and will work in tandem with mertesacker to keep koller quiet .
" with his height and power , koller is a dangerous man , especially with his long legs and we 'll have to control his airspace , particularly at corners , " said metzelder . while keeper jens lehmann will be trying to keep koller quiet , at the other end , germany 's strikers podolski and kuranyi will be doing their best to unnerve czech keeper petr cech . cech fighting fit to face germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech goalie petr cech will face chelsea team-mate ballack the 24-year-old chelsea goalkeeper suffered a fractured skull in a premiership match last october , but he is back to his best and sporting a protective rugby head guard . " i have got over the most difficult moment of my life , now i enjoy playing even more , " says cech on the eve of his first international since the injury which so nearly killed him .
" i am not afraid .
i have got used to the helmet .
it does n't bother me ; there is n't anything for me to worry about . " cech will be tested by the german pair eager to impress coach löw , who is defending his unbeaten record having won six games and drawn one since replacing jürgen klinsmann after last year 's world cup . with the 2006 world cup 's top goal-scorer miroslav klose ruled out after struggling with a back injury , his able deputies are relishing the challenge . " it 's a blow to be without miroslav klose , " said bayern munich 's podolski , " but we must be able to substitute for him and forge a partnership . " and after germany lost the last encounter between the sides when they were beaten 2-1 at the euro 2004 championships , the visitors have a point to prove . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " young players are good for us " national coach joachim löw has called up four newcomers for germany 's euro 2008 qualifier in prague on saturday .
that 's due to injuries , but it also reflects the plethora of young talent he has at his disposal .
-lrb- 23.03.2007 -rrb- national coach : german soccer on threshold of new golden age a third-place finish at the world cup was enough to captivate german soccer fans this summer , but national team coach joachim löw said he believes his young team is just beginning to show how talented it really is .

steinmeier told reporters the eu would " make clear we want an immediate liberation " of the british soldiers held by iran . the 15 servicemen were detained on friday after inspecting a vessel in the mouth of the shatt al-arab waterway that marks the southern stretch of iraq 's border with iran .
iran claimed they had violated its territorial waters , but britain said they were in international waters and demanded their release . as the diplomatic to-ing and fro-ing continued , iran said on announced that the soldiers had admitted to violating its territorial waters , rejecting demands from london for their swift release . tehran claims soldiers confessed to entering iranian waters the semi-official fars news agency said the personnel had been brought to the capital tehran for questioning about what they were doing during what britain insists was a " routine " anti-smuggling patrol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british marines carry out un missions in the gulf armed forces general staff spokesman general alireza afshar said the 15 had admitted to their interrogators that they knew they were inside iranian waters , contrary to the insistence of the british defense ministry that they had remained in iraqi waters .

" we are keeping a very close on it .

instead of protecting their group d lead , the germans will go all out for the win . german captain michael ballack insisted on friday his side are only thinking of victory over the czech republic in prague on saturday to make sure they stay top of their euro 2008 qualifying group . germany top group d ahead of the czechs only by virtue of goal difference , and with both sides on ten points there is no margin for error in the race to guarantee qualification . a win in prague would put the germans in the driving seat , but with bundesliga top-scorer mario gomez of vfb stuttgart out with a knee injury , chelsea midfielder ballack says his deputy - bayern munich 's lukas podolski - is a more than adequate substitute . " we have to take any injuries in our stride , a striker has dropped out , but the guys who will play can step in seamlessly .
we respect our opponents , but we are just focused on getting the win , " said the 30-year-old german captain . even without gomez , the germans have an abundance of talented strikers to choose from with 21-year-old podolski , voted the best young player of the 2006 world cup , boasting an impressive record of 22 goals in 37 internationals . strikers poldi and kuranyi confident of win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski aims to grab his chance back in the team " we 'll win because we have the better players , " said the confident podolski , who will partner schalke 04 's kevin kuranyi up front for the germans . " if we win , we will have a bit more breathing space , " said national team manager oliver bierhoff , looking forward to the next two qualifying games against san marino and slovakia in june .
" but if we lose , other teams behind us will be back in it , " he warned . meanwhile midfielder bastian schweinsteiger said germany aims to ruthlessly exploit any weakness in the czech republic 's defense to stay top of the group .
bayern munich star schweinsteiger wants to make sure of three qualifying points to give his side some breathing space . " we have had a good look at the way they play and we know where their weaknesses are , we have to be ruthless against them , " said the 22-year-old . löw places emphasis on attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw wants germany to target the czech defense german coach joachim löw has told his side to attack the czechs at every opportunity , but took time this week to organize his defense to cope with the towering threat of the hosts ' striker jan koller . at 6ft 8ins -lrb- 2.03m -rrb- , koller is a defenders ' nightmare in the air , even topping england 's 6ft 7ins bean-pole peter crouch , but with 75 caps and 48 goals to his name , his german minders per mertesacker and christoph metzelder will have their work cut out . metzelder played with koller at borussia dortmund before the czech switched to french side monaco and will work in tandem with mertesacker to keep koller quiet .
" with his height and power , koller is a dangerous man , especially with his long legs and we 'll have to control his airspace , particularly at corners , " said metzelder . while keeper jens lehmann will be trying to keep koller quiet , at the other end , germany 's strikers podolski and kuranyi will be doing their best to unnerve czech keeper petr cech . cech fighting fit to face germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech goalie petr cech will face chelsea team-mate ballack the 24-year-old chelsea goalkeeper suffered a fractured skull in a premiership match last october , but he is back to his best and sporting a protective rugby head guard . " i have got over the most difficult moment of my life , now i enjoy playing even more , " says cech on the eve of his first international since the injury which so nearly killed him .
" i am not afraid .
i have got used to the helmet .
it does n't bother me ; there is n't anything for me to worry about . " cech will be tested by the german pair eager to impress coach löw , who is defending his unbeaten record having won six games and drawn one since replacing jürgen klinsmann after last year 's world cup . with the 2006 world cup 's top goal-scorer miroslav klose ruled out after struggling with a back injury , his able deputies are relishing the challenge . " it 's a blow to be without miroslav klose , " said bayern munich 's podolski , " but we must be able to substitute for him and forge a partnership . " and after germany lost the last encounter between the sides when they were beaten 2-1 at the euro 2004 championships , the visitors have a point to prove . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de " young players are good for us " national coach joachim löw has called up four newcomers for germany 's euro 2008 qualifier in prague on saturday .
that 's due to injuries , but it also reflects the plethora of young talent he has at his disposal .

the eu says , give the council more time . cuba is leading a bid by a number of countries to strip the human rights council of its power to investigate and condemn violations of human rights , a move some activists warn could jeopardize the entire un 's credibility , the news agency reuters reported .
the 47 member states of the new un watchdog , which was set up last year to replace its discredited predecessor , are quietly negotiating a package of measures which will define its role .
at stake is the fate of " special procedures " - independent investigators appointed to report on countries where abuses are suspected .
the former secretary general kofi annan described these rapporteurs as the " crown jewels " of the un human rights machinery .
" our fear is that some governments are trying to sell the crown jewels , trying to undermine the independence of special procedures , " irene khan , secretary general of amnesty international , told reporters in geneva .
" there are huge stakes here for human rights , not only for survivors of abuses but the credibility of the council and the larger credibility of the united nations , " she said .
politically motivated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us declined a seat on the human rights council its 13 special rapporteurs on countries , retained for now from the former un commission on human rights , include experts probing suspected abuses in belarus , cuba , sudan and north korea .
one such investigator , nobel peace laureate jody williams , issued a much-anticipated report on darfur march 12 which blamed sudan for orchestrating war crimes across darfur .
still , some countries singled out for this attention , and their allies such as china , say such finger-pointing is selective and politically motivated .
they want to abolish the investigators .
cuba - which has never allowed a visit by the special rapporteur on cuba , christine chanet - is leading the charge to dismantle country investigators .
those opposed want that countries should submit their own reports on their domestic records .
they add there intrusive investigators are unnecessary .
" the perpetuation of country-specific mandates , imposed by force and blackmail , would maintain the spiraling confrontation that did away with the authority and credibility of the defunct commission on human rights , " cuban foreign minister felipe perez roque said in a speech last week .
eu supportive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both kofi annan and ban ki-moon worried over the council the european union says that it is fighting to preserve the special procedures , as well as the forum 's ability to adopt resolutions condemning countries for the worst violations .
" when secretary general ban ki-moon took office , he said , ' the world is watching to see whether this young council will live up to its promise , " ' one eu official said .
" we have n't given the council enough time . "
others say the investigators are vital .
" special procedures are independent and efficient - that is why they are under attack , " reed brody , counsel at the new york-based group human rights watch told reuters .
he said un human rights ' probes had been successful , pointing to chile in the late 1970s and the former yugoslavia , in the early 1990s .
the council will make a decision on the issue by mid-june . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier : world must condemn human rights abuses in darfur a new report by a un rights group blames sudan for orchestrating war crimes across darfur , while the international community pledged action .

" he accused the british military of seeking to " create a climate of tension at a moment when a -lrb- un security council -rrb- resolution on iran -lrb- over its controversial nuclear program -rrb- is to be put to the vote despite the fact that iran seeks calm and stability in the region " . " the questioning of the british sailors is continuing to try to establish their real intentions , " he added . earlier another iranian official told the fars agency that the authorities had proof from the seized vessels ' navigation equipment that the sailors had knowingly entered iranian waters . " the british troops who are in iran 's hands knew perfectly well that they were in iranian territorial waters .
their navigation equipment proves it , " said the official , whom the news agency did not name . " besides the explanations of the british sailors , data from the computerized navigation equipment on board the vessels seized shows that they knowingly entered iranian waters and stayed there . " our border guards did their duty , " he said , adding that the british navy should " pay more attention to its navigation equipment . " diplomats meet to end stand-off britain summoned iran 's ambassador in london for a second day running to hear a demand for the swift release of the britons . rasoul movahedian was seen by a senior civil servant at the foreign office on friday but was to be seen by junior minister lord david triesman for the new audience , a spokeswoman said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's elite revolutionary guard also patrol the gulf iran originally called the british operation an " illegal entry " into iranian waters as a " suspicious act " , the official irna news agency said on saturday , while fars said the british soldiers had been transferred to the capital tehran to explain their " aggressive action . " fars also said the captured britons included some women .
neither of these claims have been clarified .
" we have n't had any confirmation of that , " a british foreign office spokesman in london told reporters . " the foreign ministry 's spokesman called the illegal and interfering entry of british forces into iranian territorial waters a suspicious act and against international laws and rules and has harshly condemned it , " irna said . iran claims british had " unusual aims " the news agency also quoted foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini as saying : " violating the territory of other countries and non-permitted entrance ... show unusual aims and is against international treaties and there are no excuses for ignoring and not accepting the responsibility for that . " britain has claimed that the soldiers were detained in iraqi waters .
the foreign ministry has said that two boatloads of royal navy sailors and marines had searched a merchant vessel on a un approved mission in iraqi waters when iranian gunboats encircled and captured them . " we demanded they be released swiftly and safely , " the foreign office spokesman said .
" we are keeping a very close on it .
we are in contact with other governments in the region . " relations between iran and britain have deteriorated further in recent months after it was claimed that tehran was providing training and arms to shia insurgents in the south of iraq where the british are deployed . fragments of shell and bomb cases used in attacks on british troops are alleged to carry iranian stamps .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 24.03.2007 fringe opinion : the cult of knut großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knut has become a media pro in recent weeks since hitting the headlines knut the polar bear cub is the darling of the world 's media at the moment - and with his unbearable cuteness and heart-warming story of survival , rightly so .
but what does his elevation to superstardom say about us ? could it be that i slipped unnoticed into some kind of news narcolepsy over the last week ?
while other aspects of life seem to have carried on as normal in the past few days , there is a huge black hole in my memory concerning the most pertinent international current affairs stories . i must have slept peacefully through the release of the german hostages in iraq ; snored and dribbled through the resolution of the iran nuclear crisis and twitched fitfully as middle east peace broke out .
there can be no other reason for the dearth of serious topics on the front page of the international press and the omnipresent fuzzy visage of a baby polar bear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bono should have thought about doing this years ago do n't get me wrong .
if the first public appearance of knut the polar bear cub at berlin 's zoo is the most dramatic event facing mankind this week then i am truly happy .
his stumpy little moon-boot legs are much more appealing than the effects of car bombs in baghdad and when he rolled about with that soccer ball , well … it was like i 'd never heard of the third world .
so , " hooray " in all honesty and authenticity for knut . it says much for the state of the world that a cuddly polar bear cub can demand so much attention when there are so many uglier things going on .
knut 's arrival on the planet has had much more impact than 9-kilograms of arctic predator should realistically have .
sure , he is unbelievably cute ; yes , his story of survival is a heart-warming one , and of course , death threats aimed at the bundle of razor-clawed fun by activists should make headlines .
but front page news ?
annie liebowitz photo-shoots ?
imminent vanity fair cover stardom ?
read my lips : it 's … a … bear . nasty current affairs pushed to the sidelines bildunterschrift : the un security council debate on iran , the russian supreme court 's ban on one of last political parties left which opposes president putin , the 50th anniversary of the european union : all these stories were replaced on the front pages of the international press on saturday by cuddly knut .
and while he is much more appealing than comrade vlad , one has to ask why ? is it because , as germany 's opportunist environment minister sigmar gabriel said as he nervously interacted with the bear in front of the world 's media , knut is a symbol for global change ?
is the cub a beacon of hope for an ailing planet ?
is his survival against the odds a message that the human race should champion ?
possibly .
but i think there 's more to it than that … humans , like polar bears , are pretty hardy creatures .
we have to be to live in the world that we do .
if we were to actually sit and think about all the things going wrong around us and all the events which appear to be out of our control , there would be mass panic and chronic depression .
thankfully , we are blessed with the ability to crawl under a warm , mental blanket of denial when things get too much . knut the savior in a world gone mad ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forget your troubles by indulging yourself in some knut nothing helps more in the creation of denial than a distraction .
why worry about the state of the planet , when you can read about a cuddly polar bear cub discovering that sand does n't taste very nice ?
just as those pictures of knut taking his first drink from his enclosure 's moat pushed harder news to page four , so his big black eyes and innocent journey of discovery can push the realities of life further to the back of your mind . the current cult of knut , while it throws up many interesting questions , is really nothing to worry about .
his elevation to superstardom and worldwide fame is just the latest in a long line of respites which we should all embrace and enjoy .
knut 's time in the sun should be celebrated for as long as it lasts because before you know it , the front pages are going to be full of death and destruction again . so once again , " hooray " for knut for making the world - even for a short time - a fuzzier place . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is faces some serious issues , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

there are important things that we see as not there .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.03.2007 new un human rights body comes under fire großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the initiative is threatening the un 's credibility on the heels of a well-received report on darfur by the newly revamped un human rights council , the body is in danger of having its power stripped away .
the eu says , give the council more time . cuba is leading a bid by a number of countries to strip the human rights council of its power to investigate and condemn violations of human rights , a move some activists warn could jeopardize the entire un 's credibility , the news agency reuters reported .
the 47 member states of the new un watchdog , which was set up last year to replace its discredited predecessor , are quietly negotiating a package of measures which will define its role .
at stake is the fate of " special procedures " - independent investigators appointed to report on countries where abuses are suspected .
the former secretary general kofi annan described these rapporteurs as the " crown jewels " of the un human rights machinery .
" our fear is that some governments are trying to sell the crown jewels , trying to undermine the independence of special procedures , " irene khan , secretary general of amnesty international , told reporters in geneva .
" there are huge stakes here for human rights , not only for survivors of abuses but the credibility of the council and the larger credibility of the united nations , " she said .
politically motivated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us declined a seat on the human rights council its 13 special rapporteurs on countries , retained for now from the former un commission on human rights , include experts probing suspected abuses in belarus , cuba , sudan and north korea .
one such investigator , nobel peace laureate jody williams , issued a much-anticipated report on darfur march 12 which blamed sudan for orchestrating war crimes across darfur .
still , some countries singled out for this attention , and their allies such as china , say such finger-pointing is selective and politically motivated .
they want to abolish the investigators .
cuba - which has never allowed a visit by the special rapporteur on cuba , christine chanet - is leading the charge to dismantle country investigators .
those opposed want that countries should submit their own reports on their domestic records .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 24.03.2007 fringe opinion : the cult of knut großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knut has become a media pro in recent weeks since hitting the headlines knut the polar bear cub is the darling of the world 's media at the moment - and with his unbearable cuteness and heart-warming story of survival , rightly so .
but what does his elevation to superstardom say about us ? could it be that i slipped unnoticed into some kind of news narcolepsy over the last week ?
while other aspects of life seem to have carried on as normal in the past few days , there is a huge black hole in my memory concerning the most pertinent international current affairs stories . i must have slept peacefully through the release of the german hostages in iraq ; snored and dribbled through the resolution of the iran nuclear crisis and twitched fitfully as middle east peace broke out .
there can be no other reason for the dearth of serious topics on the front page of the international press and the omnipresent fuzzy visage of a baby polar bear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bono should have thought about doing this years ago do n't get me wrong .
if the first public appearance of knut the polar bear cub at berlin 's zoo is the most dramatic event facing mankind this week then i am truly happy .
his stumpy little moon-boot legs are much more appealing than the effects of car bombs in baghdad and when he rolled about with that soccer ball , well … it was like i 'd never heard of the third world .
so , " hooray " in all honesty and authenticity for knut . it says much for the state of the world that a cuddly polar bear cub can demand so much attention when there are so many uglier things going on .
knut 's arrival on the planet has had much more impact than 9-kilograms of arctic predator should realistically have .
sure , he is unbelievably cute ; yes , his story of survival is a heart-warming one , and of course , death threats aimed at the bundle of razor-clawed fun by activists should make headlines .
but front page news ?
annie liebowitz photo-shoots ?
imminent vanity fair cover stardom ?
read my lips : it 's … a … bear . nasty current affairs pushed to the sidelines bildunterschrift : the un security council debate on iran , the russian supreme court 's ban on one of last political parties left which opposes president putin , the 50th anniversary of the european union : all these stories were replaced on the front pages of the international press on saturday by cuddly knut .
and while he is much more appealing than comrade vlad , one has to ask why ? is it because , as germany 's opportunist environment minister sigmar gabriel said as he nervously interacted with the bear in front of the world 's media , knut is a symbol for global change ?
is the cub a beacon of hope for an ailing planet ?
is his survival against the odds a message that the human race should champion ?
possibly .
but i think there 's more to it than that … humans , like polar bears , are pretty hardy creatures .
we have to be to live in the world that we do .
if we were to actually sit and think about all the things going wrong around us and all the events which appear to be out of our control , there would be mass panic and chronic depression .
thankfully , we are blessed with the ability to crawl under a warm , mental blanket of denial when things get too much . knut the savior in a world gone mad ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forget your troubles by indulging yourself in some knut nothing helps more in the creation of denial than a distraction .
why worry about the state of the planet , when you can read about a cuddly polar bear cub discovering that sand does n't taste very nice ?
just as those pictures of knut taking his first drink from his enclosure 's moat pushed harder news to page four , so his big black eyes and innocent journey of discovery can push the realities of life further to the back of your mind . the current cult of knut , while it throws up many interesting questions , is really nothing to worry about .
his elevation to superstardom and worldwide fame is just the latest in a long line of respites which we should all embrace and enjoy .
knut 's time in the sun should be celebrated for as long as it lasts because before you know it , the front pages are going to be full of death and destruction again . so once again , " hooray " for knut for making the world - even for a short time - a fuzzier place . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is faces some serious issues , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

tehran claims the soldiers have confessed to being in iranian waters . the european union would underline its position in a statement to be issued later in the day , german foreign minister frank walter steinmeier said in berlin .
steinmeier told reporters the eu would " make clear we want an immediate liberation " of the british soldiers held by iran . the 15 servicemen were detained on friday after inspecting a vessel in the mouth of the shatt al-arab waterway that marks the southern stretch of iraq 's border with iran .
iran claimed they had violated its territorial waters , but britain said they were in international waters and demanded their release . as the diplomatic to-ing and fro-ing continued , iran said on announced that the soldiers had admitted to violating its territorial waters , rejecting demands from london for their swift release . tehran claims soldiers confessed to entering iranian waters the semi-official fars news agency said the personnel had been brought to the capital tehran for questioning about what they were doing during what britain insists was a " routine " anti-smuggling patrol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british marines carry out un missions in the gulf armed forces general staff spokesman general alireza afshar said the 15 had admitted to their interrogators that they knew they were inside iranian waters , contrary to the insistence of the british defense ministry that they had remained in iraqi waters . " they are currently being questioned and have admitted to violating the territorial waters of the islamic republic , " afshar told the fars agency . he told the arabic language service of state television : " we have solid evidence that they were detained in our territorial waters .
they themselves have confessed and admitted their mistake . " he accused the british military of seeking to " create a climate of tension at a moment when a -lrb- un security council -rrb- resolution on iran -lrb- over its controversial nuclear program -rrb- is to be put to the vote despite the fact that iran seeks calm and stability in the region " . " the questioning of the british sailors is continuing to try to establish their real intentions , " he added . earlier another iranian official told the fars agency that the authorities had proof from the seized vessels ' navigation equipment that the sailors had knowingly entered iranian waters . " the british troops who are in iran 's hands knew perfectly well that they were in iranian territorial waters .
their navigation equipment proves it , " said the official , whom the news agency did not name . " besides the explanations of the british sailors , data from the computerized navigation equipment on board the vessels seized shows that they knowingly entered iranian waters and stayed there . " our border guards did their duty , " he said , adding that the british navy should " pay more attention to its navigation equipment . " diplomats meet to end stand-off britain summoned iran 's ambassador in london for a second day running to hear a demand for the swift release of the britons . rasoul movahedian was seen by a senior civil servant at the foreign office on friday but was to be seen by junior minister lord david triesman for the new audience , a spokeswoman said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's elite revolutionary guard also patrol the gulf iran originally called the british operation an " illegal entry " into iranian waters as a " suspicious act " , the official irna news agency said on saturday , while fars said the british soldiers had been transferred to the capital tehran to explain their " aggressive action . " fars also said the captured britons included some women .
neither of these claims have been clarified .
" we have n't had any confirmation of that , " a british foreign office spokesman in london told reporters . " the foreign ministry 's spokesman called the illegal and interfering entry of british forces into iranian territorial waters a suspicious act and against international laws and rules and has harshly condemned it , " irna said . iran claims british had " unusual aims " the news agency also quoted foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini as saying : " violating the territory of other countries and non-permitted entrance ... show unusual aims and is against international treaties and there are no excuses for ignoring and not accepting the responsibility for that . " britain has claimed that the soldiers were detained in iraqi waters .
the foreign ministry has said that two boatloads of royal navy sailors and marines had searched a merchant vessel on a un approved mission in iraqi waters when iranian gunboats encircled and captured them . " we demanded they be released swiftly and safely , " the foreign office spokesman said .
" we are keeping a very close on it .
we are in contact with other governments in the region . " relations between iran and britain have deteriorated further in recent months after it was claimed that tehran was providing training and arms to shia insurgents in the south of iraq where the british are deployed . fragments of shell and bomb cases used in attacks on british troops are alleged to carry iranian stamps .
in turn , iran has accused british troops of carrying out missions over the iraqi border . abduction on eve of un vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emyr jones parry , britain 's un ambassador , is in new york for the vote the incident increases tensions in the region as iran faces un sanctions over its nuclear program that western governments believe is geared to making weapons . german foreign minister steinmeier said he was hopeful that the un security council would be able to agree this weekend on a resolution tightening sanctions against teheran . he said talks were under way with five non-permanent members of the security council who were not happy with the wording of the resolution .

" any suggestion that visa issues are the cause of president ahmadinejad 's decision not to travel to new york is false , " us deputy state department spokesman tom casey announdced saturday . on friday evening , the 15-member security council was still involved in last-minute haggling , with indonesia and qatar insisting on inserting a paragraph on the goal of establishing a " middle east free from weapons of mass destruction and all missiles for their delivery " into the draft . chinese ambassador wang guangya , whose country was among the six major powers which crafted the latest sanctions resolution , said efforts were continuing to accommodate south africa , indonesia and qatar , three non-permanent council members still unhappy with the latest amended text . " we have to see how council members react to the text put in blue -lrb- meaning readied for an imminent vote thursday -rrb- and see whether there are areas that can be improved to get more support , " he told reporters .
" i want all 15 council members on board . " britain 's un ambassador emyr jones parry , one of the draft 's co-sponsors , said thursday the plan was to have a vote on the text saturday . a western diplomat , speaking on condition of anonymity , said the text has the support of at least 12 council members . president passes up chance to present proposals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before issuing his cancellation , ahmadinejad had told french television thursday that he wanted to present what he called " new proposals " about the islamic republic 's nuclear program , which the major powers fear is a covert grab for an atomic bomb . he called the proposed un sanctions illegal , adding he was " not worried " by the prospect of us strikes against his country over the issue . the delicate diplomatic maneuvering here was unfolding amid fears for 15 british navy sailors seized by iran as they were conducting " routine " anti-smuggling checks in iraqi waters friday , according to the british ministry of defense . diplomats said the incident has no bearing on the sanctions debate here , but it comes amid rising tensions between iran and other countries . broad consensus on draft sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is broad , but not unanimous , support for sanctions late thursday , the security council members had fine-tuned minor changes made to the text agreed last week by the five veto-wielding permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany . but south africa expressed disappointment that its suggestions for a 90-day suspension of un sanctions to allow political negotiations with tehran , to remove the weapons ban and other financial sanctions were rejected . south africa , which dismantled its nuclear weapons program during its 1990s transition to democracy , has consistently defended iran 's right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes . indonesian ambassador rezlan ishar jenie also said friday : " we are not happy with the text .
there are important things that we see as not there . " he said the insertion of a paragraph on the middle east calling for a nuclear-free zone was " one important aspect i want to discuss today " . his qatari counterpart nassir abdulaziz al-nasser said he also wanted the paragraph included . trade , arms and travel restrictions planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran could be banned from exporting weapons the draft resolution under consideration would ban tehran from exporting arms , calls for voluntary trade sanctions and expands a list of officials and companies targeted for financial and travel restrictions . it builds on sanctions already adopted by the security council in december , including a ban on the sale of nuclear and ballistic missile-related materials to iran and a freeze on financial assets of iranians involved in illicit atomic and ballistic missile work . defying un demands , iran has refused to suspend its uranium enrichment work and rejected accusations that it is striving to produce nuclear weapons , insisting its program is designed to generate electricity . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de international crisis brews as iran awaits security council fate the un security council plus germany will meet on saturday to decide on possible sanctions against iran for failing to halt its contested uranium enrichment program .

but what does his elevation to superstardom say about us ? could it be that i slipped unnoticed into some kind of news narcolepsy over the last week ?
while other aspects of life seem to have carried on as normal in the past few days , there is a huge black hole in my memory concerning the most pertinent international current affairs stories . i must have slept peacefully through the release of the german hostages in iraq ; snored and dribbled through the resolution of the iran nuclear crisis and twitched fitfully as middle east peace broke out .
there can be no other reason for the dearth of serious topics on the front page of the international press and the omnipresent fuzzy visage of a baby polar bear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bono should have thought about doing this years ago do n't get me wrong .
if the first public appearance of knut the polar bear cub at berlin 's zoo is the most dramatic event facing mankind this week then i am truly happy .
his stumpy little moon-boot legs are much more appealing than the effects of car bombs in baghdad and when he rolled about with that soccer ball , well … it was like i 'd never heard of the third world .
so , " hooray " in all honesty and authenticity for knut . it says much for the state of the world that a cuddly polar bear cub can demand so much attention when there are so many uglier things going on .
knut 's arrival on the planet has had much more impact than 9-kilograms of arctic predator should realistically have .
sure , he is unbelievably cute ; yes , his story of survival is a heart-warming one , and of course , death threats aimed at the bundle of razor-clawed fun by activists should make headlines .
but front page news ?

read my lips : it 's … a … bear . nasty current affairs pushed to the sidelines bildunterschrift : the un security council debate on iran , the russian supreme court 's ban on one of last political parties left which opposes president putin , the 50th anniversary of the european union : all these stories were replaced on the front pages of the international press on saturday by cuddly knut .
and while he is much more appealing than comrade vlad , one has to ask why ? is it because , as germany 's opportunist environment minister sigmar gabriel said as he nervously interacted with the bear in front of the world 's media , knut is a symbol for global change ?
is the cub a beacon of hope for an ailing planet ?
is his survival against the odds a message that the human race should champion ?
possibly .
but i think there 's more to it than that … humans , like polar bears , are pretty hardy creatures .
we have to be to live in the world that we do .
if we were to actually sit and think about all the things going wrong around us and all the events which appear to be out of our control , there would be mass panic and chronic depression .
thankfully , we are blessed with the ability to crawl under a warm , mental blanket of denial when things get too much . knut the savior in a world gone mad ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forget your troubles by indulging yourself in some knut nothing helps more in the creation of denial than a distraction .
why worry about the state of the planet , when you can read about a cuddly polar bear cub discovering that sand does n't taste very nice ?
just as those pictures of knut taking his first drink from his enclosure 's moat pushed harder news to page four , so his big black eyes and innocent journey of discovery can push the realities of life further to the back of your mind . the current cult of knut , while it throws up many interesting questions , is really nothing to worry about .
his elevation to superstardom and worldwide fame is just the latest in a long line of respites which we should all embrace and enjoy .
knut 's time in the sun should be celebrated for as long as it lasts because before you know it , the front pages are going to be full of death and destruction again . so once again , " hooray " for knut for making the world - even for a short time - a fuzzier place . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is faces some serious issues , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .

so , " hooray " in all honesty and authenticity for knut . it says much for the state of the world that a cuddly polar bear cub can demand so much attention when there are so many uglier things going on .
knut 's arrival on the planet has had much more impact than 9-kilograms of arctic predator should realistically have .

" any suggestion that visa issues are the cause of president ahmadinejad 's decision not to travel to new york is false , " us deputy state department spokesman tom casey announdced saturday . on friday evening , the 15-member security council was still involved in last-minute haggling , with indonesia and qatar insisting on inserting a paragraph on the goal of establishing a " middle east free from weapons of mass destruction and all missiles for their delivery " into the draft . chinese ambassador wang guangya , whose country was among the six major powers which crafted the latest sanctions resolution , said efforts were continuing to accommodate south africa , indonesia and qatar , three non-permanent council members still unhappy with the latest amended text . " we have to see how council members react to the text put in blue -lrb- meaning readied for an imminent vote thursday -rrb- and see whether there are areas that can be improved to get more support , " he told reporters .
" i want all 15 council members on board . " britain 's un ambassador emyr jones parry , one of the draft 's co-sponsors , said thursday the plan was to have a vote on the text saturday . a western diplomat , speaking on condition of anonymity , said the text has the support of at least 12 council members . president passes up chance to present proposals bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : before issuing his cancellation , ahmadinejad had told french television thursday that he wanted to present what he called " new proposals " about the islamic republic 's nuclear program , which the major powers fear is a covert grab for an atomic bomb . he called the proposed un sanctions illegal , adding he was " not worried " by the prospect of us strikes against his country over the issue . the delicate diplomatic maneuvering here was unfolding amid fears for 15 british navy sailors seized by iran as they were conducting " routine " anti-smuggling checks in iraqi waters friday , according to the british ministry of defense . diplomats said the incident has no bearing on the sanctions debate here , but it comes amid rising tensions between iran and other countries . broad consensus on draft sanctions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : there is broad , but not unanimous , support for sanctions late thursday , the security council members had fine-tuned minor changes made to the text agreed last week by the five veto-wielding permanent members - britain , china , france , russia and the united states - plus germany . but south africa expressed disappointment that its suggestions for a 90-day suspension of un sanctions to allow political negotiations with tehran , to remove the weapons ban and other financial sanctions were rejected . south africa , which dismantled its nuclear weapons program during its 1990s transition to democracy , has consistently defended iran 's right to enrich uranium for peaceful purposes . indonesian ambassador rezlan ishar jenie also said friday : " we are not happy with the text .
there are important things that we see as not there . " he said the insertion of a paragraph on the middle east calling for a nuclear-free zone was " one important aspect i want to discuss today " . his qatari counterpart nassir abdulaziz al-nasser said he also wanted the paragraph included . trade , arms and travel restrictions planned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran could be banned from exporting weapons the draft resolution under consideration would ban tehran from exporting arms , calls for voluntary trade sanctions and expands a list of officials and companies targeted for financial and travel restrictions . it builds on sanctions already adopted by the security council in december , including a ban on the sale of nuclear and ballistic missile-related materials to iran and a freeze on financial assets of iranians involved in illicit atomic and ballistic missile work . defying un demands , iran has refused to suspend its uranium enrichment work and rejected accusations that it is striving to produce nuclear weapons , insisting its program is designed to generate electricity . dw staff / afp -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de international crisis brews as iran awaits security council fate the un security council plus germany will meet on saturday to decide on possible sanctions against iran for failing to halt its contested uranium enrichment program .

the eu says , give the council more time . cuba is leading a bid by a number of countries to strip the human rights council of its power to investigate and condemn violations of human rights , a move some activists warn could jeopardize the entire un 's credibility , the news agency reuters reported .
the 47 member states of the new un watchdog , which was set up last year to replace its discredited predecessor , are quietly negotiating a package of measures which will define its role .
at stake is the fate of " special procedures " - independent investigators appointed to report on countries where abuses are suspected .
the former secretary general kofi annan described these rapporteurs as the " crown jewels " of the un human rights machinery .
" our fear is that some governments are trying to sell the crown jewels , trying to undermine the independence of special procedures , " irene khan , secretary general of amnesty international , told reporters in geneva .

cuba - which has never allowed a visit by the special rapporteur on cuba , christine chanet - is leading the charge to dismantle country investigators .

" with his height and power , koller is a dangerous man , especially with his long legs and we 'll have to control his airspace , particularly at corners , " said metzelder . while keeper jens lehmann will be trying to keep koller quiet , at the other end , germany 's strikers podolski and kuranyi will be doing their best to unnerve czech keeper petr cech . cech fighting fit to face germans bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : czech goalie petr cech will face chelsea team-mate ballack the 24-year-old chelsea goalkeeper suffered a fractured skull in a premiership match last october , but he is back to his best and sporting a protective rugby head guard .

" i am not afraid .
i have got used to the helmet .
it does n't bother me ; there is n't anything for me to worry about . " cech will be tested by the german pair eager to impress coach löw , who is defending his unbeaten record having won six games and drawn one since replacing jürgen klinsmann after last year 's world cup . with the 2006 world cup 's top goal-scorer miroslav klose ruled out after struggling with a back injury , his able deputies are relishing the challenge . " it 's a blow to be without miroslav klose , " said bayern munich 's podolski , " but we must be able to substitute for him and forge a partnership .

tehran claims the soldiers have confessed to being in iranian waters . the european union would underline its position in a statement to be issued later in the day , german foreign minister frank walter steinmeier said in berlin .
steinmeier told reporters the eu would " make clear we want an immediate liberation " of the british soldiers held by iran . the 15 servicemen were detained on friday after inspecting a vessel in the mouth of the shatt al-arab waterway that marks the southern stretch of iraq 's border with iran .
iran claimed they had violated its territorial waters , but britain said they were in international waters and demanded their release . as the diplomatic to-ing and fro-ing continued , iran said on announced that the soldiers had admitted to violating its territorial waters , rejecting demands from london for their swift release . tehran claims soldiers confessed to entering iranian waters the semi-official fars news agency said the personnel had been brought to the capital tehran for questioning about what they were doing during what britain insists was a " routine " anti-smuggling patrol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british marines carry out un missions in the gulf armed forces general staff spokesman general alireza afshar said the 15 had admitted to their interrogators that they knew they were inside iranian waters , contrary to the insistence of the british defense ministry that they had remained in iraqi waters . " they are currently being questioned and have admitted to violating the territorial waters of the islamic republic , " afshar told the fars agency . he told the arabic language service of state television : " we have solid evidence that they were detained in our territorial waters .
they themselves have confessed and admitted their mistake . " he accused the british military of seeking to " create a climate of tension at a moment when a -lrb- un security council -rrb- resolution on iran -lrb- over its controversial nuclear program -rrb- is to be put to the vote despite the fact that iran seeks calm and stability in the region " . " the questioning of the british sailors is continuing to try to establish their real intentions , " he added . earlier another iranian official told the fars agency that the authorities had proof from the seized vessels ' navigation equipment that the sailors had knowingly entered iranian waters . " the british troops who are in iran 's hands knew perfectly well that they were in iranian territorial waters .
their navigation equipment proves it , " said the official , whom the news agency did not name . " besides the explanations of the british sailors , data from the computerized navigation equipment on board the vessels seized shows that they knowingly entered iranian waters and stayed there . " our border guards did their duty , " he said , adding that the british navy should " pay more attention to its navigation equipment . " diplomats meet to end stand-off britain summoned iran 's ambassador in london for a second day running to hear a demand for the swift release of the britons . rasoul movahedian was seen by a senior civil servant at the foreign office on friday but was to be seen by junior minister lord david triesman for the new audience , a spokeswoman said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's elite revolutionary guard also patrol the gulf iran originally called the british operation an " illegal entry " into iranian waters as a " suspicious act " , the official irna news agency said on saturday , while fars said the british soldiers had been transferred to the capital tehran to explain their " aggressive action . " fars also said the captured britons included some women .
neither of these claims have been clarified .
" we have n't had any confirmation of that , " a british foreign office spokesman in london told reporters . " the foreign ministry 's spokesman called the illegal and interfering entry of british forces into iranian territorial waters a suspicious act and against international laws and rules and has harshly condemned it , " irna said . iran claims british had " unusual aims " the news agency also quoted foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini as saying : " violating the territory of other countries and non-permitted entrance ... show unusual aims and is against international treaties and there are no excuses for ignoring and not accepting the responsibility for that . " britain has claimed that the soldiers were detained in iraqi waters .
the foreign ministry has said that two boatloads of royal navy sailors and marines had searched a merchant vessel on a un approved mission in iraqi waters when iranian gunboats encircled and captured them . " we demanded they be released swiftly and safely , " the foreign office spokesman said .
" we are keeping a very close on it .
we are in contact with other governments in the region . " relations between iran and britain have deteriorated further in recent months after it was claimed that tehran was providing training and arms to shia insurgents in the south of iraq where the british are deployed . fragments of shell and bomb cases used in attacks on british troops are alleged to carry iranian stamps .
in turn , iran has accused british troops of carrying out missions over the iraqi border . abduction on eve of un vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emyr jones parry , britain 's un ambassador , is in new york for the vote the incident increases tensions in the region as iran faces un sanctions over its nuclear program that western governments believe is geared to making weapons . german foreign minister steinmeier said he was hopeful that the un security council would be able to agree this weekend on a resolution tightening sanctions against teheran . he said talks were under way with five non-permanent members of the security council who were not happy with the wording of the resolution .

tehran claims the soldiers have confessed to being in iranian waters . the european union would underline its position in a statement to be issued later in the day , german foreign minister frank walter steinmeier said in berlin .
steinmeier told reporters the eu would " make clear we want an immediate liberation " of the british soldiers held by iran . the 15 servicemen were detained on friday after inspecting a vessel in the mouth of the shatt al-arab waterway that marks the southern stretch of iraq 's border with iran .
iran claimed they had violated its territorial waters , but britain said they were in international waters and demanded their release . as the diplomatic to-ing and fro-ing continued , iran said on announced that the soldiers had admitted to violating its territorial waters , rejecting demands from london for their swift release . tehran claims soldiers confessed to entering iranian waters the semi-official fars news agency said the personnel had been brought to the capital tehran for questioning about what they were doing during what britain insists was a " routine " anti-smuggling patrol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british marines carry out un missions in the gulf armed forces general staff spokesman general alireza afshar said the 15 had admitted to their interrogators that they knew they were inside iranian waters , contrary to the insistence of the british defense ministry that they had remained in iraqi waters . " they are currently being questioned and have admitted to violating the territorial waters of the islamic republic , " afshar told the fars agency . he told the arabic language service of state television : " we have solid evidence that they were detained in our territorial waters .
they themselves have confessed and admitted their mistake . " he accused the british military of seeking to " create a climate of tension at a moment when a -lrb- un security council -rrb- resolution on iran -lrb- over its controversial nuclear program -rrb- is to be put to the vote despite the fact that iran seeks calm and stability in the region " . " the questioning of the british sailors is continuing to try to establish their real intentions , " he added . earlier another iranian official told the fars agency that the authorities had proof from the seized vessels ' navigation equipment that the sailors had knowingly entered iranian waters . " the british troops who are in iran 's hands knew perfectly well that they were in iranian territorial waters .
their navigation equipment proves it , " said the official , whom the news agency did not name . " besides the explanations of the british sailors , data from the computerized navigation equipment on board the vessels seized shows that they knowingly entered iranian waters and stayed there . " our border guards did their duty , " he said , adding that the british navy should " pay more attention to its navigation equipment . " diplomats meet to end stand-off britain summoned iran 's ambassador in london for a second day running to hear a demand for the swift release of the britons . rasoul movahedian was seen by a senior civil servant at the foreign office on friday but was to be seen by junior minister lord david triesman for the new audience , a spokeswoman said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's elite revolutionary guard also patrol the gulf iran originally called the british operation an " illegal entry " into iranian waters as a " suspicious act " , the official irna news agency said on saturday , while fars said the british soldiers had been transferred to the capital tehran to explain their " aggressive action . " fars also said the captured britons included some women .
neither of these claims have been clarified .
" we have n't had any confirmation of that , " a british foreign office spokesman in london told reporters . " the foreign ministry 's spokesman called the illegal and interfering entry of british forces into iranian territorial waters a suspicious act and against international laws and rules and has harshly condemned it , " irna said . iran claims british had " unusual aims " the news agency also quoted foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini as saying : " violating the territory of other countries and non-permitted entrance ... show unusual aims and is against international treaties and there are no excuses for ignoring and not accepting the responsibility for that . " britain has claimed that the soldiers were detained in iraqi waters .
the foreign ministry has said that two boatloads of royal navy sailors and marines had searched a merchant vessel on a un approved mission in iraqi waters when iranian gunboats encircled and captured them . " we demanded they be released swiftly and safely , " the foreign office spokesman said .
" we are keeping a very close on it .
we are in contact with other governments in the region . " relations between iran and britain have deteriorated further in recent months after it was claimed that tehran was providing training and arms to shia insurgents in the south of iraq where the british are deployed . fragments of shell and bomb cases used in attacks on british troops are alleged to carry iranian stamps .
in turn , iran has accused british troops of carrying out missions over the iraqi border . abduction on eve of un vote bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : emyr jones parry , britain 's un ambassador , is in new york for the vote the incident increases tensions in the region as iran faces un sanctions over its nuclear program that western governments believe is geared to making weapons . german foreign minister steinmeier said he was hopeful that the un security council would be able to agree this weekend on a resolution tightening sanctions against teheran . he said talks were under way with five non-permanent members of the security council who were not happy with the wording of the resolution .

the eu says , give the council more time . cuba is leading a bid by a number of countries to strip the human rights council of its power to investigate and condemn violations of human rights , a move some activists warn could jeopardize the entire un 's credibility , the news agency reuters reported .
the 47 member states of the new un watchdog , which was set up last year to replace its discredited predecessor , are quietly negotiating a package of measures which will define its role .
at stake is the fate of " special procedures " - independent investigators appointed to report on countries where abuses are suspected .
the former secretary general kofi annan described these rapporteurs as the " crown jewels " of the un human rights machinery .
" our fear is that some governments are trying to sell the crown jewels , trying to undermine the independence of special procedures , " irene khan , secretary general of amnesty international , told reporters in geneva .

they want to abolish the investigators .
cuba - which has never allowed a visit by the special rapporteur on cuba , christine chanet - is leading the charge to dismantle country investigators .
those opposed want that countries should submit their own reports on their domestic records .
they add there intrusive investigators are unnecessary .
" the perpetuation of country-specific mandates , imposed by force and blackmail , would maintain the spiraling confrontation that did away with the authority and credibility of the defunct commission on human rights , " cuban foreign minister felipe perez roque said in a speech last week .
eu supportive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both kofi annan and ban ki-moon worried over the council the european union says that it is fighting to preserve the special procedures , as well as the forum 's ability to adopt resolutions condemning countries for the worst violations .

the eu says , give the council more time . cuba is leading a bid by a number of countries to strip the human rights council of its power to investigate and condemn violations of human rights , a move some activists warn could jeopardize the entire un 's credibility , the news agency reuters reported .
the 47 member states of the new un watchdog , which was set up last year to replace its discredited predecessor , are quietly negotiating a package of measures which will define its role .
at stake is the fate of " special procedures " - independent investigators appointed to report on countries where abuses are suspected .
the former secretary general kofi annan described these rapporteurs as the " crown jewels " of the un human rights machinery .
" our fear is that some governments are trying to sell the crown jewels , trying to undermine the independence of special procedures , " irene khan , secretary general of amnesty international , told reporters in geneva .
" there are huge stakes here for human rights , not only for survivors of abuses but the credibility of the council and the larger credibility of the united nations , " she said .
politically motivated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us declined a seat on the human rights council its 13 special rapporteurs on countries , retained for now from the former un commission on human rights , include experts probing suspected abuses in belarus , cuba , sudan and north korea .
one such investigator , nobel peace laureate jody williams , issued a much-anticipated report on darfur march 12 which blamed sudan for orchestrating war crimes across darfur .
still , some countries singled out for this attention , and their allies such as china , say such finger-pointing is selective and politically motivated .
they want to abolish the investigators .
cuba - which has never allowed a visit by the special rapporteur on cuba , christine chanet - is leading the charge to dismantle country investigators .
those opposed want that countries should submit their own reports on their domestic records .
they add there intrusive investigators are unnecessary .
" the perpetuation of country-specific mandates , imposed by force and blackmail , would maintain the spiraling confrontation that did away with the authority and credibility of the defunct commission on human rights , " cuban foreign minister felipe perez roque said in a speech last week .
eu supportive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both kofi annan and ban ki-moon worried over the council the european union says that it is fighting to preserve the special procedures , as well as the forum 's ability to adopt resolutions condemning countries for the worst violations .
" when secretary general ban ki-moon took office , he said , ' the world is watching to see whether this young council will live up to its promise , " ' one eu official said .
" we have n't given the council enough time . "
others say the investigators are vital .
" special procedures are independent and efficient - that is why they are under attack , " reed brody , counsel at the new york-based group human rights watch told reuters .

" they will be fit for work when they have the chance to get a regular job , " he said .
" we needed to try out a new idea and that had to be better than doing nothing . " in setting the scheme up , care had to be taken not to put existing jobs at risk , particularly in small and medium-sized businesses . as a result of the scheme the town 's old people 's home now has 13 extra staff to help out with the daily chores .
the home 's boss , lothar neumann , claims the scheme has been a great success . " our community service workers are here to help our clients pass the day more pleasantly , " he said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the picturesque town of bad schmiedeberg in saxony anhalt " they accompany them throughout the day and listen to their individual wishes .
for example , they take them for walks , talk to them and look after their pets . " they also assist with therapy and help prepare old people ’ s birthday parties or they just read out loud for them from newspaper articles . " everyone appears to benefit forty-one-year-old antje litschewski , who works as a community service worker at the old people 's home , claims the scheme has been good for the jobless as well as residents of the home . " i ’ d been unemployed for the last four years with no chance at all of getting a job on the regular labor market , " she said .
" now the situation is a lot better , financially as well .
i get some 300 euros -lrb- $ 400 -rrb- more than i used to . ” “ i really feel needed here .

" any suggestion that visa issues are the cause of president ahmadinejad 's decision not to travel to new york is false , " us deputy state department spokesman tom casey announdced saturday . on friday evening , the 15-member security council was still involved in last-minute haggling , with indonesia and qatar insisting on inserting a paragraph on the goal of establishing a " middle east free from weapons of mass destruction and all missiles for their delivery " into the draft . chinese ambassador wang guangya , whose country was among the six major powers which crafted the latest sanctions resolution , said efforts were continuing to accommodate south africa , indonesia and qatar , three non-permanent council members still unhappy with the latest amended text . " we have to see how council members react to the text put in blue -lrb- meaning readied for an imminent vote thursday -rrb- and see whether there are areas that can be improved to get more support , " he told reporters .
" i want all 15 council members on board .

tehran claims the soldiers have confessed to being in iranian waters . the european union would underline its position in a statement to be issued later in the day , german foreign minister frank walter steinmeier said in berlin .
steinmeier told reporters the eu would " make clear we want an immediate liberation " of the british soldiers held by iran . the 15 servicemen were detained on friday after inspecting a vessel in the mouth of the shatt al-arab waterway that marks the southern stretch of iraq 's border with iran .
iran claimed they had violated its territorial waters , but britain said they were in international waters and demanded their release . as the diplomatic to-ing and fro-ing continued , iran said on announced that the soldiers had admitted to violating its territorial waters , rejecting demands from london for their swift release . tehran claims soldiers confessed to entering iranian waters the semi-official fars news agency said the personnel had been brought to the capital tehran for questioning about what they were doing during what britain insists was a " routine " anti-smuggling patrol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british marines carry out un missions in the gulf armed forces general staff spokesman general alireza afshar said the 15 had admitted to their interrogators that they knew they were inside iranian waters , contrary to the insistence of the british defense ministry that they had remained in iraqi waters . " they are currently being questioned and have admitted to violating the territorial waters of the islamic republic , " afshar told the fars agency . he told the arabic language service of state television : " we have solid evidence that they were detained in our territorial waters .
they themselves have confessed and admitted their mistake . " he accused the british military of seeking to " create a climate of tension at a moment when a -lrb- un security council -rrb- resolution on iran -lrb- over its controversial nuclear program -rrb- is to be put to the vote despite the fact that iran seeks calm and stability in the region " . " the questioning of the british sailors is continuing to try to establish their real intentions , " he added . earlier another iranian official told the fars agency that the authorities had proof from the seized vessels ' navigation equipment that the sailors had knowingly entered iranian waters . " the british troops who are in iran 's hands knew perfectly well that they were in iranian territorial waters .
their navigation equipment proves it , " said the official , whom the news agency did not name . " besides the explanations of the british sailors , data from the computerized navigation equipment on board the vessels seized shows that they knowingly entered iranian waters and stayed there . " our border guards did their duty , " he said , adding that the british navy should " pay more attention to its navigation equipment . " diplomats meet to end stand-off britain summoned iran 's ambassador in london for a second day running to hear a demand for the swift release of the britons . rasoul movahedian was seen by a senior civil servant at the foreign office on friday but was to be seen by junior minister lord david triesman for the new audience , a spokeswoman said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's elite revolutionary guard also patrol the gulf iran originally called the british operation an " illegal entry " into iranian waters as a " suspicious act " , the official irna news agency said on saturday , while fars said the british soldiers had been transferred to the capital tehran to explain their " aggressive action . " fars also said the captured britons included some women .
neither of these claims have been clarified .
" we have n't had any confirmation of that , " a british foreign office spokesman in london told reporters . " the foreign ministry 's spokesman called the illegal and interfering entry of british forces into iranian territorial waters a suspicious act and against international laws and rules and has harshly condemned it , " irna said . iran claims british had " unusual aims " the news agency also quoted foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini as saying : " violating the territory of other countries and non-permitted entrance ... show unusual aims and is against international treaties and there are no excuses for ignoring and not accepting the responsibility for that . " britain has claimed that the soldiers were detained in iraqi waters .
the foreign ministry has said that two boatloads of royal navy sailors and marines had searched a merchant vessel on a un approved mission in iraqi waters when iranian gunboats encircled and captured them . " we demanded they be released swiftly and safely , " the foreign office spokesman said .
" we are keeping a very close on it .
we are in contact with other governments in the region .

while other aspects of life seem to have carried on as normal in the past few days , there is a huge black hole in my memory concerning the most pertinent international current affairs stories . i must have slept peacefully through the release of the german hostages in iraq ; snored and dribbled through the resolution of the iran nuclear crisis and twitched fitfully as middle east peace broke out .

it 's an issue that divides member states down the middle as they work towards ratification . when she took over the rotating eu presidency in january this year , german chancellor angela merkel declared it her aim to revive the eu constitution , but she also opened another can of worms , reviving the debate on whether to mention europe 's christian heritage in the proposed constitution . following a meeting with pope benedict xvi in 2006 , merkel reaffirmed her support for a christian values clause . " i believe this treaty should be linked to christianity and god because christianity was decisive in the formation of europe , " she said . two sides who can never agree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliament agreed on the text , but not without discontent from some . the debate around europe 's common history and beliefs polarizes christians and secularists .
christian democrats hans-gert pöttering , the german mep who took over the european parliament 's presidency in 2006 , sees his christian faith as intrinsic to his politics and stated the eu constitution was a " holy text " . pöttering is the leader of the european people 's party , a grouping which is the largest europe-wide party in the parliament and a coalition of center-right , christian democratic national parties . staunchly catholic poland also made it clear that it would like to see christian values enshrined in the constitution as did seven other national governments who were pressed on the subject - italy , lithuania , malta , portugal , czech republic , slovakia and ireland . ultimately however , they found themselves in the minority , and the compromise position reached by the eu was a simple reference to europe 's " cultural , religious and humanist heritage . " committed believers wo n't give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch -lrb- and their cows -rrb- voted no . that proponents have refused to fall silent following their defeat on this issue , is an indication the passion the christian values debate arouses .
opponents are just as committed to keeping the so-called " god clause " out , and they are frustrated at the revival of a battle they thought had been won . " the chancellor 's statement brings into question once more a compromise that was difficult enough to achieve .
it is not helpful to reopen a discussion that has been closed , " said martin schulz , the german mep and socialist leader in the european parliament , following merkel 's statements . because this debate centers on personal belief , both sides struggle to make concessions or understand conflicting viewpoints .
dr jan palmowski , senior lecturer in european and german politics at kings college , london says it is " hard for secularists to understand why those who feel so strongly about religion can not compromise . " treaty stuck in legal limbo the eu constitution , drafted by the european convention amid furious wrangling in 2004 , is in a state of political limbo after being rejected by the french and dutch in referenda held in mid-2005 .
proponents of the constitution argue it is necessary to give the eu workable mechanisms for reaching decisions . sweden , denmark and belgium lined up firmly behind france , which holds fast to long established secular principles . the 2004 french foreign minister michel barnier said firmly during initial negotiations " europe is not a judaeo-christian club . " palmowski also argues , as do other commentators , that there is the political question of turkey 's application for eu membership in this debate .
if europe is defined as being christian , then clearly islamic turkey is n't a european country .
and while merkel has stressed that she does n't believe that the european union is a " christian club " , conservative opposition to turkey 's membership is well-known . many do n't want to talk about it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestant and catholic - two german leaders both want god in constitution . defining who is and is n't entitled to be called european also concerns the european network against racism -lrb- enar -rrb- , a network of ngos across eu member states . " there is no denying that christianity has made a decisive contribution to european identity , but then so has judaism and islam , both present for centuries on european soil , " said enar chair bashy quraishy , who would like to see all religions included or none at all . but despite passionate debate , the members recognise that the constitution has a is about more than just values .
" religion not a make or break issue here , " palmowski says .
" even in 2004 the tensions were really about the weighting given to spain and poland in the voting structure , religion is not a decisive factor . " hanneli ebding , director of federal europe , an independent ngo lobby in brussels for the constitution in its present form , does n't see the religion debate intruding on a practical level .
" it 's just not being visibly discussed , " she said . reviving the constitutional process most analysts believe that the defeats in france and the netherlands were as a result of dissatisfaction with the constitution 's plans for expansion of members , the euro-zone , and national governments .
statements about religion do not seem to have been a significant factor .
the french were demonstrating their discontent with president jacques chirac , while many dutch felt that european integration was moving too fast . merkel has declared she will use germany 's presidency of the eu , which it holds until the end of june 2007 , to get the constitution back on the rails .
she faces a tough sell even without the " god clause " issue , with the czechs , poles , british , dutch and french expected to be the most difficult countries to win over , she may be hoping for divine intervention . emma wynne send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german eu constitution plans get mixed reception in berlin german plans to put forward new proposals on the stalled eu constitutional process drew support from denmark but hesitancy from the czech republic tuesday .

it 's an issue that divides member states down the middle as they work towards ratification . when she took over the rotating eu presidency in january this year , german chancellor angela merkel declared it her aim to revive the eu constitution , but she also opened another can of worms , reviving the debate on whether to mention europe 's christian heritage in the proposed constitution . following a meeting with pope benedict xvi in 2006 , merkel reaffirmed her support for a christian values clause . " i believe this treaty should be linked to christianity and god because christianity was decisive in the formation of europe , " she said . two sides who can never agree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliament agreed on the text , but not without discontent from some . the debate around europe 's common history and beliefs polarizes christians and secularists .
christian democrats hans-gert pöttering , the german mep who took over the european parliament 's presidency in 2006 , sees his christian faith as intrinsic to his politics and stated the eu constitution was a " holy text " . pöttering is the leader of the european people 's party , a grouping which is the largest europe-wide party in the parliament and a coalition of center-right , christian democratic national parties . staunchly catholic poland also made it clear that it would like to see christian values enshrined in the constitution as did seven other national governments who were pressed on the subject - italy , lithuania , malta , portugal , czech republic , slovakia and ireland . ultimately however , they found themselves in the minority , and the compromise position reached by the eu was a simple reference to europe 's " cultural , religious and humanist heritage .

opponents are just as committed to keeping the so-called " god clause " out , and they are frustrated at the revival of a battle they thought had been won . " the chancellor 's statement brings into question once more a compromise that was difficult enough to achieve .
it is not helpful to reopen a discussion that has been closed , " said martin schulz , the german mep and socialist leader in the european parliament , following merkel 's statements . because this debate centers on personal belief , both sides struggle to make concessions or understand conflicting viewpoints .
dr jan palmowski , senior lecturer in european and german politics at kings college , london says it is " hard for secularists to understand why those who feel so strongly about religion can not compromise . " treaty stuck in legal limbo the eu constitution , drafted by the european convention amid furious wrangling in 2004 , is in a state of political limbo after being rejected by the french and dutch in referenda held in mid-2005 .
proponents of the constitution argue it is necessary to give the eu workable mechanisms for reaching decisions . sweden , denmark and belgium lined up firmly behind france , which holds fast to long established secular principles . the 2004 french foreign minister michel barnier said firmly during initial negotiations " europe is not a judaeo-christian club .

it 's an issue that divides member states down the middle as they work towards ratification . when she took over the rotating eu presidency in january this year , german chancellor angela merkel declared it her aim to revive the eu constitution , but she also opened another can of worms , reviving the debate on whether to mention europe 's christian heritage in the proposed constitution . following a meeting with pope benedict xvi in 2006 , merkel reaffirmed her support for a christian values clause . " i believe this treaty should be linked to christianity and god because christianity was decisive in the formation of europe , " she said . two sides who can never agree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliament agreed on the text , but not without discontent from some . the debate around europe 's common history and beliefs polarizes christians and secularists .
christian democrats hans-gert pöttering , the german mep who took over the european parliament 's presidency in 2006 , sees his christian faith as intrinsic to his politics and stated the eu constitution was a " holy text " . pöttering is the leader of the european people 's party , a grouping which is the largest europe-wide party in the parliament and a coalition of center-right , christian democratic national parties . staunchly catholic poland also made it clear that it would like to see christian values enshrined in the constitution as did seven other national governments who were pressed on the subject - italy , lithuania , malta , portugal , czech republic , slovakia and ireland . ultimately however , they found themselves in the minority , and the compromise position reached by the eu was a simple reference to europe 's " cultural , religious and humanist heritage . " committed believers wo n't give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch -lrb- and their cows -rrb- voted no . that proponents have refused to fall silent following their defeat on this issue , is an indication the passion the christian values debate arouses .
opponents are just as committed to keeping the so-called " god clause " out , and they are frustrated at the revival of a battle they thought had been won . " the chancellor 's statement brings into question once more a compromise that was difficult enough to achieve .
it is not helpful to reopen a discussion that has been closed , " said martin schulz , the german mep and socialist leader in the european parliament , following merkel 's statements . because this debate centers on personal belief , both sides struggle to make concessions or understand conflicting viewpoints .
dr jan palmowski , senior lecturer in european and german politics at kings college , london says it is " hard for secularists to understand why those who feel so strongly about religion can not compromise . " treaty stuck in legal limbo the eu constitution , drafted by the european convention amid furious wrangling in 2004 , is in a state of political limbo after being rejected by the french and dutch in referenda held in mid-2005 .
proponents of the constitution argue it is necessary to give the eu workable mechanisms for reaching decisions . sweden , denmark and belgium lined up firmly behind france , which holds fast to long established secular principles . the 2004 french foreign minister michel barnier said firmly during initial negotiations " europe is not a judaeo-christian club . " palmowski also argues , as do other commentators , that there is the political question of turkey 's application for eu membership in this debate .
if europe is defined as being christian , then clearly islamic turkey is n't a european country .
and while merkel has stressed that she does n't believe that the european union is a " christian club " , conservative opposition to turkey 's membership is well-known . many do n't want to talk about it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestant and catholic - two german leaders both want god in constitution . defining who is and is n't entitled to be called european also concerns the european network against racism -lrb- enar -rrb- , a network of ngos across eu member states . " there is no denying that christianity has made a decisive contribution to european identity , but then so has judaism and islam , both present for centuries on european soil , " said enar chair bashy quraishy , who would like to see all religions included or none at all . but despite passionate debate , the members recognise that the constitution has a is about more than just values .
" religion not a make or break issue here , " palmowski says .
" even in 2004 the tensions were really about the weighting given to spain and poland in the voting structure , religion is not a decisive factor . " hanneli ebding , director of federal europe , an independent ngo lobby in brussels for the constitution in its present form , does n't see the religion debate intruding on a practical level .
" it 's just not being visibly discussed , " she said . reviving the constitutional process most analysts believe that the defeats in france and the netherlands were as a result of dissatisfaction with the constitution 's plans for expansion of members , the euro-zone , and national governments .
statements about religion do not seem to have been a significant factor .
the french were demonstrating their discontent with president jacques chirac , while many dutch felt that european integration was moving too fast . merkel has declared she will use germany 's presidency of the eu , which it holds until the end of june 2007 , to get the constitution back on the rails .
she faces a tough sell even without the " god clause " issue , with the czechs , poles , british , dutch and french expected to be the most difficult countries to win over , she may be hoping for divine intervention . emma wynne send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german eu constitution plans get mixed reception in berlin german plans to put forward new proposals on the stalled eu constitutional process drew support from denmark but hesitancy from the czech republic tuesday .

it 's an issue that divides member states down the middle as they work towards ratification . when she took over the rotating eu presidency in january this year , german chancellor angela merkel declared it her aim to revive the eu constitution , but she also opened another can of worms , reviving the debate on whether to mention europe 's christian heritage in the proposed constitution . following a meeting with pope benedict xvi in 2006 , merkel reaffirmed her support for a christian values clause . " i believe this treaty should be linked to christianity and god because christianity was decisive in the formation of europe , " she said . two sides who can never agree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliament agreed on the text , but not without discontent from some . the debate around europe 's common history and beliefs polarizes christians and secularists .
christian democrats hans-gert pöttering , the german mep who took over the european parliament 's presidency in 2006 , sees his christian faith as intrinsic to his politics and stated the eu constitution was a " holy text " . pöttering is the leader of the european people 's party , a grouping which is the largest europe-wide party in the parliament and a coalition of center-right , christian democratic national parties . staunchly catholic poland also made it clear that it would like to see christian values enshrined in the constitution as did seven other national governments who were pressed on the subject - italy , lithuania , malta , portugal , czech republic , slovakia and ireland . ultimately however , they found themselves in the minority , and the compromise position reached by the eu was a simple reference to europe 's " cultural , religious and humanist heritage . " committed believers wo n't give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch -lrb- and their cows -rrb- voted no . that proponents have refused to fall silent following their defeat on this issue , is an indication the passion the christian values debate arouses .
opponents are just as committed to keeping the so-called " god clause " out , and they are frustrated at the revival of a battle they thought had been won . " the chancellor 's statement brings into question once more a compromise that was difficult enough to achieve .
it is not helpful to reopen a discussion that has been closed , " said martin schulz , the german mep and socialist leader in the european parliament , following merkel 's statements . because this debate centers on personal belief , both sides struggle to make concessions or understand conflicting viewpoints .
dr jan palmowski , senior lecturer in european and german politics at kings college , london says it is " hard for secularists to understand why those who feel so strongly about religion can not compromise . " treaty stuck in legal limbo the eu constitution , drafted by the european convention amid furious wrangling in 2004 , is in a state of political limbo after being rejected by the french and dutch in referenda held in mid-2005 .
proponents of the constitution argue it is necessary to give the eu workable mechanisms for reaching decisions . sweden , denmark and belgium lined up firmly behind france , which holds fast to long established secular principles . the 2004 french foreign minister michel barnier said firmly during initial negotiations " europe is not a judaeo-christian club . " palmowski also argues , as do other commentators , that there is the political question of turkey 's application for eu membership in this debate .
if europe is defined as being christian , then clearly islamic turkey is n't a european country .
and while merkel has stressed that she does n't believe that the european union is a " christian club " , conservative opposition to turkey 's membership is well-known . many do n't want to talk about it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestant and catholic - two german leaders both want god in constitution . defining who is and is n't entitled to be called european also concerns the european network against racism -lrb- enar -rrb- , a network of ngos across eu member states .

the former secretary general kofi annan described these rapporteurs as the " crown jewels " of the un human rights machinery .
" our fear is that some governments are trying to sell the crown jewels , trying to undermine the independence of special procedures , " irene khan , secretary general of amnesty international , told reporters in geneva .

it 's an issue that divides member states down the middle as they work towards ratification . when she took over the rotating eu presidency in january this year , german chancellor angela merkel declared it her aim to revive the eu constitution , but she also opened another can of worms , reviving the debate on whether to mention europe 's christian heritage in the proposed constitution . following a meeting with pope benedict xvi in 2006 , merkel reaffirmed her support for a christian values clause . " i believe this treaty should be linked to christianity and god because christianity was decisive in the formation of europe , " she said . two sides who can never agree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliament agreed on the text , but not without discontent from some . the debate around europe 's common history and beliefs polarizes christians and secularists .
christian democrats hans-gert pöttering , the german mep who took over the european parliament 's presidency in 2006 , sees his christian faith as intrinsic to his politics and stated the eu constitution was a " holy text " . pöttering is the leader of the european people 's party , a grouping which is the largest europe-wide party in the parliament and a coalition of center-right , christian democratic national parties . staunchly catholic poland also made it clear that it would like to see christian values enshrined in the constitution as did seven other national governments who were pressed on the subject - italy , lithuania , malta , portugal , czech republic , slovakia and ireland . ultimately however , they found themselves in the minority , and the compromise position reached by the eu was a simple reference to europe 's " cultural , religious and humanist heritage . " committed believers wo n't give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch -lrb- and their cows -rrb- voted no . that proponents have refused to fall silent following their defeat on this issue , is an indication the passion the christian values debate arouses .
opponents are just as committed to keeping the so-called " god clause " out , and they are frustrated at the revival of a battle they thought had been won . " the chancellor 's statement brings into question once more a compromise that was difficult enough to achieve .
it is not helpful to reopen a discussion that has been closed , " said martin schulz , the german mep and socialist leader in the european parliament , following merkel 's statements . because this debate centers on personal belief , both sides struggle to make concessions or understand conflicting viewpoints .
dr jan palmowski , senior lecturer in european and german politics at kings college , london says it is " hard for secularists to understand why those who feel so strongly about religion can not compromise . " treaty stuck in legal limbo the eu constitution , drafted by the european convention amid furious wrangling in 2004 , is in a state of political limbo after being rejected by the french and dutch in referenda held in mid-2005 .
proponents of the constitution argue it is necessary to give the eu workable mechanisms for reaching decisions . sweden , denmark and belgium lined up firmly behind france , which holds fast to long established secular principles . the 2004 french foreign minister michel barnier said firmly during initial negotiations " europe is not a judaeo-christian club . " palmowski also argues , as do other commentators , that there is the political question of turkey 's application for eu membership in this debate .
if europe is defined as being christian , then clearly islamic turkey is n't a european country .
and while merkel has stressed that she does n't believe that the european union is a " christian club " , conservative opposition to turkey 's membership is well-known . many do n't want to talk about it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestant and catholic - two german leaders both want god in constitution . defining who is and is n't entitled to be called european also concerns the european network against racism -lrb- enar -rrb- , a network of ngos across eu member states . " there is no denying that christianity has made a decisive contribution to european identity , but then so has judaism and islam , both present for centuries on european soil , " said enar chair bashy quraishy , who would like to see all religions included or none at all . but despite passionate debate , the members recognise that the constitution has a is about more than just values .
" religion not a make or break issue here , " palmowski says .
" even in 2004 the tensions were really about the weighting given to spain and poland in the voting structure , religion is not a decisive factor . " hanneli ebding , director of federal europe , an independent ngo lobby in brussels for the constitution in its present form , does n't see the religion debate intruding on a practical level .
" it 's just not being visibly discussed , " she said . reviving the constitutional process most analysts believe that the defeats in france and the netherlands were as a result of dissatisfaction with the constitution 's plans for expansion of members , the euro-zone , and national governments .
statements about religion do not seem to have been a significant factor .
the french were demonstrating their discontent with president jacques chirac , while many dutch felt that european integration was moving too fast . merkel has declared she will use germany 's presidency of the eu , which it holds until the end of june 2007 , to get the constitution back on the rails .
she faces a tough sell even without the " god clause " issue , with the czechs , poles , british , dutch and french expected to be the most difficult countries to win over , she may be hoping for divine intervention . emma wynne send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german eu constitution plans get mixed reception in berlin german plans to put forward new proposals on the stalled eu constitutional process drew support from denmark but hesitancy from the czech republic tuesday .

the eu says , give the council more time . cuba is leading a bid by a number of countries to strip the human rights council of its power to investigate and condemn violations of human rights , a move some activists warn could jeopardize the entire un 's credibility , the news agency reuters reported .
the 47 member states of the new un watchdog , which was set up last year to replace its discredited predecessor , are quietly negotiating a package of measures which will define its role .
at stake is the fate of " special procedures " - independent investigators appointed to report on countries where abuses are suspected .
the former secretary general kofi annan described these rapporteurs as the " crown jewels " of the un human rights machinery .
" our fear is that some governments are trying to sell the crown jewels , trying to undermine the independence of special procedures , " irene khan , secretary general of amnesty international , told reporters in geneva .
" there are huge stakes here for human rights , not only for survivors of abuses but the credibility of the council and the larger credibility of the united nations , " she said .
politically motivated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us declined a seat on the human rights council its 13 special rapporteurs on countries , retained for now from the former un commission on human rights , include experts probing suspected abuses in belarus , cuba , sudan and north korea .
one such investigator , nobel peace laureate jody williams , issued a much-anticipated report on darfur march 12 which blamed sudan for orchestrating war crimes across darfur .
still , some countries singled out for this attention , and their allies such as china , say such finger-pointing is selective and politically motivated .
they want to abolish the investigators .
cuba - which has never allowed a visit by the special rapporteur on cuba , christine chanet - is leading the charge to dismantle country investigators .
those opposed want that countries should submit their own reports on their domestic records .
they add there intrusive investigators are unnecessary .
" the perpetuation of country-specific mandates , imposed by force and blackmail , would maintain the spiraling confrontation that did away with the authority and credibility of the defunct commission on human rights , " cuban foreign minister felipe perez roque said in a speech last week .
eu supportive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both kofi annan and ban ki-moon worried over the council the european union says that it is fighting to preserve the special procedures , as well as the forum 's ability to adopt resolutions condemning countries for the worst violations .
" when secretary general ban ki-moon took office , he said , ' the world is watching to see whether this young council will live up to its promise , " ' one eu official said .
" we have n't given the council enough time . "
others say the investigators are vital .
" special procedures are independent and efficient - that is why they are under attack , " reed brody , counsel at the new york-based group human rights watch told reuters .
he said un human rights ' probes had been successful , pointing to chile in the late 1970s and the former yugoslavia , in the early 1990s .
the council will make a decision on the issue by mid-june . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier : world must condemn human rights abuses in darfur a new report by a un rights group blames sudan for orchestrating war crimes across darfur , while the international community pledged action .

it 's an issue that divides member states down the middle as they work towards ratification . when she took over the rotating eu presidency in january this year , german chancellor angela merkel declared it her aim to revive the eu constitution , but she also opened another can of worms , reviving the debate on whether to mention europe 's christian heritage in the proposed constitution . following a meeting with pope benedict xvi in 2006 , merkel reaffirmed her support for a christian values clause . " i believe this treaty should be linked to christianity and god because christianity was decisive in the formation of europe , " she said . two sides who can never agree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliament agreed on the text , but not without discontent from some . the debate around europe 's common history and beliefs polarizes christians and secularists .
christian democrats hans-gert pöttering , the german mep who took over the european parliament 's presidency in 2006 , sees his christian faith as intrinsic to his politics and stated the eu constitution was a " holy text " . pöttering is the leader of the european people 's party , a grouping which is the largest europe-wide party in the parliament and a coalition of center-right , christian democratic national parties . staunchly catholic poland also made it clear that it would like to see christian values enshrined in the constitution as did seven other national governments who were pressed on the subject - italy , lithuania , malta , portugal , czech republic , slovakia and ireland . ultimately however , they found themselves in the minority , and the compromise position reached by the eu was a simple reference to europe 's " cultural , religious and humanist heritage . " committed believers wo n't give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch -lrb- and their cows -rrb- voted no . that proponents have refused to fall silent following their defeat on this issue , is an indication the passion the christian values debate arouses .
opponents are just as committed to keeping the so-called " god clause " out , and they are frustrated at the revival of a battle they thought had been won . " the chancellor 's statement brings into question once more a compromise that was difficult enough to achieve .
it is not helpful to reopen a discussion that has been closed , " said martin schulz , the german mep and socialist leader in the european parliament , following merkel 's statements . because this debate centers on personal belief , both sides struggle to make concessions or understand conflicting viewpoints .
dr jan palmowski , senior lecturer in european and german politics at kings college , london says it is " hard for secularists to understand why those who feel so strongly about religion can not compromise . " treaty stuck in legal limbo the eu constitution , drafted by the european convention amid furious wrangling in 2004 , is in a state of political limbo after being rejected by the french and dutch in referenda held in mid-2005 .
proponents of the constitution argue it is necessary to give the eu workable mechanisms for reaching decisions . sweden , denmark and belgium lined up firmly behind france , which holds fast to long established secular principles . the 2004 french foreign minister michel barnier said firmly during initial negotiations " europe is not a judaeo-christian club . " palmowski also argues , as do other commentators , that there is the political question of turkey 's application for eu membership in this debate .
if europe is defined as being christian , then clearly islamic turkey is n't a european country .
and while merkel has stressed that she does n't believe that the european union is a " christian club " , conservative opposition to turkey 's membership is well-known . many do n't want to talk about it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestant and catholic - two german leaders both want god in constitution . defining who is and is n't entitled to be called european also concerns the european network against racism -lrb- enar -rrb- , a network of ngos across eu member states . " there is no denying that christianity has made a decisive contribution to european identity , but then so has judaism and islam , both present for centuries on european soil , " said enar chair bashy quraishy , who would like to see all religions included or none at all . but despite passionate debate , the members recognise that the constitution has a is about more than just values .
" religion not a make or break issue here , " palmowski says .
" even in 2004 the tensions were really about the weighting given to spain and poland in the voting structure , religion is not a decisive factor . " hanneli ebding , director of federal europe , an independent ngo lobby in brussels for the constitution in its present form , does n't see the religion debate intruding on a practical level .
" it 's just not being visibly discussed , " she said . reviving the constitutional process most analysts believe that the defeats in france and the netherlands were as a result of dissatisfaction with the constitution 's plans for expansion of members , the euro-zone , and national governments .
statements about religion do not seem to have been a significant factor .
the french were demonstrating their discontent with president jacques chirac , while many dutch felt that european integration was moving too fast . merkel has declared she will use germany 's presidency of the eu , which it holds until the end of june 2007 , to get the constitution back on the rails .
she faces a tough sell even without the " god clause " issue , with the czechs , poles , british , dutch and french expected to be the most difficult countries to win over , she may be hoping for divine intervention . emma wynne send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german eu constitution plans get mixed reception in berlin german plans to put forward new proposals on the stalled eu constitutional process drew support from denmark but hesitancy from the czech republic tuesday .

it 's an issue that divides member states down the middle as they work towards ratification . when she took over the rotating eu presidency in january this year , german chancellor angela merkel declared it her aim to revive the eu constitution , but she also opened another can of worms , reviving the debate on whether to mention europe 's christian heritage in the proposed constitution . following a meeting with pope benedict xvi in 2006 , merkel reaffirmed her support for a christian values clause . " i believe this treaty should be linked to christianity and god because christianity was decisive in the formation of europe , " she said . two sides who can never agree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliament agreed on the text , but not without discontent from some . the debate around europe 's common history and beliefs polarizes christians and secularists .
christian democrats hans-gert pöttering , the german mep who took over the european parliament 's presidency in 2006 , sees his christian faith as intrinsic to his politics and stated the eu constitution was a " holy text " . pöttering is the leader of the european people 's party , a grouping which is the largest europe-wide party in the parliament and a coalition of center-right , christian democratic national parties . staunchly catholic poland also made it clear that it would like to see christian values enshrined in the constitution as did seven other national governments who were pressed on the subject - italy , lithuania , malta , portugal , czech republic , slovakia and ireland . ultimately however , they found themselves in the minority , and the compromise position reached by the eu was a simple reference to europe 's " cultural , religious and humanist heritage . " committed believers wo n't give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch -lrb- and their cows -rrb- voted no . that proponents have refused to fall silent following their defeat on this issue , is an indication the passion the christian values debate arouses .
opponents are just as committed to keeping the so-called " god clause " out , and they are frustrated at the revival of a battle they thought had been won . " the chancellor 's statement brings into question once more a compromise that was difficult enough to achieve .
it is not helpful to reopen a discussion that has been closed , " said martin schulz , the german mep and socialist leader in the european parliament , following merkel 's statements . because this debate centers on personal belief , both sides struggle to make concessions or understand conflicting viewpoints .
dr jan palmowski , senior lecturer in european and german politics at kings college , london says it is " hard for secularists to understand why those who feel so strongly about religion can not compromise . " treaty stuck in legal limbo the eu constitution , drafted by the european convention amid furious wrangling in 2004 , is in a state of political limbo after being rejected by the french and dutch in referenda held in mid-2005 .
proponents of the constitution argue it is necessary to give the eu workable mechanisms for reaching decisions . sweden , denmark and belgium lined up firmly behind france , which holds fast to long established secular principles . the 2004 french foreign minister michel barnier said firmly during initial negotiations " europe is not a judaeo-christian club . " palmowski also argues , as do other commentators , that there is the political question of turkey 's application for eu membership in this debate .
if europe is defined as being christian , then clearly islamic turkey is n't a european country .
and while merkel has stressed that she does n't believe that the european union is a " christian club " , conservative opposition to turkey 's membership is well-known . many do n't want to talk about it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestant and catholic - two german leaders both want god in constitution . defining who is and is n't entitled to be called european also concerns the european network against racism -lrb- enar -rrb- , a network of ngos across eu member states . " there is no denying that christianity has made a decisive contribution to european identity , but then so has judaism and islam , both present for centuries on european soil , " said enar chair bashy quraishy , who would like to see all religions included or none at all . but despite passionate debate , the members recognise that the constitution has a is about more than just values .
" religion not a make or break issue here , " palmowski says .
" even in 2004 the tensions were really about the weighting given to spain and poland in the voting structure , religion is not a decisive factor . " hanneli ebding , director of federal europe , an independent ngo lobby in brussels for the constitution in its present form , does n't see the religion debate intruding on a practical level .
" it 's just not being visibly discussed , " she said . reviving the constitutional process most analysts believe that the defeats in france and the netherlands were as a result of dissatisfaction with the constitution 's plans for expansion of members , the euro-zone , and national governments .
statements about religion do not seem to have been a significant factor .
the french were demonstrating their discontent with president jacques chirac , while many dutch felt that european integration was moving too fast . merkel has declared she will use germany 's presidency of the eu , which it holds until the end of june 2007 , to get the constitution back on the rails .
she faces a tough sell even without the " god clause " issue , with the czechs , poles , british , dutch and french expected to be the most difficult countries to win over , she may be hoping for divine intervention . emma wynne send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german eu constitution plans get mixed reception in berlin german plans to put forward new proposals on the stalled eu constitutional process drew support from denmark but hesitancy from the czech republic tuesday .

it 's an issue that divides member states down the middle as they work towards ratification . when she took over the rotating eu presidency in january this year , german chancellor angela merkel declared it her aim to revive the eu constitution , but she also opened another can of worms , reviving the debate on whether to mention europe 's christian heritage in the proposed constitution . following a meeting with pope benedict xvi in 2006 , merkel reaffirmed her support for a christian values clause . " i believe this treaty should be linked to christianity and god because christianity was decisive in the formation of europe , " she said . two sides who can never agree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliament agreed on the text , but not without discontent from some . the debate around europe 's common history and beliefs polarizes christians and secularists .
christian democrats hans-gert pöttering , the german mep who took over the european parliament 's presidency in 2006 , sees his christian faith as intrinsic to his politics and stated the eu constitution was a " holy text " . pöttering is the leader of the european people 's party , a grouping which is the largest europe-wide party in the parliament and a coalition of center-right , christian democratic national parties . staunchly catholic poland also made it clear that it would like to see christian values enshrined in the constitution as did seven other national governments who were pressed on the subject - italy , lithuania , malta , portugal , czech republic , slovakia and ireland . ultimately however , they found themselves in the minority , and the compromise position reached by the eu was a simple reference to europe 's " cultural , religious and humanist heritage . " committed believers wo n't give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch -lrb- and their cows -rrb- voted no . that proponents have refused to fall silent following their defeat on this issue , is an indication the passion the christian values debate arouses .
opponents are just as committed to keeping the so-called " god clause " out , and they are frustrated at the revival of a battle they thought had been won . " the chancellor 's statement brings into question once more a compromise that was difficult enough to achieve .
it is not helpful to reopen a discussion that has been closed , " said martin schulz , the german mep and socialist leader in the european parliament , following merkel 's statements . because this debate centers on personal belief , both sides struggle to make concessions or understand conflicting viewpoints .
dr jan palmowski , senior lecturer in european and german politics at kings college , london says it is " hard for secularists to understand why those who feel so strongly about religion can not compromise . " treaty stuck in legal limbo the eu constitution , drafted by the european convention amid furious wrangling in 2004 , is in a state of political limbo after being rejected by the french and dutch in referenda held in mid-2005 .
proponents of the constitution argue it is necessary to give the eu workable mechanisms for reaching decisions . sweden , denmark and belgium lined up firmly behind france , which holds fast to long established secular principles . the 2004 french foreign minister michel barnier said firmly during initial negotiations " europe is not a judaeo-christian club . " palmowski also argues , as do other commentators , that there is the political question of turkey 's application for eu membership in this debate .
if europe is defined as being christian , then clearly islamic turkey is n't a european country .
and while merkel has stressed that she does n't believe that the european union is a " christian club " , conservative opposition to turkey 's membership is well-known . many do n't want to talk about it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestant and catholic - two german leaders both want god in constitution . defining who is and is n't entitled to be called european also concerns the european network against racism -lrb- enar -rrb- , a network of ngos across eu member states . " there is no denying that christianity has made a decisive contribution to european identity , but then so has judaism and islam , both present for centuries on european soil , " said enar chair bashy quraishy , who would like to see all religions included or none at all . but despite passionate debate , the members recognise that the constitution has a is about more than just values .
" religion not a make or break issue here , " palmowski says .
" even in 2004 the tensions were really about the weighting given to spain and poland in the voting structure , religion is not a decisive factor . " hanneli ebding , director of federal europe , an independent ngo lobby in brussels for the constitution in its present form , does n't see the religion debate intruding on a practical level .
" it 's just not being visibly discussed , " she said . reviving the constitutional process most analysts believe that the defeats in france and the netherlands were as a result of dissatisfaction with the constitution 's plans for expansion of members , the euro-zone , and national governments .
statements about religion do not seem to have been a significant factor .
the french were demonstrating their discontent with president jacques chirac , while many dutch felt that european integration was moving too fast . merkel has declared she will use germany 's presidency of the eu , which it holds until the end of june 2007 , to get the constitution back on the rails .

the eu says , give the council more time . cuba is leading a bid by a number of countries to strip the human rights council of its power to investigate and condemn violations of human rights , a move some activists warn could jeopardize the entire un 's credibility , the news agency reuters reported .
the 47 member states of the new un watchdog , which was set up last year to replace its discredited predecessor , are quietly negotiating a package of measures which will define its role .
at stake is the fate of " special procedures " - independent investigators appointed to report on countries where abuses are suspected .
the former secretary general kofi annan described these rapporteurs as the " crown jewels " of the un human rights machinery .

" the perpetuation of country-specific mandates , imposed by force and blackmail , would maintain the spiraling confrontation that did away with the authority and credibility of the defunct commission on human rights , " cuban foreign minister felipe perez roque said in a speech last week .

the eu says , give the council more time . cuba is leading a bid by a number of countries to strip the human rights council of its power to investigate and condemn violations of human rights , a move some activists warn could jeopardize the entire un 's credibility , the news agency reuters reported .
the 47 member states of the new un watchdog , which was set up last year to replace its discredited predecessor , are quietly negotiating a package of measures which will define its role .
at stake is the fate of " special procedures " - independent investigators appointed to report on countries where abuses are suspected .
the former secretary general kofi annan described these rapporteurs as the " crown jewels " of the un human rights machinery .
" our fear is that some governments are trying to sell the crown jewels , trying to undermine the independence of special procedures , " irene khan , secretary general of amnesty international , told reporters in geneva .
" there are huge stakes here for human rights , not only for survivors of abuses but the credibility of the council and the larger credibility of the united nations , " she said .
politically motivated bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the us declined a seat on the human rights council its 13 special rapporteurs on countries , retained for now from the former un commission on human rights , include experts probing suspected abuses in belarus , cuba , sudan and north korea .
one such investigator , nobel peace laureate jody williams , issued a much-anticipated report on darfur march 12 which blamed sudan for orchestrating war crimes across darfur .
still , some countries singled out for this attention , and their allies such as china , say such finger-pointing is selective and politically motivated .
they want to abolish the investigators .
cuba - which has never allowed a visit by the special rapporteur on cuba , christine chanet - is leading the charge to dismantle country investigators .
those opposed want that countries should submit their own reports on their domestic records .
they add there intrusive investigators are unnecessary .
" the perpetuation of country-specific mandates , imposed by force and blackmail , would maintain the spiraling confrontation that did away with the authority and credibility of the defunct commission on human rights , " cuban foreign minister felipe perez roque said in a speech last week .
eu supportive bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : both kofi annan and ban ki-moon worried over the council the european union says that it is fighting to preserve the special procedures , as well as the forum 's ability to adopt resolutions condemning countries for the worst violations .
" when secretary general ban ki-moon took office , he said , ' the world is watching to see whether this young council will live up to its promise , " ' one eu official said .
" we have n't given the council enough time . "
others say the investigators are vital .
" special procedures are independent and efficient - that is why they are under attack , " reed brody , counsel at the new york-based group human rights watch told reuters .
he said un human rights ' probes had been successful , pointing to chile in the late 1970s and the former yugoslavia , in the early 1990s .
the council will make a decision on the issue by mid-june . dw staff -lrb- jb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de steinmeier : world must condemn human rights abuses in darfur a new report by a un rights group blames sudan for orchestrating war crimes across darfur , while the international community pledged action .

instead of protecting their group d lead , the germans will go all out for the win . german captain michael ballack insisted on friday his side are only thinking of victory over the czech republic in prague on saturday to make sure they stay top of their euro 2008 qualifying group . germany top group d ahead of the czechs only by virtue of goal difference , and with both sides on ten points there is no margin for error in the race to guarantee qualification . a win in prague would put the germans in the driving seat , but with bundesliga top-scorer mario gomez of vfb stuttgart out with a knee injury , chelsea midfielder ballack says his deputy - bayern munich 's lukas podolski - is a more than adequate substitute . " we have to take any injuries in our stride , a striker has dropped out , but the guys who will play can step in seamlessly .
we respect our opponents , but we are just focused on getting the win , " said the 30-year-old german captain . even without gomez , the germans have an abundance of talented strikers to choose from with 21-year-old podolski , voted the best young player of the 2006 world cup , boasting an impressive record of 22 goals in 37 internationals . strikers poldi and kuranyi confident of win bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : podolski aims to grab his chance back in the team " we 'll win because we have the better players , " said the confident podolski , who will partner schalke 04 's kevin kuranyi up front for the germans .

" but if we lose , other teams behind us will be back in it , " he warned . meanwhile midfielder bastian schweinsteiger said germany aims to ruthlessly exploit any weakness in the czech republic 's defense to stay top of the group .
bayern munich star schweinsteiger wants to make sure of three qualifying points to give his side some breathing space . " we have had a good look at the way they play and we know where their weaknesses are , we have to be ruthless against them , " said the 22-year-old . löw places emphasis on attack bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : löw wants germany to target the czech defense german coach joachim löw has told his side to attack the czechs at every opportunity , but took time this week to organize his defense to cope with the towering threat of the hosts ' striker jan koller . at 6ft 8ins -lrb- 2.03m -rrb- , koller is a defenders ' nightmare in the air , even topping england 's 6ft 7ins bean-pole peter crouch , but with 75 caps and 48 goals to his name , his german minders per mertesacker and christoph metzelder will have their work cut out . metzelder played with koller at borussia dortmund before the czech switched to french side monaco and will work in tandem with mertesacker to keep koller quiet .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de europe -pipe- 24.03.2007 eu demands release of british troops ; marines allegedly confess großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the british claim their troops were in international waters but iran contests this germany , in its role as eu president , called on iran to immediately release 15 british troops seized in disputed waters near iraq on friday .
tehran claims the soldiers have confessed to being in iranian waters . the european union would underline its position in a statement to be issued later in the day , german foreign minister frank walter steinmeier said in berlin .
steinmeier told reporters the eu would " make clear we want an immediate liberation " of the british soldiers held by iran . the 15 servicemen were detained on friday after inspecting a vessel in the mouth of the shatt al-arab waterway that marks the southern stretch of iraq 's border with iran .
iran claimed they had violated its territorial waters , but britain said they were in international waters and demanded their release . as the diplomatic to-ing and fro-ing continued , iran said on announced that the soldiers had admitted to violating its territorial waters , rejecting demands from london for their swift release . tehran claims soldiers confessed to entering iranian waters the semi-official fars news agency said the personnel had been brought to the capital tehran for questioning about what they were doing during what britain insists was a " routine " anti-smuggling patrol . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : british marines carry out un missions in the gulf armed forces general staff spokesman general alireza afshar said the 15 had admitted to their interrogators that they knew they were inside iranian waters , contrary to the insistence of the british defense ministry that they had remained in iraqi waters . " they are currently being questioned and have admitted to violating the territorial waters of the islamic republic , " afshar told the fars agency . he told the arabic language service of state television : " we have solid evidence that they were detained in our territorial waters .
they themselves have confessed and admitted their mistake . " he accused the british military of seeking to " create a climate of tension at a moment when a -lrb- un security council -rrb- resolution on iran -lrb- over its controversial nuclear program -rrb- is to be put to the vote despite the fact that iran seeks calm and stability in the region " . " the questioning of the british sailors is continuing to try to establish their real intentions , " he added . earlier another iranian official told the fars agency that the authorities had proof from the seized vessels ' navigation equipment that the sailors had knowingly entered iranian waters . " the british troops who are in iran 's hands knew perfectly well that they were in iranian territorial waters .
their navigation equipment proves it , " said the official , whom the news agency did not name . " besides the explanations of the british sailors , data from the computerized navigation equipment on board the vessels seized shows that they knowingly entered iranian waters and stayed there . " our border guards did their duty , " he said , adding that the british navy should " pay more attention to its navigation equipment . " diplomats meet to end stand-off britain summoned iran 's ambassador in london for a second day running to hear a demand for the swift release of the britons . rasoul movahedian was seen by a senior civil servant at the foreign office on friday but was to be seen by junior minister lord david triesman for the new audience , a spokeswoman said . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : iran 's elite revolutionary guard also patrol the gulf iran originally called the british operation an " illegal entry " into iranian waters as a " suspicious act " , the official irna news agency said on saturday , while fars said the british soldiers had been transferred to the capital tehran to explain their " aggressive action . " fars also said the captured britons included some women .
neither of these claims have been clarified .
" we have n't had any confirmation of that , " a british foreign office spokesman in london told reporters . " the foreign ministry 's spokesman called the illegal and interfering entry of british forces into iranian territorial waters a suspicious act and against international laws and rules and has harshly condemned it , " irna said . iran claims british had " unusual aims " the news agency also quoted foreign ministry spokesman mohammad ali hosseini as saying : " violating the territory of other countries and non-permitted entrance ... show unusual aims and is against international treaties and there are no excuses for ignoring and not accepting the responsibility for that . " britain has claimed that the soldiers were detained in iraqi waters .
the foreign ministry has said that two boatloads of royal navy sailors and marines had searched a merchant vessel on a un approved mission in iraqi waters when iranian gunboats encircled and captured them . " we demanded they be released swiftly and safely , " the foreign office spokesman said .
" we are keeping a very close on it .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de news -pipe- 24.03.2007 fringe opinion : the cult of knut großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : knut has become a media pro in recent weeks since hitting the headlines knut the polar bear cub is the darling of the world 's media at the moment - and with his unbearable cuteness and heart-warming story of survival , rightly so .
but what does his elevation to superstardom say about us ? could it be that i slipped unnoticed into some kind of news narcolepsy over the last week ?
while other aspects of life seem to have carried on as normal in the past few days , there is a huge black hole in my memory concerning the most pertinent international current affairs stories . i must have slept peacefully through the release of the german hostages in iraq ; snored and dribbled through the resolution of the iran nuclear crisis and twitched fitfully as middle east peace broke out .
there can be no other reason for the dearth of serious topics on the front page of the international press and the omnipresent fuzzy visage of a baby polar bear . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : bono should have thought about doing this years ago do n't get me wrong .
if the first public appearance of knut the polar bear cub at berlin 's zoo is the most dramatic event facing mankind this week then i am truly happy .
his stumpy little moon-boot legs are much more appealing than the effects of car bombs in baghdad and when he rolled about with that soccer ball , well … it was like i 'd never heard of the third world .
so , " hooray " in all honesty and authenticity for knut . it says much for the state of the world that a cuddly polar bear cub can demand so much attention when there are so many uglier things going on .
knut 's arrival on the planet has had much more impact than 9-kilograms of arctic predator should realistically have .
sure , he is unbelievably cute ; yes , his story of survival is a heart-warming one , and of course , death threats aimed at the bundle of razor-clawed fun by activists should make headlines .
but front page news ?
annie liebowitz photo-shoots ?
imminent vanity fair cover stardom ?
read my lips : it 's … a … bear . nasty current affairs pushed to the sidelines bildunterschrift : the un security council debate on iran , the russian supreme court 's ban on one of last political parties left which opposes president putin , the 50th anniversary of the european union : all these stories were replaced on the front pages of the international press on saturday by cuddly knut .
and while he is much more appealing than comrade vlad , one has to ask why ? is it because , as germany 's opportunist environment minister sigmar gabriel said as he nervously interacted with the bear in front of the world 's media , knut is a symbol for global change ?
is the cub a beacon of hope for an ailing planet ?
is his survival against the odds a message that the human race should champion ?
possibly .
but i think there 's more to it than that … humans , like polar bears , are pretty hardy creatures .
we have to be to live in the world that we do .
if we were to actually sit and think about all the things going wrong around us and all the events which appear to be out of our control , there would be mass panic and chronic depression .
thankfully , we are blessed with the ability to crawl under a warm , mental blanket of denial when things get too much . knut the savior in a world gone mad ? bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : forget your troubles by indulging yourself in some knut nothing helps more in the creation of denial than a distraction .
why worry about the state of the planet , when you can read about a cuddly polar bear cub discovering that sand does n't taste very nice ?
just as those pictures of knut taking his first drink from his enclosure 's moat pushed harder news to page four , so his big black eyes and innocent journey of discovery can push the realities of life further to the back of your mind . the current cult of knut , while it throws up many interesting questions , is really nothing to worry about .
his elevation to superstardom and worldwide fame is just the latest in a long line of respites which we should all embrace and enjoy .
knut 's time in the sun should be celebrated for as long as it lasts because before you know it , the front pages are going to be full of death and destruction again . so once again , " hooray " for knut for making the world - even for a short time - a fuzzier place . nick amies send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de the best of " from the fringe " germany is faces some serious issues , but it 's also important not to forget to laugh once in a while .
read up on a selection on recent articles about funny events in germany .

it 's an issue that divides member states down the middle as they work towards ratification . when she took over the rotating eu presidency in january this year , german chancellor angela merkel declared it her aim to revive the eu constitution , but she also opened another can of worms , reviving the debate on whether to mention europe 's christian heritage in the proposed constitution . following a meeting with pope benedict xvi in 2006 , merkel reaffirmed her support for a christian values clause . " i believe this treaty should be linked to christianity and god because christianity was decisive in the formation of europe , " she said . two sides who can never agree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliament agreed on the text , but not without discontent from some . the debate around europe 's common history and beliefs polarizes christians and secularists .
christian democrats hans-gert pöttering , the german mep who took over the european parliament 's presidency in 2006 , sees his christian faith as intrinsic to his politics and stated the eu constitution was a " holy text " . pöttering is the leader of the european people 's party , a grouping which is the largest europe-wide party in the parliament and a coalition of center-right , christian democratic national parties . staunchly catholic poland also made it clear that it would like to see christian values enshrined in the constitution as did seven other national governments who were pressed on the subject - italy , lithuania , malta , portugal , czech republic , slovakia and ireland . ultimately however , they found themselves in the minority , and the compromise position reached by the eu was a simple reference to europe 's " cultural , religious and humanist heritage . " committed believers wo n't give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch -lrb- and their cows -rrb- voted no . that proponents have refused to fall silent following their defeat on this issue , is an indication the passion the christian values debate arouses .
opponents are just as committed to keeping the so-called " god clause " out , and they are frustrated at the revival of a battle they thought had been won . " the chancellor 's statement brings into question once more a compromise that was difficult enough to achieve .
it is not helpful to reopen a discussion that has been closed , " said martin schulz , the german mep and socialist leader in the european parliament , following merkel 's statements . because this debate centers on personal belief , both sides struggle to make concessions or understand conflicting viewpoints .
dr jan palmowski , senior lecturer in european and german politics at kings college , london says it is " hard for secularists to understand why those who feel so strongly about religion can not compromise . " treaty stuck in legal limbo the eu constitution , drafted by the european convention amid furious wrangling in 2004 , is in a state of political limbo after being rejected by the french and dutch in referenda held in mid-2005 .
proponents of the constitution argue it is necessary to give the eu workable mechanisms for reaching decisions . sweden , denmark and belgium lined up firmly behind france , which holds fast to long established secular principles . the 2004 french foreign minister michel barnier said firmly during initial negotiations " europe is not a judaeo-christian club . " palmowski also argues , as do other commentators , that there is the political question of turkey 's application for eu membership in this debate .
if europe is defined as being christian , then clearly islamic turkey is n't a european country .
and while merkel has stressed that she does n't believe that the european union is a " christian club " , conservative opposition to turkey 's membership is well-known . many do n't want to talk about it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestant and catholic - two german leaders both want god in constitution . defining who is and is n't entitled to be called european also concerns the european network against racism -lrb- enar -rrb- , a network of ngos across eu member states . " there is no denying that christianity has made a decisive contribution to european identity , but then so has judaism and islam , both present for centuries on european soil , " said enar chair bashy quraishy , who would like to see all religions included or none at all . but despite passionate debate , the members recognise that the constitution has a is about more than just values .
" religion not a make or break issue here , " palmowski says .
" even in 2004 the tensions were really about the weighting given to spain and poland in the voting structure , religion is not a decisive factor . " hanneli ebding , director of federal europe , an independent ngo lobby in brussels for the constitution in its present form , does n't see the religion debate intruding on a practical level .
" it 's just not being visibly discussed , " she said . reviving the constitutional process most analysts believe that the defeats in france and the netherlands were as a result of dissatisfaction with the constitution 's plans for expansion of members , the euro-zone , and national governments .
statements about religion do not seem to have been a significant factor .
the french were demonstrating their discontent with president jacques chirac , while many dutch felt that european integration was moving too fast . merkel has declared she will use germany 's presidency of the eu , which it holds until the end of june 2007 , to get the constitution back on the rails .

it 's an issue that divides member states down the middle as they work towards ratification . when she took over the rotating eu presidency in january this year , german chancellor angela merkel declared it her aim to revive the eu constitution , but she also opened another can of worms , reviving the debate on whether to mention europe 's christian heritage in the proposed constitution . following a meeting with pope benedict xvi in 2006 , merkel reaffirmed her support for a christian values clause . " i believe this treaty should be linked to christianity and god because christianity was decisive in the formation of europe , " she said . two sides who can never agree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliament agreed on the text , but not without discontent from some . the debate around europe 's common history and beliefs polarizes christians and secularists .
christian democrats hans-gert pöttering , the german mep who took over the european parliament 's presidency in 2006 , sees his christian faith as intrinsic to his politics and stated the eu constitution was a " holy text " . pöttering is the leader of the european people 's party , a grouping which is the largest europe-wide party in the parliament and a coalition of center-right , christian democratic national parties . staunchly catholic poland also made it clear that it would like to see christian values enshrined in the constitution as did seven other national governments who were pressed on the subject - italy , lithuania , malta , portugal , czech republic , slovakia and ireland . ultimately however , they found themselves in the minority , and the compromise position reached by the eu was a simple reference to europe 's " cultural , religious and humanist heritage . " committed believers wo n't give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch -lrb- and their cows -rrb- voted no . that proponents have refused to fall silent following their defeat on this issue , is an indication the passion the christian values debate arouses .
opponents are just as committed to keeping the so-called " god clause " out , and they are frustrated at the revival of a battle they thought had been won . " the chancellor 's statement brings into question once more a compromise that was difficult enough to achieve .
it is not helpful to reopen a discussion that has been closed , " said martin schulz , the german mep and socialist leader in the european parliament , following merkel 's statements . because this debate centers on personal belief , both sides struggle to make concessions or understand conflicting viewpoints .
dr jan palmowski , senior lecturer in european and german politics at kings college , london says it is " hard for secularists to understand why those who feel so strongly about religion can not compromise . " treaty stuck in legal limbo the eu constitution , drafted by the european convention amid furious wrangling in 2004 , is in a state of political limbo after being rejected by the french and dutch in referenda held in mid-2005 .
proponents of the constitution argue it is necessary to give the eu workable mechanisms for reaching decisions . sweden , denmark and belgium lined up firmly behind france , which holds fast to long established secular principles . the 2004 french foreign minister michel barnier said firmly during initial negotiations " europe is not a judaeo-christian club . " palmowski also argues , as do other commentators , that there is the political question of turkey 's application for eu membership in this debate .
if europe is defined as being christian , then clearly islamic turkey is n't a european country .
and while merkel has stressed that she does n't believe that the european union is a " christian club " , conservative opposition to turkey 's membership is well-known . many do n't want to talk about it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestant and catholic - two german leaders both want god in constitution . defining who is and is n't entitled to be called european also concerns the european network against racism -lrb- enar -rrb- , a network of ngos across eu member states . " there is no denying that christianity has made a decisive contribution to european identity , but then so has judaism and islam , both present for centuries on european soil , " said enar chair bashy quraishy , who would like to see all religions included or none at all . but despite passionate debate , the members recognise that the constitution has a is about more than just values .
" religion not a make or break issue here , " palmowski says .
" even in 2004 the tensions were really about the weighting given to spain and poland in the voting structure , religion is not a decisive factor . " hanneli ebding , director of federal europe , an independent ngo lobby in brussels for the constitution in its present form , does n't see the religion debate intruding on a practical level .
" it 's just not being visibly discussed , " she said . reviving the constitutional process most analysts believe that the defeats in france and the netherlands were as a result of dissatisfaction with the constitution 's plans for expansion of members , the euro-zone , and national governments .
statements about religion do not seem to have been a significant factor .
the french were demonstrating their discontent with president jacques chirac , while many dutch felt that european integration was moving too fast . merkel has declared she will use germany 's presidency of the eu , which it holds until the end of june 2007 , to get the constitution back on the rails .
she faces a tough sell even without the " god clause " issue , with the czechs , poles , british , dutch and french expected to be the most difficult countries to win over , she may be hoping for divine intervention . emma wynne send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german eu constitution plans get mixed reception in berlin german plans to put forward new proposals on the stalled eu constitutional process drew support from denmark but hesitancy from the czech republic tuesday .

it 's an issue that divides member states down the middle as they work towards ratification . when she took over the rotating eu presidency in january this year , german chancellor angela merkel declared it her aim to revive the eu constitution , but she also opened another can of worms , reviving the debate on whether to mention europe 's christian heritage in the proposed constitution . following a meeting with pope benedict xvi in 2006 , merkel reaffirmed her support for a christian values clause . " i believe this treaty should be linked to christianity and god because christianity was decisive in the formation of europe , " she said . two sides who can never agree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliament agreed on the text , but not without discontent from some . the debate around europe 's common history and beliefs polarizes christians and secularists .
christian democrats hans-gert pöttering , the german mep who took over the european parliament 's presidency in 2006 , sees his christian faith as intrinsic to his politics and stated the eu constitution was a " holy text " . pöttering is the leader of the european people 's party , a grouping which is the largest europe-wide party in the parliament and a coalition of center-right , christian democratic national parties . staunchly catholic poland also made it clear that it would like to see christian values enshrined in the constitution as did seven other national governments who were pressed on the subject - italy , lithuania , malta , portugal , czech republic , slovakia and ireland . ultimately however , they found themselves in the minority , and the compromise position reached by the eu was a simple reference to europe 's " cultural , religious and humanist heritage . " committed believers wo n't give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch -lrb- and their cows -rrb- voted no . that proponents have refused to fall silent following their defeat on this issue , is an indication the passion the christian values debate arouses .
opponents are just as committed to keeping the so-called " god clause " out , and they are frustrated at the revival of a battle they thought had been won . " the chancellor 's statement brings into question once more a compromise that was difficult enough to achieve .
it is not helpful to reopen a discussion that has been closed , " said martin schulz , the german mep and socialist leader in the european parliament , following merkel 's statements . because this debate centers on personal belief , both sides struggle to make concessions or understand conflicting viewpoints .
dr jan palmowski , senior lecturer in european and german politics at kings college , london says it is " hard for secularists to understand why those who feel so strongly about religion can not compromise . " treaty stuck in legal limbo the eu constitution , drafted by the european convention amid furious wrangling in 2004 , is in a state of political limbo after being rejected by the french and dutch in referenda held in mid-2005 .
proponents of the constitution argue it is necessary to give the eu workable mechanisms for reaching decisions . sweden , denmark and belgium lined up firmly behind france , which holds fast to long established secular principles . the 2004 french foreign minister michel barnier said firmly during initial negotiations " europe is not a judaeo-christian club . " palmowski also argues , as do other commentators , that there is the political question of turkey 's application for eu membership in this debate .

it 's an issue that divides member states down the middle as they work towards ratification . when she took over the rotating eu presidency in january this year , german chancellor angela merkel declared it her aim to revive the eu constitution , but she also opened another can of worms , reviving the debate on whether to mention europe 's christian heritage in the proposed constitution . following a meeting with pope benedict xvi in 2006 , merkel reaffirmed her support for a christian values clause . " i believe this treaty should be linked to christianity and god because christianity was decisive in the formation of europe , " she said . two sides who can never agree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliament agreed on the text , but not without discontent from some . the debate around europe 's common history and beliefs polarizes christians and secularists .
christian democrats hans-gert pöttering , the german mep who took over the european parliament 's presidency in 2006 , sees his christian faith as intrinsic to his politics and stated the eu constitution was a " holy text " . pöttering is the leader of the european people 's party , a grouping which is the largest europe-wide party in the parliament and a coalition of center-right , christian democratic national parties . staunchly catholic poland also made it clear that it would like to see christian values enshrined in the constitution as did seven other national governments who were pressed on the subject - italy , lithuania , malta , portugal , czech republic , slovakia and ireland . ultimately however , they found themselves in the minority , and the compromise position reached by the eu was a simple reference to europe 's " cultural , religious and humanist heritage . " committed believers wo n't give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch -lrb- and their cows -rrb- voted no . that proponents have refused to fall silent following their defeat on this issue , is an indication the passion the christian values debate arouses .
opponents are just as committed to keeping the so-called " god clause " out , and they are frustrated at the revival of a battle they thought had been won . " the chancellor 's statement brings into question once more a compromise that was difficult enough to achieve .
it is not helpful to reopen a discussion that has been closed , " said martin schulz , the german mep and socialist leader in the european parliament , following merkel 's statements . because this debate centers on personal belief , both sides struggle to make concessions or understand conflicting viewpoints .
dr jan palmowski , senior lecturer in european and german politics at kings college , london says it is " hard for secularists to understand why those who feel so strongly about religion can not compromise . " treaty stuck in legal limbo the eu constitution , drafted by the european convention amid furious wrangling in 2004 , is in a state of political limbo after being rejected by the french and dutch in referenda held in mid-2005 .
proponents of the constitution argue it is necessary to give the eu workable mechanisms for reaching decisions . sweden , denmark and belgium lined up firmly behind france , which holds fast to long established secular principles . the 2004 french foreign minister michel barnier said firmly during initial negotiations " europe is not a judaeo-christian club . " palmowski also argues , as do other commentators , that there is the political question of turkey 's application for eu membership in this debate .
if europe is defined as being christian , then clearly islamic turkey is n't a european country .
and while merkel has stressed that she does n't believe that the european union is a " christian club " , conservative opposition to turkey 's membership is well-known . many do n't want to talk about it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestant and catholic - two german leaders both want god in constitution . defining who is and is n't entitled to be called european also concerns the european network against racism -lrb- enar -rrb- , a network of ngos across eu member states . " there is no denying that christianity has made a decisive contribution to european identity , but then so has judaism and islam , both present for centuries on european soil , " said enar chair bashy quraishy , who would like to see all religions included or none at all . but despite passionate debate , the members recognise that the constitution has a is about more than just values .
" religion not a make or break issue here , " palmowski says .
" even in 2004 the tensions were really about the weighting given to spain and poland in the voting structure , religion is not a decisive factor . " hanneli ebding , director of federal europe , an independent ngo lobby in brussels for the constitution in its present form , does n't see the religion debate intruding on a practical level .
" it 's just not being visibly discussed , " she said . reviving the constitutional process most analysts believe that the defeats in france and the netherlands were as a result of dissatisfaction with the constitution 's plans for expansion of members , the euro-zone , and national governments .
statements about religion do not seem to have been a significant factor .
the french were demonstrating their discontent with president jacques chirac , while many dutch felt that european integration was moving too fast . merkel has declared she will use germany 's presidency of the eu , which it holds until the end of june 2007 , to get the constitution back on the rails .
she faces a tough sell even without the " god clause " issue , with the czechs , poles , british , dutch and french expected to be the most difficult countries to win over , she may be hoping for divine intervention . emma wynne send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german eu constitution plans get mixed reception in berlin german plans to put forward new proposals on the stalled eu constitutional process drew support from denmark but hesitancy from the czech republic tuesday .

it 's an issue that divides member states down the middle as they work towards ratification . when she took over the rotating eu presidency in january this year , german chancellor angela merkel declared it her aim to revive the eu constitution , but she also opened another can of worms , reviving the debate on whether to mention europe 's christian heritage in the proposed constitution . following a meeting with pope benedict xvi in 2006 , merkel reaffirmed her support for a christian values clause . " i believe this treaty should be linked to christianity and god because christianity was decisive in the formation of europe , " she said . two sides who can never agree bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : european parliament agreed on the text , but not without discontent from some . the debate around europe 's common history and beliefs polarizes christians and secularists .
christian democrats hans-gert pöttering , the german mep who took over the european parliament 's presidency in 2006 , sees his christian faith as intrinsic to his politics and stated the eu constitution was a " holy text " . pöttering is the leader of the european people 's party , a grouping which is the largest europe-wide party in the parliament and a coalition of center-right , christian democratic national parties . staunchly catholic poland also made it clear that it would like to see christian values enshrined in the constitution as did seven other national governments who were pressed on the subject - italy , lithuania , malta , portugal , czech republic , slovakia and ireland . ultimately however , they found themselves in the minority , and the compromise position reached by the eu was a simple reference to europe 's " cultural , religious and humanist heritage . " committed believers wo n't give up bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the dutch -lrb- and their cows -rrb- voted no . that proponents have refused to fall silent following their defeat on this issue , is an indication the passion the christian values debate arouses .
opponents are just as committed to keeping the so-called " god clause " out , and they are frustrated at the revival of a battle they thought had been won . " the chancellor 's statement brings into question once more a compromise that was difficult enough to achieve .
it is not helpful to reopen a discussion that has been closed , " said martin schulz , the german mep and socialist leader in the european parliament , following merkel 's statements . because this debate centers on personal belief , both sides struggle to make concessions or understand conflicting viewpoints .
dr jan palmowski , senior lecturer in european and german politics at kings college , london says it is " hard for secularists to understand why those who feel so strongly about religion can not compromise . " treaty stuck in legal limbo the eu constitution , drafted by the european convention amid furious wrangling in 2004 , is in a state of political limbo after being rejected by the french and dutch in referenda held in mid-2005 .
proponents of the constitution argue it is necessary to give the eu workable mechanisms for reaching decisions . sweden , denmark and belgium lined up firmly behind france , which holds fast to long established secular principles . the 2004 french foreign minister michel barnier said firmly during initial negotiations " europe is not a judaeo-christian club . " palmowski also argues , as do other commentators , that there is the political question of turkey 's application for eu membership in this debate .
if europe is defined as being christian , then clearly islamic turkey is n't a european country .
and while merkel has stressed that she does n't believe that the european union is a " christian club " , conservative opposition to turkey 's membership is well-known . many do n't want to talk about it bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : protestant and catholic - two german leaders both want god in constitution . defining who is and is n't entitled to be called european also concerns the european network against racism -lrb- enar -rrb- , a network of ngos across eu member states . " there is no denying that christianity has made a decisive contribution to european identity , but then so has judaism and islam , both present for centuries on european soil , " said enar chair bashy quraishy , who would like to see all religions included or none at all . but despite passionate debate , the members recognise that the constitution has a is about more than just values .
" religion not a make or break issue here , " palmowski says .
" even in 2004 the tensions were really about the weighting given to spain and poland in the voting structure , religion is not a decisive factor . " hanneli ebding , director of federal europe , an independent ngo lobby in brussels for the constitution in its present form , does n't see the religion debate intruding on a practical level .

the national trust property is home to the negro coachboy , a portrait of a black youth thought to be owned by the mansion 's founder , john mellor .
the bicentenary of the abolition of slavery act is on sunday .
the painting , also known as the ' negro minstrel ' , ' black boy ' or ' mellor 's coachboy ' hangs in the servants ' hall .
the boy certainly was a slave , that 's how he would have come here jeremy cragg , erddig hall manager painted around 1720 , it is still not clear whether the youngster was a slave taken to live and work at erddig hall by mellor , who was a wealthy london lawyer , or whether he was just a figment of an artist 's imagination .

he said : " it really is a total mystery .

preparations for this season at erddig hall included washing the george iii-era cut-glass chandelier for the first time in seven years .
the chandelier has hung in the saloon since 1846 , but can boast its own " only fools and horses " moment when it was dropped by a drunken butler trying to give it a clean .
in scenes reminiscent of a well-loved episode of the bbc tv comedy starring david jason , records from 1903 reveal the " non-too sober " butler did not realise that as he rotated the chandelier he was turning off its thread .
it smashed to the floor and the repairs , which cost £ 38 , included sending for glass replacements from europe .

low rainfall in the province of sichuan has forced officials to deliver clean water to the worst-hit areas .
six million livestock and half a million hectares of land are affected , sichuan 's governor said .
many areas of china are regularly hit by water shortages or droughts , with some blaming climate change .
most of sichuan received no major rain in february , and no significant rain predicted before the end of march .
stunted crops lack of rainfall and unusually warm temperatures are to blame for the drought that has hit farmers in sichuan province , causing losses of nearly 300 million yuan -lrb- $ 38m , £ 19m -rrb- , the official xinhua news agency said .
last year , much of sichuan and neighbouring chongqing were hit by a severe drought which severely stunted crop growths in many areas .
other parts of china have experienced abnormal weather conditions recently .

the trio have appeared in four movies , and will star in the fifth potter film , the order of the phoenix , in july .
harry potter and the order of the phoenix is out this summer the final two films , to be based on jk rowling 's books , will follow suit - the half-blood prince , scheduled for release in november 2008 , and the deathly hallows .
there had been some speculation that the three actors were becoming too old to fulfil their parts .
radcliffe and grint , who plays ron weasley , have moved onto adult roles on stage and screen , while it had been rumoured that watson had told producers she did not want to continue .

bbc news -pipe- south asia -pipe- is india 's slip good for cricket ?
bbc news / south asia graphics version bbc sport home news front page -pipe- africa -pipe- americas -pipe- asia-pacific -pipe- europe -pipe- middle east -pipe- south asia -pipe- uk -pipe- business -pipe- health -pipe- science & environment -pipe- technology -pipe- entertainment -pipe- also in the news -pipe- have your say -pipe- saturday , 24 march 2007 , 12:11 gmt is india 's slip good for cricket ?
by mukul kesavan author of ' men in white ' for indian fans , india 's elimination from the cricket world cup so early in the competition is a crushing disappointment .
for the television channels that bought rights to beam the tournament to these fans , friday 's defeat was a financial disaster .
but for the tournament itself , nothing could have been more tonic than the purging of pakistan and india , the dysfunctional giants of south asian cricket .
instead of these glowering bruisers , the extravagantly gifted sri lankans and the plucky bangladeshis will represent south asia in the next round , the super 8 .
since the reliance world cup hosted by india in 1987 , south asia 's cricketing nations have become more and more influential in the conduct and administration of the one-day game . "
the elimination of india and pakistan leaves the world cup in the west indies a happier , less toxic tournament " some of this influence has to do with cricketing success : since india won the cup in 1983 , pakistan and sri lanka have won it in 1992 and 1996 respectively .
mainly , though , the balance of power in world cricket has shifted from england and australia towards the sub-continent for commercial reasons : the dawning realisation that india owns the only mass audience there is for the game .
one-day allure cricket was always popular in india , but the coincidence of world cup success in 1983 and the creation of a national television audience in the early 1980s -lrb- doordarshan , india 's sole , government-owned television station at the time , created a pan-indian network in 1982 -rrb- expanded and deepened the fan base of the game .
crucially , this new audience was exclusively drawn to one-day cricket , the shorter form of the game .
there were several reasons for this .
limited overs matches were over in a day , they were never inconclusive and they had a gladiatorial quality that test cricket with its longueurs , wholly lacked .
the arena-like excitement of odis was tailor-made for that great south asian sport , chauvinism .
india and pakistan had resumed cricket relations after a long chill in 1978 , just as limited-overs cricket was starting to take off .
the compulsive need to confront the old enemy led to the creation of a cricket circus in the gulf sheikhdom , sharjah , where , on neutral ground , the sub-continent 's blood feuds were re-played as one-day tournaments for the benefit of increasingly feverish and volatile audiences .
the fusion of chauvinism and television had two bad consequences : an obsessive fan base that tended to become deranged by defeat and the rise of contemporary cricket 's stock villain , the corrupting bookie .
defeat , especially at the hands of the old enemy , led to a -rrb- a suspension of cricketing relations -lrb- india stopped playing pakistan in sharjah after a sequence of defeats led to allegations of foul play -rrb- and b -rrb- to attacks on players or their property -lrb- mohammad kaif 's home was attacked in 2003 , and mahendra dhoni 's house was damaged after india was defeated by bangladesh in their opening match in the present tournament -rrb- .
corruption the rise of the bookie and the phenomenon of match-fixing which nearly destroyed cricket 's credibility as a competitive sport , was a by-product of the new south asian audience for one-day cricket .
it could n't have happened in an environment where the test match was the dominant form .
test cricket is harder to fix .
it happens over a longer span , there are more innings , more variables and it never generates the steaming pressure-cooked excitement that leads to frenzied betting in the course of an odi .
test cricket 's suspense is cumulative , and its metabolic rate too low for villains .
and these bookies , these villains are south asian - located in india and pakistan for the most part , countries where the criminalisation of betting has driven the betting ' industry ' underground .
the corruption that bookies have brought to the game has had foreign recruits like the late south african captain , hansie cronje , but it remains a sub-continental blight .
already bob woolmer 's tragic death is being speculatively attributed to bookmakers worried that the pakistani coach was about to blow the whistle on their racket in his forthcoming book .
cricket will buckle under the weight of the sullen , thin-skinned nationalism that indian and pakistani fans bring to the game and it can certainly do without the bookie-driven corruption that feeds off this perverse enthusiasm .
the elimination of india and pakistan leaves the world cup in the west indies a happier , less toxic tournament ; it might even give the fans of these countries the time to actually play some cricket .
or they could use the break to switch their loyalties to a sport that does n't bring out the worst in them .
test cricket , anyone ?
mukul kesavan is a writer , and his book of cricket , men in white , will be published by penguin india this year .
this debate is closed .
following is a selection of comments you sent .
it 's difficult not to agree with mukul kesavan 's well-written article .
the media has to held responsible for the hype , without giving thought that there are at least half a dozen nations capable of winning the cup .
the electronic media created the hype in order to whip up the passion and influence the corporates to increase spending on advertisement .
person who were fans became journalists and talked anything but cricket .
in addition some of the players played for themselves .
in a way it 's good india lost to sri lanka , otherwise the world would put it down as a match fixed .
khashi nath , india the author has correctly articulated the plight of cricket game in india and pakistan .
it is a national waste when virtually the whole country is glued to tv when the odis or even the tests are played .
in this game , there is no sport now .
there are no sportsmen .
there is only the money .
the debacle should trigger some positive thinking but i am not very hopeful .
prof vn asopa , i quite agree with your article and would also add that some members of the indian team are overrated , lacking the capacity to ' dig in ' during tough times .
the pakistan team simply imploded with all the controversy ; and then the death of the coach is almost the final nail in their coffin .
i pick sri lanka to be in the finals ; while we wait for more positive signs from our beloved west indies .
wendy lawrence , trinidad and tobago not sure if it is good for cricket but it is certainly good for india .
there is way too much craze for the game and this has starved other sports in the country .
it 's not healthy .
hope this creates opportunities for other sports .
sammy , us i totally agree .
as an indian , these days i doubt whether any match played by india or pakistan is really " contested for " at all .
everyone tends to presume that every little happening on field is really a part of a bigger plan hatched by bookies .
its high time for india 's populace to promote other sports as well and take some of the spotlight away from cricket .
ashwin datye , india nicely written but same old story .
i hope this time though the bcci takes a hard look at not only the players but reasons like the selection system , dead-as-a-dodo pitches , past glory over present form of players and the top most fitness levels .
how are we to compete at all if majority of our players need to go off the field every five overs .
we do n't see that in the case of any other team and should take a leaf out of their books there .
but everything said and done , please inject some youth .
rohit kaul , united states this debacle should be a wake up call for all indians .
it is symptomatic of a society that is very poor in mindset and values .
indians should stop trying to find fault with everything around them and realise that the primary reason for their current situation in the world is themselves .
the day when indians accept the fact that they have a lot to fix about themselves the country will take a giant leap forward .
till then we will keep whitewashing ourselves into thinking that we are a world power either in cricket or it or the economy .
kiron , usa with a heavy heart if i were the chairman of selection committee , i would drop sachin tendulkar and ask him to regain his place by scoring in domestic matches just like saurav ganguly .
narendra.pawar , india an excellent article that unfortunately feels correct in its conclusions .
i do not see how india and pakistan can move away for their unhealthy emotional connection to their cricket teams unless other sports -lrb- like football -rrb- take more of the public 's interest / obsession with the game .
for example , if australia do not win the world cup , the cricket loving public will be very disappointed and there will be some media and internal cricket inquisitions but ultimately the focus will move to our winter sports -lrb- aussie rules , rugby league and union -rrb- and the loss will be put in its proper perspective .
with india and pakistan , with the lack of other national attention grabbing sports , the focus remains on your cricket team and this is in no-one 's best interest .
the only way around the betting issue is to play more tests and reduce the number of odi 's , which is not likely to happen given the money involved but for me , it is the only way to reduce the power of the sports gambling cliques and improve the performance of the indian and pakistan teams .
down under , the view is that too much odi cricket is played ahead of test cricket .
rightly or wrongly , it is felt in australia that test cricket is the best teacher of the game and if you master this form of the game , odi cricket will follow .
paul sikand , australia i am happy to see bangladesh is coming up as a cricket giant .
it is always nice to see new powers in any international tournament .
events like this -lrb- beating india and bermuda -rrb- makes me feel proud and remind me of my roots .
i do n't understand cricket very well but i feel the emotion and love of the bangladeshi cricket fans .
well done bangladesh .
i am looking forward to see more success stories .
congratulation both bangladesh and ireland .
ripon , usa india 's victory in 1983 world cup reinvigorated cricket in the world , the results of which you are seeing today .
if india had not arrived in 1983 , then cricket was a dead sport played by the selected white men .
vikram , usa excellent article mukul !
this is indeed true that the unnatural hype around cricket has been harmful to the players , to the game itself , and also to other sports too .
maybe indian players would have played better -lrb- and , who knows , won -rrb- against sri lanka if they had not been under the threat of having their homes attacked if they lost .
the fans need to realize that it is a sport after all , nothing more , nothing less .
the media , too , needs to show responsibility .
at the moment , tv channels in india spend hours giving useless analysis and opinions before and after a cricket match .
it pains me to see that cricket makes front page news in a country facing far bigger problems .
if only we could put our priorities in the right places ...
abhishek saxena , united kingdom i agree with mukul 's comment completely in addition i have few more comments .
i am a long-time avid follower of cricket-india following them through thick and thin over 20 years and i 've decided to give up cricket-watching as a hobby after the toothless show last weekend .
i 've been fooling myself into thinking all-along that indian team has the potential but do n't play consistently but after a series of mediocre games i am convinced that they are not just capable and only play second and third-rung teams well .
i am not going to give one more cent or spend one more hour of my time to this madness where 1 billion people are being cheated and held hostage to a cricket-team that is not any better than say indian soccer or hockey .
we are better off as a nation taking this billions of dollars and investing on other sports where we have a chance in the future .
it is not just an angry outburst of a life-long cricket fan -lrb- atic -rrb- but someone who has become rational and realistic.br / > senthil krishnapillai , usa sachin tendulkar 's time is up .
he should depart from cricket .
isha miranda , sri lanka i agree with mukul .
however , memory of indian cricket fans are very short -lrb- so does advertisers , cricket board and selectors -rrb- .
in next home series , all the indian featherbed batsmen will start making big scores on flat indian pitches .
so the whole thing will be back to square - the way it was before world cup .
the basic problem is that if india plays outside the indian subcontinent indian batsmen simply do n't have any chance .
did n't we lose against weak west indies last time ?
did n't we lose at malaysia couple of months back ?
then the players came back and defeated sri lanka in home grounds .
then we thought india has potential of winning world coup .
what a joke !
bottom-line , indian batsmen simply can not play abroad .
so what was the reason for hoping this world cup will be any different from last west indies tour or malaysia tour or last australia tour or last south africa tour ?
pkd , us we are not minnows anymore !
ehsan , bangladesh readers do expect articles devoid of such flashy rhetoric and better judgement and understanding from these senior cricket experts .
every single time india has played poor cricket to lose a tournament , a line of calls for change is imminent .
suggesting that the game in india has suddenly become a frankenstein , or that the talent we have in india is rotten , or that this will help cleanse the dirt in the system or that indian players are suddenly physically unfit is quite clearly hyperbole rather than any good sense .
what if india had gone on to the next round or even all the way ?
yes in the aftermath of this early exit , some tough decisions regarding the performances of players will and must happen , but to suggest that the game as a whole in india has come to some form of cross-roads reflects badly on the larger scale and scheme of cricket in india .
the game will go on .
to imagine that we need to exorcise some demons in the closet is an exercise in panic and hallucination .
srihari janakiraman , india the fact that the cricketing world can be celebrating the exit of two of its most popular and richest teams , akin to say football celebrating the exit of italy or brazil in the 1st round speaks volumes .
this is surely part of the breather that cricket needs from the stifling influence of the sub-continent on the game .
ryan ramoutar , trinidad and tobago i am very much delighted to see india and pakistan knocked out in the first round and they should learn lessons from the sri lankan cricket team who not only play well but also very professional and have respect for their coach and team-mates .
i had few opportunities to meet sri lankan cricketers and sensed their team spirit .
go sri lanka go for the cup .
you deserve it again .
balan nadarajah , canada it is a well written article high lighting the blind following of cricket in india .
damaging the property of the cricketers is not going to bring out the best in them .
also , there has been too much interference from advertisers .
otherwise , how can a physically unfit pathan can be selected ?
it is time india started looking at youngsters for future .
sangu narayanan , canada the only way to teach a lesson to the indian players is to boycott the products that these players peddle day in and day out .
you can not watch a minute of tv without sachin peddling something .
it is obscene .
hero honda , u.s.a it was the over confident and over cautious approach which caused the debacle and its really unfortunate .
i think neither bangladesh nor ireland is going to perform any better further in the tournament .
ashutosh joshi , uk every country has a sport which its citizens are passionate about and every country has also had its major upsets in the sport they think they are doing well .
just because india and pakistan lost does not mean you have to condemn their cricket fans !
what about football fans in europe .
do you tell them that they are wasting their time every weekend when they go crazy over their beloved football clubs ?
ashok patel , milton keynes , uk we follow cricket as a religion and players as god .
it 's not a game for " sahibs " anymore .
it 's for the masses ! ! !
puneet , united states i just hope that cricket loses all its hype and the mass hysteria that it generates in the subcontinent and people can get on with their lives without having to experience unnecessary emotional turmoil and resort to burning of effigies and indulge in mindless protests .
raghu bindinganavale , uk i think indians are themselves to blame .
we expect too much from team india .
each player is an immensely talented individually but as a team they are a bunch of losers .
except india they never win in good numbers and every indian knows this pretty well but still we hope a lot from them .
i truly agree with steve waugh 's latest statement that players from sub-continent especially from india just plays for their own record and not as a team or that matter for our country .
we got to stop expecting from team india .
gaurav sharma , canada i agree with most of the article and would like to add that even before tv came on the scene , there was much passion for the sport in india , and in the subcontinent .
during test matches , people often huddled around transistor radios and keenly followed the game .
a lot of work at offices was left pending due to this diversion .
as for the present exit of india and pakistan from the 2007 world cup , personally i would like to move on and enjoy the rest of the tournament .
i shall be cheering for sri lanka and bangladesh and see how far they will go knowing that in the end the best oiled machine will make it to the top , most probably australia .
national pride apart , folks need to sit back and enjoy the sport .
rajiv bakshi , saudi arabia according to your article , pakistanis and indians are toxic and as such a poor reflection on cricket .
spoken like the perfect colonial slave that would have done everything to keep cricket ' gora ' .
i 'm disappointed and agitated by your article .
jawwad riaz , pakistan very simple solution - if we do n't win the match then every team player should be banned from doing ads .
and this should be enforced for three years .
gurudaas , india the truth is there is no aggression among the indian cricket players .
losing is their habit and it 's ongoing .
now we cant blame a coach for everything .
it feels like no coach can help india win the world cup .
sachin , dravid , ganguly should now stop playing .
get youngsters .
reetesh bhasin , pune , india i tend to agree with you .
the odis have changed the complexion of the sport by moving it in a profoundly different direction .
cricket has become more and more like football or rugby - it starts and ends at well-defined intervals .
for these reasons , illegal gamblers and match-fixing bookies can make a bundle of money in a very short time period .
moreover , cricket is increasingly being played by well-paid professional players , who do n't have the same pride in carrying their country 's flag as did former cricket players , who were for the most part , either non-professionals or part-time professionals .
i say good riddance to india 's and pakistan 's cricket teams from this world cup !
they do n't deserve to stay around a day longer .
mobiusein , usa this is a very bigoted look at the emergence of cricket as a mass-viewed sport in the sub-continent .
perhaps the author is longing for the days of yore when the ' sahibs ' played in a gentlemanly fashion .
watching india 's win in 1983 as a child , i was just thrilled to watch indians win , that 's all .
the conclusion that cricket took off in south asia because of its ' chauvinistic ' and ' gladiatorial ' qualities is a far reach .
could n't you say that about any sport ?
like football in britain or for that matter , women 's football in the us ?
mo , india i believe that the indian public are stuck with mediocrity in many aspects of life and perhaps cricket tops that list .
i hope that indians will snap out of it - at least with respect to cricket .
sai p. , usa india 's defeat is like a blessing in disguise .
first of all , the advertisers will sit back and think before they sign any player .
secondly the players too will become grounded now .
i have nothing against players involved in commercial activities , but this is taking precedence over the actual game of cricket .
further i fail to understand why players like vvs laxman and mohammed kaif were left out of the squad ? .
players like sachin and saurav should resign now and give way to new players .
ravi chandra kota , switzerland this early exit would act as blessing in disguise to ponder where we really stand in world cricket .
abhijeet chaudhari , india i feel relaxed that we are out of the world cup .
i love cricket , not cricketers any more .
let new champions emerge from this cup .
t chandra sekhar , india first of all lets get this straight , bookies are everywhere .
their headquarters may be in south asia but that does n't mean they do not do buisness elsewhere .
secondly , the part about the dysfunctional giants was uncalled for .
sri lanka played well , so did the bangladeshis .
hence they deserved a place in the super eight .
instead of unnecessary rhetoric it would be good if we all made up our minds and supported the remaining two asian contenders rather than just stand and bicker .
madhusudan , india while there is a lot of truth in what is in the article , let us not forget that cricket unites india like no other single thing or event , and gives the poor of the nation something to feel proud about .
i think the world cup format must be looked at where in effect one poor performance led to india 's demise -lrb- assuming that the game against sl was aways 50:50 -rrb- .
now they are going to have 24 super eight games !
may be it would be better to have more pool games and the top team from each group met in a round robin of the top four teams .
vish , new zealand this was a great article .
india has taken cricket to a whole new level beyond sports- and its not healthy .
their exit can give other teams a chance to play and focus on the game of cricket - not on the players themselves .
india is too obsessive it terms of cricket and it needs to end .
miriam , usa as long as cricket retains mass appeal -lrb- and associated betting revenues -rrb- the potential for corruption will remain .
look at the continual allegations of corruption in the european football leagues .
dilip , uk we need to face the fact that this was the best team we could have sent to the world cup .
pick any other 11 players and that would have probably lost to bermuda as well .
what we need is for bcci to show some sort of accountability and own up to this disaster .
rohit tanwar , india betting , bookies are part of any big popular sports , corruption is unavoidable in any big entity , whether it is football , cricket , a nation or a construction company .
cricket was clean in the past because it was also less popular and involved little money , now it has grown up in its popularity and economy especially because of popularity and economic growth in the indian subcontinent .
corruption is unavoidably involved as big money involved , just like in football .
but that does n't mean that the countries , which brought the passion and money to the sport should stay out .
cricket is benefiting from the passionate indian fans and the growing indian economy ; it would certainly huge losses if icc loose the indian cricket and indian fans .
probably mr. kesavan should invest his precious time in helping icc and bcci to plan strategies to prevent corruption rather than writing such comments .
sachin , germany i can not agree more with you .
finally , a sensible person analysing the game from the true perspective instead of indulging only in glorification of the overrated players .
thank you so much for the article !
adithya , usa the indian people who compare their cricketing heroes with gods should realise that cricket is just a game .
raveethiraraja nirrushan , sri lanka we should not worry too much or get upset .
we have to accept that our players will not bring glory .
so why cry about it ?
romi budhrani , taipei , taiwan let us hope that the disgrace in the west indies will help eliminate the present lot and bring true and committed players into the team .
g.kalamannil , india the sloppiness of the indian team was clearly revealed in the world cup .
they rightly do not deserve to qualify .
shabu varghese , qatar india and pakistan have taken cricket beyond sports .
i agree with you with india and pakistan out , we will see a more sporting contest .
the two countries need to popularise football , hockey , maybe baseball .
naveed khan , usa one less great team to stop us winning the world cup , which is so rightfully ours !
bring it on !
alistair , australia good article .
too much of advertisements and too much of sponsorship for the current indian players .
too much of media hype .
waste of money and waste of time .
india has to learn a lesson and start promoting other games .
n ramanathan , ghana big business must also take some of the blame for this mass hysteria .
huge amounts of money are spent by consumer giants to plug their products and whip up chauvinism by tag-lines like " one in a billion , hoo-hah india " and such disgustingly banality .
show some corporate responsibility for heaven 's sake ! !
jay amrith , singapore it is unfortunate that mukul kesavan has misunderstood the fact that the process of betting is a phenomenon which is as old as the world 's oldest profession .
the failure of the indian and pakistani teams in this world cup does not mean that betting and corruption is removed completely and hence make it less toxic !
such corrupt practices would exist in any other country too but the intensity of finger pointing and blame game would not be the same as the writers and journalist of many countries are responsible and would love to nurture the game and not kill the enthusiastic supporters .
i would continue to watch cricket , support india and pakistan no matter .
praveen ashokan , uae it 's time we faced the grim realities and realised that india is not the giant killer it is made out to be .
a narayanan , india as an ex londoner who had the good fortune of watching cricket at the oval and lords in the forties and fifties it is sad to see that the moral principles of the game have been lost .
i was taught to walk and understood the honorable concept of fair play .
hopefully the concept expressed in the article that test cricket is not subject to the same corruption is valid as to me at least , it is the ultimate expression of the totally demanding sport .
it requires skill , stamina , intellect and integrity .
if indeed bob woolmers death is in any way associated with the game it is a cancer that needs to be removed .
another instance that sport has become entertainment and big business .
the character building aspects of sport have been lost again .
cricket is becoming another tv and gambling mecca .
goodbye grace , bradman and hammond .
john , usa in a way its blessing in disguise - in today 's resurgent india , we need more productivity , rather than be glued to tv .
we need to move on , and rather become more physically fit , than become obese , by watching cricket .
we should not pass on cricket fever to our young generation .
hanif mohammed , dubai , uae it is time we disregarded the players in both good and bad times .
there are many other people who contribute much more to the nation and are not even paid one tenth of what our mediocre cricketeers are paid .
subhash kaul , india i watched many matches featuring india and pakistan in the 2003 world cup - also one with sri lanka , but no bangladesh to my regret .
the sri lankans were , i thought , really in touch with the spirit of the game - doing their stellar best , enjoying everything , applauding their opponents ' good moments .
wonderful !
then came india .
very passionate spectators , mostly good-humoured and well informed , happy to chat and nice to meet ; but nobody seemed to find it strange when people wandered around holding placards proclaiming the unfortunate sachin tendulkar as a god .
how do they expect him to perform , or even eat his breakfast , with those expectations on his shoulders ?
as a proud but baffled south african , i 'd love to see sri lanka do really well - perhaps lose to us in the final ?
deborah hubbard , south africa as someone who grew up in the 50 's and 60 's following cricket , mainly test cricket , i can not agree more with mukul kesavan .
it is a shame to see the behaviour of so called fans in india .
the players , spoiled by pampering and unlimited advertising incomes , are spoilt .
a drubbing like the one they received was needed - for the players , the fans and the indian cricket control board all of whom seem to have forgotten that cricket is a game not a war that threatens to exterminate the nation .
ajay malik , switzerland i am very happy that indian fans got what they deserve to follow a game without sensibility .
saurabh kaushik , india i have seen this indian team crumble so many times .
everybody says that indian viewers drive this game .
so i have decided not to watch any one day matches involving india .
it is better to see a match between australia vs. south africa where there is no heart break and emotion involved .
jatender koul , india test cricket is not another sport .
its a different form of the same sport .
in my view pakistan and india need new sports .
it ca n't just be cricket 365 days of the year .
in america we have so much to choose from .
there are leagues of professional and college football , basketball , baseball and even soccer .
south asia has a fifth of the world 's population so why ca n't they come up with other sports ?
fawad arain , usa india could not have chosen a better world cup to be beaten out of .
beating pakistan is the real thrill - that shiny trophy is only a secondary consideration .
the english , with their relative attitudes to the ashes and the world cup , will empathise .
manosij majumdar , canada it is time india and pakistan put their cricketing house in order - fair administration and selection and an end to political horse trading .
more importantly , they need to understand the ethics of sport itself .
better to congratulate the winners and commiserate with the losers rather than resort brainlessly to death threats !
phil , hong kong great article .
the chauvinism in india has not only percolated into cricket , but into many other areas and it is high time , india realises and sets its priorities right and concentrates on the real problems of the country .
the corruption is so loathsome in this country and no wonder it has spoiled the game of cricket .
vijay , india the sad fact is players are now over paid , over-pampered and seem to have forgotten that the game and specatators matter more than them .
in 1974 as a 14 year old i saw pakistan play england for the first time at lords .
it was a gripping match which ended in a draw but had some memorable bowling by derek underwood .
on the saturday i was there , it started raining at 2:30 and did not stop .
we waited for the players to come out for autographs , and they finally went to their coach at 6:30 pm .
intikhab alam , the captain , saw me and a few other young boys drenched waiting for the team .
he stopped the coach , asked me on board and got every member of the team to give me an autograph .
he then told me to be a good boy and go straight home !
cut to 2006 and the saturday of the lords test .
memorable innings from yousuf .
this time i took my 10 year old lad with me .
he wanted autographs so he and about 10 other boys -lrb- mostly english -rrb- waited .
at 7:00 pm we were told the pakistan team had left via a separate entrance and in any case were not giving autographs .
perhaps the players need to learn some dignity and respect for young fans , who are the future of the sport .
ejaz , uk i think media is largely responsible for boosting indian players ' egos .
a good score against a weak team and they are treated like superstars and their whole family comes into limelight .
its the media who makes the players god piyush suri , united kingdom stop cricket for a while and please divert funds to other games .
dr b dilip kumar , iraq and dont really understand the crib of the influence of south asian nations on cricket .
if the money comes from india , it will and has to be the power center .
if they cant manage , then the game is gone .
dhananjaya , london god save indian cricket .
eswar ramachandran , chennai , tamil nadu , india i was a cricket fan once to the extend that i had a scrapbook that contained score sheets of all test matches .
this was around 1995-87 , when i was 13-15 years old .
but after watching the soccer world cup in 1998 , my interest in cricket reduced to such a level that i watched cricket only when tendulkar was batting .
after the 2002 soccer world cup , it reduced even further .
my only regret in life is that i wasted too much time watching cricket .
now i do n't even understand how can people prefer cricket to games like soccer or for that matter even kabbadi .
as far as i could see this cricket addiction is more dangerous than drug addiction .
it is tough to get out and you waste too much time .
sujith babu , india legalise betting and give more importance to games like football and tennis .
dinesh , ahmedabad , india europe and south america have the same attitude to football and americans to their football .
so we are entitled to our sins .
yes the game should be purified and the bookies abolished .
but do not throw the baby with the bath water .
sanjaya das , india i guess this is the best thing which has happened to indian cricket .
a few things which need to change - 1. the zonal selection process .
2.amount of money that is associated with cricket.that has to come down drastically if the pressure on players to perform has to come down .
3.the hype by the media of being the best batting line up etc which is utter trash .
-lrb- its almost nine years since sachin has scored a match winning knock in a crucial tie -lrb- except for the not to so important word cup 2003 match against pakistan -rrb- .for almost three to four years now he does n't deserve to be called the world 's greatest batsman .
4.stop critisizing greg chappell -lrb- or any foreign coach -rrb- .at least they bring in some sort of professionalism which we indians lack .

by mukul kesavan author of ' men in white ' india 's fans staged a protest after the world cup loss to sri lanka for indian fans , india 's elimination from the cricket world cup so early in the competition is a crushing disappointment .
for the television channels that bought rights to beam the tournament to these fans , friday 's defeat was a financial disaster .
but for the tournament itself , nothing could have been more tonic than the purging of pakistan and india , the dysfunctional giants of south asian cricket .
instead of these glowering bruisers , the extravagantly gifted sri lankans and the plucky bangladeshis will represent south asia in the next round , the super 8 .
since the reliance world cup hosted by india in 1987 , south asia 's cricketing nations have become more and more influential in the conduct and administration of the one-day game .
the elimination of india and pakistan leaves the world cup in the west indies a happier , less toxic tournament send your comments on mukul kesavan 's article some of this influence has to do with cricketing success : since india won the cup in 1983 , pakistan and sri lanka have won it in 1992 and 1996 respectively .
mainly , though , the balance of power in world cricket has shifted from england and australia towards the sub-continent for commercial reasons : the dawning realisation that india owns the only mass audience there is for the game .
one-day allure cricket was always popular in india , but the coincidence of world cup success in 1983 and the creation of a national television audience in the early 1980s -lrb- doordarshan , india 's sole , government-owned television station at the time , created a pan-indian network in 1982 -rrb- expanded and deepened the fan base of the game .
crucially , this new audience was exclusively drawn to one-day cricket , the shorter form of the game .
pakistan 's elimination from the world cup also drew angry protests there were several reasons for this .
limited overs matches were over in a day , they were never inconclusive and they had a gladiatorial quality that test cricket with its longueurs , wholly lacked .
the arena-like excitement of odis was tailor-made for that great south asian sport , chauvinism .
india and pakistan had resumed cricket relations after a long chill in 1978 , just as limited-overs cricket was starting to take off .
the compulsive need to confront the old enemy led to the creation of a cricket circus in the gulf sheikhdom , sharjah , where , on neutral ground , the sub-continent 's blood feuds were re-played as one-day tournaments for the benefit of increasingly feverish and volatile audiences .
the fusion of chauvinism and television had two bad consequences : an obsessive fan base that tended to become deranged by defeat and the rise of contemporary cricket 's stock villain , the corrupting bookie .
defeat , especially at the hands of the old enemy , led to a -rrb- a suspension of cricketing relations -lrb- india stopped playing pakistan in sharjah after a sequence of defeats led to allegations of foul play -rrb- and b -rrb- to attacks on players or their property -lrb- mohammad kaif 's home was attacked in 2003 , and mahendra dhoni 's house was damaged after india was defeated by bangladesh in their opening match in the present tournament -rrb- .
corruption the rise of the bookie and the phenomenon of match-fixing which nearly destroyed cricket 's credibility as a competitive sport , was a by-product of the new south asian audience for one-day cricket .
it could n't have happened in an environment where the test match was the dominant form .
test cricket is harder to fix .
it happens over a longer span , there are more innings , more variables and it never generates the steaming pressure-cooked excitement that leads to frenzied betting in the course of an odi .
test cricket 's suspense is cumulative , and its metabolic rate too low for villains .
and these bookies , these villains are south asian - located in india and pakistan for the most part , countries where the criminalisation of betting has driven the betting ' industry ' underground .
the corruption that bookies have brought to the game has had foreign recruits like the late south african captain , hansie cronje , but it remains a sub-continental blight .
already bob woolmer 's tragic death is being speculatively attributed to bookmakers worried that the pakistani coach was about to blow the whistle on their racket in his forthcoming book .
cricket will buckle under the weight of the sullen , thin-skinned nationalism that indian and pakistani fans bring to the game and it can certainly do without the bookie-driven corruption that feeds off this perverse enthusiasm .
the elimination of india and pakistan leaves the world cup in the west indies a happier , less toxic tournament ; it might even give the fans of these countries the time to actually play some cricket .
or they could use the break to switch their loyalties to a sport that does n't bring out the worst in them .
test cricket , anyone ?
mukul kesavan is a writer , and his book of cricket , men in white , will be published by penguin india this year .
this debate is closed .
following is a selection of comments you sent .
it 's difficult not to agree with mukul kesavan 's well-written article .
the media has to held responsible for the hype , without giving thought that there are at least half a dozen nations capable of winning the cup .
the electronic media created the hype in order to whip up the passion and influence the corporates to increase spending on advertisement .
person who were fans became journalists and talked anything but cricket .
in addition some of the players played for themselves .
in a way it 's good india lost to sri lanka , otherwise the world would put it down as a match fixed .
khashi nath , india the author has correctly articulated the plight of cricket game in india and pakistan .
it is a national waste when virtually the whole country is glued to tv when the odis or even the tests are played .
in this game , there is no sport now .
there are no sportsmen .
there is only the money .
the debacle should trigger some positive thinking but i am not very hopeful .
prof vn asopa , i quite agree with your article and would also add that some members of the indian team are overrated , lacking the capacity to ' dig in ' during tough times .
the pakistan team simply imploded with all the controversy ; and then the death of the coach is almost the final nail in their coffin .
i pick sri lanka to be in the finals ; while we wait for more positive signs from our beloved west indies .
wendy lawrence , trinidad and tobago not sure if it is good for cricket but it is certainly good for india .
there is way too much craze for the game and this has starved other sports in the country .
it 's not healthy .
hope this creates opportunities for other sports .
sammy , us i totally agree .
as an indian , these days i doubt whether any match played by india or pakistan is really " contested for " at all .
everyone tends to presume that every little happening on field is really a part of a bigger plan hatched by bookies .
its high time for india 's populace to promote other sports as well and take some of the spotlight away from cricket .
ashwin datye , india nicely written but same old story .
i hope this time though the bcci takes a hard look at not only the players but reasons like the selection system , dead-as-a-dodo pitches , past glory over present form of players and the top most fitness levels .
how are we to compete at all if majority of our players need to go off the field every five overs .
we do n't see that in the case of any other team and should take a leaf out of their books there .
but everything said and done , please inject some youth .
rohit kaul , united states this debacle should be a wake up call for all indians .
it is symptomatic of a society that is very poor in mindset and values .
indians should stop trying to find fault with everything around them and realise that the primary reason for their current situation in the world is themselves .
the day when indians accept the fact that they have a lot to fix about themselves the country will take a giant leap forward .
till then we will keep whitewashing ourselves into thinking that we are a world power either in cricket or it or the economy .
kiron , usa with a heavy heart if i were the chairman of selection committee , i would drop sachin tendulkar and ask him to regain his place by scoring in domestic matches just like saurav ganguly .
narendra.pawar , india an excellent article that unfortunately feels correct in its conclusions .
i do not see how india and pakistan can move away for their unhealthy emotional connection to their cricket teams unless other sports -lrb- like football -rrb- take more of the public 's interest / obsession with the game .
for example , if australia do not win the world cup , the cricket loving public will be very disappointed and there will be some media and internal cricket inquisitions but ultimately the focus will move to our winter sports -lrb- aussie rules , rugby league and union -rrb- and the loss will be put in its proper perspective .
with india and pakistan , with the lack of other national attention grabbing sports , the focus remains on your cricket team and this is in no-one 's best interest .
the only way around the betting issue is to play more tests and reduce the number of odi 's , which is not likely to happen given the money involved but for me , it is the only way to reduce the power of the sports gambling cliques and improve the performance of the indian and pakistan teams .
down under , the view is that too much odi cricket is played ahead of test cricket .
rightly or wrongly , it is felt in australia that test cricket is the best teacher of the game and if you master this form of the game , odi cricket will follow .
paul sikand , australia i am happy to see bangladesh is coming up as a cricket giant .
it is always nice to see new powers in any international tournament .
events like this -lrb- beating india and bermuda -rrb- makes me feel proud and remind me of my roots .
i do n't understand cricket very well but i feel the emotion and love of the bangladeshi cricket fans .
well done bangladesh .
i am looking forward to see more success stories .
congratulation both bangladesh and ireland .
ripon , usa india 's victory in 1983 world cup reinvigorated cricket in the world , the results of which you are seeing today .
if india had not arrived in 1983 , then cricket was a dead sport played by the selected white men .
vikram , usa excellent article mukul !
this is indeed true that the unnatural hype around cricket has been harmful to the players , to the game itself , and also to other sports too .
maybe indian players would have played better -lrb- and , who knows , won -rrb- against sri lanka if they had not been under the threat of having their homes attacked if they lost .
the fans need to realize that it is a sport after all , nothing more , nothing less .
the media , too , needs to show responsibility .
at the moment , tv channels in india spend hours giving useless analysis and opinions before and after a cricket match .
it pains me to see that cricket makes front page news in a country facing far bigger problems .
if only we could put our priorities in the right places ...
abhishek saxena , united kingdom i agree with mukul 's comment completely in addition i have few more comments .
i am a long-time avid follower of cricket-india following them through thick and thin over 20 years and i 've decided to give up cricket-watching as a hobby after the toothless show last weekend .
i 've been fooling myself into thinking all-along that indian team has the potential but do n't play consistently but after a series of mediocre games i am convinced that they are not just capable and only play second and third-rung teams well .
i am not going to give one more cent or spend one more hour of my time to this madness where 1 billion people are being cheated and held hostage to a cricket-team that is not any better than say indian soccer or hockey .
we are better off as a nation taking this billions of dollars and investing on other sports where we have a chance in the future .
it is not just an angry outburst of a life-long cricket fan -lrb- atic -rrb- but someone who has become rational and realistic.br / > senthil krishnapillai , usa sachin tendulkar 's time is up .
he should depart from cricket .
isha miranda , sri lanka i agree with mukul .
however , memory of indian cricket fans are very short -lrb- so does advertisers , cricket board and selectors -rrb- .
in next home series , all the indian featherbed batsmen will start making big scores on flat indian pitches .
so the whole thing will be back to square - the way it was before world cup .
the basic problem is that if india plays outside the indian subcontinent indian batsmen simply do n't have any chance .
did n't we lose against weak west indies last time ?
did n't we lose at malaysia couple of months back ?
then the players came back and defeated sri lanka in home grounds .
then we thought india has potential of winning world coup .
what a joke !
bottom-line , indian batsmen simply can not play abroad .
so what was the reason for hoping this world cup will be any different from last west indies tour or malaysia tour or last australia tour or last south africa tour ?
pkd , us we are not minnows anymore !
ehsan , bangladesh readers do expect articles devoid of such flashy rhetoric and better judgement and understanding from these senior cricket experts .
every single time india has played poor cricket to lose a tournament , a line of calls for change is imminent .
suggesting that the game in india has suddenly become a frankenstein , or that the talent we have in india is rotten , or that this will help cleanse the dirt in the system or that indian players are suddenly physically unfit is quite clearly hyperbole rather than any good sense .
what if india had gone on to the next round or even all the way ?
yes in the aftermath of this early exit , some tough decisions regarding the performances of players will and must happen , but to suggest that the game as a whole in india has come to some form of cross-roads reflects badly on the larger scale and scheme of cricket in india .
the game will go on .
to imagine that we need to exorcise some demons in the closet is an exercise in panic and hallucination .
srihari janakiraman , india the fact that the cricketing world can be celebrating the exit of two of its most popular and richest teams , akin to say football celebrating the exit of italy or brazil in the 1st round speaks volumes .
this is surely part of the breather that cricket needs from the stifling influence of the sub-continent on the game .
ryan ramoutar , trinidad and tobago i am very much delighted to see india and pakistan knocked out in the first round and they should learn lessons from the sri lankan cricket team who not only play well but also very professional and have respect for their coach and team-mates .
i had few opportunities to meet sri lankan cricketers and sensed their team spirit .
go sri lanka go for the cup .
you deserve it again .
balan nadarajah , canada it is a well written article high lighting the blind following of cricket in india .
damaging the property of the cricketers is not going to bring out the best in them .
also , there has been too much interference from advertisers .
otherwise , how can a physically unfit pathan can be selected ?
it is time india started looking at youngsters for future .
sangu narayanan , canada the only way to teach a lesson to the indian players is to boycott the products that these players peddle day in and day out .
you can not watch a minute of tv without sachin peddling something .
it is obscene .
hero honda , u.s.a it was the over confident and over cautious approach which caused the debacle and its really unfortunate .
i think neither bangladesh nor ireland is going to perform any better further in the tournament .
ashutosh joshi , uk every country has a sport which its citizens are passionate about and every country has also had its major upsets in the sport they think they are doing well .
just because india and pakistan lost does not mean you have to condemn their cricket fans !
what about football fans in europe .
do you tell them that they are wasting their time every weekend when they go crazy over their beloved football clubs ?
ashok patel , milton keynes , uk we follow cricket as a religion and players as god .
it 's not a game for " sahibs " anymore .
it 's for the masses ! ! !
puneet , united states i just hope that cricket loses all its hype and the mass hysteria that it generates in the subcontinent and people can get on with their lives without having to experience unnecessary emotional turmoil and resort to burning of effigies and indulge in mindless protests .
raghu bindinganavale , uk i think indians are themselves to blame .
we expect too much from team india .
each player is an immensely talented individually but as a team they are a bunch of losers .
except india they never win in good numbers and every indian knows this pretty well but still we hope a lot from them .
i truly agree with steve waugh 's latest statement that players from sub-continent especially from india just plays for their own record and not as a team or that matter for our country .
we got to stop expecting from team india .
gaurav sharma , canada i agree with most of the article and would like to add that even before tv came on the scene , there was much passion for the sport in india , and in the subcontinent .
during test matches , people often huddled around transistor radios and keenly followed the game .
a lot of work at offices was left pending due to this diversion .
as for the present exit of india and pakistan from the 2007 world cup , personally i would like to move on and enjoy the rest of the tournament .
i shall be cheering for sri lanka and bangladesh and see how far they will go knowing that in the end the best oiled machine will make it to the top , most probably australia .
national pride apart , folks need to sit back and enjoy the sport .
rajiv bakshi , saudi arabia according to your article , pakistanis and indians are toxic and as such a poor reflection on cricket .
spoken like the perfect colonial slave that would have done everything to keep cricket ' gora ' .
i 'm disappointed and agitated by your article .
jawwad riaz , pakistan very simple solution - if we do n't win the match then every team player should be banned from doing ads .
and this should be enforced for three years .
gurudaas , india the truth is there is no aggression among the indian cricket players .
losing is their habit and it 's ongoing .
now we cant blame a coach for everything .
it feels like no coach can help india win the world cup .
sachin , dravid , ganguly should now stop playing .
get youngsters .
reetesh bhasin , pune , india i tend to agree with you .
the odis have changed the complexion of the sport by moving it in a profoundly different direction .
cricket has become more and more like football or rugby - it starts and ends at well-defined intervals .
for these reasons , illegal gamblers and match-fixing bookies can make a bundle of money in a very short time period .
moreover , cricket is increasingly being played by well-paid professional players , who do n't have the same pride in carrying their country 's flag as did former cricket players , who were for the most part , either non-professionals or part-time professionals .
i say good riddance to india 's and pakistan 's cricket teams from this world cup !
they do n't deserve to stay around a day longer .
mobiusein , usa this is a very bigoted look at the emergence of cricket as a mass-viewed sport in the sub-continent .
perhaps the author is longing for the days of yore when the ' sahibs ' played in a gentlemanly fashion .
watching india 's win in 1983 as a child , i was just thrilled to watch indians win , that 's all .
the conclusion that cricket took off in south asia because of its ' chauvinistic ' and ' gladiatorial ' qualities is a far reach .
could n't you say that about any sport ?
like football in britain or for that matter , women 's football in the us ?
mo , india i believe that the indian public are stuck with mediocrity in many aspects of life and perhaps cricket tops that list .
i hope that indians will snap out of it - at least with respect to cricket .
sai p. , usa india 's defeat is like a blessing in disguise .
first of all , the advertisers will sit back and think before they sign any player .
secondly the players too will become grounded now .
i have nothing against players involved in commercial activities , but this is taking precedence over the actual game of cricket .
further i fail to understand why players like vvs laxman and mohammed kaif were left out of the squad ? .
players like sachin and saurav should resign now and give way to new players .
ravi chandra kota , switzerland this early exit would act as blessing in disguise to ponder where we really stand in world cricket .
abhijeet chaudhari , india i feel relaxed that we are out of the world cup .
i love cricket , not cricketers any more .
let new champions emerge from this cup .
t chandra sekhar , india first of all lets get this straight , bookies are everywhere .
their headquarters may be in south asia but that does n't mean they do not do buisness elsewhere .
secondly , the part about the dysfunctional giants was uncalled for .
sri lanka played well , so did the bangladeshis .
hence they deserved a place in the super eight .
instead of unnecessary rhetoric it would be good if we all made up our minds and supported the remaining two asian contenders rather than just stand and bicker .
madhusudan , india while there is a lot of truth in what is in the article , let us not forget that cricket unites india like no other single thing or event , and gives the poor of the nation something to feel proud about .
i think the world cup format must be looked at where in effect one poor performance led to india 's demise -lrb- assuming that the game against sl was aways 50:50 -rrb- .
now they are going to have 24 super eight games !
may be it would be better to have more pool games and the top team from each group met in a round robin of the top four teams .
vish , new zealand this was a great article .
india has taken cricket to a whole new level beyond sports- and its not healthy .
their exit can give other teams a chance to play and focus on the game of cricket - not on the players themselves .
india is too obsessive it terms of cricket and it needs to end .
miriam , usa as long as cricket retains mass appeal -lrb- and associated betting revenues -rrb- the potential for corruption will remain .
look at the continual allegations of corruption in the european football leagues .
dilip , uk we need to face the fact that this was the best team we could have sent to the world cup .
pick any other 11 players and that would have probably lost to bermuda as well .
what we need is for bcci to show some sort of accountability and own up to this disaster .
rohit tanwar , india betting , bookies are part of any big popular sports , corruption is unavoidable in any big entity , whether it is football , cricket , a nation or a construction company .
cricket was clean in the past because it was also less popular and involved little money , now it has grown up in its popularity and economy especially because of popularity and economic growth in the indian subcontinent .
corruption is unavoidably involved as big money involved , just like in football .
but that does n't mean that the countries , which brought the passion and money to the sport should stay out .
cricket is benefiting from the passionate indian fans and the growing indian economy ; it would certainly huge losses if icc loose the indian cricket and indian fans .
probably mr. kesavan should invest his precious time in helping icc and bcci to plan strategies to prevent corruption rather than writing such comments .
sachin , germany i can not agree more with you .
finally , a sensible person analysing the game from the true perspective instead of indulging only in glorification of the overrated players .
thank you so much for the article !
adithya , usa the indian people who compare their cricketing heroes with gods should realise that cricket is just a game .
raveethiraraja nirrushan , sri lanka we should not worry too much or get upset .
we have to accept that our players will not bring glory .
so why cry about it ?
romi budhrani , taipei , taiwan let us hope that the disgrace in the west indies will help eliminate the present lot and bring true and committed players into the team .
g.kalamannil , india the sloppiness of the indian team was clearly revealed in the world cup .
they rightly do not deserve to qualify .
shabu varghese , qatar india and pakistan have taken cricket beyond sports .
i agree with you with india and pakistan out , we will see a more sporting contest .
the two countries need to popularise football , hockey , maybe baseball .
naveed khan , usa one less great team to stop us winning the world cup , which is so rightfully ours !
bring it on !
alistair , australia good article .
too much of advertisements and too much of sponsorship for the current indian players .
too much of media hype .
waste of money and waste of time .
india has to learn a lesson and start promoting other games .
n ramanathan , ghana big business must also take some of the blame for this mass hysteria .
huge amounts of money are spent by consumer giants to plug their products and whip up chauvinism by tag-lines like " one in a billion , hoo-hah india " and such disgustingly banality .
show some corporate responsibility for heaven 's sake ! !
jay amrith , singapore it is unfortunate that mukul kesavan has misunderstood the fact that the process of betting is a phenomenon which is as old as the world 's oldest profession .
the failure of the indian and pakistani teams in this world cup does not mean that betting and corruption is removed completely and hence make it less toxic !
such corrupt practices would exist in any other country too but the intensity of finger pointing and blame game would not be the same as the writers and journalist of many countries are responsible and would love to nurture the game and not kill the enthusiastic supporters .
i would continue to watch cricket , support india and pakistan no matter .
praveen ashokan , uae it 's time we faced the grim realities and realised that india is not the giant killer it is made out to be .
a narayanan , india as an ex londoner who had the good fortune of watching cricket at the oval and lords in the forties and fifties it is sad to see that the moral principles of the game have been lost .
i was taught to walk and understood the honorable concept of fair play .
hopefully the concept expressed in the article that test cricket is not subject to the same corruption is valid as to me at least , it is the ultimate expression of the totally demanding sport .
it requires skill , stamina , intellect and integrity .
if indeed bob woolmers death is in any way associated with the game it is a cancer that needs to be removed .
another instance that sport has become entertainment and big business .
the character building aspects of sport have been lost again .
cricket is becoming another tv and gambling mecca .
goodbye grace , bradman and hammond .
john , usa in a way its blessing in disguise - in today 's resurgent india , we need more productivity , rather than be glued to tv .
we need to move on , and rather become more physically fit , than become obese , by watching cricket .
we should not pass on cricket fever to our young generation .
hanif mohammed , dubai , uae it is time we disregarded the players in both good and bad times .
there are many other people who contribute much more to the nation and are not even paid one tenth of what our mediocre cricketeers are paid .
subhash kaul , india i watched many matches featuring india and pakistan in the 2003 world cup - also one with sri lanka , but no bangladesh to my regret .
the sri lankans were , i thought , really in touch with the spirit of the game - doing their stellar best , enjoying everything , applauding their opponents ' good moments .
wonderful !
then came india .
very passionate spectators , mostly good-humoured and well informed , happy to chat and nice to meet ; but nobody seemed to find it strange when people wandered around holding placards proclaiming the unfortunate sachin tendulkar as a god .
how do they expect him to perform , or even eat his breakfast , with those expectations on his shoulders ?
as a proud but baffled south african , i 'd love to see sri lanka do really well - perhaps lose to us in the final ?
deborah hubbard , south africa as someone who grew up in the 50 's and 60 's following cricket , mainly test cricket , i can not agree more with mukul kesavan .
it is a shame to see the behaviour of so called fans in india .
the players , spoiled by pampering and unlimited advertising incomes , are spoilt .
a drubbing like the one they received was needed - for the players , the fans and the indian cricket control board all of whom seem to have forgotten that cricket is a game not a war that threatens to exterminate the nation .
ajay malik , switzerland i am very happy that indian fans got what they deserve to follow a game without sensibility .
saurabh kaushik , india i have seen this indian team crumble so many times .
everybody says that indian viewers drive this game .
so i have decided not to watch any one day matches involving india .
it is better to see a match between australia vs. south africa where there is no heart break and emotion involved .
jatender koul , india test cricket is not another sport .
its a different form of the same sport .
in my view pakistan and india need new sports .
it ca n't just be cricket 365 days of the year .
in america we have so much to choose from .
there are leagues of professional and college football , basketball , baseball and even soccer .
south asia has a fifth of the world 's population so why ca n't they come up with other sports ?
fawad arain , usa india could not have chosen a better world cup to be beaten out of .
beating pakistan is the real thrill - that shiny trophy is only a secondary consideration .
the english , with their relative attitudes to the ashes and the world cup , will empathise .
manosij majumdar , canada it is time india and pakistan put their cricketing house in order - fair administration and selection and an end to political horse trading .
more importantly , they need to understand the ethics of sport itself .
better to congratulate the winners and commiserate with the losers rather than resort brainlessly to death threats !
phil , hong kong great article .
the chauvinism in india has not only percolated into cricket , but into many other areas and it is high time , india realises and sets its priorities right and concentrates on the real problems of the country .
the corruption is so loathsome in this country and no wonder it has spoiled the game of cricket .
vijay , india the sad fact is players are now over paid , over-pampered and seem to have forgotten that the game and specatators matter more than them .
in 1974 as a 14 year old i saw pakistan play england for the first time at lords .
it was a gripping match which ended in a draw but had some memorable bowling by derek underwood .
on the saturday i was there , it started raining at 2:30 and did not stop .
we waited for the players to come out for autographs , and they finally went to their coach at 6:30 pm .
intikhab alam , the captain , saw me and a few other young boys drenched waiting for the team .
he stopped the coach , asked me on board and got every member of the team to give me an autograph .
he then told me to be a good boy and go straight home !
cut to 2006 and the saturday of the lords test .
memorable innings from yousuf .
this time i took my 10 year old lad with me .
he wanted autographs so he and about 10 other boys -lrb- mostly english -rrb- waited .
at 7:00 pm we were told the pakistan team had left via a separate entrance and in any case were not giving autographs .
perhaps the players need to learn some dignity and respect for young fans , who are the future of the sport .
ejaz , uk i think media is largely responsible for boosting indian players ' egos .
a good score against a weak team and they are treated like superstars and their whole family comes into limelight .
its the media who makes the players god piyush suri , united kingdom stop cricket for a while and please divert funds to other games .
dr b dilip kumar , iraq and dont really understand the crib of the influence of south asian nations on cricket .
if the money comes from india , it will and has to be the power center .
if they cant manage , then the game is gone .
dhananjaya , london god save indian cricket .
eswar ramachandran , chennai , tamil nadu , india i was a cricket fan once to the extend that i had a scrapbook that contained score sheets of all test matches .
this was around 1995-87 , when i was 13-15 years old .
but after watching the soccer world cup in 1998 , my interest in cricket reduced to such a level that i watched cricket only when tendulkar was batting .
after the 2002 soccer world cup , it reduced even further .
my only regret in life is that i wasted too much time watching cricket .
now i do n't even understand how can people prefer cricket to games like soccer or for that matter even kabbadi .
as far as i could see this cricket addiction is more dangerous than drug addiction .
it is tough to get out and you waste too much time .
sujith babu , india legalise betting and give more importance to games like football and tennis .
dinesh , ahmedabad , india europe and south america have the same attitude to football and americans to their football .
so we are entitled to our sins .
yes the game should be purified and the bookies abolished .
but do not throw the baby with the bath water .
sanjaya das , india i guess this is the best thing which has happened to indian cricket .
a few things which need to change - 1. the zonal selection process .
2.amount of money that is associated with cricket.that has to come down drastically if the pressure on players to perform has to come down .
3.the hype by the media of being the best batting line up etc which is utter trash .
-lrb- its almost nine years since sachin has scored a match winning knock in a crucial tie -lrb- except for the not to so important word cup 2003 match against pakistan -rrb- .for almost three to four years now he does n't deserve to be called the world 's greatest batsman .
4.stop critisizing greg chappell -lrb- or any foreign coach -rrb- .at least they bring in some sort of professionalism which we indians lack .

by mukul kesavan author of ' men in white ' india 's fans staged a protest after the world cup loss to sri lanka for indian fans , india 's elimination from the cricket world cup so early in the competition is a crushing disappointment .
for the television channels that bought rights to beam the tournament to these fans , friday 's defeat was a financial disaster .
but for the tournament itself , nothing could have been more tonic than the purging of pakistan and india , the dysfunctional giants of south asian cricket .
instead of these glowering bruisers , the extravagantly gifted sri lankans and the plucky bangladeshis will represent south asia in the next round , the super 8 .
since the reliance world cup hosted by india in 1987 , south asia 's cricketing nations have become more and more influential in the conduct and administration of the one-day game .
the elimination of india and pakistan leaves the world cup in the west indies a happier , less toxic tournament send your comments on mukul kesavan 's article some of this influence has to do with cricketing success : since india won the cup in 1983 , pakistan and sri lanka have won it in 1992 and 1996 respectively .
mainly , though , the balance of power in world cricket has shifted from england and australia towards the sub-continent for commercial reasons : the dawning realisation that india owns the only mass audience there is for the game .
one-day allure cricket was always popular in india , but the coincidence of world cup success in 1983 and the creation of a national television audience in the early 1980s -lrb- doordarshan , india 's sole , government-owned television station at the time , created a pan-indian network in 1982 -rrb- expanded and deepened the fan base of the game .
crucially , this new audience was exclusively drawn to one-day cricket , the shorter form of the game .
pakistan 's elimination from the world cup also drew angry protests there were several reasons for this .
limited overs matches were over in a day , they were never inconclusive and they had a gladiatorial quality that test cricket with its longueurs , wholly lacked .
the arena-like excitement of odis was tailor-made for that great south asian sport , chauvinism .
india and pakistan had resumed cricket relations after a long chill in 1978 , just as limited-overs cricket was starting to take off .
the compulsive need to confront the old enemy led to the creation of a cricket circus in the gulf sheikhdom , sharjah , where , on neutral ground , the sub-continent 's blood feuds were re-played as one-day tournaments for the benefit of increasingly feverish and volatile audiences .
the fusion of chauvinism and television had two bad consequences : an obsessive fan base that tended to become deranged by defeat and the rise of contemporary cricket 's stock villain , the corrupting bookie .
defeat , especially at the hands of the old enemy , led to a -rrb- a suspension of cricketing relations -lrb- india stopped playing pakistan in sharjah after a sequence of defeats led to allegations of foul play -rrb- and b -rrb- to attacks on players or their property -lrb- mohammad kaif 's home was attacked in 2003 , and mahendra dhoni 's house was damaged after india was defeated by bangladesh in their opening match in the present tournament -rrb- .
corruption the rise of the bookie and the phenomenon of match-fixing which nearly destroyed cricket 's credibility as a competitive sport , was a by-product of the new south asian audience for one-day cricket .
it could n't have happened in an environment where the test match was the dominant form .
test cricket is harder to fix .
it happens over a longer span , there are more innings , more variables and it never generates the steaming pressure-cooked excitement that leads to frenzied betting in the course of an odi .
test cricket 's suspense is cumulative , and its metabolic rate too low for villains .
and these bookies , these villains are south asian - located in india and pakistan for the most part , countries where the criminalisation of betting has driven the betting ' industry ' underground .
the corruption that bookies have brought to the game has had foreign recruits like the late south african captain , hansie cronje , but it remains a sub-continental blight .
already bob woolmer 's tragic death is being speculatively attributed to bookmakers worried that the pakistani coach was about to blow the whistle on their racket in his forthcoming book .
cricket will buckle under the weight of the sullen , thin-skinned nationalism that indian and pakistani fans bring to the game and it can certainly do without the bookie-driven corruption that feeds off this perverse enthusiasm .
the elimination of india and pakistan leaves the world cup in the west indies a happier , less toxic tournament ; it might even give the fans of these countries the time to actually play some cricket .
or they could use the break to switch their loyalties to a sport that does n't bring out the worst in them .
test cricket , anyone ?
mukul kesavan is a writer , and his book of cricket , men in white , will be published by penguin india this year .
this debate is closed .
following is a selection of comments you sent .
it 's difficult not to agree with mukul kesavan 's well-written article .
the media has to held responsible for the hype , without giving thought that there are at least half a dozen nations capable of winning the cup .
the electronic media created the hype in order to whip up the passion and influence the corporates to increase spending on advertisement .
person who were fans became journalists and talked anything but cricket .
in addition some of the players played for themselves .
in a way it 's good india lost to sri lanka , otherwise the world would put it down as a match fixed .
khashi nath , india the author has correctly articulated the plight of cricket game in india and pakistan .
it is a national waste when virtually the whole country is glued to tv when the odis or even the tests are played .
in this game , there is no sport now .
there are no sportsmen .
there is only the money .
the debacle should trigger some positive thinking but i am not very hopeful .
prof vn asopa , i quite agree with your article and would also add that some members of the indian team are overrated , lacking the capacity to ' dig in ' during tough times .
the pakistan team simply imploded with all the controversy ; and then the death of the coach is almost the final nail in their coffin .
i pick sri lanka to be in the finals ; while we wait for more positive signs from our beloved west indies .
wendy lawrence , trinidad and tobago not sure if it is good for cricket but it is certainly good for india .
there is way too much craze for the game and this has starved other sports in the country .
it 's not healthy .
hope this creates opportunities for other sports .
sammy , us i totally agree .
as an indian , these days i doubt whether any match played by india or pakistan is really " contested for " at all .
everyone tends to presume that every little happening on field is really a part of a bigger plan hatched by bookies .
its high time for india 's populace to promote other sports as well and take some of the spotlight away from cricket .
ashwin datye , india nicely written but same old story .
i hope this time though the bcci takes a hard look at not only the players but reasons like the selection system , dead-as-a-dodo pitches , past glory over present form of players and the top most fitness levels .
how are we to compete at all if majority of our players need to go off the field every five overs .
we do n't see that in the case of any other team and should take a leaf out of their books there .
but everything said and done , please inject some youth .
rohit kaul , united states this debacle should be a wake up call for all indians .
it is symptomatic of a society that is very poor in mindset and values .
indians should stop trying to find fault with everything around them and realise that the primary reason for their current situation in the world is themselves .
the day when indians accept the fact that they have a lot to fix about themselves the country will take a giant leap forward .
till then we will keep whitewashing ourselves into thinking that we are a world power either in cricket or it or the economy .
kiron , usa with a heavy heart if i were the chairman of selection committee , i would drop sachin tendulkar and ask him to regain his place by scoring in domestic matches just like saurav ganguly .
narendra.pawar , india an excellent article that unfortunately feels correct in its conclusions .
i do not see how india and pakistan can move away for their unhealthy emotional connection to their cricket teams unless other sports -lrb- like football -rrb- take more of the public 's interest / obsession with the game .
for example , if australia do not win the world cup , the cricket loving public will be very disappointed and there will be some media and internal cricket inquisitions but ultimately the focus will move to our winter sports -lrb- aussie rules , rugby league and union -rrb- and the loss will be put in its proper perspective .
with india and pakistan , with the lack of other national attention grabbing sports , the focus remains on your cricket team and this is in no-one 's best interest .
the only way around the betting issue is to play more tests and reduce the number of odi 's , which is not likely to happen given the money involved but for me , it is the only way to reduce the power of the sports gambling cliques and improve the performance of the indian and pakistan teams .
down under , the view is that too much odi cricket is played ahead of test cricket .
rightly or wrongly , it is felt in australia that test cricket is the best teacher of the game and if you master this form of the game , odi cricket will follow .
paul sikand , australia i am happy to see bangladesh is coming up as a cricket giant .
it is always nice to see new powers in any international tournament .
events like this -lrb- beating india and bermuda -rrb- makes me feel proud and remind me of my roots .
i do n't understand cricket very well but i feel the emotion and love of the bangladeshi cricket fans .
well done bangladesh .
i am looking forward to see more success stories .
congratulation both bangladesh and ireland .
ripon , usa india 's victory in 1983 world cup reinvigorated cricket in the world , the results of which you are seeing today .
if india had not arrived in 1983 , then cricket was a dead sport played by the selected white men .
vikram , usa excellent article mukul !
this is indeed true that the unnatural hype around cricket has been harmful to the players , to the game itself , and also to other sports too .
maybe indian players would have played better -lrb- and , who knows , won -rrb- against sri lanka if they had not been under the threat of having their homes attacked if they lost .
the fans need to realize that it is a sport after all , nothing more , nothing less .
the media , too , needs to show responsibility .
at the moment , tv channels in india spend hours giving useless analysis and opinions before and after a cricket match .
it pains me to see that cricket makes front page news in a country facing far bigger problems .
if only we could put our priorities in the right places ...
abhishek saxena , united kingdom i agree with mukul 's comment completely in addition i have few more comments .
i am a long-time avid follower of cricket-india following them through thick and thin over 20 years and i 've decided to give up cricket-watching as a hobby after the toothless show last weekend .
i 've been fooling myself into thinking all-along that indian team has the potential but do n't play consistently but after a series of mediocre games i am convinced that they are not just capable and only play second and third-rung teams well .
i am not going to give one more cent or spend one more hour of my time to this madness where 1 billion people are being cheated and held hostage to a cricket-team that is not any better than say indian soccer or hockey .
we are better off as a nation taking this billions of dollars and investing on other sports where we have a chance in the future .
it is not just an angry outburst of a life-long cricket fan -lrb- atic -rrb- but someone who has become rational and realistic.br / > senthil krishnapillai , usa sachin tendulkar 's time is up .
he should depart from cricket .
isha miranda , sri lanka i agree with mukul .
however , memory of indian cricket fans are very short -lrb- so does advertisers , cricket board and selectors -rrb- .
in next home series , all the indian featherbed batsmen will start making big scores on flat indian pitches .
so the whole thing will be back to square - the way it was before world cup .
the basic problem is that if india plays outside the indian subcontinent indian batsmen simply do n't have any chance .
did n't we lose against weak west indies last time ?
did n't we lose at malaysia couple of months back ?
then the players came back and defeated sri lanka in home grounds .
then we thought india has potential of winning world coup .
what a joke !
bottom-line , indian batsmen simply can not play abroad .
so what was the reason for hoping this world cup will be any different from last west indies tour or malaysia tour or last australia tour or last south africa tour ?
pkd , us we are not minnows anymore !
ehsan , bangladesh readers do expect articles devoid of such flashy rhetoric and better judgement and understanding from these senior cricket experts .
every single time india has played poor cricket to lose a tournament , a line of calls for change is imminent .
suggesting that the game in india has suddenly become a frankenstein , or that the talent we have in india is rotten , or that this will help cleanse the dirt in the system or that indian players are suddenly physically unfit is quite clearly hyperbole rather than any good sense .
what if india had gone on to the next round or even all the way ?
yes in the aftermath of this early exit , some tough decisions regarding the performances of players will and must happen , but to suggest that the game as a whole in india has come to some form of cross-roads reflects badly on the larger scale and scheme of cricket in india .
the game will go on .
to imagine that we need to exorcise some demons in the closet is an exercise in panic and hallucination .
srihari janakiraman , india the fact that the cricketing world can be celebrating the exit of two of its most popular and richest teams , akin to say football celebrating the exit of italy or brazil in the 1st round speaks volumes .
this is surely part of the breather that cricket needs from the stifling influence of the sub-continent on the game .
ryan ramoutar , trinidad and tobago i am very much delighted to see india and pakistan knocked out in the first round and they should learn lessons from the sri lankan cricket team who not only play well but also very professional and have respect for their coach and team-mates .
i had few opportunities to meet sri lankan cricketers and sensed their team spirit .
go sri lanka go for the cup .
you deserve it again .
balan nadarajah , canada it is a well written article high lighting the blind following of cricket in india .
damaging the property of the cricketers is not going to bring out the best in them .
also , there has been too much interference from advertisers .
otherwise , how can a physically unfit pathan can be selected ?
it is time india started looking at youngsters for future .
sangu narayanan , canada the only way to teach a lesson to the indian players is to boycott the products that these players peddle day in and day out .
you can not watch a minute of tv without sachin peddling something .
it is obscene .
hero honda , u.s.a it was the over confident and over cautious approach which caused the debacle and its really unfortunate .
i think neither bangladesh nor ireland is going to perform any better further in the tournament .
ashutosh joshi , uk every country has a sport which its citizens are passionate about and every country has also had its major upsets in the sport they think they are doing well .
just because india and pakistan lost does not mean you have to condemn their cricket fans !
what about football fans in europe .
do you tell them that they are wasting their time every weekend when they go crazy over their beloved football clubs ?
ashok patel , milton keynes , uk we follow cricket as a religion and players as god .
it 's not a game for " sahibs " anymore .
it 's for the masses ! ! !
puneet , united states i just hope that cricket loses all its hype and the mass hysteria that it generates in the subcontinent and people can get on with their lives without having to experience unnecessary emotional turmoil and resort to burning of effigies and indulge in mindless protests .
raghu bindinganavale , uk i think indians are themselves to blame .
we expect too much from team india .
each player is an immensely talented individually but as a team they are a bunch of losers .
except india they never win in good numbers and every indian knows this pretty well but still we hope a lot from them .
i truly agree with steve waugh 's latest statement that players from sub-continent especially from india just plays for their own record and not as a team or that matter for our country .
we got to stop expecting from team india .
gaurav sharma , canada i agree with most of the article and would like to add that even before tv came on the scene , there was much passion for the sport in india , and in the subcontinent .
during test matches , people often huddled around transistor radios and keenly followed the game .
a lot of work at offices was left pending due to this diversion .
as for the present exit of india and pakistan from the 2007 world cup , personally i would like to move on and enjoy the rest of the tournament .
i shall be cheering for sri lanka and bangladesh and see how far they will go knowing that in the end the best oiled machine will make it to the top , most probably australia .
national pride apart , folks need to sit back and enjoy the sport .
rajiv bakshi , saudi arabia according to your article , pakistanis and indians are toxic and as such a poor reflection on cricket .
spoken like the perfect colonial slave that would have done everything to keep cricket ' gora ' .
i 'm disappointed and agitated by your article .
jawwad riaz , pakistan very simple solution - if we do n't win the match then every team player should be banned from doing ads .
and this should be enforced for three years .
gurudaas , india the truth is there is no aggression among the indian cricket players .
losing is their habit and it 's ongoing .
now we cant blame a coach for everything .
it feels like no coach can help india win the world cup .
sachin , dravid , ganguly should now stop playing .
get youngsters .
reetesh bhasin , pune , india i tend to agree with you .
the odis have changed the complexion of the sport by moving it in a profoundly different direction .
cricket has become more and more like football or rugby - it starts and ends at well-defined intervals .
for these reasons , illegal gamblers and match-fixing bookies can make a bundle of money in a very short time period .
moreover , cricket is increasingly being played by well-paid professional players , who do n't have the same pride in carrying their country 's flag as did former cricket players , who were for the most part , either non-professionals or part-time professionals .
i say good riddance to india 's and pakistan 's cricket teams from this world cup !
they do n't deserve to stay around a day longer .
mobiusein , usa this is a very bigoted look at the emergence of cricket as a mass-viewed sport in the sub-continent .
perhaps the author is longing for the days of yore when the ' sahibs ' played in a gentlemanly fashion .
watching india 's win in 1983 as a child , i was just thrilled to watch indians win , that 's all .
the conclusion that cricket took off in south asia because of its ' chauvinistic ' and ' gladiatorial ' qualities is a far reach .
could n't you say that about any sport ?
like football in britain or for that matter , women 's football in the us ?
mo , india i believe that the indian public are stuck with mediocrity in many aspects of life and perhaps cricket tops that list .
i hope that indians will snap out of it - at least with respect to cricket .
sai p. , usa india 's defeat is like a blessing in disguise .
first of all , the advertisers will sit back and think before they sign any player .
secondly the players too will become grounded now .
i have nothing against players involved in commercial activities , but this is taking precedence over the actual game of cricket .
further i fail to understand why players like vvs laxman and mohammed kaif were left out of the squad ? .
players like sachin and saurav should resign now and give way to new players .
ravi chandra kota , switzerland this early exit would act as blessing in disguise to ponder where we really stand in world cricket .
abhijeet chaudhari , india i feel relaxed that we are out of the world cup .
i love cricket , not cricketers any more .
let new champions emerge from this cup .
t chandra sekhar , india first of all lets get this straight , bookies are everywhere .
their headquarters may be in south asia but that does n't mean they do not do buisness elsewhere .
secondly , the part about the dysfunctional giants was uncalled for .
sri lanka played well , so did the bangladeshis .
hence they deserved a place in the super eight .
instead of unnecessary rhetoric it would be good if we all made up our minds and supported the remaining two asian contenders rather than just stand and bicker .
madhusudan , india while there is a lot of truth in what is in the article , let us not forget that cricket unites india like no other single thing or event , and gives the poor of the nation something to feel proud about .
i think the world cup format must be looked at where in effect one poor performance led to india 's demise -lrb- assuming that the game against sl was aways 50:50 -rrb- .
now they are going to have 24 super eight games !
may be it would be better to have more pool games and the top team from each group met in a round robin of the top four teams .
vish , new zealand this was a great article .
india has taken cricket to a whole new level beyond sports- and its not healthy .
their exit can give other teams a chance to play and focus on the game of cricket - not on the players themselves .
india is too obsessive it terms of cricket and it needs to end .
miriam , usa as long as cricket retains mass appeal -lrb- and associated betting revenues -rrb- the potential for corruption will remain .
look at the continual allegations of corruption in the european football leagues .
dilip , uk we need to face the fact that this was the best team we could have sent to the world cup .
pick any other 11 players and that would have probably lost to bermuda as well .
what we need is for bcci to show some sort of accountability and own up to this disaster .
rohit tanwar , india betting , bookies are part of any big popular sports , corruption is unavoidable in any big entity , whether it is football , cricket , a nation or a construction company .
cricket was clean in the past because it was also less popular and involved little money , now it has grown up in its popularity and economy especially because of popularity and economic growth in the indian subcontinent .
corruption is unavoidably involved as big money involved , just like in football .
but that does n't mean that the countries , which brought the passion and money to the sport should stay out .
cricket is benefiting from the passionate indian fans and the growing indian economy ; it would certainly huge losses if icc loose the indian cricket and indian fans .
probably mr. kesavan should invest his precious time in helping icc and bcci to plan strategies to prevent corruption rather than writing such comments .
sachin , germany i can not agree more with you .
finally , a sensible person analysing the game from the true perspective instead of indulging only in glorification of the overrated players .
thank you so much for the article !
adithya , usa the indian people who compare their cricketing heroes with gods should realise that cricket is just a game .
raveethiraraja nirrushan , sri lanka we should not worry too much or get upset .
we have to accept that our players will not bring glory .
so why cry about it ?
romi budhrani , taipei , taiwan let us hope that the disgrace in the west indies will help eliminate the present lot and bring true and committed players into the team .
g.kalamannil , india the sloppiness of the indian team was clearly revealed in the world cup .
they rightly do not deserve to qualify .
shabu varghese , qatar india and pakistan have taken cricket beyond sports .
i agree with you with india and pakistan out , we will see a more sporting contest .
the two countries need to popularise football , hockey , maybe baseball .
naveed khan , usa one less great team to stop us winning the world cup , which is so rightfully ours !
bring it on !
alistair , australia good article .
too much of advertisements and too much of sponsorship for the current indian players .
too much of media hype .
waste of money and waste of time .
india has to learn a lesson and start promoting other games .
n ramanathan , ghana big business must also take some of the blame for this mass hysteria .
huge amounts of money are spent by consumer giants to plug their products and whip up chauvinism by tag-lines like " one in a billion , hoo-hah india " and such disgustingly banality .
show some corporate responsibility for heaven 's sake ! !
jay amrith , singapore it is unfortunate that mukul kesavan has misunderstood the fact that the process of betting is a phenomenon which is as old as the world 's oldest profession .
the failure of the indian and pakistani teams in this world cup does not mean that betting and corruption is removed completely and hence make it less toxic !
such corrupt practices would exist in any other country too but the intensity of finger pointing and blame game would not be the same as the writers and journalist of many countries are responsible and would love to nurture the game and not kill the enthusiastic supporters .
i would continue to watch cricket , support india and pakistan no matter .
praveen ashokan , uae it 's time we faced the grim realities and realised that india is not the giant killer it is made out to be .
a narayanan , india as an ex londoner who had the good fortune of watching cricket at the oval and lords in the forties and fifties it is sad to see that the moral principles of the game have been lost .
i was taught to walk and understood the honorable concept of fair play .
hopefully the concept expressed in the article that test cricket is not subject to the same corruption is valid as to me at least , it is the ultimate expression of the totally demanding sport .
it requires skill , stamina , intellect and integrity .
if indeed bob woolmers death is in any way associated with the game it is a cancer that needs to be removed .
another instance that sport has become entertainment and big business .
the character building aspects of sport have been lost again .
cricket is becoming another tv and gambling mecca .
goodbye grace , bradman and hammond .
john , usa in a way its blessing in disguise - in today 's resurgent india , we need more productivity , rather than be glued to tv .
we need to move on , and rather become more physically fit , than become obese , by watching cricket .
we should not pass on cricket fever to our young generation .
hanif mohammed , dubai , uae it is time we disregarded the players in both good and bad times .
there are many other people who contribute much more to the nation and are not even paid one tenth of what our mediocre cricketeers are paid .
subhash kaul , india i watched many matches featuring india and pakistan in the 2003 world cup - also one with sri lanka , but no bangladesh to my regret .
the sri lankans were , i thought , really in touch with the spirit of the game - doing their stellar best , enjoying everything , applauding their opponents ' good moments .
wonderful !
then came india .
very passionate spectators , mostly good-humoured and well informed , happy to chat and nice to meet ; but nobody seemed to find it strange when people wandered around holding placards proclaiming the unfortunate sachin tendulkar as a god .
how do they expect him to perform , or even eat his breakfast , with those expectations on his shoulders ?
as a proud but baffled south african , i 'd love to see sri lanka do really well - perhaps lose to us in the final ?
deborah hubbard , south africa as someone who grew up in the 50 's and 60 's following cricket , mainly test cricket , i can not agree more with mukul kesavan .
it is a shame to see the behaviour of so called fans in india .
the players , spoiled by pampering and unlimited advertising incomes , are spoilt .
a drubbing like the one they received was needed - for the players , the fans and the indian cricket control board all of whom seem to have forgotten that cricket is a game not a war that threatens to exterminate the nation .
ajay malik , switzerland i am very happy that indian fans got what they deserve to follow a game without sensibility .
saurabh kaushik , india i have seen this indian team crumble so many times .
everybody says that indian viewers drive this game .
so i have decided not to watch any one day matches involving india .
it is better to see a match between australia vs. south africa where there is no heart break and emotion involved .
jatender koul , india test cricket is not another sport .
its a different form of the same sport .
in my view pakistan and india need new sports .
it ca n't just be cricket 365 days of the year .
in america we have so much to choose from .
there are leagues of professional and college football , basketball , baseball and even soccer .
south asia has a fifth of the world 's population so why ca n't they come up with other sports ?
fawad arain , usa india could not have chosen a better world cup to be beaten out of .
beating pakistan is the real thrill - that shiny trophy is only a secondary consideration .
the english , with their relative attitudes to the ashes and the world cup , will empathise .
manosij majumdar , canada it is time india and pakistan put their cricketing house in order - fair administration and selection and an end to political horse trading .
more importantly , they need to understand the ethics of sport itself .
better to congratulate the winners and commiserate with the losers rather than resort brainlessly to death threats !
phil , hong kong great article .
the chauvinism in india has not only percolated into cricket , but into many other areas and it is high time , india realises and sets its priorities right and concentrates on the real problems of the country .
the corruption is so loathsome in this country and no wonder it has spoiled the game of cricket .
vijay , india the sad fact is players are now over paid , over-pampered and seem to have forgotten that the game and specatators matter more than them .
in 1974 as a 14 year old i saw pakistan play england for the first time at lords .
it was a gripping match which ended in a draw but had some memorable bowling by derek underwood .
on the saturday i was there , it started raining at 2:30 and did not stop .
we waited for the players to come out for autographs , and they finally went to their coach at 6:30 pm .
intikhab alam , the captain , saw me and a few other young boys drenched waiting for the team .
he stopped the coach , asked me on board and got every member of the team to give me an autograph .
he then told me to be a good boy and go straight home !
cut to 2006 and the saturday of the lords test .
memorable innings from yousuf .
this time i took my 10 year old lad with me .
he wanted autographs so he and about 10 other boys -lrb- mostly english -rrb- waited .
at 7:00 pm we were told the pakistan team had left via a separate entrance and in any case were not giving autographs .
perhaps the players need to learn some dignity and respect for young fans , who are the future of the sport .
ejaz , uk i think media is largely responsible for boosting indian players ' egos .
a good score against a weak team and they are treated like superstars and their whole family comes into limelight .
its the media who makes the players god piyush suri , united kingdom stop cricket for a while and please divert funds to other games .
dr b dilip kumar , iraq and dont really understand the crib of the influence of south asian nations on cricket .
if the money comes from india , it will and has to be the power center .
if they cant manage , then the game is gone .
dhananjaya , london god save indian cricket .
eswar ramachandran , chennai , tamil nadu , india i was a cricket fan once to the extend that i had a scrapbook that contained score sheets of all test matches .
this was around 1995-87 , when i was 13-15 years old .
but after watching the soccer world cup in 1998 , my interest in cricket reduced to such a level that i watched cricket only when tendulkar was batting .
after the 2002 soccer world cup , it reduced even further .
my only regret in life is that i wasted too much time watching cricket .
now i do n't even understand how can people prefer cricket to games like soccer or for that matter even kabbadi .
as far as i could see this cricket addiction is more dangerous than drug addiction .
it is tough to get out and you waste too much time .
sujith babu , india legalise betting and give more importance to games like football and tennis .
dinesh , ahmedabad , india europe and south america have the same attitude to football and americans to their football .
so we are entitled to our sins .
yes the game should be purified and the bookies abolished .
but do not throw the baby with the bath water .
sanjaya das , india i guess this is the best thing which has happened to indian cricket .
a few things which need to change - 1. the zonal selection process .
2.amount of money that is associated with cricket.that has to come down drastically if the pressure on players to perform has to come down .
3.the hype by the media of being the best batting line up etc which is utter trash .
-lrb- its almost nine years since sachin has scored a match winning knock in a crucial tie -lrb- except for the not to so important word cup 2003 match against pakistan -rrb- .for almost three to four years now he does n't deserve to be called the world 's greatest batsman .
4.stop critisizing greg chappell -lrb- or any foreign coach -rrb- .at least they bring in some sort of professionalism which we indians lack .

by mukul kesavan author of ' men in white ' india 's fans staged a protest after the world cup loss to sri lanka for indian fans , india 's elimination from the cricket world cup so early in the competition is a crushing disappointment .
for the television channels that bought rights to beam the tournament to these fans , friday 's defeat was a financial disaster .
but for the tournament itself , nothing could have been more tonic than the purging of pakistan and india , the dysfunctional giants of south asian cricket .
instead of these glowering bruisers , the extravagantly gifted sri lankans and the plucky bangladeshis will represent south asia in the next round , the super 8 .
since the reliance world cup hosted by india in 1987 , south asia 's cricketing nations have become more and more influential in the conduct and administration of the one-day game .
the elimination of india and pakistan leaves the world cup in the west indies a happier , less toxic tournament send your comments on mukul kesavan 's article some of this influence has to do with cricketing success : since india won the cup in 1983 , pakistan and sri lanka have won it in 1992 and 1996 respectively .
mainly , though , the balance of power in world cricket has shifted from england and australia towards the sub-continent for commercial reasons : the dawning realisation that india owns the only mass audience there is for the game .
one-day allure cricket was always popular in india , but the coincidence of world cup success in 1983 and the creation of a national television audience in the early 1980s -lrb- doordarshan , india 's sole , government-owned television station at the time , created a pan-indian network in 1982 -rrb- expanded and deepened the fan base of the game .
crucially , this new audience was exclusively drawn to one-day cricket , the shorter form of the game .
pakistan 's elimination from the world cup also drew angry protests there were several reasons for this .
limited overs matches were over in a day , they were never inconclusive and they had a gladiatorial quality that test cricket with its longueurs , wholly lacked .
the arena-like excitement of odis was tailor-made for that great south asian sport , chauvinism .
india and pakistan had resumed cricket relations after a long chill in 1978 , just as limited-overs cricket was starting to take off .
the compulsive need to confront the old enemy led to the creation of a cricket circus in the gulf sheikhdom , sharjah , where , on neutral ground , the sub-continent 's blood feuds were re-played as one-day tournaments for the benefit of increasingly feverish and volatile audiences .
the fusion of chauvinism and television had two bad consequences : an obsessive fan base that tended to become deranged by defeat and the rise of contemporary cricket 's stock villain , the corrupting bookie .
defeat , especially at the hands of the old enemy , led to a -rrb- a suspension of cricketing relations -lrb- india stopped playing pakistan in sharjah after a sequence of defeats led to allegations of foul play -rrb- and b -rrb- to attacks on players or their property -lrb- mohammad kaif 's home was attacked in 2003 , and mahendra dhoni 's house was damaged after india was defeated by bangladesh in their opening match in the present tournament -rrb- .
corruption the rise of the bookie and the phenomenon of match-fixing which nearly destroyed cricket 's credibility as a competitive sport , was a by-product of the new south asian audience for one-day cricket .
it could n't have happened in an environment where the test match was the dominant form .
test cricket is harder to fix .
it happens over a longer span , there are more innings , more variables and it never generates the steaming pressure-cooked excitement that leads to frenzied betting in the course of an odi .
test cricket 's suspense is cumulative , and its metabolic rate too low for villains .
and these bookies , these villains are south asian - located in india and pakistan for the most part , countries where the criminalisation of betting has driven the betting ' industry ' underground .
the corruption that bookies have brought to the game has had foreign recruits like the late south african captain , hansie cronje , but it remains a sub-continental blight .
already bob woolmer 's tragic death is being speculatively attributed to bookmakers worried that the pakistani coach was about to blow the whistle on their racket in his forthcoming book .
cricket will buckle under the weight of the sullen , thin-skinned nationalism that indian and pakistani fans bring to the game and it can certainly do without the bookie-driven corruption that feeds off this perverse enthusiasm .
the elimination of india and pakistan leaves the world cup in the west indies a happier , less toxic tournament ; it might even give the fans of these countries the time to actually play some cricket .
or they could use the break to switch their loyalties to a sport that does n't bring out the worst in them .
test cricket , anyone ?
mukul kesavan is a writer , and his book of cricket , men in white , will be published by penguin india this year .
this debate is closed .
following is a selection of comments you sent .
it 's difficult not to agree with mukul kesavan 's well-written article .
the media has to held responsible for the hype , without giving thought that there are at least half a dozen nations capable of winning the cup .
the electronic media created the hype in order to whip up the passion and influence the corporates to increase spending on advertisement .
person who were fans became journalists and talked anything but cricket .
in addition some of the players played for themselves .
in a way it 's good india lost to sri lanka , otherwise the world would put it down as a match fixed .
khashi nath , india the author has correctly articulated the plight of cricket game in india and pakistan .
it is a national waste when virtually the whole country is glued to tv when the odis or even the tests are played .
in this game , there is no sport now .
there are no sportsmen .
there is only the money .
the debacle should trigger some positive thinking but i am not very hopeful .
prof vn asopa , i quite agree with your article and would also add that some members of the indian team are overrated , lacking the capacity to ' dig in ' during tough times .
the pakistan team simply imploded with all the controversy ; and then the death of the coach is almost the final nail in their coffin .
i pick sri lanka to be in the finals ; while we wait for more positive signs from our beloved west indies .
wendy lawrence , trinidad and tobago not sure if it is good for cricket but it is certainly good for india .
there is way too much craze for the game and this has starved other sports in the country .
it 's not healthy .
hope this creates opportunities for other sports .
sammy , us i totally agree .
as an indian , these days i doubt whether any match played by india or pakistan is really " contested for " at all .
everyone tends to presume that every little happening on field is really a part of a bigger plan hatched by bookies .
its high time for india 's populace to promote other sports as well and take some of the spotlight away from cricket .
ashwin datye , india nicely written but same old story .
i hope this time though the bcci takes a hard look at not only the players but reasons like the selection system , dead-as-a-dodo pitches , past glory over present form of players and the top most fitness levels .
how are we to compete at all if majority of our players need to go off the field every five overs .
we do n't see that in the case of any other team and should take a leaf out of their books there .
but everything said and done , please inject some youth .
rohit kaul , united states this debacle should be a wake up call for all indians .
it is symptomatic of a society that is very poor in mindset and values .
indians should stop trying to find fault with everything around them and realise that the primary reason for their current situation in the world is themselves .
the day when indians accept the fact that they have a lot to fix about themselves the country will take a giant leap forward .
till then we will keep whitewashing ourselves into thinking that we are a world power either in cricket or it or the economy .
kiron , usa with a heavy heart if i were the chairman of selection committee , i would drop sachin tendulkar and ask him to regain his place by scoring in domestic matches just like saurav ganguly .
narendra.pawar , india an excellent article that unfortunately feels correct in its conclusions .
i do not see how india and pakistan can move away for their unhealthy emotional connection to their cricket teams unless other sports -lrb- like football -rrb- take more of the public 's interest / obsession with the game .
for example , if australia do not win the world cup , the cricket loving public will be very disappointed and there will be some media and internal cricket inquisitions but ultimately the focus will move to our winter sports -lrb- aussie rules , rugby league and union -rrb- and the loss will be put in its proper perspective .
with india and pakistan , with the lack of other national attention grabbing sports , the focus remains on your cricket team and this is in no-one 's best interest .
the only way around the betting issue is to play more tests and reduce the number of odi 's , which is not likely to happen given the money involved but for me , it is the only way to reduce the power of the sports gambling cliques and improve the performance of the indian and pakistan teams .
down under , the view is that too much odi cricket is played ahead of test cricket .
rightly or wrongly , it is felt in australia that test cricket is the best teacher of the game and if you master this form of the game , odi cricket will follow .
paul sikand , australia i am happy to see bangladesh is coming up as a cricket giant .
it is always nice to see new powers in any international tournament .
events like this -lrb- beating india and bermuda -rrb- makes me feel proud and remind me of my roots .
i do n't understand cricket very well but i feel the emotion and love of the bangladeshi cricket fans .
well done bangladesh .
i am looking forward to see more success stories .
congratulation both bangladesh and ireland .
ripon , usa india 's victory in 1983 world cup reinvigorated cricket in the world , the results of which you are seeing today .
if india had not arrived in 1983 , then cricket was a dead sport played by the selected white men .
vikram , usa excellent article mukul !
this is indeed true that the unnatural hype around cricket has been harmful to the players , to the game itself , and also to other sports too .
maybe indian players would have played better -lrb- and , who knows , won -rrb- against sri lanka if they had not been under the threat of having their homes attacked if they lost .
the fans need to realize that it is a sport after all , nothing more , nothing less .
the media , too , needs to show responsibility .
at the moment , tv channels in india spend hours giving useless analysis and opinions before and after a cricket match .
it pains me to see that cricket makes front page news in a country facing far bigger problems .
if only we could put our priorities in the right places ...
abhishek saxena , united kingdom i agree with mukul 's comment completely in addition i have few more comments .
i am a long-time avid follower of cricket-india following them through thick and thin over 20 years and i 've decided to give up cricket-watching as a hobby after the toothless show last weekend .
i 've been fooling myself into thinking all-along that indian team has the potential but do n't play consistently but after a series of mediocre games i am convinced that they are not just capable and only play second and third-rung teams well .
i am not going to give one more cent or spend one more hour of my time to this madness where 1 billion people are being cheated and held hostage to a cricket-team that is not any better than say indian soccer or hockey .
we are better off as a nation taking this billions of dollars and investing on other sports where we have a chance in the future .
it is not just an angry outburst of a life-long cricket fan -lrb- atic -rrb- but someone who has become rational and realistic.br / > senthil krishnapillai , usa sachin tendulkar 's time is up .
he should depart from cricket .
isha miranda , sri lanka i agree with mukul .
however , memory of indian cricket fans are very short -lrb- so does advertisers , cricket board and selectors -rrb- .
in next home series , all the indian featherbed batsmen will start making big scores on flat indian pitches .
so the whole thing will be back to square - the way it was before world cup .
the basic problem is that if india plays outside the indian subcontinent indian batsmen simply do n't have any chance .
did n't we lose against weak west indies last time ?
did n't we lose at malaysia couple of months back ?
then the players came back and defeated sri lanka in home grounds .
then we thought india has potential of winning world coup .
what a joke !
bottom-line , indian batsmen simply can not play abroad .
so what was the reason for hoping this world cup will be any different from last west indies tour or malaysia tour or last australia tour or last south africa tour ?
pkd , us we are not minnows anymore !
ehsan , bangladesh readers do expect articles devoid of such flashy rhetoric and better judgement and understanding from these senior cricket experts .
every single time india has played poor cricket to lose a tournament , a line of calls for change is imminent .
suggesting that the game in india has suddenly become a frankenstein , or that the talent we have in india is rotten , or that this will help cleanse the dirt in the system or that indian players are suddenly physically unfit is quite clearly hyperbole rather than any good sense .
what if india had gone on to the next round or even all the way ?
yes in the aftermath of this early exit , some tough decisions regarding the performances of players will and must happen , but to suggest that the game as a whole in india has come to some form of cross-roads reflects badly on the larger scale and scheme of cricket in india .
the game will go on .
to imagine that we need to exorcise some demons in the closet is an exercise in panic and hallucination .
srihari janakiraman , india the fact that the cricketing world can be celebrating the exit of two of its most popular and richest teams , akin to say football celebrating the exit of italy or brazil in the 1st round speaks volumes .
this is surely part of the breather that cricket needs from the stifling influence of the sub-continent on the game .
ryan ramoutar , trinidad and tobago i am very much delighted to see india and pakistan knocked out in the first round and they should learn lessons from the sri lankan cricket team who not only play well but also very professional and have respect for their coach and team-mates .
i had few opportunities to meet sri lankan cricketers and sensed their team spirit .
go sri lanka go for the cup .
you deserve it again .
balan nadarajah , canada it is a well written article high lighting the blind following of cricket in india .
damaging the property of the cricketers is not going to bring out the best in them .
also , there has been too much interference from advertisers .
otherwise , how can a physically unfit pathan can be selected ?
it is time india started looking at youngsters for future .
sangu narayanan , canada the only way to teach a lesson to the indian players is to boycott the products that these players peddle day in and day out .
you can not watch a minute of tv without sachin peddling something .
it is obscene .
hero honda , u.s.a it was the over confident and over cautious approach which caused the debacle and its really unfortunate .
i think neither bangladesh nor ireland is going to perform any better further in the tournament .
ashutosh joshi , uk every country has a sport which its citizens are passionate about and every country has also had its major upsets in the sport they think they are doing well .
just because india and pakistan lost does not mean you have to condemn their cricket fans !
what about football fans in europe .
do you tell them that they are wasting their time every weekend when they go crazy over their beloved football clubs ?
ashok patel , milton keynes , uk we follow cricket as a religion and players as god .
it 's not a game for " sahibs " anymore .
it 's for the masses ! ! !
puneet , united states i just hope that cricket loses all its hype and the mass hysteria that it generates in the subcontinent and people can get on with their lives without having to experience unnecessary emotional turmoil and resort to burning of effigies and indulge in mindless protests .
raghu bindinganavale , uk i think indians are themselves to blame .
we expect too much from team india .
each player is an immensely talented individually but as a team they are a bunch of losers .
except india they never win in good numbers and every indian knows this pretty well but still we hope a lot from them .
i truly agree with steve waugh 's latest statement that players from sub-continent especially from india just plays for their own record and not as a team or that matter for our country .
we got to stop expecting from team india .
gaurav sharma , canada i agree with most of the article and would like to add that even before tv came on the scene , there was much passion for the sport in india , and in the subcontinent .
during test matches , people often huddled around transistor radios and keenly followed the game .
a lot of work at offices was left pending due to this diversion .
as for the present exit of india and pakistan from the 2007 world cup , personally i would like to move on and enjoy the rest of the tournament .
i shall be cheering for sri lanka and bangladesh and see how far they will go knowing that in the end the best oiled machine will make it to the top , most probably australia .
national pride apart , folks need to sit back and enjoy the sport .
rajiv bakshi , saudi arabia according to your article , pakistanis and indians are toxic and as such a poor reflection on cricket .
spoken like the perfect colonial slave that would have done everything to keep cricket ' gora ' .
i 'm disappointed and agitated by your article .
jawwad riaz , pakistan very simple solution - if we do n't win the match then every team player should be banned from doing ads .
and this should be enforced for three years .
gurudaas , india the truth is there is no aggression among the indian cricket players .
losing is their habit and it 's ongoing .
now we cant blame a coach for everything .
it feels like no coach can help india win the world cup .
sachin , dravid , ganguly should now stop playing .
get youngsters .
reetesh bhasin , pune , india i tend to agree with you .
the odis have changed the complexion of the sport by moving it in a profoundly different direction .
cricket has become more and more like football or rugby - it starts and ends at well-defined intervals .
for these reasons , illegal gamblers and match-fixing bookies can make a bundle of money in a very short time period .
moreover , cricket is increasingly being played by well-paid professional players , who do n't have the same pride in carrying their country 's flag as did former cricket players , who were for the most part , either non-professionals or part-time professionals .
i say good riddance to india 's and pakistan 's cricket teams from this world cup !
they do n't deserve to stay around a day longer .
mobiusein , usa this is a very bigoted look at the emergence of cricket as a mass-viewed sport in the sub-continent .
perhaps the author is longing for the days of yore when the ' sahibs ' played in a gentlemanly fashion .
watching india 's win in 1983 as a child , i was just thrilled to watch indians win , that 's all .
the conclusion that cricket took off in south asia because of its ' chauvinistic ' and ' gladiatorial ' qualities is a far reach .
could n't you say that about any sport ?
like football in britain or for that matter , women 's football in the us ?
mo , india i believe that the indian public are stuck with mediocrity in many aspects of life and perhaps cricket tops that list .
i hope that indians will snap out of it - at least with respect to cricket .
sai p. , usa india 's defeat is like a blessing in disguise .
first of all , the advertisers will sit back and think before they sign any player .
secondly the players too will become grounded now .
i have nothing against players involved in commercial activities , but this is taking precedence over the actual game of cricket .
further i fail to understand why players like vvs laxman and mohammed kaif were left out of the squad ? .
players like sachin and saurav should resign now and give way to new players .
ravi chandra kota , switzerland this early exit would act as blessing in disguise to ponder where we really stand in world cricket .
abhijeet chaudhari , india i feel relaxed that we are out of the world cup .
i love cricket , not cricketers any more .
let new champions emerge from this cup .
t chandra sekhar , india first of all lets get this straight , bookies are everywhere .
their headquarters may be in south asia but that does n't mean they do not do buisness elsewhere .
secondly , the part about the dysfunctional giants was uncalled for .
sri lanka played well , so did the bangladeshis .
hence they deserved a place in the super eight .
instead of unnecessary rhetoric it would be good if we all made up our minds and supported the remaining two asian contenders rather than just stand and bicker .
madhusudan , india while there is a lot of truth in what is in the article , let us not forget that cricket unites india like no other single thing or event , and gives the poor of the nation something to feel proud about .
i think the world cup format must be looked at where in effect one poor performance led to india 's demise -lrb- assuming that the game against sl was aways 50:50 -rrb- .
now they are going to have 24 super eight games !
may be it would be better to have more pool games and the top team from each group met in a round robin of the top four teams .
vish , new zealand this was a great article .
india has taken cricket to a whole new level beyond sports- and its not healthy .
their exit can give other teams a chance to play and focus on the game of cricket - not on the players themselves .
india is too obsessive it terms of cricket and it needs to end .
miriam , usa as long as cricket retains mass appeal -lrb- and associated betting revenues -rrb- the potential for corruption will remain .
look at the continual allegations of corruption in the european football leagues .
dilip , uk we need to face the fact that this was the best team we could have sent to the world cup .
pick any other 11 players and that would have probably lost to bermuda as well .
what we need is for bcci to show some sort of accountability and own up to this disaster .
rohit tanwar , india betting , bookies are part of any big popular sports , corruption is unavoidable in any big entity , whether it is football , cricket , a nation or a construction company .
cricket was clean in the past because it was also less popular and involved little money , now it has grown up in its popularity and economy especially because of popularity and economic growth in the indian subcontinent .
corruption is unavoidably involved as big money involved , just like in football .
but that does n't mean that the countries , which brought the passion and money to the sport should stay out .
cricket is benefiting from the passionate indian fans and the growing indian economy ; it would certainly huge losses if icc loose the indian cricket and indian fans .
probably mr. kesavan should invest his precious time in helping icc and bcci to plan strategies to prevent corruption rather than writing such comments .
sachin , germany i can not agree more with you .
finally , a sensible person analysing the game from the true perspective instead of indulging only in glorification of the overrated players .
thank you so much for the article !
adithya , usa the indian people who compare their cricketing heroes with gods should realise that cricket is just a game .
raveethiraraja nirrushan , sri lanka we should not worry too much or get upset .
we have to accept that our players will not bring glory .
so why cry about it ?
romi budhrani , taipei , taiwan let us hope that the disgrace in the west indies will help eliminate the present lot and bring true and committed players into the team .
g.kalamannil , india the sloppiness of the indian team was clearly revealed in the world cup .
they rightly do not deserve to qualify .
shabu varghese , qatar india and pakistan have taken cricket beyond sports .
i agree with you with india and pakistan out , we will see a more sporting contest .
the two countries need to popularise football , hockey , maybe baseball .
naveed khan , usa one less great team to stop us winning the world cup , which is so rightfully ours !
bring it on !
alistair , australia good article .
too much of advertisements and too much of sponsorship for the current indian players .
too much of media hype .
waste of money and waste of time .
india has to learn a lesson and start promoting other games .
n ramanathan , ghana big business must also take some of the blame for this mass hysteria .
huge amounts of money are spent by consumer giants to plug their products and whip up chauvinism by tag-lines like " one in a billion , hoo-hah india " and such disgustingly banality .
show some corporate responsibility for heaven 's sake ! !
jay amrith , singapore it is unfortunate that mukul kesavan has misunderstood the fact that the process of betting is a phenomenon which is as old as the world 's oldest profession .
the failure of the indian and pakistani teams in this world cup does not mean that betting and corruption is removed completely and hence make it less toxic !
such corrupt practices would exist in any other country too but the intensity of finger pointing and blame game would not be the same as the writers and journalist of many countries are responsible and would love to nurture the game and not kill the enthusiastic supporters .
i would continue to watch cricket , support india and pakistan no matter .
praveen ashokan , uae it 's time we faced the grim realities and realised that india is not the giant killer it is made out to be .
a narayanan , india as an ex londoner who had the good fortune of watching cricket at the oval and lords in the forties and fifties it is sad to see that the moral principles of the game have been lost .
i was taught to walk and understood the honorable concept of fair play .
hopefully the concept expressed in the article that test cricket is not subject to the same corruption is valid as to me at least , it is the ultimate expression of the totally demanding sport .
it requires skill , stamina , intellect and integrity .
if indeed bob woolmers death is in any way associated with the game it is a cancer that needs to be removed .
another instance that sport has become entertainment and big business .
the character building aspects of sport have been lost again .
cricket is becoming another tv and gambling mecca .
goodbye grace , bradman and hammond .
john , usa in a way its blessing in disguise - in today 's resurgent india , we need more productivity , rather than be glued to tv .
we need to move on , and rather become more physically fit , than become obese , by watching cricket .
we should not pass on cricket fever to our young generation .
hanif mohammed , dubai , uae it is time we disregarded the players in both good and bad times .
there are many other people who contribute much more to the nation and are not even paid one tenth of what our mediocre cricketeers are paid .
subhash kaul , india i watched many matches featuring india and pakistan in the 2003 world cup - also one with sri lanka , but no bangladesh to my regret .
the sri lankans were , i thought , really in touch with the spirit of the game - doing their stellar best , enjoying everything , applauding their opponents ' good moments .
wonderful !
then came india .
very passionate spectators , mostly good-humoured and well informed , happy to chat and nice to meet ; but nobody seemed to find it strange when people wandered around holding placards proclaiming the unfortunate sachin tendulkar as a god .
how do they expect him to perform , or even eat his breakfast , with those expectations on his shoulders ?
as a proud but baffled south african , i 'd love to see sri lanka do really well - perhaps lose to us in the final ?
deborah hubbard , south africa as someone who grew up in the 50 's and 60 's following cricket , mainly test cricket , i can not agree more with mukul kesavan .
it is a shame to see the behaviour of so called fans in india .
the players , spoiled by pampering and unlimited advertising incomes , are spoilt .
a drubbing like the one they received was needed - for the players , the fans and the indian cricket control board all of whom seem to have forgotten that cricket is a game not a war that threatens to exterminate the nation .
ajay malik , switzerland i am very happy that indian fans got what they deserve to follow a game without sensibility .
saurabh kaushik , india i have seen this indian team crumble so many times .
everybody says that indian viewers drive this game .
so i have decided not to watch any one day matches involving india .
it is better to see a match between australia vs. south africa where there is no heart break and emotion involved .
jatender koul , india test cricket is not another sport .
its a different form of the same sport .
in my view pakistan and india need new sports .
it ca n't just be cricket 365 days of the year .
in america we have so much to choose from .
there are leagues of professional and college football , basketball , baseball and even soccer .
south asia has a fifth of the world 's population so why ca n't they come up with other sports ?
fawad arain , usa india could not have chosen a better world cup to be beaten out of .
beating pakistan is the real thrill - that shiny trophy is only a secondary consideration .
the english , with their relative attitudes to the ashes and the world cup , will empathise .
manosij majumdar , canada it is time india and pakistan put their cricketing house in order - fair administration and selection and an end to political horse trading .
more importantly , they need to understand the ethics of sport itself .
better to congratulate the winners and commiserate with the losers rather than resort brainlessly to death threats !
phil , hong kong great article .
the chauvinism in india has not only percolated into cricket , but into many other areas and it is high time , india realises and sets its priorities right and concentrates on the real problems of the country .
the corruption is so loathsome in this country and no wonder it has spoiled the game of cricket .
vijay , india the sad fact is players are now over paid , over-pampered and seem to have forgotten that the game and specatators matter more than them .
in 1974 as a 14 year old i saw pakistan play england for the first time at lords .
it was a gripping match which ended in a draw but had some memorable bowling by derek underwood .
on the saturday i was there , it started raining at 2:30 and did not stop .
we waited for the players to come out for autographs , and they finally went to their coach at 6:30 pm .
intikhab alam , the captain , saw me and a few other young boys drenched waiting for the team .
he stopped the coach , asked me on board and got every member of the team to give me an autograph .
he then told me to be a good boy and go straight home !
cut to 2006 and the saturday of the lords test .
memorable innings from yousuf .
this time i took my 10 year old lad with me .
he wanted autographs so he and about 10 other boys -lrb- mostly english -rrb- waited .
at 7:00 pm we were told the pakistan team had left via a separate entrance and in any case were not giving autographs .
perhaps the players need to learn some dignity and respect for young fans , who are the future of the sport .
ejaz , uk i think media is largely responsible for boosting indian players ' egos .
a good score against a weak team and they are treated like superstars and their whole family comes into limelight .
its the media who makes the players god piyush suri , united kingdom stop cricket for a while and please divert funds to other games .
dr b dilip kumar , iraq and dont really understand the crib of the influence of south asian nations on cricket .
if the money comes from india , it will and has to be the power center .
if they cant manage , then the game is gone .
dhananjaya , london god save indian cricket .
eswar ramachandran , chennai , tamil nadu , india i was a cricket fan once to the extend that i had a scrapbook that contained score sheets of all test matches .
this was around 1995-87 , when i was 13-15 years old .
but after watching the soccer world cup in 1998 , my interest in cricket reduced to such a level that i watched cricket only when tendulkar was batting .
after the 2002 soccer world cup , it reduced even further .
my only regret in life is that i wasted too much time watching cricket .
now i do n't even understand how can people prefer cricket to games like soccer or for that matter even kabbadi .
as far as i could see this cricket addiction is more dangerous than drug addiction .
it is tough to get out and you waste too much time .
sujith babu , india legalise betting and give more importance to games like football and tennis .
dinesh , ahmedabad , india europe and south america have the same attitude to football and americans to their football .
so we are entitled to our sins .
yes the game should be purified and the bookies abolished .
but do not throw the baby with the bath water .
sanjaya das , india i guess this is the best thing which has happened to indian cricket .
a few things which need to change - 1. the zonal selection process .
2.amount of money that is associated with cricket.that has to come down drastically if the pressure on players to perform has to come down .
3.the hype by the media of being the best batting line up etc which is utter trash .
-lrb- its almost nine years since sachin has scored a match winning knock in a crucial tie -lrb- except for the not to so important word cup 2003 match against pakistan -rrb- .for almost three to four years now he does n't deserve to be called the world 's greatest batsman .
4.stop critisizing greg chappell -lrb- or any foreign coach -rrb- .at least they bring in some sort of professionalism which we indians lack .

by mukul kesavan author of ' men in white ' india 's fans staged a protest after the world cup loss to sri lanka for indian fans , india 's elimination from the cricket world cup so early in the competition is a crushing disappointment .
for the television channels that bought rights to beam the tournament to these fans , friday 's defeat was a financial disaster .
but for the tournament itself , nothing could have been more tonic than the purging of pakistan and india , the dysfunctional giants of south asian cricket .
instead of these glowering bruisers , the extravagantly gifted sri lankans and the plucky bangladeshis will represent south asia in the next round , the super 8 .
since the reliance world cup hosted by india in 1987 , south asia 's cricketing nations have become more and more influential in the conduct and administration of the one-day game .
the elimination of india and pakistan leaves the world cup in the west indies a happier , less toxic tournament send your comments on mukul kesavan 's article some of this influence has to do with cricketing success : since india won the cup in 1983 , pakistan and sri lanka have won it in 1992 and 1996 respectively .
mainly , though , the balance of power in world cricket has shifted from england and australia towards the sub-continent for commercial reasons : the dawning realisation that india owns the only mass audience there is for the game .
one-day allure cricket was always popular in india , but the coincidence of world cup success in 1983 and the creation of a national television audience in the early 1980s -lrb- doordarshan , india 's sole , government-owned television station at the time , created a pan-indian network in 1982 -rrb- expanded and deepened the fan base of the game .
crucially , this new audience was exclusively drawn to one-day cricket , the shorter form of the game .
pakistan 's elimination from the world cup also drew angry protests there were several reasons for this .
limited overs matches were over in a day , they were never inconclusive and they had a gladiatorial quality that test cricket with its longueurs , wholly lacked .
the arena-like excitement of odis was tailor-made for that great south asian sport , chauvinism .
india and pakistan had resumed cricket relations after a long chill in 1978 , just as limited-overs cricket was starting to take off .
the compulsive need to confront the old enemy led to the creation of a cricket circus in the gulf sheikhdom , sharjah , where , on neutral ground , the sub-continent 's blood feuds were re-played as one-day tournaments for the benefit of increasingly feverish and volatile audiences .
the fusion of chauvinism and television had two bad consequences : an obsessive fan base that tended to become deranged by defeat and the rise of contemporary cricket 's stock villain , the corrupting bookie .
defeat , especially at the hands of the old enemy , led to a -rrb- a suspension of cricketing relations -lrb- india stopped playing pakistan in sharjah after a sequence of defeats led to allegations of foul play -rrb- and b -rrb- to attacks on players or their property -lrb- mohammad kaif 's home was attacked in 2003 , and mahendra dhoni 's house was damaged after india was defeated by bangladesh in their opening match in the present tournament -rrb- .
corruption the rise of the bookie and the phenomenon of match-fixing which nearly destroyed cricket 's credibility as a competitive sport , was a by-product of the new south asian audience for one-day cricket .
it could n't have happened in an environment where the test match was the dominant form .
test cricket is harder to fix .
it happens over a longer span , there are more innings , more variables and it never generates the steaming pressure-cooked excitement that leads to frenzied betting in the course of an odi .
test cricket 's suspense is cumulative , and its metabolic rate too low for villains .
and these bookies , these villains are south asian - located in india and pakistan for the most part , countries where the criminalisation of betting has driven the betting ' industry ' underground .
the corruption that bookies have brought to the game has had foreign recruits like the late south african captain , hansie cronje , but it remains a sub-continental blight .
already bob woolmer 's tragic death is being speculatively attributed to bookmakers worried that the pakistani coach was about to blow the whistle on their racket in his forthcoming book .
cricket will buckle under the weight of the sullen , thin-skinned nationalism that indian and pakistani fans bring to the game and it can certainly do without the bookie-driven corruption that feeds off this perverse enthusiasm .
the elimination of india and pakistan leaves the world cup in the west indies a happier , less toxic tournament ; it might even give the fans of these countries the time to actually play some cricket .
or they could use the break to switch their loyalties to a sport that does n't bring out the worst in them .
test cricket , anyone ?
mukul kesavan is a writer , and his book of cricket , men in white , will be published by penguin india this year .
this debate is closed .
following is a selection of comments you sent .
it 's difficult not to agree with mukul kesavan 's well-written article .
the media has to held responsible for the hype , without giving thought that there are at least half a dozen nations capable of winning the cup .
the electronic media created the hype in order to whip up the passion and influence the corporates to increase spending on advertisement .
person who were fans became journalists and talked anything but cricket .
in addition some of the players played for themselves .
in a way it 's good india lost to sri lanka , otherwise the world would put it down as a match fixed .
khashi nath , india the author has correctly articulated the plight of cricket game in india and pakistan .
it is a national waste when virtually the whole country is glued to tv when the odis or even the tests are played .
in this game , there is no sport now .
there are no sportsmen .
there is only the money .
the debacle should trigger some positive thinking but i am not very hopeful .
prof vn asopa , i quite agree with your article and would also add that some members of the indian team are overrated , lacking the capacity to ' dig in ' during tough times .
the pakistan team simply imploded with all the controversy ; and then the death of the coach is almost the final nail in their coffin .
i pick sri lanka to be in the finals ; while we wait for more positive signs from our beloved west indies .
wendy lawrence , trinidad and tobago not sure if it is good for cricket but it is certainly good for india .
there is way too much craze for the game and this has starved other sports in the country .
it 's not healthy .
hope this creates opportunities for other sports .
sammy , us i totally agree .
as an indian , these days i doubt whether any match played by india or pakistan is really " contested for " at all .
everyone tends to presume that every little happening on field is really a part of a bigger plan hatched by bookies .
its high time for india 's populace to promote other sports as well and take some of the spotlight away from cricket .
ashwin datye , india nicely written but same old story .
i hope this time though the bcci takes a hard look at not only the players but reasons like the selection system , dead-as-a-dodo pitches , past glory over present form of players and the top most fitness levels .
how are we to compete at all if majority of our players need to go off the field every five overs .
we do n't see that in the case of any other team and should take a leaf out of their books there .
but everything said and done , please inject some youth .
rohit kaul , united states this debacle should be a wake up call for all indians .
it is symptomatic of a society that is very poor in mindset and values .
indians should stop trying to find fault with everything around them and realise that the primary reason for their current situation in the world is themselves .
the day when indians accept the fact that they have a lot to fix about themselves the country will take a giant leap forward .
till then we will keep whitewashing ourselves into thinking that we are a world power either in cricket or it or the economy .
kiron , usa with a heavy heart if i were the chairman of selection committee , i would drop sachin tendulkar and ask him to regain his place by scoring in domestic matches just like saurav ganguly .
narendra.pawar , india an excellent article that unfortunately feels correct in its conclusions .
i do not see how india and pakistan can move away for their unhealthy emotional connection to their cricket teams unless other sports -lrb- like football -rrb- take more of the public 's interest / obsession with the game .
for example , if australia do not win the world cup , the cricket loving public will be very disappointed and there will be some media and internal cricket inquisitions but ultimately the focus will move to our winter sports -lrb- aussie rules , rugby league and union -rrb- and the loss will be put in its proper perspective .
with india and pakistan , with the lack of other national attention grabbing sports , the focus remains on your cricket team and this is in no-one 's best interest .
the only way around the betting issue is to play more tests and reduce the number of odi 's , which is not likely to happen given the money involved but for me , it is the only way to reduce the power of the sports gambling cliques and improve the performance of the indian and pakistan teams .
down under , the view is that too much odi cricket is played ahead of test cricket .
rightly or wrongly , it is felt in australia that test cricket is the best teacher of the game and if you master this form of the game , odi cricket will follow .
paul sikand , australia i am happy to see bangladesh is coming up as a cricket giant .
it is always nice to see new powers in any international tournament .
events like this -lrb- beating india and bermuda -rrb- makes me feel proud and remind me of my roots .
i do n't understand cricket very well but i feel the emotion and love of the bangladeshi cricket fans .
well done bangladesh .
i am looking forward to see more success stories .
congratulation both bangladesh and ireland .
ripon , usa india 's victory in 1983 world cup reinvigorated cricket in the world , the results of which you are seeing today .
if india had not arrived in 1983 , then cricket was a dead sport played by the selected white men .
vikram , usa excellent article mukul !
this is indeed true that the unnatural hype around cricket has been harmful to the players , to the game itself , and also to other sports too .
maybe indian players would have played better -lrb- and , who knows , won -rrb- against sri lanka if they had not been under the threat of having their homes attacked if they lost .
the fans need to realize that it is a sport after all , nothing more , nothing less .
the media , too , needs to show responsibility .
at the moment , tv channels in india spend hours giving useless analysis and opinions before and after a cricket match .
it pains me to see that cricket makes front page news in a country facing far bigger problems .
if only we could put our priorities in the right places ...
abhishek saxena , united kingdom i agree with mukul 's comment completely in addition i have few more comments .
i am a long-time avid follower of cricket-india following them through thick and thin over 20 years and i 've decided to give up cricket-watching as a hobby after the toothless show last weekend .
i 've been fooling myself into thinking all-along that indian team has the potential but do n't play consistently but after a series of mediocre games i am convinced that they are not just capable and only play second and third-rung teams well .
i am not going to give one more cent or spend one more hour of my time to this madness where 1 billion people are being cheated and held hostage to a cricket-team that is not any better than say indian soccer or hockey .
we are better off as a nation taking this billions of dollars and investing on other sports where we have a chance in the future .
it is not just an angry outburst of a life-long cricket fan -lrb- atic -rrb- but someone who has become rational and realistic.br / > senthil krishnapillai , usa sachin tendulkar 's time is up .
he should depart from cricket .
isha miranda , sri lanka i agree with mukul .
however , memory of indian cricket fans are very short -lrb- so does advertisers , cricket board and selectors -rrb- .
in next home series , all the indian featherbed batsmen will start making big scores on flat indian pitches .
so the whole thing will be back to square - the way it was before world cup .
the basic problem is that if india plays outside the indian subcontinent indian batsmen simply do n't have any chance .
did n't we lose against weak west indies last time ?
did n't we lose at malaysia couple of months back ?
then the players came back and defeated sri lanka in home grounds .
then we thought india has potential of winning world coup .
what a joke !
bottom-line , indian batsmen simply can not play abroad .
so what was the reason for hoping this world cup will be any different from last west indies tour or malaysia tour or last australia tour or last south africa tour ?
pkd , us we are not minnows anymore !
ehsan , bangladesh readers do expect articles devoid of such flashy rhetoric and better judgement and understanding from these senior cricket experts .
every single time india has played poor cricket to lose a tournament , a line of calls for change is imminent .
suggesting that the game in india has suddenly become a frankenstein , or that the talent we have in india is rotten , or that this will help cleanse the dirt in the system or that indian players are suddenly physically unfit is quite clearly hyperbole rather than any good sense .
what if india had gone on to the next round or even all the way ?
yes in the aftermath of this early exit , some tough decisions regarding the performances of players will and must happen , but to suggest that the game as a whole in india has come to some form of cross-roads reflects badly on the larger scale and scheme of cricket in india .
the game will go on .
to imagine that we need to exorcise some demons in the closet is an exercise in panic and hallucination .
srihari janakiraman , india the fact that the cricketing world can be celebrating the exit of two of its most popular and richest teams , akin to say football celebrating the exit of italy or brazil in the 1st round speaks volumes .
this is surely part of the breather that cricket needs from the stifling influence of the sub-continent on the game .
ryan ramoutar , trinidad and tobago i am very much delighted to see india and pakistan knocked out in the first round and they should learn lessons from the sri lankan cricket team who not only play well but also very professional and have respect for their coach and team-mates .
i had few opportunities to meet sri lankan cricketers and sensed their team spirit .
go sri lanka go for the cup .
you deserve it again .
balan nadarajah , canada it is a well written article high lighting the blind following of cricket in india .
damaging the property of the cricketers is not going to bring out the best in them .
also , there has been too much interference from advertisers .
otherwise , how can a physically unfit pathan can be selected ?
it is time india started looking at youngsters for future .
sangu narayanan , canada the only way to teach a lesson to the indian players is to boycott the products that these players peddle day in and day out .
you can not watch a minute of tv without sachin peddling something .
it is obscene .
hero honda , u.s.a it was the over confident and over cautious approach which caused the debacle and its really unfortunate .
i think neither bangladesh nor ireland is going to perform any better further in the tournament .
ashutosh joshi , uk every country has a sport which its citizens are passionate about and every country has also had its major upsets in the sport they think they are doing well .
just because india and pakistan lost does not mean you have to condemn their cricket fans !
what about football fans in europe .
do you tell them that they are wasting their time every weekend when they go crazy over their beloved football clubs ?
ashok patel , milton keynes , uk we follow cricket as a religion and players as god .
it 's not a game for " sahibs " anymore .
it 's for the masses ! ! !
puneet , united states i just hope that cricket loses all its hype and the mass hysteria that it generates in the subcontinent and people can get on with their lives without having to experience unnecessary emotional turmoil and resort to burning of effigies and indulge in mindless protests .
raghu bindinganavale , uk i think indians are themselves to blame .
we expect too much from team india .
each player is an immensely talented individually but as a team they are a bunch of losers .
except india they never win in good numbers and every indian knows this pretty well but still we hope a lot from them .
i truly agree with steve waugh 's latest statement that players from sub-continent especially from india just plays for their own record and not as a team or that matter for our country .
we got to stop expecting from team india .
gaurav sharma , canada i agree with most of the article and would like to add that even before tv came on the scene , there was much passion for the sport in india , and in the subcontinent .
during test matches , people often huddled around transistor radios and keenly followed the game .
a lot of work at offices was left pending due to this diversion .
as for the present exit of india and pakistan from the 2007 world cup , personally i would like to move on and enjoy the rest of the tournament .
i shall be cheering for sri lanka and bangladesh and see how far they will go knowing that in the end the best oiled machine will make it to the top , most probably australia .
national pride apart , folks need to sit back and enjoy the sport .
rajiv bakshi , saudi arabia according to your article , pakistanis and indians are toxic and as such a poor reflection on cricket .
spoken like the perfect colonial slave that would have done everything to keep cricket ' gora ' .
i 'm disappointed and agitated by your article .
jawwad riaz , pakistan very simple solution - if we do n't win the match then every team player should be banned from doing ads .
and this should be enforced for three years .
gurudaas , india the truth is there is no aggression among the indian cricket players .
losing is their habit and it 's ongoing .
now we cant blame a coach for everything .
it feels like no coach can help india win the world cup .
sachin , dravid , ganguly should now stop playing .
get youngsters .
reetesh bhasin , pune , india i tend to agree with you .
the odis have changed the complexion of the sport by moving it in a profoundly different direction .
cricket has become more and more like football or rugby - it starts and ends at well-defined intervals .
for these reasons , illegal gamblers and match-fixing bookies can make a bundle of money in a very short time period .
moreover , cricket is increasingly being played by well-paid professional players , who do n't have the same pride in carrying their country 's flag as did former cricket players , who were for the most part , either non-professionals or part-time professionals .
i say good riddance to india 's and pakistan 's cricket teams from this world cup !
they do n't deserve to stay around a day longer .
mobiusein , usa this is a very bigoted look at the emergence of cricket as a mass-viewed sport in the sub-continent .
perhaps the author is longing for the days of yore when the ' sahibs ' played in a gentlemanly fashion .
watching india 's win in 1983 as a child , i was just thrilled to watch indians win , that 's all .
the conclusion that cricket took off in south asia because of its ' chauvinistic ' and ' gladiatorial ' qualities is a far reach .
could n't you say that about any sport ?
like football in britain or for that matter , women 's football in the us ?
mo , india i believe that the indian public are stuck with mediocrity in many aspects of life and perhaps cricket tops that list .
i hope that indians will snap out of it - at least with respect to cricket .
sai p. , usa india 's defeat is like a blessing in disguise .
first of all , the advertisers will sit back and think before they sign any player .
secondly the players too will become grounded now .
i have nothing against players involved in commercial activities , but this is taking precedence over the actual game of cricket .
further i fail to understand why players like vvs laxman and mohammed kaif were left out of the squad ? .
players like sachin and saurav should resign now and give way to new players .
ravi chandra kota , switzerland this early exit would act as blessing in disguise to ponder where we really stand in world cricket .
abhijeet chaudhari , india i feel relaxed that we are out of the world cup .
i love cricket , not cricketers any more .
let new champions emerge from this cup .
t chandra sekhar , india first of all lets get this straight , bookies are everywhere .
their headquarters may be in south asia but that does n't mean they do not do buisness elsewhere .
secondly , the part about the dysfunctional giants was uncalled for .
sri lanka played well , so did the bangladeshis .
hence they deserved a place in the super eight .
instead of unnecessary rhetoric it would be good if we all made up our minds and supported the remaining two asian contenders rather than just stand and bicker .
madhusudan , india while there is a lot of truth in what is in the article , let us not forget that cricket unites india like no other single thing or event , and gives the poor of the nation something to feel proud about .
i think the world cup format must be looked at where in effect one poor performance led to india 's demise -lrb- assuming that the game against sl was aways 50:50 -rrb- .
now they are going to have 24 super eight games !
may be it would be better to have more pool games and the top team from each group met in a round robin of the top four teams .
vish , new zealand this was a great article .
india has taken cricket to a whole new level beyond sports- and its not healthy .
their exit can give other teams a chance to play and focus on the game of cricket - not on the players themselves .
india is too obsessive it terms of cricket and it needs to end .
miriam , usa as long as cricket retains mass appeal -lrb- and associated betting revenues -rrb- the potential for corruption will remain .
look at the continual allegations of corruption in the european football leagues .
dilip , uk we need to face the fact that this was the best team we could have sent to the world cup .
pick any other 11 players and that would have probably lost to bermuda as well .
what we need is for bcci to show some sort of accountability and own up to this disaster .
rohit tanwar , india betting , bookies are part of any big popular sports , corruption is unavoidable in any big entity , whether it is football , cricket , a nation or a construction company .
cricket was clean in the past because it was also less popular and involved little money , now it has grown up in its popularity and economy especially because of popularity and economic growth in the indian subcontinent .
corruption is unavoidably involved as big money involved , just like in football .
but that does n't mean that the countries , which brought the passion and money to the sport should stay out .
cricket is benefiting from the passionate indian fans and the growing indian economy ; it would certainly huge losses if icc loose the indian cricket and indian fans .
probably mr. kesavan should invest his precious time in helping icc and bcci to plan strategies to prevent corruption rather than writing such comments .
sachin , germany i can not agree more with you .
finally , a sensible person analysing the game from the true perspective instead of indulging only in glorification of the overrated players .
thank you so much for the article !
adithya , usa the indian people who compare their cricketing heroes with gods should realise that cricket is just a game .
raveethiraraja nirrushan , sri lanka we should not worry too much or get upset .
we have to accept that our players will not bring glory .
so why cry about it ?
romi budhrani , taipei , taiwan let us hope that the disgrace in the west indies will help eliminate the present lot and bring true and committed players into the team .
g.kalamannil , india the sloppiness of the indian team was clearly revealed in the world cup .
they rightly do not deserve to qualify .
shabu varghese , qatar india and pakistan have taken cricket beyond sports .
i agree with you with india and pakistan out , we will see a more sporting contest .
the two countries need to popularise football , hockey , maybe baseball .
naveed khan , usa one less great team to stop us winning the world cup , which is so rightfully ours !
bring it on !
alistair , australia good article .
too much of advertisements and too much of sponsorship for the current indian players .
too much of media hype .
waste of money and waste of time .
india has to learn a lesson and start promoting other games .
n ramanathan , ghana big business must also take some of the blame for this mass hysteria .
huge amounts of money are spent by consumer giants to plug their products and whip up chauvinism by tag-lines like " one in a billion , hoo-hah india " and such disgustingly banality .
show some corporate responsibility for heaven 's sake ! !
jay amrith , singapore it is unfortunate that mukul kesavan has misunderstood the fact that the process of betting is a phenomenon which is as old as the world 's oldest profession .
the failure of the indian and pakistani teams in this world cup does not mean that betting and corruption is removed completely and hence make it less toxic !
such corrupt practices would exist in any other country too but the intensity of finger pointing and blame game would not be the same as the writers and journalist of many countries are responsible and would love to nurture the game and not kill the enthusiastic supporters .
i would continue to watch cricket , support india and pakistan no matter .
praveen ashokan , uae it 's time we faced the grim realities and realised that india is not the giant killer it is made out to be .
a narayanan , india as an ex londoner who had the good fortune of watching cricket at the oval and lords in the forties and fifties it is sad to see that the moral principles of the game have been lost .
i was taught to walk and understood the honorable concept of fair play .
hopefully the concept expressed in the article that test cricket is not subject to the same corruption is valid as to me at least , it is the ultimate expression of the totally demanding sport .
it requires skill , stamina , intellect and integrity .
if indeed bob woolmers death is in any way associated with the game it is a cancer that needs to be removed .
another instance that sport has become entertainment and big business .
the character building aspects of sport have been lost again .
cricket is becoming another tv and gambling mecca .
goodbye grace , bradman and hammond .
john , usa in a way its blessing in disguise - in today 's resurgent india , we need more productivity , rather than be glued to tv .
we need to move on , and rather become more physically fit , than become obese , by watching cricket .
we should not pass on cricket fever to our young generation .
hanif mohammed , dubai , uae it is time we disregarded the players in both good and bad times .
there are many other people who contribute much more to the nation and are not even paid one tenth of what our mediocre cricketeers are paid .
subhash kaul , india i watched many matches featuring india and pakistan in the 2003 world cup - also one with sri lanka , but no bangladesh to my regret .
the sri lankans were , i thought , really in touch with the spirit of the game - doing their stellar best , enjoying everything , applauding their opponents ' good moments .
wonderful !
then came india .
very passionate spectators , mostly good-humoured and well informed , happy to chat and nice to meet ; but nobody seemed to find it strange when people wandered around holding placards proclaiming the unfortunate sachin tendulkar as a god .
how do they expect him to perform , or even eat his breakfast , with those expectations on his shoulders ?
as a proud but baffled south african , i 'd love to see sri lanka do really well - perhaps lose to us in the final ?
deborah hubbard , south africa as someone who grew up in the 50 's and 60 's following cricket , mainly test cricket , i can not agree more with mukul kesavan .
it is a shame to see the behaviour of so called fans in india .
the players , spoiled by pampering and unlimited advertising incomes , are spoilt .
a drubbing like the one they received was needed - for the players , the fans and the indian cricket control board all of whom seem to have forgotten that cricket is a game not a war that threatens to exterminate the nation .
ajay malik , switzerland i am very happy that indian fans got what they deserve to follow a game without sensibility .
saurabh kaushik , india i have seen this indian team crumble so many times .
everybody says that indian viewers drive this game .
so i have decided not to watch any one day matches involving india .
it is better to see a match between australia vs. south africa where there is no heart break and emotion involved .
jatender koul , india test cricket is not another sport .
its a different form of the same sport .
in my view pakistan and india need new sports .
it ca n't just be cricket 365 days of the year .
in america we have so much to choose from .
there are leagues of professional and college football , basketball , baseball and even soccer .
south asia has a fifth of the world 's population so why ca n't they come up with other sports ?
fawad arain , usa india could not have chosen a better world cup to be beaten out of .
beating pakistan is the real thrill - that shiny trophy is only a secondary consideration .
the english , with their relative attitudes to the ashes and the world cup , will empathise .
manosij majumdar , canada it is time india and pakistan put their cricketing house in order - fair administration and selection and an end to political horse trading .
more importantly , they need to understand the ethics of sport itself .
better to congratulate the winners and commiserate with the losers rather than resort brainlessly to death threats !
phil , hong kong great article .
the chauvinism in india has not only percolated into cricket , but into many other areas and it is high time , india realises and sets its priorities right and concentrates on the real problems of the country .
the corruption is so loathsome in this country and no wonder it has spoiled the game of cricket .
vijay , india the sad fact is players are now over paid , over-pampered and seem to have forgotten that the game and specatators matter more than them .
in 1974 as a 14 year old i saw pakistan play england for the first time at lords .
it was a gripping match which ended in a draw but had some memorable bowling by derek underwood .
on the saturday i was there , it started raining at 2:30 and did not stop .
we waited for the players to come out for autographs , and they finally went to their coach at 6:30 pm .
intikhab alam , the captain , saw me and a few other young boys drenched waiting for the team .
he stopped the coach , asked me on board and got every member of the team to give me an autograph .
he then told me to be a good boy and go straight home !
cut to 2006 and the saturday of the lords test .
memorable innings from yousuf .
this time i took my 10 year old lad with me .
he wanted autographs so he and about 10 other boys -lrb- mostly english -rrb- waited .
at 7:00 pm we were told the pakistan team had left via a separate entrance and in any case were not giving autographs .
perhaps the players need to learn some dignity and respect for young fans , who are the future of the sport .
ejaz , uk i think media is largely responsible for boosting indian players ' egos .
a good score against a weak team and they are treated like superstars and their whole family comes into limelight .
its the media who makes the players god piyush suri , united kingdom stop cricket for a while and please divert funds to other games .
dr b dilip kumar , iraq and dont really understand the crib of the influence of south asian nations on cricket .
if the money comes from india , it will and has to be the power center .
if they cant manage , then the game is gone .
dhananjaya , london god save indian cricket .
eswar ramachandran , chennai , tamil nadu , india i was a cricket fan once to the extend that i had a scrapbook that contained score sheets of all test matches .
this was around 1995-87 , when i was 13-15 years old .
but after watching the soccer world cup in 1998 , my interest in cricket reduced to such a level that i watched cricket only when tendulkar was batting .
after the 2002 soccer world cup , it reduced even further .
my only regret in life is that i wasted too much time watching cricket .
now i do n't even understand how can people prefer cricket to games like soccer or for that matter even kabbadi .
as far as i could see this cricket addiction is more dangerous than drug addiction .
it is tough to get out and you waste too much time .
sujith babu , india legalise betting and give more importance to games like football and tennis .
dinesh , ahmedabad , india europe and south america have the same attitude to football and americans to their football .
so we are entitled to our sins .
yes the game should be purified and the bookies abolished .
but do not throw the baby with the bath water .
sanjaya das , india i guess this is the best thing which has happened to indian cricket .
a few things which need to change - 1. the zonal selection process .
2.amount of money that is associated with cricket.that has to come down drastically if the pressure on players to perform has to come down .
3.the hype by the media of being the best batting line up etc which is utter trash .
-lrb- its almost nine years since sachin has scored a match winning knock in a crucial tie -lrb- except for the not to so important word cup 2003 match against pakistan -rrb- .for almost three to four years now he does n't deserve to be called the world 's greatest batsman .
4.stop critisizing greg chappell -lrb- or any foreign coach -rrb- .at least they bring in some sort of professionalism which we indians lack .

the purple milkweed butterfly , which winters in the south of the island , passes over some 600m of motorway to reach its breeding ground in the north .
many of the 11,500 butterflies that attempt the journey each hour do not reach safety , experts say .

the protective nets are designed to force the butterflies to fly higher , reducing the chances of them getting caught in the traffic .
