russia , which is also part of the middle east quartet , maintains contact with the organization . " it is part of the policy of the quartet , " solana said .
" you know very well what hamas has to do in order to change that policy . " the quartet - made up of the eu , russia , the united nations and the united states - demands that hamas recognize israel , renounce violence and abide by past peace agreements . solana is currently touring the middle east to prepare a major international middle east peace conference later this year .
solana said it was crucial to restart the peace process and that the eu would help and cooperate as much as possible in preparing the event . " we do n't know exactly when the conference will take place , but it must be a success , " he said .
" we can not allow it to fail and we must therefore define success . " eu condemns rocket attacks on israel militants in gaza have launched at least nine gaza-made qassam rockets at southern israel since monday morning , one of which struck near a nursery school in sderot .
solana said he condemned the attack on the school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rocket attack in sderot caused no casualties according to solana , israel would continue to have support from the 27-nation eu in fighting hamas-led attacks . " sometimes we do not agree 100 percent on exactly how to combat it , but we offer our full solidarity with israel in its efforts to fight terrorism , " solana said . solana continued on to jordan from israel for a working dinner with jordanian foreign minister abdel ilah khatib on monday .
the two men agreed that the international conference on the middle east , proposed by us president george w. bush " should be preceded by good preparations , " an official statement said . on tuesday , solana holds similar talks in lebanon and egypt . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics say the structure has been turned into a neo-nazi shrine . the hotel " zum türken " in the southern german town of obersalzberg is being strongly criticized for allowing visitors to view part of a nazi-era bunker located beneath its restaurant . according to research by german public broadcaster ard , visitors can access the bunker via an advertised passageway at the hotel .
ard research showed that it had become a pilgrimage site for neo-nazis , who come to see the nazi propaganda , swastikas and anti-semitic statements scrawled and carved on its walls . obersalzberg near berchtesgaden , located in bavaria near the austrian border , became hitler 's holiday retreat in 1923 .
it was expanded after 1933 , becoming a second seat of government along with berlin under the nazi regime . the hotel " zum türken " and adjoining bunker were once the quarters for hitler 's personal security staff and bodyguards from the sicherheitsdienst des reichsführers -lrb- sd -rrb- .
visitors to the bunker can view sd detention cells and shooting ranges . state government should be on the lookout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the allies demolished the remains of hitler 's berghof residence in 1952 bavaria 's finance minister kurt faltlhauser said the government had a clear responsibility to take in light of the bunker 's growing popularity among neo-nazis . " we must take on the role of a sentinel , " faltlhauser said in a statement .
" this should n't be covered up and , most importantly , there ca n't be any hidden or open glorification of the nazi regime . " the ministry said it had recommended to the state prosecutor to file criminal charges .
it has also appealed to local authorities to check whether it can revoke the hotel 's restaurant and alcohol license . officials can not close the site , however , as it is privately owned by the hotel .
the hotel owner 's attorney jan de haan said there had been problems in the past with right-wing extremists . " the hotel owner is in no way pleased by this , " de haan said .
he said that 95 percent of the hotel 's guests were foreigners , many from the united states .
the owner was not acquiring neo-nazi customers , de haan added . neighboring documentation center 's hands are tied the bavarian state government , together with the institute of contemporary history in munich and berlin , set up a documentation center in obersalzberg in 1999 .
a permanent exhibition informs the public of the town 's past under hitler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the documentation center in obersalzberg said it is severely underfunded the center 's head volker dahm said the hotel 's bunker had been a nuisance for years . " but we ca n't actually do anything about it , " dahm told ard .
" the problem is that a relic of the third reich is privately owned and commercially marketed by the owner . " according to dahm , the documentation center has its own problems to deal with .
it was too small and bursting at the seams , he said .
there were also too few qualified personnel and parts of the exhibition were outdated . " it looks as if we will not be able to sustain the exhibition 's scientific and professional standards , as well as the quality of its presentation with these personnel , " dahm said . faltlhauser , however , said he was aware of bavaria 's obligation to the site . " i have been very consistent in my responsibility and will continue to be so , " faltlhauser said . the ministry said faltlhauser in may doubled state funding for the site to 320,000 euros -lrb- $ 434,000 -rrb- and promised further personnel . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german finance experts also fear possible takeovers from abroad . german bankers and politicians said they see the financial turmoil on domestic markets resulting from the subprime loan crisis in the united states as an opportunity to switch gears within the germany banking system . " the situation is serious , " finance minister peer steinbrück told a banking conference in frankfurt , in reference to problems that have hit german banks and financial institutions in recent weeks . according to a survey commissioned by the german business daily handelsblatt , 31 percent of the 791 german business managers polled are concerned about the reputation of german banks . two institutions , the sachsenlb regional bank and the ikb , which normally specialize in lending to small businesses , suffered heavy losses through defaults in the us high-risk home loan sector and had to rely on help from other german banks to stay afloat . turmoil should bring change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück said institutions needed to usher change into the banking landscape steinbrück , however , said the current difficulties should prompt change . " the landesbanken -lrb- regional state banks -rrb- must use the opportunity to combine their strengths , " he said , adding that " it is right that consolidation be on the agenda . " " just holding on to the status quo and sitting it out will not be to the advantage of any of the institutions involved , " steinbrück said . after thanking the institutions involved in securing funding for the ikb , steinbrück also praised the landesbank baden-württemberg 's -lrb- lbbw -rrb- takeover of sachsenlb .
such buyouts would help protect german financial institutions from foreign investors , the minister added . as the world 's leading exporter , however , germany did need to ensure it did not rely on just one or two banking heavyweights , steinbrück added . fewer , stronger institutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another regional state bank bought out sachsenlb consolidation was also the message that deutsche bank head josef ackermann brought to the annual bankers meeting in frankfurt on tuesday . ackermann called for germany financial institutions to gather under fewer but stronger roofs as the financial storm appeared to be passing . " there are many small banks , in a fragmented market , " ackermann said at the banking conference , adding that the smaller banks should " join forces , one way or another . " the next tie-up could bring together lbbw and westlb , which was weakened by a crisis separate from last month 's subprime lending turmoil , heinrich haasis , president of the german savings banks ' federation , the dsgv , told the afp news agency . risk ignored bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : subprime mortgages led to much of last month 's financial chaos steinbrück said he agreed with ackermann , who said banks ignored the risk involved in lending excessively to the subprime us housing sector , which threw international markets into turmoil last month . " i share the evaluation of mr. ackermann , " that such practices demonstrated a poor understanding of the risks involved , the finance minister said . ackermann , meanwhile , downplayed fears problems in the us housing market would set off a larger credit crunch in the coming months . " in the last few days , there have been signs that markets have begun to stabilize , " he said in a statement before the conference .

he will be remembered as the man who secured a pay increase of 4.1 percent this year and another 1.7 percent next year for manufacturing workers .
peters and ig metall had originally gone into talks demanding a 6.5 percent raise . new direction the appointment of huber , who started his career as a toolmaker but went on to study history and philosophy , signals a new direction for the union and one in which more negotiation and compromise in disputes can be expected .
it will be his first task to define a new strategy to unify the remaining 2.3 million members of the union , which is still the most powerful in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall has over two million members since germany 's reunification , ig metall has had to fight growing dissatisfaction among salaried workers for labor groups in general , losing one million members in the past 12 years .
the damaging split between the two camps has contributed to the losses during jürgen peters ' reign . to the modernizers in the union , the new leadership signals an end to positions that were often seen as extreme , and based more on ideology than on the best interests of ig metall and its members .
the union 's past fierce and sometimes knee-jerk opposition to welfare reform , a retirement age increase , health care reform , temporary employment or a minimum wage caused it to lose credibility in the eyes of many . huber 's right-hand man will be detlef wetzel , 54 , the president of ig metall 's division in the western state of north-rhine westphalia , which is germany 's metalworking heartland . wetzel earned his stripes this spring by negotiating the biggest wage increases in a decade for metal , automobile and electronic equipment workers .

yet they should be realistic and cautiously optimistic about the process . the european union has reiterated its position of avoiding direct dealings with the radical islamist group hamas , which violently took control of the gaza strip in mid-june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni -lrb- left -rrb- and solana see eye-to-eye on middle east issues " i would like to repeat the eu position : there will not be any contacts between the eu and hamas , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana at a press conference on monday after meeting with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni . the european union , israel and the united states consider hamas a terrorist group .
russia , which is also part of the middle east quartet , maintains contact with the organization . " it is part of the policy of the quartet , " solana said .
" you know very well what hamas has to do in order to change that policy . " the quartet - made up of the eu , russia , the united nations and the united states - demands that hamas recognize israel , renounce violence and abide by past peace agreements . solana is currently touring the middle east to prepare a major international middle east peace conference later this year .
solana said it was crucial to restart the peace process and that the eu would help and cooperate as much as possible in preparing the event . " we do n't know exactly when the conference will take place , but it must be a success , " he said .
" we can not allow it to fail and we must therefore define success . " eu condemns rocket attacks on israel militants in gaza have launched at least nine gaza-made qassam rockets at southern israel since monday morning , one of which struck near a nursery school in sderot .
solana said he condemned the attack on the school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rocket attack in sderot caused no casualties according to solana , israel would continue to have support from the 27-nation eu in fighting hamas-led attacks . " sometimes we do not agree 100 percent on exactly how to combat it , but we offer our full solidarity with israel in its efforts to fight terrorism , " solana said . solana continued on to jordan from israel for a working dinner with jordanian foreign minister abdel ilah khatib on monday .
the two men agreed that the international conference on the middle east , proposed by us president george w. bush " should be preceded by good preparations , " an official statement said . on tuesday , solana holds similar talks in lebanon and egypt . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics say the structure has been turned into a neo-nazi shrine . the hotel " zum türken " in the southern german town of obersalzberg is being strongly criticized for allowing visitors to view part of a nazi-era bunker located beneath its restaurant . according to research by german public broadcaster ard , visitors can access the bunker via an advertised passageway at the hotel .
ard research showed that it had become a pilgrimage site for neo-nazis , who come to see the nazi propaganda , swastikas and anti-semitic statements scrawled and carved on its walls . obersalzberg near berchtesgaden , located in bavaria near the austrian border , became hitler 's holiday retreat in 1923 .
it was expanded after 1933 , becoming a second seat of government along with berlin under the nazi regime . the hotel " zum türken " and adjoining bunker were once the quarters for hitler 's personal security staff and bodyguards from the sicherheitsdienst des reichsführers -lrb- sd -rrb- .
visitors to the bunker can view sd detention cells and shooting ranges . state government should be on the lookout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the allies demolished the remains of hitler 's berghof residence in 1952 bavaria 's finance minister kurt faltlhauser said the government had a clear responsibility to take in light of the bunker 's growing popularity among neo-nazis . " we must take on the role of a sentinel , " faltlhauser said in a statement .
" this should n't be covered up and , most importantly , there ca n't be any hidden or open glorification of the nazi regime . " the ministry said it had recommended to the state prosecutor to file criminal charges .
it has also appealed to local authorities to check whether it can revoke the hotel 's restaurant and alcohol license . officials can not close the site , however , as it is privately owned by the hotel .
the hotel owner 's attorney jan de haan said there had been problems in the past with right-wing extremists . " the hotel owner is in no way pleased by this , " de haan said .
he said that 95 percent of the hotel 's guests were foreigners , many from the united states .
the owner was not acquiring neo-nazi customers , de haan added . neighboring documentation center 's hands are tied the bavarian state government , together with the institute of contemporary history in munich and berlin , set up a documentation center in obersalzberg in 1999 .
a permanent exhibition informs the public of the town 's past under hitler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the documentation center in obersalzberg said it is severely underfunded the center 's head volker dahm said the hotel 's bunker had been a nuisance for years . " but we ca n't actually do anything about it , " dahm told ard .
" the problem is that a relic of the third reich is privately owned and commercially marketed by the owner . " according to dahm , the documentation center has its own problems to deal with .
it was too small and bursting at the seams , he said .
there were also too few qualified personnel and parts of the exhibition were outdated . " it looks as if we will not be able to sustain the exhibition 's scientific and professional standards , as well as the quality of its presentation with these personnel , " dahm said . faltlhauser , however , said he was aware of bavaria 's obligation to the site . " i have been very consistent in my responsibility and will continue to be so , " faltlhauser said . the ministry said faltlhauser in may doubled state funding for the site to 320,000 euros -lrb- $ 434,000 -rrb- and promised further personnel . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the complex would hold not just the bodies of a select few , but of millions of people . granted , germany is a relatively small , densely populated country .
so finding a place to bury the deceased can be a tricky business .
cemeteries often resort to excavating people 's remains after 20 or more years to make room for a new casket and headstone . as a potential way out of the dilemma , several germans have come up with a creative solution : emulating the ancient egyptians - en masse . german entrepreneurs have secured around 90,000 euros -lrb- $ 122,000 -rrb- in funding to study the feasibility of building an up to 488-meter tall -lrb- 1,600 feet -rrb- " great pyramid " near the eastern german town of dessau , in the state of saxony-anhalt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike egypt , dessau could become home to just one huge pyramid jens thiel , one of the project initiators , said a burial space within the pyramid could be affordable for most people .
current estimates showed that a tomb could cost up to 700 euros . those interested can already reserve their burial space online at thegreatpyramid.org. pyramid is " open to everyone " " outlasting personal physical existence is something that the egyptian pyramids could promise only a few , but this pyramid is open to every individual , " the web site said . " no one should be denied a place just because they ca n't afford it , " thiel said . thiel , along with the other project initiators ingo niermann and heiko holzberger , have founded an association called " friends of the great pyramid " to create this " tomb for all people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's highly unlikely any world-renown architects have worked on pumpkin pyramids according to germany 's daily süddeutsche zeitung , it is likely that the pyramid , should it ever be built , would initially be 150 meters high and increase in size as millions of burial tombs would be added concrete block by concrete block over several decades . the project initiators proclaim it could become the " largest building in history , " generating up to 19.6 million euros in sales of burial spaces . star architect rem koolhaas allegedly on board so outlandish is the proposal that is has caught the attention of famous architects , such as dutchman rem koolhaas .
the project initiators said koolhaas agreed to be on the jury for an architecture competition for the pyramid 's creation . there is a difference between the ancient egyptians ' architectural masterpiece at giza and the proposed german version near dessau : the hordes of tourists who are expected to come flocking to pay respects to loved ones , and the money they would likely bring with them . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics say the structure has been turned into a neo-nazi shrine . the hotel " zum türken " in the southern german town of obersalzberg is being strongly criticized for allowing visitors to view part of a nazi-era bunker located beneath its restaurant . according to research by german public broadcaster ard , visitors can access the bunker via an advertised passageway at the hotel .
ard research showed that it had become a pilgrimage site for neo-nazis , who come to see the nazi propaganda , swastikas and anti-semitic statements scrawled and carved on its walls . obersalzberg near berchtesgaden , located in bavaria near the austrian border , became hitler 's holiday retreat in 1923 .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de international relations -pipe- 04.09.2007 germany is isolating poland , says polish official großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the connection between germany and poland appears to be getting shakier germany lacks a " vision for the future of europe , " according to a top polish foreign policy official .
he also accused his country 's western neighbor of not taking poland 's interests seriously . " berlin is n't concerned with poland 's vital interests , " according to poland 's foreign policy aid responsible for relations with germany , mariusz muszynski . muszynski named energy and security policies as particular bones of contention in a guest commentary for monday 's edition of the german business daily handelsblatt . poland 's proposal for a common european army was met with " coldness and distance , " muszynski wrote .
when poland had advocated a common energy policy , germany responded by clenching a deal with russia to build the baltic sea gas pipeline , which would circumvent poland , he added . " warsaw and not moscow is germany 's partner in nato and the eu , " muszynski said . germany wants to stay out of polish elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is not focused on european integration , said muszynski a german foreign ministry spokeswoman expressed " incomprehension " at muszynski 's remarks .
she said that his comments may be linked to domestic political considerations . " we do not want to contribute to the election campaign in poland , " the spokeswoman said , referring to the early parliamentary elections expected to take place next month . facing the possible collapse of their right-wing coalition , the kaczynski twins - lech kaczynski holds the presidency , while jaroslav is prime minister - have indicated that they may call early elections . germany 's " official position will have to be very cautious in the weeks ahead , because every comment could be used as ammunition in the election campaign , " kai-olaf lang from the german institute for international and security affairs said in an interview with german news agency dpa . although the perception of ordinary poles of germany is quite positive , " there will be no harmony " between the two countries , said lang , as historical differences run too deep . historical wounds remain unhealed the nazi invasion of poland in 1939 and much publicized claims from germans expelled from what is now poland following world war ii have been ongoing divisive issues . muszynski made several historical references in his commentary indicating that the past had a strong influence on the present bilateral relationship .
he went so far as to suggest that poland preferred germany under otto von bismarck , a 19th century statesman known for his poor treatment of the poles . german chancellor angela merkel and her predecessor gerhard schröder had strayed away from the positive " moderation " of helmut kohl , who was germany 's chancellor from 1982 to 1998 , muszynski said . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german finance experts also fear possible takeovers from abroad . german bankers and politicians said they see the financial turmoil on domestic markets resulting from the subprime loan crisis in the united states as an opportunity to switch gears within the germany banking system . " the situation is serious , " finance minister peer steinbrück told a banking conference in frankfurt , in reference to problems that have hit german banks and financial institutions in recent weeks . according to a survey commissioned by the german business daily handelsblatt , 31 percent of the 791 german business managers polled are concerned about the reputation of german banks . two institutions , the sachsenlb regional bank and the ikb , which normally specialize in lending to small businesses , suffered heavy losses through defaults in the us high-risk home loan sector and had to rely on help from other german banks to stay afloat . turmoil should bring change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück said institutions needed to usher change into the banking landscape steinbrück , however , said the current difficulties should prompt change . " the landesbanken -lrb- regional state banks -rrb- must use the opportunity to combine their strengths , " he said , adding that " it is right that consolidation be on the agenda . " " just holding on to the status quo and sitting it out will not be to the advantage of any of the institutions involved , " steinbrück said . after thanking the institutions involved in securing funding for the ikb , steinbrück also praised the landesbank baden-württemberg 's -lrb- lbbw -rrb- takeover of sachsenlb .
such buyouts would help protect german financial institutions from foreign investors , the minister added . as the world 's leading exporter , however , germany did need to ensure it did not rely on just one or two banking heavyweights , steinbrück added . fewer , stronger institutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another regional state bank bought out sachsenlb consolidation was also the message that deutsche bank head josef ackermann brought to the annual bankers meeting in frankfurt on tuesday . ackermann called for germany financial institutions to gather under fewer but stronger roofs as the financial storm appeared to be passing . " there are many small banks , in a fragmented market , " ackermann said at the banking conference , adding that the smaller banks should " join forces , one way or another . " the next tie-up could bring together lbbw and westlb , which was weakened by a crisis separate from last month 's subprime lending turmoil , heinrich haasis , president of the german savings banks ' federation , the dsgv , told the afp news agency . risk ignored bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : subprime mortgages led to much of last month 's financial chaos steinbrück said he agreed with ackermann , who said banks ignored the risk involved in lending excessively to the subprime us housing sector , which threw international markets into turmoil last month . " i share the evaluation of mr. ackermann , " that such practices demonstrated a poor understanding of the risks involved , the finance minister said . ackermann , meanwhile , downplayed fears problems in the us housing market would set off a larger credit crunch in the coming months . " in the last few days , there have been signs that markets have begun to stabilize , " he said in a statement before the conference .

but the complex would hold not just the bodies of a select few , but of millions of people . granted , germany is a relatively small , densely populated country .
so finding a place to bury the deceased can be a tricky business .

he also accused his country 's western neighbor of not taking poland 's interests seriously . " berlin is n't concerned with poland 's vital interests , " according to poland 's foreign policy aid responsible for relations with germany , mariusz muszynski . muszynski named energy and security policies as particular bones of contention in a guest commentary for monday 's edition of the german business daily handelsblatt . poland 's proposal for a common european army was met with " coldness and distance , " muszynski wrote .
when poland had advocated a common energy policy , germany responded by clenching a deal with russia to build the baltic sea gas pipeline , which would circumvent poland , he added . " warsaw and not moscow is germany 's partner in nato and the eu , " muszynski said . germany wants to stay out of polish elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is not focused on european integration , said muszynski a german foreign ministry spokeswoman expressed " incomprehension " at muszynski 's remarks .
she said that his comments may be linked to domestic political considerations . " we do not want to contribute to the election campaign in poland , " the spokeswoman said , referring to the early parliamentary elections expected to take place next month . facing the possible collapse of their right-wing coalition , the kaczynski twins - lech kaczynski holds the presidency , while jaroslav is prime minister - have indicated that they may call early elections . germany 's " official position will have to be very cautious in the weeks ahead , because every comment could be used as ammunition in the election campaign , " kai-olaf lang from the german institute for international and security affairs said in an interview with german news agency dpa . although the perception of ordinary poles of germany is quite positive , " there will be no harmony " between the two countries , said lang , as historical differences run too deep . historical wounds remain unhealed the nazi invasion of poland in 1939 and much publicized claims from germans expelled from what is now poland following world war ii have been ongoing divisive issues . muszynski made several historical references in his commentary indicating that the past had a strong influence on the present bilateral relationship .
he went so far as to suggest that poland preferred germany under otto von bismarck , a 19th century statesman known for his poor treatment of the poles . german chancellor angela merkel and her predecessor gerhard schröder had strayed away from the positive " moderation " of helmut kohl , who was germany 's chancellor from 1982 to 1998 , muszynski said . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he will be remembered as the man who secured a pay increase of 4.1 percent this year and another 1.7 percent next year for manufacturing workers .
peters and ig metall had originally gone into talks demanding a 6.5 percent raise . new direction the appointment of huber , who started his career as a toolmaker but went on to study history and philosophy , signals a new direction for the union and one in which more negotiation and compromise in disputes can be expected .
it will be his first task to define a new strategy to unify the remaining 2.3 million members of the union , which is still the most powerful in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall has over two million members since germany 's reunification , ig metall has had to fight growing dissatisfaction among salaried workers for labor groups in general , losing one million members in the past 12 years .
the damaging split between the two camps has contributed to the losses during jürgen peters ' reign . to the modernizers in the union , the new leadership signals an end to positions that were often seen as extreme , and based more on ideology than on the best interests of ig metall and its members .
the union 's past fierce and sometimes knee-jerk opposition to welfare reform , a retirement age increase , health care reform , temporary employment or a minimum wage caused it to lose credibility in the eyes of many . huber 's right-hand man will be detlef wetzel , 54 , the president of ig metall 's division in the western state of north-rhine westphalia , which is germany 's metalworking heartland . wetzel earned his stripes this spring by negotiating the biggest wage increases in a decade for metal , automobile and electronic equipment workers .
he is also considered a reformer . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also accused his country 's western neighbor of not taking poland 's interests seriously . " berlin is n't concerned with poland 's vital interests , " according to poland 's foreign policy aid responsible for relations with germany , mariusz muszynski . muszynski named energy and security policies as particular bones of contention in a guest commentary for monday 's edition of the german business daily handelsblatt . poland 's proposal for a common european army was met with " coldness and distance , " muszynski wrote .
when poland had advocated a common energy policy , germany responded by clenching a deal with russia to build the baltic sea gas pipeline , which would circumvent poland , he added . " warsaw and not moscow is germany 's partner in nato and the eu , " muszynski said . germany wants to stay out of polish elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is not focused on european integration , said muszynski a german foreign ministry spokeswoman expressed " incomprehension " at muszynski 's remarks .
she said that his comments may be linked to domestic political considerations . " we do not want to contribute to the election campaign in poland , " the spokeswoman said , referring to the early parliamentary elections expected to take place next month . facing the possible collapse of their right-wing coalition , the kaczynski twins - lech kaczynski holds the presidency , while jaroslav is prime minister - have indicated that they may call early elections . germany 's " official position will have to be very cautious in the weeks ahead , because every comment could be used as ammunition in the election campaign , " kai-olaf lang from the german institute for international and security affairs said in an interview with german news agency dpa . although the perception of ordinary poles of germany is quite positive , " there will be no harmony " between the two countries , said lang , as historical differences run too deep . historical wounds remain unhealed the nazi invasion of poland in 1939 and much publicized claims from germans expelled from what is now poland following world war ii have been ongoing divisive issues . muszynski made several historical references in his commentary indicating that the past had a strong influence on the present bilateral relationship .
he went so far as to suggest that poland preferred germany under otto von bismarck , a 19th century statesman known for his poor treatment of the poles . german chancellor angela merkel and her predecessor gerhard schröder had strayed away from the positive " moderation " of helmut kohl , who was germany 's chancellor from 1982 to 1998 , muszynski said . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

" the accused are guilty of multiple cases of manslaughter , " said presiding judge rainer hohler at the bülach district court near zurich . three of those found guilty were managers of the air traffic control company skyguide , and were handed one-year suspended jail sentences for negligent manslaughter . the fourth person , who was in charge of maintenance work on traffic control equipment at the time of the crash , was fined 13,500 swiss francs -lrb- 8,200 euros ; $ 11,200 -rrb- and sentenced to 90 days in jail .
all four will have to pay court cost of 25,000 francs . insufficient protection in place bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : only one air traffic controller was on duty when the 2002 collision occurred the judge said the skyguide managers had failed to exercise sufficient care by leaving just one air traffic controller in charge of the southern german and eastern swiss airspace at the time . a second air traffic controller was taking an authorized break when the collision occurred . " staffing the entire acc -lrb- zurich air control -rrb- at night with only one controller goes completely against air traffic security principles , " the judge said , according to a reuters news report . due to repair work , some plane radar systems were also out of action at the time of the collision . four other skyguide employees who were on trial for contributing to circumstances that led to the crash were acquitted . children on vacation died in crash bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : alain rossier , skyguide 's ceo at the time , apologized to russia in 2004 the july 1 , 2002 accident involved a russian passenger jet and a dhl-operated cargo plane , which collided in swiss-controlled airspace over the town of überlingen in southern germany . most of the russians on board the passenger plane were schoolchildren on their way to a holiday in spain . the lone air traffic controller on duty at the time of the 2002 disaster was stabbed to death in 2004 by a russian man who lost his wife and children in the crash . the swiss district prosecutor had called for jail sentences of six to 15 months for the managers and surviving air traffic controller . the head of skyguide asked for forgiveness and the swiss president offered an official state apology to russia . " we , for our part , are convinced that this tragedy is attributable primarily to systemic causes in the interplay between people , technology and procedures , " interim skyguide chief executive francis schubert said in a statement .

he also accused his country 's western neighbor of not taking poland 's interests seriously . " berlin is n't concerned with poland 's vital interests , " according to poland 's foreign policy aid responsible for relations with germany , mariusz muszynski . muszynski named energy and security policies as particular bones of contention in a guest commentary for monday 's edition of the german business daily handelsblatt . poland 's proposal for a common european army was met with " coldness and distance , " muszynski wrote .
when poland had advocated a common energy policy , germany responded by clenching a deal with russia to build the baltic sea gas pipeline , which would circumvent poland , he added . " warsaw and not moscow is germany 's partner in nato and the eu , " muszynski said . germany wants to stay out of polish elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is not focused on european integration , said muszynski a german foreign ministry spokeswoman expressed " incomprehension " at muszynski 's remarks .
she said that his comments may be linked to domestic political considerations . " we do not want to contribute to the election campaign in poland , " the spokeswoman said , referring to the early parliamentary elections expected to take place next month . facing the possible collapse of their right-wing coalition , the kaczynski twins - lech kaczynski holds the presidency , while jaroslav is prime minister - have indicated that they may call early elections . germany 's " official position will have to be very cautious in the weeks ahead , because every comment could be used as ammunition in the election campaign , " kai-olaf lang from the german institute for international and security affairs said in an interview with german news agency dpa . although the perception of ordinary poles of germany is quite positive , " there will be no harmony " between the two countries , said lang , as historical differences run too deep . historical wounds remain unhealed the nazi invasion of poland in 1939 and much publicized claims from germans expelled from what is now poland following world war ii have been ongoing divisive issues . muszynski made several historical references in his commentary indicating that the past had a strong influence on the present bilateral relationship .
he went so far as to suggest that poland preferred germany under otto von bismarck , a 19th century statesman known for his poor treatment of the poles . german chancellor angela merkel and her predecessor gerhard schröder had strayed away from the positive " moderation " of helmut kohl , who was germany 's chancellor from 1982 to 1998 , muszynski said . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german finance experts also fear possible takeovers from abroad . german bankers and politicians said they see the financial turmoil on domestic markets resulting from the subprime loan crisis in the united states as an opportunity to switch gears within the germany banking system . " the situation is serious , " finance minister peer steinbrück told a banking conference in frankfurt , in reference to problems that have hit german banks and financial institutions in recent weeks . according to a survey commissioned by the german business daily handelsblatt , 31 percent of the 791 german business managers polled are concerned about the reputation of german banks . two institutions , the sachsenlb regional bank and the ikb , which normally specialize in lending to small businesses , suffered heavy losses through defaults in the us high-risk home loan sector and had to rely on help from other german banks to stay afloat . turmoil should bring change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück said institutions needed to usher change into the banking landscape steinbrück , however , said the current difficulties should prompt change . " the landesbanken -lrb- regional state banks -rrb- must use the opportunity to combine their strengths , " he said , adding that " it is right that consolidation be on the agenda . " " just holding on to the status quo and sitting it out will not be to the advantage of any of the institutions involved , " steinbrück said . after thanking the institutions involved in securing funding for the ikb , steinbrück also praised the landesbank baden-württemberg 's -lrb- lbbw -rrb- takeover of sachsenlb .
such buyouts would help protect german financial institutions from foreign investors , the minister added . as the world 's leading exporter , however , germany did need to ensure it did not rely on just one or two banking heavyweights , steinbrück added . fewer , stronger institutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another regional state bank bought out sachsenlb consolidation was also the message that deutsche bank head josef ackermann brought to the annual bankers meeting in frankfurt on tuesday . ackermann called for germany financial institutions to gather under fewer but stronger roofs as the financial storm appeared to be passing . " there are many small banks , in a fragmented market , " ackermann said at the banking conference , adding that the smaller banks should " join forces , one way or another . " the next tie-up could bring together lbbw and westlb , which was weakened by a crisis separate from last month 's subprime lending turmoil , heinrich haasis , president of the german savings banks ' federation , the dsgv , told the afp news agency . risk ignored bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : subprime mortgages led to much of last month 's financial chaos steinbrück said he agreed with ackermann , who said banks ignored the risk involved in lending excessively to the subprime us housing sector , which threw international markets into turmoil last month . " i share the evaluation of mr. ackermann , " that such practices demonstrated a poor understanding of the risks involved , the finance minister said . ackermann , meanwhile , downplayed fears problems in the us housing market would set off a larger credit crunch in the coming months . " in the last few days , there have been signs that markets have begun to stabilize , " he said in a statement before the conference .

ard research showed that it had become a pilgrimage site for neo-nazis , who come to see the nazi propaganda , swastikas and anti-semitic statements scrawled and carved on its walls . obersalzberg near berchtesgaden , located in bavaria near the austrian border , became hitler 's holiday retreat in 1923 .

critics say the structure has been turned into a neo-nazi shrine . the hotel " zum türken " in the southern german town of obersalzberg is being strongly criticized for allowing visitors to view part of a nazi-era bunker located beneath its restaurant . according to research by german public broadcaster ard , visitors can access the bunker via an advertised passageway at the hotel .
ard research showed that it had become a pilgrimage site for neo-nazis , who come to see the nazi propaganda , swastikas and anti-semitic statements scrawled and carved on its walls . obersalzberg near berchtesgaden , located in bavaria near the austrian border , became hitler 's holiday retreat in 1923 .
it was expanded after 1933 , becoming a second seat of government along with berlin under the nazi regime . the hotel " zum türken " and adjoining bunker were once the quarters for hitler 's personal security staff and bodyguards from the sicherheitsdienst des reichsführers -lrb- sd -rrb- .
visitors to the bunker can view sd detention cells and shooting ranges . state government should be on the lookout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the allies demolished the remains of hitler 's berghof residence in 1952 bavaria 's finance minister kurt faltlhauser said the government had a clear responsibility to take in light of the bunker 's growing popularity among neo-nazis . " we must take on the role of a sentinel , " faltlhauser said in a statement .
" this should n't be covered up and , most importantly , there ca n't be any hidden or open glorification of the nazi regime . " the ministry said it had recommended to the state prosecutor to file criminal charges .
it has also appealed to local authorities to check whether it can revoke the hotel 's restaurant and alcohol license . officials can not close the site , however , as it is privately owned by the hotel .
the hotel owner 's attorney jan de haan said there had been problems in the past with right-wing extremists . " the hotel owner is in no way pleased by this , " de haan said .
he said that 95 percent of the hotel 's guests were foreigners , many from the united states .
the owner was not acquiring neo-nazi customers , de haan added . neighboring documentation center 's hands are tied the bavarian state government , together with the institute of contemporary history in munich and berlin , set up a documentation center in obersalzberg in 1999 .
a permanent exhibition informs the public of the town 's past under hitler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the documentation center in obersalzberg said it is severely underfunded the center 's head volker dahm said the hotel 's bunker had been a nuisance for years . " but we ca n't actually do anything about it , " dahm told ard .
" the problem is that a relic of the third reich is privately owned and commercially marketed by the owner . " according to dahm , the documentation center has its own problems to deal with .
it was too small and bursting at the seams , he said .
there were also too few qualified personnel and parts of the exhibition were outdated . " it looks as if we will not be able to sustain the exhibition 's scientific and professional standards , as well as the quality of its presentation with these personnel , " dahm said . faltlhauser , however , said he was aware of bavaria 's obligation to the site . " i have been very consistent in my responsibility and will continue to be so , " faltlhauser said . the ministry said faltlhauser in may doubled state funding for the site to 320,000 euros -lrb- $ 434,000 -rrb- and promised further personnel . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia , which is also part of the middle east quartet , maintains contact with the organization . " it is part of the policy of the quartet , " solana said .
" you know very well what hamas has to do in order to change that policy . " the quartet - made up of the eu , russia , the united nations and the united states - demands that hamas recognize israel , renounce violence and abide by past peace agreements . solana is currently touring the middle east to prepare a major international middle east peace conference later this year .
solana said it was crucial to restart the peace process and that the eu would help and cooperate as much as possible in preparing the event . " we do n't know exactly when the conference will take place , but it must be a success , " he said .
" we can not allow it to fail and we must therefore define success . " eu condemns rocket attacks on israel militants in gaza have launched at least nine gaza-made qassam rockets at southern israel since monday morning , one of which struck near a nursery school in sderot .
solana said he condemned the attack on the school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rocket attack in sderot caused no casualties according to solana , israel would continue to have support from the 27-nation eu in fighting hamas-led attacks . " sometimes we do not agree 100 percent on exactly how to combat it , but we offer our full solidarity with israel in its efforts to fight terrorism , " solana said . solana continued on to jordan from israel for a working dinner with jordanian foreign minister abdel ilah khatib on monday .
the two men agreed that the international conference on the middle east , proposed by us president george w. bush " should be preceded by good preparations , " an official statement said . on tuesday , solana holds similar talks in lebanon and egypt . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he will be remembered as the man who secured a pay increase of 4.1 percent this year and another 1.7 percent next year for manufacturing workers .
peters and ig metall had originally gone into talks demanding a 6.5 percent raise . new direction the appointment of huber , who started his career as a toolmaker but went on to study history and philosophy , signals a new direction for the union and one in which more negotiation and compromise in disputes can be expected .
it will be his first task to define a new strategy to unify the remaining 2.3 million members of the union , which is still the most powerful in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall has over two million members since germany 's reunification , ig metall has had to fight growing dissatisfaction among salaried workers for labor groups in general , losing one million members in the past 12 years .
the damaging split between the two camps has contributed to the losses during jürgen peters ' reign . to the modernizers in the union , the new leadership signals an end to positions that were often seen as extreme , and based more on ideology than on the best interests of ig metall and its members .
the union 's past fierce and sometimes knee-jerk opposition to welfare reform , a retirement age increase , health care reform , temporary employment or a minimum wage caused it to lose credibility in the eyes of many . huber 's right-hand man will be detlef wetzel , 54 , the president of ig metall 's division in the western state of north-rhine westphalia , which is germany 's metalworking heartland . wetzel earned his stripes this spring by negotiating the biggest wage increases in a decade for metal , automobile and electronic equipment workers .

he will be remembered as the man who secured a pay increase of 4.1 percent this year and another 1.7 percent next year for manufacturing workers .
peters and ig metall had originally gone into talks demanding a 6.5 percent raise . new direction the appointment of huber , who started his career as a toolmaker but went on to study history and philosophy , signals a new direction for the union and one in which more negotiation and compromise in disputes can be expected .
it will be his first task to define a new strategy to unify the remaining 2.3 million members of the union , which is still the most powerful in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall has over two million members since germany 's reunification , ig metall has had to fight growing dissatisfaction among salaried workers for labor groups in general , losing one million members in the past 12 years .
the damaging split between the two camps has contributed to the losses during jürgen peters ' reign . to the modernizers in the union , the new leadership signals an end to positions that were often seen as extreme , and based more on ideology than on the best interests of ig metall and its members .
the union 's past fierce and sometimes knee-jerk opposition to welfare reform , a retirement age increase , health care reform , temporary employment or a minimum wage caused it to lose credibility in the eyes of many . huber 's right-hand man will be detlef wetzel , 54 , the president of ig metall 's division in the western state of north-rhine westphalia , which is germany 's metalworking heartland . wetzel earned his stripes this spring by negotiating the biggest wage increases in a decade for metal , automobile and electronic equipment workers .
he is also considered a reformer . dw staff -lrb- nda -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

russia , which is also part of the middle east quartet , maintains contact with the organization . " it is part of the policy of the quartet , " solana said .

solana said he condemned the attack on the school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rocket attack in sderot caused no casualties according to solana , israel would continue to have support from the 27-nation eu in fighting hamas-led attacks . " sometimes we do not agree 100 percent on exactly how to combat it , but we offer our full solidarity with israel in its efforts to fight terrorism , " solana said . solana continued on to jordan from israel for a working dinner with jordanian foreign minister abdel ilah khatib on monday .
the two men agreed that the international conference on the middle east , proposed by us president george w. bush " should be preceded by good preparations , " an official statement said . on tuesday , solana holds similar talks in lebanon and egypt . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he also accused his country 's western neighbor of not taking poland 's interests seriously . " berlin is n't concerned with poland 's vital interests , " according to poland 's foreign policy aid responsible for relations with germany , mariusz muszynski . muszynski named energy and security policies as particular bones of contention in a guest commentary for monday 's edition of the german business daily handelsblatt . poland 's proposal for a common european army was met with " coldness and distance , " muszynski wrote .
when poland had advocated a common energy policy , germany responded by clenching a deal with russia to build the baltic sea gas pipeline , which would circumvent poland , he added . " warsaw and not moscow is germany 's partner in nato and the eu , " muszynski said . germany wants to stay out of polish elections bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : germany is not focused on european integration , said muszynski a german foreign ministry spokeswoman expressed " incomprehension " at muszynski 's remarks .
she said that his comments may be linked to domestic political considerations . " we do not want to contribute to the election campaign in poland , " the spokeswoman said , referring to the early parliamentary elections expected to take place next month . facing the possible collapse of their right-wing coalition , the kaczynski twins - lech kaczynski holds the presidency , while jaroslav is prime minister - have indicated that they may call early elections . germany 's " official position will have to be very cautious in the weeks ahead , because every comment could be used as ammunition in the election campaign , " kai-olaf lang from the german institute for international and security affairs said in an interview with german news agency dpa . although the perception of ordinary poles of germany is quite positive , " there will be no harmony " between the two countries , said lang , as historical differences run too deep . historical wounds remain unhealed the nazi invasion of poland in 1939 and much publicized claims from germans expelled from what is now poland following world war ii have been ongoing divisive issues . muszynski made several historical references in his commentary indicating that the past had a strong influence on the present bilateral relationship .
he went so far as to suggest that poland preferred germany under otto von bismarck , a 19th century statesman known for his poor treatment of the poles . german chancellor angela merkel and her predecessor gerhard schröder had strayed away from the positive " moderation " of helmut kohl , who was germany 's chancellor from 1982 to 1998 , muszynski said . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics say the structure has been turned into a neo-nazi shrine . the hotel " zum türken " in the southern german town of obersalzberg is being strongly criticized for allowing visitors to view part of a nazi-era bunker located beneath its restaurant . according to research by german public broadcaster ard , visitors can access the bunker via an advertised passageway at the hotel .
ard research showed that it had become a pilgrimage site for neo-nazis , who come to see the nazi propaganda , swastikas and anti-semitic statements scrawled and carved on its walls . obersalzberg near berchtesgaden , located in bavaria near the austrian border , became hitler 's holiday retreat in 1923 .

it has also appealed to local authorities to check whether it can revoke the hotel 's restaurant and alcohol license . officials can not close the site , however , as it is privately owned by the hotel .

critics say the structure has been turned into a neo-nazi shrine . the hotel " zum türken " in the southern german town of obersalzberg is being strongly criticized for allowing visitors to view part of a nazi-era bunker located beneath its restaurant . according to research by german public broadcaster ard , visitors can access the bunker via an advertised passageway at the hotel .
ard research showed that it had become a pilgrimage site for neo-nazis , who come to see the nazi propaganda , swastikas and anti-semitic statements scrawled and carved on its walls . obersalzberg near berchtesgaden , located in bavaria near the austrian border , became hitler 's holiday retreat in 1923 .
it was expanded after 1933 , becoming a second seat of government along with berlin under the nazi regime . the hotel " zum türken " and adjoining bunker were once the quarters for hitler 's personal security staff and bodyguards from the sicherheitsdienst des reichsführers -lrb- sd -rrb- .

it has also appealed to local authorities to check whether it can revoke the hotel 's restaurant and alcohol license . officials can not close the site , however , as it is privately owned by the hotel .
the hotel owner 's attorney jan de haan said there had been problems in the past with right-wing extremists . " the hotel owner is in no way pleased by this , " de haan said .
he said that 95 percent of the hotel 's guests were foreigners , many from the united states .
the owner was not acquiring neo-nazi customers , de haan added . neighboring documentation center 's hands are tied the bavarian state government , together with the institute of contemporary history in munich and berlin , set up a documentation center in obersalzberg in 1999 .

he went so far as to suggest that poland preferred germany under otto von bismarck , a 19th century statesman known for his poor treatment of the poles . german chancellor angela merkel and her predecessor gerhard schröder had strayed away from the positive " moderation " of helmut kohl , who was germany 's chancellor from 1982 to 1998 , muszynski said . dw staff -lrb- kjb -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the complex would hold not just the bodies of a select few , but of millions of people . granted , germany is a relatively small , densely populated country .
so finding a place to bury the deceased can be a tricky business .
cemeteries often resort to excavating people 's remains after 20 or more years to make room for a new casket and headstone . as a potential way out of the dilemma , several germans have come up with a creative solution : emulating the ancient egyptians - en masse . german entrepreneurs have secured around 90,000 euros -lrb- $ 122,000 -rrb- in funding to study the feasibility of building an up to 488-meter tall -lrb- 1,600 feet -rrb- " great pyramid " near the eastern german town of dessau , in the state of saxony-anhalt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike egypt , dessau could become home to just one huge pyramid jens thiel , one of the project initiators , said a burial space within the pyramid could be affordable for most people .
current estimates showed that a tomb could cost up to 700 euros . those interested can already reserve their burial space online at thegreatpyramid.org. pyramid is " open to everyone " " outlasting personal physical existence is something that the egyptian pyramids could promise only a few , but this pyramid is open to every individual , " the web site said . " no one should be denied a place just because they ca n't afford it , " thiel said . thiel , along with the other project initiators ingo niermann and heiko holzberger , have founded an association called " friends of the great pyramid " to create this " tomb for all people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's highly unlikely any world-renown architects have worked on pumpkin pyramids according to germany 's daily süddeutsche zeitung , it is likely that the pyramid , should it ever be built , would initially be 150 meters high and increase in size as millions of burial tombs would be added concrete block by concrete block over several decades . the project initiators proclaim it could become the " largest building in history , " generating up to 19.6 million euros in sales of burial spaces . star architect rem koolhaas allegedly on board so outlandish is the proposal that is has caught the attention of famous architects , such as dutchman rem koolhaas .
the project initiators said koolhaas agreed to be on the jury for an architecture competition for the pyramid 's creation . there is a difference between the ancient egyptians ' architectural masterpiece at giza and the proposed german version near dessau : the hordes of tourists who are expected to come flocking to pay respects to loved ones , and the money they would likely bring with them . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he will be remembered as the man who secured a pay increase of 4.1 percent this year and another 1.7 percent next year for manufacturing workers .
peters and ig metall had originally gone into talks demanding a 6.5 percent raise . new direction the appointment of huber , who started his career as a toolmaker but went on to study history and philosophy , signals a new direction for the union and one in which more negotiation and compromise in disputes can be expected .
it will be his first task to define a new strategy to unify the remaining 2.3 million members of the union , which is still the most powerful in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall has over two million members since germany 's reunification , ig metall has had to fight growing dissatisfaction among salaried workers for labor groups in general , losing one million members in the past 12 years .
the damaging split between the two camps has contributed to the losses during jürgen peters ' reign . to the modernizers in the union , the new leadership signals an end to positions that were often seen as extreme , and based more on ideology than on the best interests of ig metall and its members .
the union 's past fierce and sometimes knee-jerk opposition to welfare reform , a retirement age increase , health care reform , temporary employment or a minimum wage caused it to lose credibility in the eyes of many . huber 's right-hand man will be detlef wetzel , 54 , the president of ig metall 's division in the western state of north-rhine westphalia , which is germany 's metalworking heartland . wetzel earned his stripes this spring by negotiating the biggest wage increases in a decade for metal , automobile and electronic equipment workers .

russia , which is also part of the middle east quartet , maintains contact with the organization . " it is part of the policy of the quartet , " solana said .
" you know very well what hamas has to do in order to change that policy . " the quartet - made up of the eu , russia , the united nations and the united states - demands that hamas recognize israel , renounce violence and abide by past peace agreements . solana is currently touring the middle east to prepare a major international middle east peace conference later this year .
solana said it was crucial to restart the peace process and that the eu would help and cooperate as much as possible in preparing the event . " we do n't know exactly when the conference will take place , but it must be a success , " he said .
" we can not allow it to fail and we must therefore define success . " eu condemns rocket attacks on israel militants in gaza have launched at least nine gaza-made qassam rockets at southern israel since monday morning , one of which struck near a nursery school in sderot .
solana said he condemned the attack on the school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rocket attack in sderot caused no casualties according to solana , israel would continue to have support from the 27-nation eu in fighting hamas-led attacks . " sometimes we do not agree 100 percent on exactly how to combat it , but we offer our full solidarity with israel in its efforts to fight terrorism , " solana said . solana continued on to jordan from israel for a working dinner with jordanian foreign minister abdel ilah khatib on monday .
the two men agreed that the international conference on the middle east , proposed by us president george w. bush " should be preceded by good preparations , " an official statement said . on tuesday , solana holds similar talks in lebanon and egypt . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the complex would hold not just the bodies of a select few , but of millions of people . granted , germany is a relatively small , densely populated country .
so finding a place to bury the deceased can be a tricky business .
cemeteries often resort to excavating people 's remains after 20 or more years to make room for a new casket and headstone . as a potential way out of the dilemma , several germans have come up with a creative solution : emulating the ancient egyptians - en masse . german entrepreneurs have secured around 90,000 euros -lrb- $ 122,000 -rrb- in funding to study the feasibility of building an up to 488-meter tall -lrb- 1,600 feet -rrb- " great pyramid " near the eastern german town of dessau , in the state of saxony-anhalt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike egypt , dessau could become home to just one huge pyramid jens thiel , one of the project initiators , said a burial space within the pyramid could be affordable for most people .
current estimates showed that a tomb could cost up to 700 euros . those interested can already reserve their burial space online at thegreatpyramid.org. pyramid is " open to everyone " " outlasting personal physical existence is something that the egyptian pyramids could promise only a few , but this pyramid is open to every individual , " the web site said . " no one should be denied a place just because they ca n't afford it , " thiel said . thiel , along with the other project initiators ingo niermann and heiko holzberger , have founded an association called " friends of the great pyramid " to create this " tomb for all people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's highly unlikely any world-renown architects have worked on pumpkin pyramids according to germany 's daily süddeutsche zeitung , it is likely that the pyramid , should it ever be built , would initially be 150 meters high and increase in size as millions of burial tombs would be added concrete block by concrete block over several decades . the project initiators proclaim it could become the " largest building in history , " generating up to 19.6 million euros in sales of burial spaces . star architect rem koolhaas allegedly on board so outlandish is the proposal that is has caught the attention of famous architects , such as dutchman rem koolhaas .
the project initiators said koolhaas agreed to be on the jury for an architecture competition for the pyramid 's creation . there is a difference between the ancient egyptians ' architectural masterpiece at giza and the proposed german version near dessau : the hordes of tourists who are expected to come flocking to pay respects to loved ones , and the money they would likely bring with them . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

he will be remembered as the man who secured a pay increase of 4.1 percent this year and another 1.7 percent next year for manufacturing workers .
peters and ig metall had originally gone into talks demanding a 6.5 percent raise . new direction the appointment of huber , who started his career as a toolmaker but went on to study history and philosophy , signals a new direction for the union and one in which more negotiation and compromise in disputes can be expected .
it will be his first task to define a new strategy to unify the remaining 2.3 million members of the union , which is still the most powerful in germany . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : ig metall has over two million members since germany 's reunification , ig metall has had to fight growing dissatisfaction among salaried workers for labor groups in general , losing one million members in the past 12 years .
the damaging split between the two camps has contributed to the losses during jürgen peters ' reign . to the modernizers in the union , the new leadership signals an end to positions that were often seen as extreme , and based more on ideology than on the best interests of ig metall and its members .
the union 's past fierce and sometimes knee-jerk opposition to welfare reform , a retirement age increase , health care reform , temporary employment or a minimum wage caused it to lose credibility in the eyes of many . huber 's right-hand man will be detlef wetzel , 54 , the president of ig metall 's division in the western state of north-rhine westphalia , which is germany 's metalworking heartland . wetzel earned his stripes this spring by negotiating the biggest wage increases in a decade for metal , automobile and electronic equipment workers .

" the quartet - made up of the eu , russia , the united nations and the united states - demands that hamas recognize israel , renounce violence and abide by past peace agreements . solana is currently touring the middle east to prepare a major international middle east peace conference later this year .
solana said it was crucial to restart the peace process and that the eu would help and cooperate as much as possible in preparing the event . " we do n't know exactly when the conference will take place , but it must be a success , " he said .
" we can not allow it to fail and we must therefore define success . " eu condemns rocket attacks on israel militants in gaza have launched at least nine gaza-made qassam rockets at southern israel since monday morning , one of which struck near a nursery school in sderot .
solana said he condemned the attack on the school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rocket attack in sderot caused no casualties according to solana , israel would continue to have support from the 27-nation eu in fighting hamas-led attacks . " sometimes we do not agree 100 percent on exactly how to combat it , but we offer our full solidarity with israel in its efforts to fight terrorism , " solana said . solana continued on to jordan from israel for a working dinner with jordanian foreign minister abdel ilah khatib on monday .

critics say the structure has been turned into a neo-nazi shrine . the hotel " zum türken " in the southern german town of obersalzberg is being strongly criticized for allowing visitors to view part of a nazi-era bunker located beneath its restaurant . according to research by german public broadcaster ard , visitors can access the bunker via an advertised passageway at the hotel .
ard research showed that it had become a pilgrimage site for neo-nazis , who come to see the nazi propaganda , swastikas and anti-semitic statements scrawled and carved on its walls . obersalzberg near berchtesgaden , located in bavaria near the austrian border , became hitler 's holiday retreat in 1923 .
it was expanded after 1933 , becoming a second seat of government along with berlin under the nazi regime . the hotel " zum türken " and adjoining bunker were once the quarters for hitler 's personal security staff and bodyguards from the sicherheitsdienst des reichsführers -lrb- sd -rrb- .

" we must take on the role of a sentinel , " faltlhauser said in a statement .
" this should n't be covered up and , most importantly , there ca n't be any hidden or open glorification of the nazi regime . " the ministry said it had recommended to the state prosecutor to file criminal charges .
it has also appealed to local authorities to check whether it can revoke the hotel 's restaurant and alcohol license . officials can not close the site , however , as it is privately owned by the hotel .
the hotel owner 's attorney jan de haan said there had been problems in the past with right-wing extremists . " the hotel owner is in no way pleased by this , " de haan said .
he said that 95 percent of the hotel 's guests were foreigners , many from the united states .
the owner was not acquiring neo-nazi customers , de haan added . neighboring documentation center 's hands are tied the bavarian state government , together with the institute of contemporary history in munich and berlin , set up a documentation center in obersalzberg in 1999 .

" the problem is that a relic of the third reich is privately owned and commercially marketed by the owner . " according to dahm , the documentation center has its own problems to deal with .
it was too small and bursting at the seams , he said .
there were also too few qualified personnel and parts of the exhibition were outdated .

yet they should be realistic and cautiously optimistic about the process . the european union has reiterated its position of avoiding direct dealings with the radical islamist group hamas , which violently took control of the gaza strip in mid-june . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : livni -lrb- left -rrb- and solana see eye-to-eye on middle east issues " i would like to repeat the eu position : there will not be any contacts between the eu and hamas , " said eu foreign policy chief javier solana at a press conference on monday after meeting with israeli foreign minister tzipi livni . the european union , israel and the united states consider hamas a terrorist group .
russia , which is also part of the middle east quartet , maintains contact with the organization . " it is part of the policy of the quartet , " solana said .
" you know very well what hamas has to do in order to change that policy . " the quartet - made up of the eu , russia , the united nations and the united states - demands that hamas recognize israel , renounce violence and abide by past peace agreements . solana is currently touring the middle east to prepare a major international middle east peace conference later this year .
solana said it was crucial to restart the peace process and that the eu would help and cooperate as much as possible in preparing the event . " we do n't know exactly when the conference will take place , but it must be a success , " he said .
" we can not allow it to fail and we must therefore define success . " eu condemns rocket attacks on israel militants in gaza have launched at least nine gaza-made qassam rockets at southern israel since monday morning , one of which struck near a nursery school in sderot .
solana said he condemned the attack on the school . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the rocket attack in sderot caused no casualties according to solana , israel would continue to have support from the 27-nation eu in fighting hamas-led attacks . " sometimes we do not agree 100 percent on exactly how to combat it , but we offer our full solidarity with israel in its efforts to fight terrorism , " solana said . solana continued on to jordan from israel for a working dinner with jordanian foreign minister abdel ilah khatib on monday .
the two men agreed that the international conference on the middle east , proposed by us president george w. bush " should be preceded by good preparations , " an official statement said . on tuesday , solana holds similar talks in lebanon and egypt . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics say the structure has been turned into a neo-nazi shrine . the hotel " zum türken " in the southern german town of obersalzberg is being strongly criticized for allowing visitors to view part of a nazi-era bunker located beneath its restaurant . according to research by german public broadcaster ard , visitors can access the bunker via an advertised passageway at the hotel .
ard research showed that it had become a pilgrimage site for neo-nazis , who come to see the nazi propaganda , swastikas and anti-semitic statements scrawled and carved on its walls . obersalzberg near berchtesgaden , located in bavaria near the austrian border , became hitler 's holiday retreat in 1923 .
it was expanded after 1933 , becoming a second seat of government along with berlin under the nazi regime . the hotel " zum türken " and adjoining bunker were once the quarters for hitler 's personal security staff and bodyguards from the sicherheitsdienst des reichsführers -lrb- sd -rrb- .
visitors to the bunker can view sd detention cells and shooting ranges . state government should be on the lookout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the allies demolished the remains of hitler 's berghof residence in 1952 bavaria 's finance minister kurt faltlhauser said the government had a clear responsibility to take in light of the bunker 's growing popularity among neo-nazis . " we must take on the role of a sentinel , " faltlhauser said in a statement .
" this should n't be covered up and , most importantly , there ca n't be any hidden or open glorification of the nazi regime . " the ministry said it had recommended to the state prosecutor to file criminal charges .
it has also appealed to local authorities to check whether it can revoke the hotel 's restaurant and alcohol license . officials can not close the site , however , as it is privately owned by the hotel .
the hotel owner 's attorney jan de haan said there had been problems in the past with right-wing extremists . " the hotel owner is in no way pleased by this , " de haan said .
he said that 95 percent of the hotel 's guests were foreigners , many from the united states .
the owner was not acquiring neo-nazi customers , de haan added . neighboring documentation center 's hands are tied the bavarian state government , together with the institute of contemporary history in munich and berlin , set up a documentation center in obersalzberg in 1999 .
a permanent exhibition informs the public of the town 's past under hitler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the documentation center in obersalzberg said it is severely underfunded the center 's head volker dahm said the hotel 's bunker had been a nuisance for years . " but we ca n't actually do anything about it , " dahm told ard .
" the problem is that a relic of the third reich is privately owned and commercially marketed by the owner . " according to dahm , the documentation center has its own problems to deal with .
it was too small and bursting at the seams , he said .
there were also too few qualified personnel and parts of the exhibition were outdated . " it looks as if we will not be able to sustain the exhibition 's scientific and professional standards , as well as the quality of its presentation with these personnel , " dahm said . faltlhauser , however , said he was aware of bavaria 's obligation to the site . " i have been very consistent in my responsibility and will continue to be so , " faltlhauser said . the ministry said faltlhauser in may doubled state funding for the site to 320,000 euros -lrb- $ 434,000 -rrb- and promised further personnel . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the complex would hold not just the bodies of a select few , but of millions of people . granted , germany is a relatively small , densely populated country .
so finding a place to bury the deceased can be a tricky business .
cemeteries often resort to excavating people 's remains after 20 or more years to make room for a new casket and headstone . as a potential way out of the dilemma , several germans have come up with a creative solution : emulating the ancient egyptians - en masse . german entrepreneurs have secured around 90,000 euros -lrb- $ 122,000 -rrb- in funding to study the feasibility of building an up to 488-meter tall -lrb- 1,600 feet -rrb- " great pyramid " near the eastern german town of dessau , in the state of saxony-anhalt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike egypt , dessau could become home to just one huge pyramid jens thiel , one of the project initiators , said a burial space within the pyramid could be affordable for most people .
current estimates showed that a tomb could cost up to 700 euros . those interested can already reserve their burial space online at thegreatpyramid.org. pyramid is " open to everyone " " outlasting personal physical existence is something that the egyptian pyramids could promise only a few , but this pyramid is open to every individual , " the web site said . " no one should be denied a place just because they ca n't afford it , " thiel said . thiel , along with the other project initiators ingo niermann and heiko holzberger , have founded an association called " friends of the great pyramid " to create this " tomb for all people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's highly unlikely any world-renown architects have worked on pumpkin pyramids according to germany 's daily süddeutsche zeitung , it is likely that the pyramid , should it ever be built , would initially be 150 meters high and increase in size as millions of burial tombs would be added concrete block by concrete block over several decades . the project initiators proclaim it could become the " largest building in history , " generating up to 19.6 million euros in sales of burial spaces . star architect rem koolhaas allegedly on board so outlandish is the proposal that is has caught the attention of famous architects , such as dutchman rem koolhaas .
the project initiators said koolhaas agreed to be on the jury for an architecture competition for the pyramid 's creation . there is a difference between the ancient egyptians ' architectural masterpiece at giza and the proposed german version near dessau : the hordes of tourists who are expected to come flocking to pay respects to loved ones , and the money they would likely bring with them . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics say the structure has been turned into a neo-nazi shrine . the hotel " zum türken " in the southern german town of obersalzberg is being strongly criticized for allowing visitors to view part of a nazi-era bunker located beneath its restaurant . according to research by german public broadcaster ard , visitors can access the bunker via an advertised passageway at the hotel .
ard research showed that it had become a pilgrimage site for neo-nazis , who come to see the nazi propaganda , swastikas and anti-semitic statements scrawled and carved on its walls . obersalzberg near berchtesgaden , located in bavaria near the austrian border , became hitler 's holiday retreat in 1923 .
it was expanded after 1933 , becoming a second seat of government along with berlin under the nazi regime . the hotel " zum türken " and adjoining bunker were once the quarters for hitler 's personal security staff and bodyguards from the sicherheitsdienst des reichsführers -lrb- sd -rrb- .
visitors to the bunker can view sd detention cells and shooting ranges . state government should be on the lookout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the allies demolished the remains of hitler 's berghof residence in 1952 bavaria 's finance minister kurt faltlhauser said the government had a clear responsibility to take in light of the bunker 's growing popularity among neo-nazis . " we must take on the role of a sentinel , " faltlhauser said in a statement .
" this should n't be covered up and , most importantly , there ca n't be any hidden or open glorification of the nazi regime . " the ministry said it had recommended to the state prosecutor to file criminal charges .
it has also appealed to local authorities to check whether it can revoke the hotel 's restaurant and alcohol license . officials can not close the site , however , as it is privately owned by the hotel .
the hotel owner 's attorney jan de haan said there had been problems in the past with right-wing extremists . " the hotel owner is in no way pleased by this , " de haan said .
he said that 95 percent of the hotel 's guests were foreigners , many from the united states .
the owner was not acquiring neo-nazi customers , de haan added . neighboring documentation center 's hands are tied the bavarian state government , together with the institute of contemporary history in munich and berlin , set up a documentation center in obersalzberg in 1999 .
a permanent exhibition informs the public of the town 's past under hitler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the documentation center in obersalzberg said it is severely underfunded the center 's head volker dahm said the hotel 's bunker had been a nuisance for years . " but we ca n't actually do anything about it , " dahm told ard .
" the problem is that a relic of the third reich is privately owned and commercially marketed by the owner . " according to dahm , the documentation center has its own problems to deal with .
it was too small and bursting at the seams , he said .
there were also too few qualified personnel and parts of the exhibition were outdated . " it looks as if we will not be able to sustain the exhibition 's scientific and professional standards , as well as the quality of its presentation with these personnel , " dahm said . faltlhauser , however , said he was aware of bavaria 's obligation to the site . " i have been very consistent in my responsibility and will continue to be so , " faltlhauser said . the ministry said faltlhauser in may doubled state funding for the site to 320,000 euros -lrb- $ 434,000 -rrb- and promised further personnel . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the complex would hold not just the bodies of a select few , but of millions of people . granted , germany is a relatively small , densely populated country .
so finding a place to bury the deceased can be a tricky business .
cemeteries often resort to excavating people 's remains after 20 or more years to make room for a new casket and headstone . as a potential way out of the dilemma , several germans have come up with a creative solution : emulating the ancient egyptians - en masse . german entrepreneurs have secured around 90,000 euros -lrb- $ 122,000 -rrb- in funding to study the feasibility of building an up to 488-meter tall -lrb- 1,600 feet -rrb- " great pyramid " near the eastern german town of dessau , in the state of saxony-anhalt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike egypt , dessau could become home to just one huge pyramid jens thiel , one of the project initiators , said a burial space within the pyramid could be affordable for most people .
current estimates showed that a tomb could cost up to 700 euros . those interested can already reserve their burial space online at thegreatpyramid.org. pyramid is " open to everyone " " outlasting personal physical existence is something that the egyptian pyramids could promise only a few , but this pyramid is open to every individual , " the web site said . " no one should be denied a place just because they ca n't afford it , " thiel said . thiel , along with the other project initiators ingo niermann and heiko holzberger , have founded an association called " friends of the great pyramid " to create this " tomb for all people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's highly unlikely any world-renown architects have worked on pumpkin pyramids according to germany 's daily süddeutsche zeitung , it is likely that the pyramid , should it ever be built , would initially be 150 meters high and increase in size as millions of burial tombs would be added concrete block by concrete block over several decades . the project initiators proclaim it could become the " largest building in history , " generating up to 19.6 million euros in sales of burial spaces . star architect rem koolhaas allegedly on board so outlandish is the proposal that is has caught the attention of famous architects , such as dutchman rem koolhaas .
the project initiators said koolhaas agreed to be on the jury for an architecture competition for the pyramid 's creation . there is a difference between the ancient egyptians ' architectural masterpiece at giza and the proposed german version near dessau : the hordes of tourists who are expected to come flocking to pay respects to loved ones , and the money they would likely bring with them . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics say the structure has been turned into a neo-nazi shrine . the hotel " zum türken " in the southern german town of obersalzberg is being strongly criticized for allowing visitors to view part of a nazi-era bunker located beneath its restaurant . according to research by german public broadcaster ard , visitors can access the bunker via an advertised passageway at the hotel .
ard research showed that it had become a pilgrimage site for neo-nazis , who come to see the nazi propaganda , swastikas and anti-semitic statements scrawled and carved on its walls . obersalzberg near berchtesgaden , located in bavaria near the austrian border , became hitler 's holiday retreat in 1923 .
it was expanded after 1933 , becoming a second seat of government along with berlin under the nazi regime . the hotel " zum türken " and adjoining bunker were once the quarters for hitler 's personal security staff and bodyguards from the sicherheitsdienst des reichsführers -lrb- sd -rrb- .
visitors to the bunker can view sd detention cells and shooting ranges . state government should be on the lookout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the allies demolished the remains of hitler 's berghof residence in 1952 bavaria 's finance minister kurt faltlhauser said the government had a clear responsibility to take in light of the bunker 's growing popularity among neo-nazis . " we must take on the role of a sentinel , " faltlhauser said in a statement .
" this should n't be covered up and , most importantly , there ca n't be any hidden or open glorification of the nazi regime . " the ministry said it had recommended to the state prosecutor to file criminal charges .
it has also appealed to local authorities to check whether it can revoke the hotel 's restaurant and alcohol license . officials can not close the site , however , as it is privately owned by the hotel .
the hotel owner 's attorney jan de haan said there had been problems in the past with right-wing extremists . " the hotel owner is in no way pleased by this , " de haan said .
he said that 95 percent of the hotel 's guests were foreigners , many from the united states .
the owner was not acquiring neo-nazi customers , de haan added . neighboring documentation center 's hands are tied the bavarian state government , together with the institute of contemporary history in munich and berlin , set up a documentation center in obersalzberg in 1999 .
a permanent exhibition informs the public of the town 's past under hitler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the documentation center in obersalzberg said it is severely underfunded the center 's head volker dahm said the hotel 's bunker had been a nuisance for years . " but we ca n't actually do anything about it , " dahm told ard .
" the problem is that a relic of the third reich is privately owned and commercially marketed by the owner . " according to dahm , the documentation center has its own problems to deal with .
it was too small and bursting at the seams , he said .
there were also too few qualified personnel and parts of the exhibition were outdated . " it looks as if we will not be able to sustain the exhibition 's scientific and professional standards , as well as the quality of its presentation with these personnel , " dahm said . faltlhauser , however , said he was aware of bavaria 's obligation to the site . " i have been very consistent in my responsibility and will continue to be so , " faltlhauser said . the ministry said faltlhauser in may doubled state funding for the site to 320,000 euros -lrb- $ 434,000 -rrb- and promised further personnel . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the complex would hold not just the bodies of a select few , but of millions of people . granted , germany is a relatively small , densely populated country .
so finding a place to bury the deceased can be a tricky business .
cemeteries often resort to excavating people 's remains after 20 or more years to make room for a new casket and headstone . as a potential way out of the dilemma , several germans have come up with a creative solution : emulating the ancient egyptians - en masse . german entrepreneurs have secured around 90,000 euros -lrb- $ 122,000 -rrb- in funding to study the feasibility of building an up to 488-meter tall -lrb- 1,600 feet -rrb- " great pyramid " near the eastern german town of dessau , in the state of saxony-anhalt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike egypt , dessau could become home to just one huge pyramid jens thiel , one of the project initiators , said a burial space within the pyramid could be affordable for most people .
current estimates showed that a tomb could cost up to 700 euros . those interested can already reserve their burial space online at thegreatpyramid.org. pyramid is " open to everyone " " outlasting personal physical existence is something that the egyptian pyramids could promise only a few , but this pyramid is open to every individual , " the web site said . " no one should be denied a place just because they ca n't afford it , " thiel said . thiel , along with the other project initiators ingo niermann and heiko holzberger , have founded an association called " friends of the great pyramid " to create this " tomb for all people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's highly unlikely any world-renown architects have worked on pumpkin pyramids according to germany 's daily süddeutsche zeitung , it is likely that the pyramid , should it ever be built , would initially be 150 meters high and increase in size as millions of burial tombs would be added concrete block by concrete block over several decades . the project initiators proclaim it could become the " largest building in history , " generating up to 19.6 million euros in sales of burial spaces . star architect rem koolhaas allegedly on board so outlandish is the proposal that is has caught the attention of famous architects , such as dutchman rem koolhaas .
the project initiators said koolhaas agreed to be on the jury for an architecture competition for the pyramid 's creation . there is a difference between the ancient egyptians ' architectural masterpiece at giza and the proposed german version near dessau : the hordes of tourists who are expected to come flocking to pay respects to loved ones , and the money they would likely bring with them . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics say the structure has been turned into a neo-nazi shrine . the hotel " zum türken " in the southern german town of obersalzberg is being strongly criticized for allowing visitors to view part of a nazi-era bunker located beneath its restaurant . according to research by german public broadcaster ard , visitors can access the bunker via an advertised passageway at the hotel .
ard research showed that it had become a pilgrimage site for neo-nazis , who come to see the nazi propaganda , swastikas and anti-semitic statements scrawled and carved on its walls . obersalzberg near berchtesgaden , located in bavaria near the austrian border , became hitler 's holiday retreat in 1923 .
it was expanded after 1933 , becoming a second seat of government along with berlin under the nazi regime . the hotel " zum türken " and adjoining bunker were once the quarters for hitler 's personal security staff and bodyguards from the sicherheitsdienst des reichsführers -lrb- sd -rrb- .
visitors to the bunker can view sd detention cells and shooting ranges . state government should be on the lookout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the allies demolished the remains of hitler 's berghof residence in 1952 bavaria 's finance minister kurt faltlhauser said the government had a clear responsibility to take in light of the bunker 's growing popularity among neo-nazis . " we must take on the role of a sentinel , " faltlhauser said in a statement .
" this should n't be covered up and , most importantly , there ca n't be any hidden or open glorification of the nazi regime . " the ministry said it had recommended to the state prosecutor to file criminal charges .
it has also appealed to local authorities to check whether it can revoke the hotel 's restaurant and alcohol license . officials can not close the site , however , as it is privately owned by the hotel .
the hotel owner 's attorney jan de haan said there had been problems in the past with right-wing extremists . " the hotel owner is in no way pleased by this , " de haan said .
he said that 95 percent of the hotel 's guests were foreigners , many from the united states .
the owner was not acquiring neo-nazi customers , de haan added . neighboring documentation center 's hands are tied the bavarian state government , together with the institute of contemporary history in munich and berlin , set up a documentation center in obersalzberg in 1999 .
a permanent exhibition informs the public of the town 's past under hitler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the documentation center in obersalzberg said it is severely underfunded the center 's head volker dahm said the hotel 's bunker had been a nuisance for years . " but we ca n't actually do anything about it , " dahm told ard .
" the problem is that a relic of the third reich is privately owned and commercially marketed by the owner . " according to dahm , the documentation center has its own problems to deal with .
it was too small and bursting at the seams , he said .
there were also too few qualified personnel and parts of the exhibition were outdated . " it looks as if we will not be able to sustain the exhibition 's scientific and professional standards , as well as the quality of its presentation with these personnel , " dahm said . faltlhauser , however , said he was aware of bavaria 's obligation to the site . " i have been very consistent in my responsibility and will continue to be so , " faltlhauser said . the ministry said faltlhauser in may doubled state funding for the site to 320,000 euros -lrb- $ 434,000 -rrb- and promised further personnel . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

german finance experts also fear possible takeovers from abroad . german bankers and politicians said they see the financial turmoil on domestic markets resulting from the subprime loan crisis in the united states as an opportunity to switch gears within the germany banking system . " the situation is serious , " finance minister peer steinbrück told a banking conference in frankfurt , in reference to problems that have hit german banks and financial institutions in recent weeks . according to a survey commissioned by the german business daily handelsblatt , 31 percent of the 791 german business managers polled are concerned about the reputation of german banks . two institutions , the sachsenlb regional bank and the ikb , which normally specialize in lending to small businesses , suffered heavy losses through defaults in the us high-risk home loan sector and had to rely on help from other german banks to stay afloat . turmoil should bring change bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinbrück said institutions needed to usher change into the banking landscape steinbrück , however , said the current difficulties should prompt change . " the landesbanken -lrb- regional state banks -rrb- must use the opportunity to combine their strengths , " he said , adding that " it is right that consolidation be on the agenda . " " just holding on to the status quo and sitting it out will not be to the advantage of any of the institutions involved , " steinbrück said . after thanking the institutions involved in securing funding for the ikb , steinbrück also praised the landesbank baden-württemberg 's -lrb- lbbw -rrb- takeover of sachsenlb .
such buyouts would help protect german financial institutions from foreign investors , the minister added . as the world 's leading exporter , however , germany did need to ensure it did not rely on just one or two banking heavyweights , steinbrück added . fewer , stronger institutions bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : another regional state bank bought out sachsenlb consolidation was also the message that deutsche bank head josef ackermann brought to the annual bankers meeting in frankfurt on tuesday . ackermann called for germany financial institutions to gather under fewer but stronger roofs as the financial storm appeared to be passing . " there are many small banks , in a fragmented market , " ackermann said at the banking conference , adding that the smaller banks should " join forces , one way or another . " the next tie-up could bring together lbbw and westlb , which was weakened by a crisis separate from last month 's subprime lending turmoil , heinrich haasis , president of the german savings banks ' federation , the dsgv , told the afp news agency . risk ignored bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : subprime mortgages led to much of last month 's financial chaos steinbrück said he agreed with ackermann , who said banks ignored the risk involved in lending excessively to the subprime us housing sector , which threw international markets into turmoil last month . " i share the evaluation of mr. ackermann , " that such practices demonstrated a poor understanding of the risks involved , the finance minister said . ackermann , meanwhile , downplayed fears problems in the us housing market would set off a larger credit crunch in the coming months . " in the last few days , there have been signs that markets have begun to stabilize , " he said in a statement before the conference .

but the complex would hold not just the bodies of a select few , but of millions of people . granted , germany is a relatively small , densely populated country .
so finding a place to bury the deceased can be a tricky business .
cemeteries often resort to excavating people 's remains after 20 or more years to make room for a new casket and headstone . as a potential way out of the dilemma , several germans have come up with a creative solution : emulating the ancient egyptians - en masse . german entrepreneurs have secured around 90,000 euros -lrb- $ 122,000 -rrb- in funding to study the feasibility of building an up to 488-meter tall -lrb- 1,600 feet -rrb- " great pyramid " near the eastern german town of dessau , in the state of saxony-anhalt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike egypt , dessau could become home to just one huge pyramid jens thiel , one of the project initiators , said a burial space within the pyramid could be affordable for most people .
current estimates showed that a tomb could cost up to 700 euros . those interested can already reserve their burial space online at thegreatpyramid.org. pyramid is " open to everyone " " outlasting personal physical existence is something that the egyptian pyramids could promise only a few , but this pyramid is open to every individual , " the web site said . " no one should be denied a place just because they ca n't afford it , " thiel said . thiel , along with the other project initiators ingo niermann and heiko holzberger , have founded an association called " friends of the great pyramid " to create this " tomb for all people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's highly unlikely any world-renown architects have worked on pumpkin pyramids according to germany 's daily süddeutsche zeitung , it is likely that the pyramid , should it ever be built , would initially be 150 meters high and increase in size as millions of burial tombs would be added concrete block by concrete block over several decades . the project initiators proclaim it could become the " largest building in history , " generating up to 19.6 million euros in sales of burial spaces . star architect rem koolhaas allegedly on board so outlandish is the proposal that is has caught the attention of famous architects , such as dutchman rem koolhaas .
the project initiators said koolhaas agreed to be on the jury for an architecture competition for the pyramid 's creation . there is a difference between the ancient egyptians ' architectural masterpiece at giza and the proposed german version near dessau : the hordes of tourists who are expected to come flocking to pay respects to loved ones , and the money they would likely bring with them . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics say the structure has been turned into a neo-nazi shrine . the hotel " zum türken " in the southern german town of obersalzberg is being strongly criticized for allowing visitors to view part of a nazi-era bunker located beneath its restaurant . according to research by german public broadcaster ard , visitors can access the bunker via an advertised passageway at the hotel .
ard research showed that it had become a pilgrimage site for neo-nazis , who come to see the nazi propaganda , swastikas and anti-semitic statements scrawled and carved on its walls . obersalzberg near berchtesgaden , located in bavaria near the austrian border , became hitler 's holiday retreat in 1923 .
it was expanded after 1933 , becoming a second seat of government along with berlin under the nazi regime . the hotel " zum türken " and adjoining bunker were once the quarters for hitler 's personal security staff and bodyguards from the sicherheitsdienst des reichsführers -lrb- sd -rrb- .
visitors to the bunker can view sd detention cells and shooting ranges . state government should be on the lookout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the allies demolished the remains of hitler 's berghof residence in 1952 bavaria 's finance minister kurt faltlhauser said the government had a clear responsibility to take in light of the bunker 's growing popularity among neo-nazis . " we must take on the role of a sentinel , " faltlhauser said in a statement .
" this should n't be covered up and , most importantly , there ca n't be any hidden or open glorification of the nazi regime . " the ministry said it had recommended to the state prosecutor to file criminal charges .
it has also appealed to local authorities to check whether it can revoke the hotel 's restaurant and alcohol license . officials can not close the site , however , as it is privately owned by the hotel .
the hotel owner 's attorney jan de haan said there had been problems in the past with right-wing extremists . " the hotel owner is in no way pleased by this , " de haan said .
he said that 95 percent of the hotel 's guests were foreigners , many from the united states .
the owner was not acquiring neo-nazi customers , de haan added . neighboring documentation center 's hands are tied the bavarian state government , together with the institute of contemporary history in munich and berlin , set up a documentation center in obersalzberg in 1999 .
a permanent exhibition informs the public of the town 's past under hitler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the documentation center in obersalzberg said it is severely underfunded the center 's head volker dahm said the hotel 's bunker had been a nuisance for years . " but we ca n't actually do anything about it , " dahm told ard .
" the problem is that a relic of the third reich is privately owned and commercially marketed by the owner . " according to dahm , the documentation center has its own problems to deal with .
it was too small and bursting at the seams , he said .
there were also too few qualified personnel and parts of the exhibition were outdated . " it looks as if we will not be able to sustain the exhibition 's scientific and professional standards , as well as the quality of its presentation with these personnel , " dahm said . faltlhauser , however , said he was aware of bavaria 's obligation to the site . " i have been very consistent in my responsibility and will continue to be so , " faltlhauser said . the ministry said faltlhauser in may doubled state funding for the site to 320,000 euros -lrb- $ 434,000 -rrb- and promised further personnel . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

critics say the structure has been turned into a neo-nazi shrine . the hotel " zum türken " in the southern german town of obersalzberg is being strongly criticized for allowing visitors to view part of a nazi-era bunker located beneath its restaurant . according to research by german public broadcaster ard , visitors can access the bunker via an advertised passageway at the hotel .
ard research showed that it had become a pilgrimage site for neo-nazis , who come to see the nazi propaganda , swastikas and anti-semitic statements scrawled and carved on its walls . obersalzberg near berchtesgaden , located in bavaria near the austrian border , became hitler 's holiday retreat in 1923 .
it was expanded after 1933 , becoming a second seat of government along with berlin under the nazi regime . the hotel " zum türken " and adjoining bunker were once the quarters for hitler 's personal security staff and bodyguards from the sicherheitsdienst des reichsführers -lrb- sd -rrb- .
visitors to the bunker can view sd detention cells and shooting ranges . state government should be on the lookout bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the allies demolished the remains of hitler 's berghof residence in 1952 bavaria 's finance minister kurt faltlhauser said the government had a clear responsibility to take in light of the bunker 's growing popularity among neo-nazis . " we must take on the role of a sentinel , " faltlhauser said in a statement .
" this should n't be covered up and , most importantly , there ca n't be any hidden or open glorification of the nazi regime . " the ministry said it had recommended to the state prosecutor to file criminal charges .
it has also appealed to local authorities to check whether it can revoke the hotel 's restaurant and alcohol license . officials can not close the site , however , as it is privately owned by the hotel .
the hotel owner 's attorney jan de haan said there had been problems in the past with right-wing extremists . " the hotel owner is in no way pleased by this , " de haan said .
he said that 95 percent of the hotel 's guests were foreigners , many from the united states .
the owner was not acquiring neo-nazi customers , de haan added . neighboring documentation center 's hands are tied the bavarian state government , together with the institute of contemporary history in munich and berlin , set up a documentation center in obersalzberg in 1999 .
a permanent exhibition informs the public of the town 's past under hitler . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the documentation center in obersalzberg said it is severely underfunded the center 's head volker dahm said the hotel 's bunker had been a nuisance for years . " but we ca n't actually do anything about it , " dahm told ard .
" the problem is that a relic of the third reich is privately owned and commercially marketed by the owner . " according to dahm , the documentation center has its own problems to deal with .
it was too small and bursting at the seams , he said .
there were also too few qualified personnel and parts of the exhibition were outdated . " it looks as if we will not be able to sustain the exhibition 's scientific and professional standards , as well as the quality of its presentation with these personnel , " dahm said . faltlhauser , however , said he was aware of bavaria 's obligation to the site . " i have been very consistent in my responsibility and will continue to be so , " faltlhauser said . the ministry said faltlhauser in may doubled state funding for the site to 320,000 euros -lrb- $ 434,000 -rrb- and promised further personnel . dw staff -lrb- sac -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

but the complex would hold not just the bodies of a select few , but of millions of people . granted , germany is a relatively small , densely populated country .
so finding a place to bury the deceased can be a tricky business .
cemeteries often resort to excavating people 's remains after 20 or more years to make room for a new casket and headstone . as a potential way out of the dilemma , several germans have come up with a creative solution : emulating the ancient egyptians - en masse . german entrepreneurs have secured around 90,000 euros -lrb- $ 122,000 -rrb- in funding to study the feasibility of building an up to 488-meter tall -lrb- 1,600 feet -rrb- " great pyramid " near the eastern german town of dessau , in the state of saxony-anhalt . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unlike egypt , dessau could become home to just one huge pyramid jens thiel , one of the project initiators , said a burial space within the pyramid could be affordable for most people .
current estimates showed that a tomb could cost up to 700 euros . those interested can already reserve their burial space online at thegreatpyramid.org. pyramid is " open to everyone " " outlasting personal physical existence is something that the egyptian pyramids could promise only a few , but this pyramid is open to every individual , " the web site said . " no one should be denied a place just because they ca n't afford it , " thiel said . thiel , along with the other project initiators ingo niermann and heiko holzberger , have founded an association called " friends of the great pyramid " to create this " tomb for all people . " bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : it 's highly unlikely any world-renown architects have worked on pumpkin pyramids according to germany 's daily süddeutsche zeitung , it is likely that the pyramid , should it ever be built , would initially be 150 meters high and increase in size as millions of burial tombs would be added concrete block by concrete block over several decades . the project initiators proclaim it could become the " largest building in history , " generating up to 19.6 million euros in sales of burial spaces . star architect rem koolhaas allegedly on board so outlandish is the proposal that is has caught the attention of famous architects , such as dutchman rem koolhaas .
the project initiators said koolhaas agreed to be on the jury for an architecture competition for the pyramid 's creation . there is a difference between the ancient egyptians ' architectural masterpiece at giza and the proposed german version near dessau : the hordes of tourists who are expected to come flocking to pay respects to loved ones , and the money they would likely bring with them . dw staff -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic share this article what is social bookmarking ?

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de team rick fulker rick fulker discovered his dual passion for music and the german language during his school years .
he graduated from the university of oregon with a degree in both subjects in 1977 , and moved to germany soon afterwards . a music journalist since 1983 , rick has practiced the trade in close collaboration with music program editors and producers in the united states , where his dw festival concerts are regularly broadcast .
rick says , however , that a job like his just does n't exist over there , which is one reason he has made germany his second home . rick is a regular visitor at germany 's major music festivals , particularly the bayreuth festival , and he is addicted to the music of wagner .
but his music interests are inclusive : from bach to be-bop , rameau to rammstein and gregorian chant to grunge .
he likes quoting his idol leonard bernstein : " there are only two kinds of music , good and bad . " because he is surrounded by so much great music in his office , the radio studio , and in germany 's concert halls , rick finds the sound of silence in his retreat in his eifel mountains in germany 's west all the more satisfying . there , he is currently fixing up an old farm with his partner , maintains a vegetable garden that is much to big , and dotes on his two british longhair cats - noting with satisfaction that they too seem to enjoy the music of wagner . < back send us an e-mail email : mail to rick fulker radio news listen to world headlines from the top of the hour .

a range of prevention and alleviation schemes have been examined for a number of communities .
however , funding issues mean they can not all be dealt with at once and a report to councillors has suggested a potential priority list .
it says selkirk and galashiels could see work completed in five years but other towns might face a longer wait .
councillors are scheduled to discuss the situation on tuesday .
the most costly scheme is in hawick - the scene of devastating floods two years ago .
the price of dealing with the flooding issue there is about £ 38m .
cash needed a little more than £ 15m is needed to address flood risks in selkirk posed by the ettrick water and long philip burn .
other schemes to be considered by councillors include those in peebles , where £ 7.2m would be required , newcastleton , where a similar amount of cash is needed and stow , where the likely bill is £ 3m .
the two least costly schemes are in jedburgh , at £ 1.5m , and galashiels where only a little more than £ 300,000 is required .
a detailed report to councillors advises them to go ahead with schemes in selkirk and galashiels within the next three to five years .
plans would then be drawn up and grant aid sought from the scottish executive .
the remaining projects are described as " medium to long term " with target implementation set at between three and more than eight years .

the national behaviour and attendance review looked at factors including future employment chances and estimated costs to the wider community .
it also expresses concern that unauthorised absences in welsh primary schools are double those in england .
the full report and recommendations are expected early next year .
i would urge everyone who has an interest in improving behaviour and attendance in our schools to read the report jane hutt , education minister the interim report states that the costs to the individual of being permanently excluded from school were " very high indeed " but warns that the costs to the community as a whole were also " very high " .
the review gives examples of the extra public spending which can result from removing a pupil .
these include educating the child elsewhere and the bill from deploying services such as social care , benefits and probation service .
the estimated cost to the individual ranges from a reduced chance of securing stable employment , to the risk of getting into crime and substance abuse .
the document emphasis that " exclusion , therefore , needs to be seen in the context of a big decision , bearing in mind major cost implications for the individual and the community " .
the interim report emphasises that most schools in wales are " orderly and well-managed " but expresses concern over a rise in the number of primary school pupils missing lessons .
the report says : " between 2005-2006 , rates of unauthorised absence in primary schools in wales were exactly double that of england .
" secondary absences are also much too high , with significant variations occurring between local authorities and schools throughout and across wales . "

causes identified include " widely different " support from authorities , a general lack of resources , short-term funding and families taking budget price holidays in term time .
the report sees a need for better training for people working with children , including teachers , health and social workers .
the authors say it is " evident " that " large numbers of existing professionals " have received " little or no training for their roles in managing attendance or behaviour " .
they found the way schools dealt with exclusions varied " considerably " between different local authorities , despite " adequate guidance " from the assembly government .
' drab and demeaning ' the need to improve some school buildings was also highlighted .
" it is far more difficult to secure good attendance , positive behaviour and to promote respect and regard for one another in an environment that is drab and demeaning , " the report says .
improving the leadership of some schools was also suggested , as well as the possibility of bringing parents into classrooms .
the report says research in the united states has " highlighted the benefits of using parents in classroom situations both for learning and behavioural support " .
the review team was chaired by swansea institute of higher education deputy principal professor ken reid .

the national behaviour and attendance review looked at factors including future employment chances and estimated costs to the wider community .
it also expresses concern that unauthorised absences in welsh primary schools are double those in england .
the full report and recommendations are expected early next year .
i would urge everyone who has an interest in improving behaviour and attendance in our schools to read the report jane hutt , education minister the interim report states that the costs to the individual of being permanently excluded from school were " very high indeed " but warns that the costs to the community as a whole were also " very high " .
the review gives examples of the extra public spending which can result from removing a pupil .
these include educating the child elsewhere and the bill from deploying services such as social care , benefits and probation service .
the estimated cost to the individual ranges from a reduced chance of securing stable employment , to the risk of getting into crime and substance abuse .
the document emphasis that " exclusion , therefore , needs to be seen in the context of a big decision , bearing in mind major cost implications for the individual and the community " .
the interim report emphasises that most schools in wales are " orderly and well-managed " but expresses concern over a rise in the number of primary school pupils missing lessons .
the report says : " between 2005-2006 , rates of unauthorised absence in primary schools in wales were exactly double that of england .
" secondary absences are also much too high , with significant variations occurring between local authorities and schools throughout and across wales . "

causes identified include " widely different " support from authorities , a general lack of resources , short-term funding and families taking budget price holidays in term time .
the report sees a need for better training for people working with children , including teachers , health and social workers .
the authors say it is " evident " that " large numbers of existing professionals " have received " little or no training for their roles in managing attendance or behaviour " .
they found the way schools dealt with exclusions varied " considerably " between different local authorities , despite " adequate guidance " from the assembly government .
' drab and demeaning ' the need to improve some school buildings was also highlighted .
" it is far more difficult to secure good attendance , positive behaviour and to promote respect and regard for one another in an environment that is drab and demeaning , " the report says .
improving the leadership of some schools was also suggested , as well as the possibility of bringing parents into classrooms .
the report says research in the united states has " highlighted the benefits of using parents in classroom situations both for learning and behavioural support " .
the review team was chaired by swansea institute of higher education deputy principal professor ken reid .
those taking part included teachers , behaviour specialists and welfare officers .
prof reid said the report was aimed at generating further debate .

the report says research in the united states has " highlighted the benefits of using parents in classroom situations both for learning and behavioural support " .
the review team was chaired by swansea institute of higher education deputy principal professor ken reid .

the national behaviour and attendance review looked at factors including future employment chances and estimated costs to the wider community .
it also expresses concern that unauthorised absences in welsh primary schools are double those in england .
the full report and recommendations are expected early next year .
i would urge everyone who has an interest in improving behaviour and attendance in our schools to read the report jane hutt , education minister the interim report states that the costs to the individual of being permanently excluded from school were " very high indeed " but warns that the costs to the community as a whole were also " very high " .
the review gives examples of the extra public spending which can result from removing a pupil .
these include educating the child elsewhere and the bill from deploying services such as social care , benefits and probation service .
the estimated cost to the individual ranges from a reduced chance of securing stable employment , to the risk of getting into crime and substance abuse .
the document emphasis that " exclusion , therefore , needs to be seen in the context of a big decision , bearing in mind major cost implications for the individual and the community " .
the interim report emphasises that most schools in wales are " orderly and well-managed " but expresses concern over a rise in the number of primary school pupils missing lessons .

causes identified include " widely different " support from authorities , a general lack of resources , short-term funding and families taking budget price holidays in term time .
the report sees a need for better training for people working with children , including teachers , health and social workers .
the authors say it is " evident " that " large numbers of existing professionals " have received " little or no training for their roles in managing attendance or behaviour " .

epi taione has changed his name to paddy power a tongan rugby star called paddy power says he hopes to realise a burning ambition by scoring a try against england in the forthcoming world cup .
the player formerly known as epi taione caused raised eyebrows earlier this week when he adopted the name of the well-known irish bookmaker .
taione who made the change by deed poll , will use the name throughout the tournament which begins on friday .
the mystery behind the strange name change was cleared up when it was revealed that the bookmaker had agreed to sponsor the cash-strapped tongan team for a five-figure sum , provided taione was re-named .
taione , no stranger to the media limelight , received an 18-week ban last year for biting irish international denis leamy during a heineken cup match .
tonga , and the 28-year-old power-taione , open their world cup campaign with a match against the usa in france on 12 september .
the talented tongan player will have the chance to realise his life-long ambition to score a try against england when the sides meet on 28 september .
paddy power , the bookmaker , is offering odds of 7-1 against the other paddy power 's dream becoming a reality .

epi taione has changed his name to paddy power a tongan rugby star called paddy power says he hopes to realise a burning ambition by scoring a try against england in the forthcoming world cup .
the player formerly known as epi taione caused raised eyebrows earlier this week when he adopted the name of the well-known irish bookmaker .
taione who made the change by deed poll , will use the name throughout the tournament which begins on friday .
the mystery behind the strange name change was cleared up when it was revealed that the bookmaker had agreed to sponsor the cash-strapped tongan team for a five-figure sum , provided taione was re-named .
taione , no stranger to the media limelight , received an 18-week ban last year for biting irish international denis leamy during a heineken cup match .

the affair , known as the " mensalao " -lrb- or big monthly allowance scandal -rrb- , first came to light in 2005 , but a decision on legal action has only come now after a lengthy investigation .
what are the main allegations ?
the defendants are accused of involvement in an illegal vote-buying scheme .
the " mensalao " relates to payments alleged to have been made each month in 2003 and 2004 to opposition politicians by president lula 's workers party -lrb- pt -rrb- , which has a minority in congress and governs through a coalition of several parties .
the payments , said to be around $ 13,000 -lrb- £ 6,500 -rrb- a month to lawmakers , were allegedly used to buy their support so they would vote in line with the pt .
the pt is also alleged to have used illicit funds to finance the election campaigns of its members and allies .
the pt acknowledged irregularities in its campaign financing , but repeatedly denied paying bribes to lawmakers from other parties .
who made the claims ?
the allegations were made in june 2005 by roberto jefferson , a deputy for the brazilian labour party -lrb- ptb -rrb- in the lower house of brazil 's parliament .
in a newspaper interview , he said the pt was running a vote-buying scheme and was involved in illegal campaign financing .
he later testified at a congressional hearing that he had accepted money on behalf of the ptb from the pt .
mr jefferson , who was stripped of his mandate , has been charged with corruption and money-laundering .
he denies the charges .
what stage is the case at ?
the supreme court has decided there is a case to answer .
the indictment says the scheme was designed to ensure " the continuance of the pt 's programme in power by buying political favours from other parties and funding their future and past -lrb- by settling debts -rrb- election campaigns " .
who are the key figures accused of involvement ?
they include president lula 's former chief of staff , jose dirceu , who has been indicted on corruption charges .
prosecutors say that he and other leaders of the pt , together with bankers and publicists , formed a " criminal organisation " that used public and private funds to buy political favours .
mr dirceu has denied the charges which his lawyer has said are without foundation .
other former high-ranking officials facing charges include jose genoino , previously president of the pt , delubio soares , the pt 's former treasurer , and ex-transport minister anderson adauto .
four directors of a small private bank have also been indicted , accused of making fraudulent loans to the pt .
advertising executive marcos valerio , who held several contracts with the government , is facing charges of corruption and money-laundering .
in 2003 , he personally guaranteed two bank loans to the pt , and in july 2004 he paid a $ 150,000 instalment on one of the loans .
such loans were not in themselves illegal .
but mr valerio assisted the pt at a time when his advertising companies were being paid for work with state-run companies and government ministries .
opposition lawmakers alleged mr valerio was , through those contracts , funnelling taxpayers ' money to the pt .
both mr valerio and the pt denied the claim .
is the president in any way implicated ?
no-one has suggested president lula was personally involved in the alleged vote-buying scam , and a majority of brazilians firmly believe he is honest .
the government acknowledged that mr lula was warned about the allegations in march 2005 .
at the time , he ordered two colleagues to look into the allegations .
they reported back that a parliamentary inquiry had investigated similar claims in october 2004 , and found no evidence of wrongdoing .
so what has been the scandal 's political impact ?
the opposition seized on the allegations and made them an issue during the 2006 presidential poll when mr lula was running for re-election .
he was forced into a second round , but then came through to win convincingly , mainly on the back of brazil 's economic growth and the popularity of his anti-poverty programmes .
what are the broader consequences of all this ?
despite mr lula 's re-election , the affair seriously dented the pt 's image as a party of honest government .
in 2002 , millions of brazilians voted for mr lula in the hope that he would change a political culture that many saw as corrupt and favouring vested interests .
but the suspicion has grown that the pt has delivered more of the same .
the " mensalao " , one of a number of political scandals surfacing in recent years , has held up the president 's efforts to push through important legislation and key reforms .
the legal proceedings are likely to be lengthy , keeping a scandal in the public eye that the president and his supporters hoped they had long left behind them .

the indictment says the scheme was designed to ensure " the continuance of the pt 's programme in power by buying political favours from other parties and funding their future and past -lrb- by settling debts -rrb- election campaigns " .
who are the key figures accused of involvement ?
they include president lula 's former chief of staff , jose dirceu , who has been indicted on corruption charges .
prosecutors say that he and other leaders of the pt , together with bankers and publicists , formed a " criminal organisation " that used public and private funds to buy political favours .
mr dirceu has denied the charges which his lawyer has said are without foundation .
other former high-ranking officials facing charges include jose genoino , previously president of the pt , delubio soares , the pt 's former treasurer , and ex-transport minister anderson adauto .
four directors of a small private bank have also been indicted , accused of making fraudulent loans to the pt .
advertising executive marcos valerio , who held several contracts with the government , is facing charges of corruption and money-laundering .
in 2003 , he personally guaranteed two bank loans to the pt , and in july 2004 he paid a $ 150,000 instalment on one of the loans .
such loans were not in themselves illegal .
but mr valerio assisted the pt at a time when his advertising companies were being paid for work with state-run companies and government ministries .
opposition lawmakers alleged mr valerio was , through those contracts , funnelling taxpayers ' money to the pt .
both mr valerio and the pt denied the claim .
is the president in any way implicated ?
no-one has suggested president lula was personally involved in the alleged vote-buying scam , and a majority of brazilians firmly believe he is honest .
the government acknowledged that mr lula was warned about the allegations in march 2005 .
at the time , he ordered two colleagues to look into the allegations .
they reported back that a parliamentary inquiry had investigated similar claims in october 2004 , and found no evidence of wrongdoing .
so what has been the scandal 's political impact ?
the opposition seized on the allegations and made them an issue during the 2006 presidential poll when mr lula was running for re-election .
he was forced into a second round , but then came through to win convincingly , mainly on the back of brazil 's economic growth and the popularity of his anti-poverty programmes .
what are the broader consequences of all this ?
despite mr lula 's re-election , the affair seriously dented the pt 's image as a party of honest government .
in 2002 , millions of brazilians voted for mr lula in the hope that he would change a political culture that many saw as corrupt and favouring vested interests .
but the suspicion has grown that the pt has delivered more of the same .
the " mensalao " , one of a number of political scandals surfacing in recent years , has held up the president 's efforts to push through important legislation and key reforms .
the legal proceedings are likely to be lengthy , keeping a scandal in the public eye that the president and his supporters hoped they had long left behind them .

the affair , known as the " mensalao " -lrb- or big monthly allowance scandal -rrb- , first came to light in 2005 , but a decision on legal action has only come now after a lengthy investigation .
what are the main allegations ?
the defendants are accused of involvement in an illegal vote-buying scheme .
lula has not been personally implicated in the scandal the " mensalao " relates to payments alleged to have been made each month in 2003 and 2004 to opposition politicians by president lula 's workers party -lrb- pt -rrb- , which has a minority in congress and governs through a coalition of several parties .
the payments , said to be around $ 13,000 -lrb- £ 6,500 -rrb- a month to lawmakers , were allegedly used to buy their support so they would vote in line with the pt .
the pt is also alleged to have used illicit funds to finance the election campaigns of its members and allies .
the pt acknowledged irregularities in its campaign financing , but repeatedly denied paying bribes to lawmakers from other parties .
who made the claims ?
the allegations were made in june 2005 by roberto jefferson , a deputy for the brazilian labour party -lrb- ptb -rrb- in the lower house of brazil 's parliament .
in a newspaper interview , he said the pt was running a vote-buying scheme and was involved in illegal campaign financing .
he later testified at a congressional hearing that he had accepted money on behalf of the ptb from the pt .
mr jefferson , who was stripped of his mandate , has been charged with corruption and money-laundering .
he denies the charges .

my alternative career as a clairvoyant crashed only seconds after take-off .
i went on holiday declaring there would be hardly any polls in august .
how wrong can you be ?
the european union featured prominently in the polling .
an icm poll for the daily mail -lrb- sampled 15-16 august -rrb- was devoted exclusively to it , but the findings illustrated some of the difficulties we face when we try to interpret public opinion .
the greater part of the poll was devoted to the premise that the proposed new eu treaty equalled a new eu constitution and therefore labour should honour its 2005 manifesto pledge to hold a referendum on any new eu constitution .
however , when asked if they thought the new treaty " does or does not represent a constitution for the eu " , only 24 % thought it did , whereas 44 % thought it did not and 31 % did not know .
eu withdrawal additionally , 58 % thought the eu had too much power over the lives of british people .
yet , when push came to shove , barely one-in-five -lrb- 21 % -rrb- thought we should withdraw from the eu .
a mori / sun poll -lrb- sampled 8-9 august -rrb- asked whether the decision to sign " the eu constitutional treaty " should be made by parliament or by the british people in a referendum : 17 % favoured parliament and 81 % a referendum .
in the event of such a referendum , 31 % said they were fixed in their determination to vote against , compared with 10 % who were determined to vote in favour .
the middle ground was occupied by 24 % who said they were slightly against but could be persuaded otherwise , and the 27 % who were slightly in favour but could also change their mind .
diana grief the 10th anniversary of princess diana 's death created a flurry of poll questions reflecting on that event as well as broader issues relating to the royal family .
a comres -lrb- formerly communicate research -rrb- poll for the bbc -lrb- sampled 24-26 august -rrb- found 37 % stating that the public display of grief over her death in 1997 was " too much " -lrb- 50 % thought it " about right " -rrb- .
and 56 % thought the royal family was out of touch with the public .
icm for the daily mail -lrb- sampled 1-3 august -rrb- found opinion divided over the effect of prince charles 's marriage to camilla - 39 % thought this had strengthened the royal family , compared with 37 % who thought they were weakened by it .
however , if charles does become king , 59 % thought camilla should not be allowed to take the title of queen .
brown vs cameron the monthly icm / guardian poll -lrb- sampled 22-23 august -rrb- found responses which suggested a more complex view of crime than might be supposed from many news headlines .
whereas 77 % thought court sentences were too soft , 51 % thought the government should not build more prisons but look for other ways to punish criminals and deter crime ; and 49 % agreed with the view that prison does n't work because it turns people into professional criminals who then commit even more crime .
needless to say , with no polling holiday , politics also featured throughout the month .
and gordon brown 's bounce continued .
mori / sun found those rating david cameron as untrustworthy had risen to 50 % -lrb- from 46 % in june -rrb- , compared with 54 % who thought mr brown trustworthy -lrb- up from 37 % in june -rrb- .
mr cameron continues to lead gordon brown in terms of having most personality -lrb- 42 % versus 31 % -rrb- .
however , gordon brown led david cameron as best at understanding the problems facing britain by 51 % to 17 % ; and as best in a crisis by 69 % to 10 % .
icm / sunday mirror -lrb- sampled 8-10 august -rrb- found 59 % satisfied with the way gordon brown was doing his job as prime minister -lrb- 19 % were dissatisfied -rrb- .
some 38 % were satisfied with mr cameron 's handling of his job as leader of the conservative party -lrb- 42 % were dissatisfied -rrb- .

the european union featured prominently in the polling .
an icm poll for the daily mail -lrb- sampled 15-16 august -rrb- was devoted exclusively to it , but the findings illustrated some of the difficulties we face when we try to interpret public opinion .
the greater part of the poll was devoted to the premise that the proposed new eu treaty equalled a new eu constitution and therefore labour should honour its 2005 manifesto pledge to hold a referendum on any new eu constitution .
however , when asked if they thought the new treaty " does or does not represent a constitution for the eu " , only 24 % thought it did , whereas 44 % thought it did not and 31 % did not know .
eu withdrawal additionally , 58 % thought the eu had too much power over the lives of british people .
yet , when push came to shove , barely one-in-five -lrb- 21 % -rrb- thought we should withdraw from the eu .
a mori / sun poll -lrb- sampled 8-9 august -rrb- asked whether the decision to sign " the eu constitutional treaty " should be made by parliament or by the british people in a referendum : 17 % favoured parliament and 81 % a referendum .
in the event of such a referendum , 31 % said they were fixed in their determination to vote against , compared with 10 % who were determined to vote in favour .
the middle ground was occupied by 24 % who said they were slightly against but could be persuaded otherwise , and the 27 % who were slightly in favour but could also change their mind .
diana grief the 10th anniversary of princess diana 's death created a flurry of poll questions reflecting on that event as well as broader issues relating to the royal family .

and 56 % thought the royal family was out of touch with the public .
icm for the daily mail -lrb- sampled 1-3 august -rrb- found opinion divided over the effect of prince charles 's marriage to camilla - 39 % thought this had strengthened the royal family , compared with 37 % who thought they were weakened by it .
however , if charles does become king , 59 % thought camilla should not be allowed to take the title of queen .
brown vs cameron the monthly icm / guardian poll -lrb- sampled 22-23 august -rrb- found responses which suggested a more complex view of crime than might be supposed from many news headlines .
whereas 77 % thought court sentences were too soft , 51 % thought the government should not build more prisons but look for other ways to punish criminals and deter crime ; and 49 % agreed with the view that prison does n't work because it turns people into professional criminals who then commit even more crime .

my alternative career as a clairvoyant crashed only seconds after take-off .
i went on holiday declaring there would be hardly any polls in august .
how wrong can you be ?
the european union featured prominently in the polling .
an icm poll for the daily mail -lrb- sampled 15-16 august -rrb- was devoted exclusively to it , but the findings illustrated some of the difficulties we face when we try to interpret public opinion .
the greater part of the poll was devoted to the premise that the proposed new eu treaty equalled a new eu constitution and therefore labour should honour its 2005 manifesto pledge to hold a referendum on any new eu constitution .
however , when asked if they thought the new treaty " does or does not represent a constitution for the eu " , only 24 % thought it did , whereas 44 % thought it did not and 31 % did not know .
eu withdrawal additionally , 58 % thought the eu had too much power over the lives of british people .
yet , when push came to shove , barely one-in-five -lrb- 21 % -rrb- thought we should withdraw from the eu .
a mori / sun poll -lrb- sampled 8-9 august -rrb- asked whether the decision to sign " the eu constitutional treaty " should be made by parliament or by the british people in a referendum : 17 % favoured parliament and 81 % a referendum .
in the event of such a referendum , 31 % said they were fixed in their determination to vote against , compared with 10 % who were determined to vote in favour .
the middle ground was occupied by 24 % who said they were slightly against but could be persuaded otherwise , and the 27 % who were slightly in favour but could also change their mind .
diana grief the 10th anniversary of princess diana 's death created a flurry of poll questions reflecting on that event as well as broader issues relating to the royal family .
a comres -lrb- formerly communicate research -rrb- poll for the bbc -lrb- sampled 24-26 august -rrb- found 37 % stating that the public display of grief over her death in 1997 was " too much " -lrb- 50 % thought it " about right " -rrb- .
and 56 % thought the royal family was out of touch with the public .
icm for the daily mail -lrb- sampled 1-3 august -rrb- found opinion divided over the effect of prince charles 's marriage to camilla - 39 % thought this had strengthened the royal family , compared with 37 % who thought they were weakened by it .
however , if charles does become king , 59 % thought camilla should not be allowed to take the title of queen .
brown vs cameron the monthly icm / guardian poll -lrb- sampled 22-23 august -rrb- found responses which suggested a more complex view of crime than might be supposed from many news headlines .
whereas 77 % thought court sentences were too soft , 51 % thought the government should not build more prisons but look for other ways to punish criminals and deter crime ; and 49 % agreed with the view that prison does n't work because it turns people into professional criminals who then commit even more crime .
needless to say , with no polling holiday , politics also featured throughout the month .
and gordon brown 's bounce continued .
mori / sun found those rating david cameron as untrustworthy had risen to 50 % -lrb- from 46 % in june -rrb- , compared with 54 % who thought mr brown trustworthy -lrb- up from 37 % in june -rrb- .
mr cameron continues to lead gordon brown in terms of having most personality -lrb- 42 % versus 31 % -rrb- .
however , gordon brown led david cameron as best at understanding the problems facing britain by 51 % to 17 % ; and as best in a crisis by 69 % to 10 % .
icm / sunday mirror -lrb- sampled 8-10 august -rrb- found 59 % satisfied with the way gordon brown was doing his job as prime minister -lrb- 19 % were dissatisfied -rrb- .
some 38 % were satisfied with mr cameron 's handling of his job as leader of the conservative party -lrb- 42 % were dissatisfied -rrb- .

the drug sutent can in some cases prolong the lives of patients with kidney cancer .
the company , oxford biomedica , is funding the supply of the drug , at christie hospital in manchester .
in return patients must agree to be involved in a trial of the firm 's drug trovax to see how it works with sutent .
the study will test if trovax adds further benefit and help patients survive longer .

sutent and trovax are not cures for kidney cancer , which is an aggressive and fatal disease , but it can slow down tumour growth , and help patients to live longer .
friends of tony wilson offered to pay for his treatment patients taking part will have to meet certain enrolment criteria for the trial and should not have had any treatment for their cancer other than surgery and radiotherapy .
sutent was licensed for treatment of advanced kidney cancer in the uk by regulators a year ago , and is used as a standard therapy in many countries including the usa , france , germany and spain .
however , it has not been approved by uk drugs watchdog body nice , but a small number of primary care trusts are funding it at a cost of about £ 3,000 a month .
nick woolf , a spokesman for oxford biomedica said : " we now have four centres open for recruitment in the uk , leeds , manchester , middlesbrough and middlesex , and another four are likely to open in the next few weeks .
" we hope that by making sutent available to patients as part of the trial this will help to accelerate recruitment in the uk . "
treatment privately the firm aims to recruit around 70 patients from 14 centres across the uk .
several cancer patients in the uk have decided to pay for their treatment privately , including tony wilson , co-founder of factory records in manchester , who died recently .
his friends offered to pay for the treatment after he was refused sutent on the nhs .

on sale , say security experts , are everything from individual viruses to comprehensive kits that let budding cyber thieves craft their own attacks .
the top hacking tools are being offered for prices ranging up to £ 500 .
some of the most expensive tools are sold with 12 months of technical support that ensures they stay armed with the latest vulnerabilities .
tool time " they are starting to pop up left and right , " said tim eades from security company sana , of the sites offering downloadable hacking tools .
" it 's the classic verticalisation of a market as it starts to mature . "
malicious hackers had evolved over the last few years , he said , and were now selling the tools they used to use to the growing numbers of fledgling cyber thieves . "
when it comes to the hacking industry and level of business acumen there 's no limit to what your money can buy " paul henry , secure computing mr eades said some hacking groups offer boutique virus writing services that produce malicious programs that security software will not spot .
individual malicious programs cost up to £ 17 -lrb- 25 euros -rrb- , he said .
at the top end of the scale , said mr eades , were tools like the notorious mpack which costs up to £ 500 .
the regular updates for the software ensure it uses the latest vulnerabilities to help criminals hijack pcs via booby-trapped webpages .
it also includes a statistical package that lets owners know how successful their attack has been and where victims are based .
mpack has proved very popular with criminally minded groups and in late june 2007 managed to subvert more than 10,000 websites in one attack that drew on the tool .
hacking groups also operate volume pricing schemes and discounts for loyal customers , he said .
" it 's almost a play-by-play of good business practices of software marketing , " he said .
" when it comes to the hacking industry and level of business acumen there 's no limit to what your money can buy . "
paul henry , vice president of technology evangelism at secure computing , said the numbers of downloadable hacking tools was growing fast .
according to mr henry there were more than 68,000 downloadable hacking tools in circulation .
the majority were free to use and took some skill to operate but a growing number were offered for sale to those without the technical knowledge to run their own attacks , he said .
but , he added , many hacking groups were offering tools such as mpack , shark 2 , nuclear , webattacker , and icepack that made it much easier for unskilled people to get in to the hi-tech crime game .
mr henry said the tools were proving useful because so many vulnerabilities were being discovered and were taking so long to be patched .
little risk " mpack used more than 12 different vulnerabilities that were launched against any web browser that visited any compromised site , " he said .
many hacking groups were attracted to selling the kits because it meant they took little risk themselves if the malicious software was used to commit crimes .
" the only thing you are going to find is a disclaimer that this was distributed for educational purposes and the user accepts any responsibility for any misuse , " he said .
the only risk the hacker groups faced in making the tools available was in having someone else steal them and offer them at a lower price .
already , he said , the sheer number of tools for sale was driving down prices .
garry sidaway , a senior consultant at security firm tricipher , said the success of mpack and the attendant publicity was rumoured to be worrying its creators .
" it was made by a group of friends and they all have regular jobs , " he said .
mr sidaway said the group would not lose much money if they did stop selling it because they made much more from other lines of business .
in particular , he said , the groups can sell information about unpatched or unknown vulnerabilities in software for thousands of pounds per bug .
