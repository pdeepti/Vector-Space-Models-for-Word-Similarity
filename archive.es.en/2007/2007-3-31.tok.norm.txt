" there is full support for the riyadh consensus , " said a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana , referring to the agreement reached by the arab league in saudi arabia this week to revive a five-year-old middle east peace plan . " the eu will continue to be extremely proactive to ensure that this window of opportunity is not missed . " the ministers meeting in bremen , germany , also supported a call by solana to organize meetings between the international quartet on the middle east - the eu , un , us and russia - and the arab quartet of egypt , saudi arabia , the united arab emirates and jordan , the spokeswoman said . ministers voiced optimism at their first get-together since the riyadh deal , which has been rejected by israel in its current form . " i take some confidence from the fact that the meeting of the arab league not only took place and showed some result but was also received with a cautious response on the part of the israeli government , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , presiding over the bremen meeting , told reporters . luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn said the arab initiative and the formation of the palestinian unity government were positive moves which lent the possibility of encouraging israel " to take seriously the hand extended by the arabs . "
hope for future peace the arab blueprint offers israel full normalization of relations if it withdraws from all land occupied in the 1967 war and allows the creation of a palestinian state and the return of palestinian refugees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert appears to see the possibility of peace though israel rejected the plan , prime minister ehud olmert said in interviews published friday that the jewish state could clinch global peace with its enemies within five years . on the final day of their meeting , the eu ministers were briefed by solana on his discussions at the arab league summit . the eu ministers also discussed how to deal with the new palestinian government , which includes ministers from the militant muslim hamas and the moderate fatah groups . so far the unity government has not accepted the conditions fixed by the international quartet for full renewed engagement - renunciation of violence , recognition of israel and abiding by past agreements .
eu deals with non-hamas officials solana , who hailed a " new arab consensus , " set the tone for relations with the palestinian unity government by talking in riyadh to the non-hamas president , mahmud abbas , and foreign minister , ziad abu amr , but not the hamas prime minister , ismail haniya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu will deal with abbas -lrb- right -rrb- , but not haniyah -lrb- left -rrb- his spokeswoman said the eu had agreed it would work " with the members of the government which are not hamas , in particular abbas , abu amr and the finance minister . " like the united states , the eu considers hamas a terrorist organization and boycotted the hamas-led palestinian administration which preceded the unity government . the eu ministers will also be discussing how to continue sending aid to the palestinians without dealing directly with hamas as well as a possible restructuring of the temporary mechanism to aid " institution building " in the palestinian territories rather than simple social welfare aid .
refugee issue remains as the ministers met , german chancellor angela merkel began a trip to jordan , israel , lebanon and the palestinian territories . she said the arab league agreement had " created a lot of movement . " however , eu diplomats warn that the palestinian refugee issue remains one serious stumbling block to peace . almost 4.5 million palestinian refugees and their descendants live today in dozens of refugee camps across the middle east in precarious conditions . israel vehemently rejects any suggestions of the refugees being allowed to return , arguing that the influx would effectively erase the jewish character of the state . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel embarks on middle east visit amid signs of hope angela merkel leaves saturday on a mideast trip and plans to visit jordan , israel , the palestinian territories and lebanon .

" it 's not the first person to make saber-rattling comments , " said beckett .
" i do n't think it 's helpful , " she added . a diplomatic note from iran to british authorities released friday condemned the " illegal act " by british naval staff in the gulf but did not call for an apology . beckett said : " i think everyone regrets that this position has arisen .
what we want is a way out of it , we want it peacefully and we want it as soon as possible .
we would like to be told where our personnel are ; we would like to be given access to them ; but we want it resolved , " beckett added . she said , however , she feared the current holiday period in iran might delay the diplomatic proceedings .

" we did hope that something might have happened during the night on the basis of bilateral relations between the united kingdom and iran but it did not happen , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier had hoped for movement friday night steinmeier added that a solution must be found " before the sailors and marines are sentenced , because that is what could happen to them , " he said .
iranian ambassador denies comments however , the iranian ambassador reported to have made the comments , gholam reza ansari , told iran 's state news agency irna that he was misquoted by russian television when he said tehran might put them on trial . " the network has made a mistake in translating the comments about detained british personnel and has reported the possibility of their trial , " he said , referring to an interview he had given on friday to vesti-24 television . iran on saturday again warned britain against politicizing the seizure of its 15 navy personnel , saying it could complicate efforts to resolve the escalating crisis . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu tells iran to release british sailors " immediately " eu foreign ministers , meeting in germany , sent a message of solidarity with britain over iran 's detention of 15 british naval personnel .

bildunterschrift : salihamidzic puts in bayern 's second goal despite larsen 's efforts for schalke stuttgart powers on at home to alemannia aachen , third-placed stuttgart vfb took an early lead when swiss striker marco streller powered his header just past the despairing finger tips of diving goalkeeper stephan straub after 29 minutes . aachen got back on level terms after the break when zambian defender moses sichone put his header just out of reach of stuttgart 's goalkeeper timo hildebrand to make it 1-1 on 59 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauth -lrb- center -rrb- celebrates next to sami khedira , after scoring but stuttgart made sure of the win as benjamin lauth chipped the keeper on 75 minutes before brazilian striker cacau scored an almost identical goal in the 84th minute to seal the 3-1 win . the win leaves them just two points behind bremen and four points away from schalke . closer to safety eintracht frankfurt defender sotirios kyrgiakos gave his side an early 1-0 lead over bottom-side borussia mönchengladbach after 11 minutes , but battling borussia picked up a priceless point thanks to federico insua . the draw keeps them bottom , but they are now only four points from safety . czech midfielder tomas galasek volleyed nuremberg into an early lead at home to hertha berlin in the 15th minute , and the home side extended their lead when midfielder marco engelhardt drove home his shot eight meters out on the hour . berlin gave themselves a life-line when argentinian striker christian gimenez scored on 69 minutes , but still went down 2-1 . two quick goals fired bayer leverkusen into an early 2-0 lead away at mainz 05 .
good day for schneider after german international midfielder bernd schneider made a huge dent in the mainz defense , his inch-perfect pass to sergej barbarez allowed the bosnian striker to headed his shot home on 42 minutes .
and the 25-year-old scored again three minutes later on the stroke of half-time when he followed a shot up from simon rolfes - fresh from making his debut for germany in midweek - to slide the ball home .
bildunterschrift : schneider makes it 3-0 schneider smashed his free-kick past mainz keeper dino wache on 52 minutes before mainz grabbed a consolation goal through egyptian striker mohamed zidan with 15 minutes to go to make it 3-1 . arminia bielfeld lifted themselves out of the relegation zone on friday night with a 1-0 win over borussia dortmund who took their place in the bottom three . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de bayern battle injury , attitude problems ahead of schalke clash bayern munich face injury and motivation problems ahead of their make-or-break game against league leaders schalke .

" there is full support for the riyadh consensus , " said a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana , referring to the agreement reached by the arab league in saudi arabia this week to revive a five-year-old middle east peace plan . " the eu will continue to be extremely proactive to ensure that this window of opportunity is not missed . " the ministers meeting in bremen , germany , also supported a call by solana to organize meetings between the international quartet on the middle east - the eu , un , us and russia - and the arab quartet of egypt , saudi arabia , the united arab emirates and jordan , the spokeswoman said . ministers voiced optimism at their first get-together since the riyadh deal , which has been rejected by israel in its current form . " i take some confidence from the fact that the meeting of the arab league not only took place and showed some result but was also received with a cautious response on the part of the israeli government , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , presiding over the bremen meeting , told reporters . luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn said the arab initiative and the formation of the palestinian unity government were positive moves which lent the possibility of encouraging israel " to take seriously the hand extended by the arabs . "
hope for future peace the arab blueprint offers israel full normalization of relations if it withdraws from all land occupied in the 1967 war and allows the creation of a palestinian state and the return of palestinian refugees .

bildunterschrift : salihamidzic puts in bayern 's second goal despite larsen 's efforts for schalke stuttgart powers on at home to alemannia aachen , third-placed stuttgart vfb took an early lead when swiss striker marco streller powered his header just past the despairing finger tips of diving goalkeeper stephan straub after 29 minutes . aachen got back on level terms after the break when zambian defender moses sichone put his header just out of reach of stuttgart 's goalkeeper timo hildebrand to make it 1-1 on 59 minutes .

good day for schneider after german international midfielder bernd schneider made a huge dent in the mainz defense , his inch-perfect pass to sergej barbarez allowed the bosnian striker to headed his shot home on 42 minutes .
and the 25-year-old scored again three minutes later on the stroke of half-time when he followed a shot up from simon rolfes - fresh from making his debut for germany in midweek - to slide the ball home .

the foundation behind it says the pictures are meant to provoke in order to bring the issue of hiv back into focus . in one of the campaign 's posters , a woman dressed in only black panties and high heels kneels in front of a naked man .
but in place of his penis , the barrel of a silver pistol is in her mouth .
the text accompanying the photo : " there 's only .003 mm latex between life and death . " the picture is one of a series of sometimes disconcerting images that have been launched by the michael stich foundation , a group founded by former tennis professional stich that focuses on hiv / aids awareness and works extensively with hiv-infected children in german-speaking countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this baby got hiv from mommy , the text says another one of the campaign 's posters shows an infant 's face in close-up with the words , " the chin is grandpa 's .

drug therapies developed in the 1990s that have mitigated the worst effects of the disease and lengthened the lives of many have led to the widespread opinion that hiv / aids is no longer as serious as it once was .

" it 's not the first person to make saber-rattling comments , " said beckett .
" i do n't think it 's helpful , " she added . a diplomatic note from iran to british authorities released friday condemned the " illegal act " by british naval staff in the gulf but did not call for an apology . beckett said : " i think everyone regrets that this position has arisen .
what we want is a way out of it , we want it peacefully and we want it as soon as possible .
we would like to be told where our personnel are ; we would like to be given access to them ; but we want it resolved , " beckett added . she said , however , she feared the current holiday period in iran might delay the diplomatic proceedings .

" the network has made a mistake in translating the comments about detained british personnel and has reported the possibility of their trial , " he said , referring to an interview he had given on friday to vesti-24 television . iran on saturday again warned britain against politicizing the seizure of its 15 navy personnel , saying it could complicate efforts to resolve the escalating crisis . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu tells iran to release british sailors " immediately " eu foreign ministers , meeting in germany , sent a message of solidarity with britain over iran 's detention of 15 british naval personnel .

" there is full support for the riyadh consensus , " said a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana , referring to the agreement reached by the arab league in saudi arabia this week to revive a five-year-old middle east peace plan . " the eu will continue to be extremely proactive to ensure that this window of opportunity is not missed . " the ministers meeting in bremen , germany , also supported a call by solana to organize meetings between the international quartet on the middle east - the eu , un , us and russia - and the arab quartet of egypt , saudi arabia , the united arab emirates and jordan , the spokeswoman said . ministers voiced optimism at their first get-together since the riyadh deal , which has been rejected by israel in its current form . " i take some confidence from the fact that the meeting of the arab league not only took place and showed some result but was also received with a cautious response on the part of the israeli government , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , presiding over the bremen meeting , told reporters . luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn said the arab initiative and the formation of the palestinian unity government were positive moves which lent the possibility of encouraging israel " to take seriously the hand extended by the arabs . "
hope for future peace the arab blueprint offers israel full normalization of relations if it withdraws from all land occupied in the 1967 war and allows the creation of a palestinian state and the return of palestinian refugees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert appears to see the possibility of peace though israel rejected the plan , prime minister ehud olmert said in interviews published friday that the jewish state could clinch global peace with its enemies within five years . on the final day of their meeting , the eu ministers were briefed by solana on his discussions at the arab league summit . the eu ministers also discussed how to deal with the new palestinian government , which includes ministers from the militant muslim hamas and the moderate fatah groups . so far the unity government has not accepted the conditions fixed by the international quartet for full renewed engagement - renunciation of violence , recognition of israel and abiding by past agreements .
eu deals with non-hamas officials solana , who hailed a " new arab consensus , " set the tone for relations with the palestinian unity government by talking in riyadh to the non-hamas president , mahmud abbas , and foreign minister , ziad abu amr , but not the hamas prime minister , ismail haniya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu will deal with abbas -lrb- right -rrb- , but not haniyah -lrb- left -rrb- his spokeswoman said the eu had agreed it would work " with the members of the government which are not hamas , in particular abbas , abu amr and the finance minister . " like the united states , the eu considers hamas a terrorist organization and boycotted the hamas-led palestinian administration which preceded the unity government . the eu ministers will also be discussing how to continue sending aid to the palestinians without dealing directly with hamas as well as a possible restructuring of the temporary mechanism to aid " institution building " in the palestinian territories rather than simple social welfare aid .
refugee issue remains as the ministers met , german chancellor angela merkel began a trip to jordan , israel , lebanon and the palestinian territories . she said the arab league agreement had " created a lot of movement . " however , eu diplomats warn that the palestinian refugee issue remains one serious stumbling block to peace . almost 4.5 million palestinian refugees and their descendants live today in dozens of refugee camps across the middle east in precarious conditions . israel vehemently rejects any suggestions of the refugees being allowed to return , arguing that the influx would effectively erase the jewish character of the state . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel embarks on middle east visit amid signs of hope angela merkel leaves saturday on a mideast trip and plans to visit jordan , israel , the palestinian territories and lebanon .

" it 's not the first person to make saber-rattling comments , " said beckett .
" i do n't think it 's helpful , " she added . a diplomatic note from iran to british authorities released friday condemned the " illegal act " by british naval staff in the gulf but did not call for an apology . beckett said : " i think everyone regrets that this position has arisen .
what we want is a way out of it , we want it peacefully and we want it as soon as possible .
we would like to be told where our personnel are ; we would like to be given access to them ; but we want it resolved , " beckett added . she said , however , she feared the current holiday period in iran might delay the diplomatic proceedings .
iran remains steadfast iran has so far refused to bow to mounting international pressure to release the naval personnel , who are being held in a secret location and are occasionally shown on television allegedly confessing to having entered iranian waters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somme iranians have called for drastic measures against the sailors britain insists they were in iraqi waters when they were seized . beckett said there had been contact with the iranian side but gave no details .

" we did hope that something might have happened during the night on the basis of bilateral relations between the united kingdom and iran but it did not happen , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier had hoped for movement friday night steinmeier added that a solution must be found " before the sailors and marines are sentenced , because that is what could happen to them , " he said .
iranian ambassador denies comments however , the iranian ambassador reported to have made the comments , gholam reza ansari , told iran 's state news agency irna that he was misquoted by russian television when he said tehran might put them on trial . " the network has made a mistake in translating the comments about detained british personnel and has reported the possibility of their trial , " he said , referring to an interview he had given on friday to vesti-24 television . iran on saturday again warned britain against politicizing the seizure of its 15 navy personnel , saying it could complicate efforts to resolve the escalating crisis . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu tells iran to release british sailors " immediately " eu foreign ministers , meeting in germany , sent a message of solidarity with britain over iran 's detention of 15 british naval personnel .

instead of using a car or bike , nissen sets off each day in a boat .
the 57-year old brings mail to the northern german halligen islands . it 's around 9 a.m. and like almost every morning for the past 30 years , fide nissen can be found with his cargo at the ferry station in northern german schlüttsiel .
his job is to deliver mail to approximately 160 residents of the halligen islands . everything - letters , newspapers and packages - gets stashed each morning in the boat 's waterproof cabin for its journey from the mainland .
the group of 10 small islands , unprotected by dykes , sit off the north friesland coast near denmark . there 's not much about the operation that looks like a traditional postal service - least of all its captain .
nissen looks more like a fisherman , with his beard , the waterproof clothes and the captain 's hat . happily afloat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mail delivery ship jobs are hard to come by on the small islands , which are often flooded by storms .
when he got the offer to be a mail captain in 1977 , he did n't hesitate .
he 's been an aquatic postman ever since . " since i love to be on the water and fish , i 've got my hobby and my job tied together , and of course that 's a fine thing .
naturally , summer days are nicer than winter ones , but you get through it , " nissen said . nissen commandeers an eight-meter-long -lrb- 26-feet -rrb- rescue cruiser with a 40-horsepower motor .
weather permitting , he heads out six times each week . on his daily tour , nissen maintains radio contact with his wife so he knows what jobs are waiting for him on shore and also for safety purposes .
additionally , he has a high-frequency marine radio with him , so that he can reach other ships in an emergency . nissen heads towards the island oland where he leaves letters and packages in a small postal box below a thatched roof house .
nissen is responsible for getting the mail to the islands , but not for actually delivering it .
he takes the outgoing mail under his arm and heads in the direction of the island langeness . it 's a cool spring morning .
the air smells of sea spray and on the horizon you can see the island dwellings that have been built on stilts to protect them from flooding . after two hours , we arrive at langeness , where nissen lives .
postal carrier liv schladenhaufen waits for him at the landing .
the 100 pieces of mail are sorted in an old milking parlor while sheep bleat outside .
for nissen , the day has only begun .
the letter carrier works on his parents ' farm .
he rents out holiday homes and is also involved in an acting group . staying connected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unusual cargo these days , the mail arrives more quickly than to many large german cities .
the german postal service , deutsche post , does n't charge extra to send letters to the islands .
it also does n't matter if the islands lack street names or house numbers . officially , there are house numbers . " companies had problems with their computers when someone ordered something but did n't have a house number , " schladenhaufen said .
" so most people have a zero or a one .
eventually house numbers were allotted . " with or without house numbers , there 's been mail delivery by boat to the islands for around 200 years .
if it 's up to lageness mayor boy andresen , it 'll stay that way .
even with e-mail and fax services . " when there 's mail , it will be delivered .
with the postal services here , we 're very happy .
it ca n't get any better , " he said . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's deutsche post wants europe to open markets deutsche post 's monopoly on letter delivery will end next year .

instead of using a car or bike , nissen sets off each day in a boat .
the 57-year old brings mail to the northern german halligen islands . it 's around 9 a.m. and like almost every morning for the past 30 years , fide nissen can be found with his cargo at the ferry station in northern german schlüttsiel .
his job is to deliver mail to approximately 160 residents of the halligen islands . everything - letters , newspapers and packages - gets stashed each morning in the boat 's waterproof cabin for its journey from the mainland .
the group of 10 small islands , unprotected by dykes , sit off the north friesland coast near denmark . there 's not much about the operation that looks like a traditional postal service - least of all its captain .
nissen looks more like a fisherman , with his beard , the waterproof clothes and the captain 's hat . happily afloat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mail delivery ship jobs are hard to come by on the small islands , which are often flooded by storms .
when he got the offer to be a mail captain in 1977 , he did n't hesitate .
he 's been an aquatic postman ever since . " since i love to be on the water and fish , i 've got my hobby and my job tied together , and of course that 's a fine thing .
naturally , summer days are nicer than winter ones , but you get through it , " nissen said . nissen commandeers an eight-meter-long -lrb- 26-feet -rrb- rescue cruiser with a 40-horsepower motor .
weather permitting , he heads out six times each week . on his daily tour , nissen maintains radio contact with his wife so he knows what jobs are waiting for him on shore and also for safety purposes .
additionally , he has a high-frequency marine radio with him , so that he can reach other ships in an emergency . nissen heads towards the island oland where he leaves letters and packages in a small postal box below a thatched roof house .
nissen is responsible for getting the mail to the islands , but not for actually delivering it .
he takes the outgoing mail under his arm and heads in the direction of the island langeness . it 's a cool spring morning .
the air smells of sea spray and on the horizon you can see the island dwellings that have been built on stilts to protect them from flooding . after two hours , we arrive at langeness , where nissen lives .
postal carrier liv schladenhaufen waits for him at the landing .
the 100 pieces of mail are sorted in an old milking parlor while sheep bleat outside .
for nissen , the day has only begun .
the letter carrier works on his parents ' farm .
he rents out holiday homes and is also involved in an acting group . staying connected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unusual cargo these days , the mail arrives more quickly than to many large german cities .
the german postal service , deutsche post , does n't charge extra to send letters to the islands .
it also does n't matter if the islands lack street names or house numbers . officially , there are house numbers . " companies had problems with their computers when someone ordered something but did n't have a house number , " schladenhaufen said .
" so most people have a zero or a one .
eventually house numbers were allotted . " with or without house numbers , there 's been mail delivery by boat to the islands for around 200 years .
if it 's up to lageness mayor boy andresen , it 'll stay that way .
even with e-mail and fax services . " when there 's mail , it will be delivered .
with the postal services here , we 're very happy .
it ca n't get any better , " he said . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's deutsche post wants europe to open markets deutsche post 's monopoly on letter delivery will end next year .

his job is to deliver mail to approximately 160 residents of the halligen islands . everything - letters , newspapers and packages - gets stashed each morning in the boat 's waterproof cabin for its journey from the mainland .
the group of 10 small islands , unprotected by dykes , sit off the north friesland coast near denmark . there 's not much about the operation that looks like a traditional postal service - least of all its captain .
nissen looks more like a fisherman , with his beard , the waterproof clothes and the captain 's hat . happily afloat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mail delivery ship jobs are hard to come by on the small islands , which are often flooded by storms .
when he got the offer to be a mail captain in 1977 , he did n't hesitate .
he 's been an aquatic postman ever since . " since i love to be on the water and fish , i 've got my hobby and my job tied together , and of course that 's a fine thing .
naturally , summer days are nicer than winter ones , but you get through it , " nissen said . nissen commandeers an eight-meter-long -lrb- 26-feet -rrb- rescue cruiser with a 40-horsepower motor .
weather permitting , he heads out six times each week . on his daily tour , nissen maintains radio contact with his wife so he knows what jobs are waiting for him on shore and also for safety purposes .
additionally , he has a high-frequency marine radio with him , so that he can reach other ships in an emergency . nissen heads towards the island oland where he leaves letters and packages in a small postal box below a thatched roof house .
nissen is responsible for getting the mail to the islands , but not for actually delivering it .
he takes the outgoing mail under his arm and heads in the direction of the island langeness . it 's a cool spring morning .
the air smells of sea spray and on the horizon you can see the island dwellings that have been built on stilts to protect them from flooding . after two hours , we arrive at langeness , where nissen lives .
postal carrier liv schladenhaufen waits for him at the landing .
the 100 pieces of mail are sorted in an old milking parlor while sheep bleat outside .
for nissen , the day has only begun .
the letter carrier works on his parents ' farm .
he rents out holiday homes and is also involved in an acting group . staying connected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unusual cargo these days , the mail arrives more quickly than to many large german cities .
the german postal service , deutsche post , does n't charge extra to send letters to the islands .
it also does n't matter if the islands lack street names or house numbers . officially , there are house numbers . " companies had problems with their computers when someone ordered something but did n't have a house number , " schladenhaufen said .
" so most people have a zero or a one .
eventually house numbers were allotted . " with or without house numbers , there 's been mail delivery by boat to the islands for around 200 years .
if it 's up to lageness mayor boy andresen , it 'll stay that way .
even with e-mail and fax services . " when there 's mail , it will be delivered .
with the postal services here , we 're very happy .
it ca n't get any better , " he said . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's deutsche post wants europe to open markets deutsche post 's monopoly on letter delivery will end next year .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.03.2007 new german hiv / aids campaign pushes the envelope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the images of the new hiv prevention campaign sometimes jar - that 's the point a new campaign to raise awareness about hiv infection uses shock tactics to get its message across .
the foundation behind it says the pictures are meant to provoke in order to bring the issue of hiv back into focus . in one of the campaign 's posters , a woman dressed in only black panties and high heels kneels in front of a naked man .
but in place of his penis , the barrel of a silver pistol is in her mouth .
the text accompanying the photo : " there 's only .003 mm latex between life and death . " the picture is one of a series of sometimes disconcerting images that have been launched by the michael stich foundation , a group founded by former tennis professional stich that focuses on hiv / aids awareness and works extensively with hiv-infected children in german-speaking countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this baby got hiv from mommy , the text says another one of the campaign 's posters shows an infant 's face in close-up with the words , " the chin is grandpa 's .
the eyes are daddy 's .
the hiv is from mommy . " " the pictures are meant to provoke , " linda von neree , an employee of the stich foundation , told the online site of the daily die welt .
" young people especially have lost sight of the problem . " she and many health care experts say hiv and aids have largely disappeared from the public 's consciousness .
drug therapies developed in the 1990s that have mitigated the worst effects of the disease and lengthened the lives of many have led to the widespread opinion that hiv / aids is no longer as serious as it once was .
that , in turn , has led to an increase in unsafe sexual practices that can transmit hiv infection . the campaign 's photographs have already appeared in several german newspapers and the foundation has produced an informational spot that will air on television and be shown in cinemas . growing infection rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hiv is neither pretty nor harmless medical experts in germany have been alarmed by a recent increase in new hiv infections in the country .
according to the robert koch institute , germany 's center for public health and disease control , 2,700 people in germany became infected in 2006 , a 7.4 percent increase over the previous year . that follows a 20 percent increase in new hiv infections in the first half of 2005 compared with the first half of 2004 . the institute estimates that around 56,000 people in germany are living with hiv . michael stich , who won a wimbledon title in 1991 , started his foundation 13 years ago .
in addition to the current print and television campaign , the group is running an educational program in schools to teach kids about hiv prevention . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german aids action plan aims to revive awareness the german cabinet approved a national action plan against the spread of hiv and aids , which focuses on increased preventive measures and research into new strains of drug-resistant viruses .

some have even taken to shooting at them with guns , pelting them with rocks or sawing them off their poles . the fury of a german driver caught speeding knows no bounds .
and the roadside devices used in germany to catch speeders may just be in for some harsh treatment as a result . some speed demons get so angry , they 'll do anything to avoid prosecution , as police in the harz mountains town of osterode discovered recently . in order to avoid being charged , one speeding driver stopped his car long enough to rip out all the speed limit signs he could find along a stretch of road and tossed them into a nearby ditch .
officers came across them several days later . " it was probably someone caught by a camera while speeding on the b 243 highway , " a police spokesman said , pointing out that countless other speeding motorists had probably slipped through the net in the days that followed since they could rightly claim that no speed limit signs were visible . the fury of a speeder scorned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some speed limit signs land in the graveyard after speeders ' antics police have not given up hope of catching the sign-destroyers who will face heavy fines once caught - just like the one handed down to a 75-year-old pensioner convicted recently by a court in the city of goslar . despite a previous conviction for firing bullets at a radar speed trap in fulda , the elderly man hurled stones at a pole-mounted camera after it had snapped a picture of him while speeding .

the first device was stolen by traffic rowdies , while a 19-year-old took an axe to its replacement .

coach hitzfeld wants longer training camps to get his players ' heads right before crucial games . german champions bayern munich face the biggest game of their domestic season so far when they meet league leaders schalke 04 on saturday .
but ottmar hitzfeld 's fourth-placed team have injury and motivational problems ahead of the match which could do much to determine the destination of the title . bayern will be hoping bastian schweinsteiger 's thigh injury , sustained during germany 's 2-1 victory against the czech republic in a euro 2008 qualifier in prague last saturday , will heal in time for the influential midfielder to feature in the game . hitzfeld said on munich 's web site that the midfielder " is doubtful " for the crucial league match with schalke , which munich need to win if they want to defend their title . hitzfeld prescribes extra training bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzfeld wants his team to spend more time together hitzfeld has planned longer pre-match training camps in a bid to make his players more dedicated in the crucial final weeks of the bundesliga season , the sport bild weekly reported on wednesday . the coach was left fuming after the bavarian giants ' latest setback , the 1-0 defeat at lowly eintracht frankfurt last saturday and wants to address what he said was " a lack of determination in front of the goal and not enough creativity in midfield . " munich have to finish at least third in order to make qualifying for the european champions league a possibility , and hitzfeld is planning camps 48 hours ahead of the games and not 24 hours in a bid to push his players further . " i am thinking about starting the training camps ahead of the matches a day earlier .
maybe the players will realize how serious the situation is if they are together over a longer period , " hitzfeld told sport bild . makaay sees title chase as mission impossible bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : makaay -lrb- left -rrb- sees the title race as a serious struggle meanwhile , bayern 's dutch striker roy makaay has said that the champions require a miracle if they are to win the bundesliga this season . the 32-year-old said that there was too much of a gap between them and schalke and that they would have to look to next month 's champions league quarter-final with ac milan to achieve anything this season . " with nine points difference between us and schalke 04 , we need a miracle if we are to be crowned champions , especially with just eight matches remaining , " makaay told the club web site .
" we have three teams ahead of us , and aside from that we also have the champions league quarter-final . " makaay , who has scored 74 times including 12 this season for bayern in the bundesliga since he signed for 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.6 million -rrb- in 2003 , admitted that they needed to pull something out of what has been a generally disappointing season by their high standards .

" it would be perfectly normal for china with a population of 1.3 billion to become the world 's export champion , " said börner . his comments at a press conference in berlin on tuesday followed the move by the bga to raise its 2007 growth forecast for germany 's exports from 6.0 percent to 9.0 percent , helped by china 's booming economic growth . the bga expects german exports to non-european union nations to rise by 13 percent this year , boosted by exports to china and russia as well southeast asia 's fast-moving economies . this is almost double the 7.0-percent growth increase the bga is forecasting for exports to germany 's key partners in the 13-member euro zone . no risk to germany börner also stressed that china replacing germany as the world 's leading export nation did not represent a risk for germany , which is also europe 's biggest economy . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : most of these shrimp being processed in china are meant for the eu and us china taking the title represented " good news and did not represent any danger for the german economy , " said börner . " our exports will continue to grow with or without the world champion title , " he said , stressing that germany 's export machine was resulting in german employers expanding their hiring . about 8.5 billion jobs , or one in every five , were dependent on germany 's export sector in 2006 , the bga chief said , adding that it was about one billion more than in 2000 .
the trend is for continued growth in job creation , he said . almost three years after the european union 's big bang in its membership , when 10 largely central and eastern european states signed up to the brussels-based bloc , exports to that region continued to boom . the bga expects a 12-percent rise in german exports to central and eastern europe this year , also boosted by romania and bulgaria becoming the eu 's 26th and 27th member states at the start of 2007 . dw staff / dpa -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany companies profit from torture device exports torture is still practiced in many different countries and electro-shockers - some of which can be bought and exported from germany - have become increasingly common in torturing political dissidents .

the foundation behind it says the pictures are meant to provoke in order to bring the issue of hiv back into focus . in one of the campaign 's posters , a woman dressed in only black panties and high heels kneels in front of a naked man .
but in place of his penis , the barrel of a silver pistol is in her mouth .
the text accompanying the photo : " there 's only .003 mm latex between life and death .

" young people especially have lost sight of the problem . " she and many health care experts say hiv and aids have largely disappeared from the public 's consciousness .
drug therapies developed in the 1990s that have mitigated the worst effects of the disease and lengthened the lives of many have led to the widespread opinion that hiv / aids is no longer as serious as it once was .

according to the robert koch institute , germany 's center for public health and disease control , 2,700 people in germany became infected in 2006 , a 7.4 percent increase over the previous year . that follows a 20 percent increase in new hiv infections in the first half of 2005 compared with the first half of 2004 . the institute estimates that around 56,000 people in germany are living with hiv . michael stich , who won a wimbledon title in 1991 , started his foundation 13 years ago .
in addition to the current print and television campaign , the group is running an educational program in schools to teach kids about hiv prevention . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german aids action plan aims to revive awareness the german cabinet approved a national action plan against the spread of hiv and aids , which focuses on increased preventive measures and research into new strains of drug-resistant viruses .

" there is full support for the riyadh consensus , " said a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana , referring to the agreement reached by the arab league in saudi arabia this week to revive a five-year-old middle east peace plan . " the eu will continue to be extremely proactive to ensure that this window of opportunity is not missed . " the ministers meeting in bremen , germany , also supported a call by solana to organize meetings between the international quartet on the middle east - the eu , un , us and russia - and the arab quartet of egypt , saudi arabia , the united arab emirates and jordan , the spokeswoman said . ministers voiced optimism at their first get-together since the riyadh deal , which has been rejected by israel in its current form .

officers came across them several days later .

instead of using a car or bike , nissen sets off each day in a boat .
the 57-year old brings mail to the northern german halligen islands . it 's around 9 a.m. and like almost every morning for the past 30 years , fide nissen can be found with his cargo at the ferry station in northern german schlüttsiel .
his job is to deliver mail to approximately 160 residents of the halligen islands . everything - letters , newspapers and packages - gets stashed each morning in the boat 's waterproof cabin for its journey from the mainland .
the group of 10 small islands , unprotected by dykes , sit off the north friesland coast near denmark . there 's not much about the operation that looks like a traditional postal service - least of all its captain .
nissen looks more like a fisherman , with his beard , the waterproof clothes and the captain 's hat . happily afloat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mail delivery ship jobs are hard to come by on the small islands , which are often flooded by storms .
when he got the offer to be a mail captain in 1977 , he did n't hesitate .
he 's been an aquatic postman ever since . " since i love to be on the water and fish , i 've got my hobby and my job tied together , and of course that 's a fine thing .
naturally , summer days are nicer than winter ones , but you get through it , " nissen said . nissen commandeers an eight-meter-long -lrb- 26-feet -rrb- rescue cruiser with a 40-horsepower motor .
weather permitting , he heads out six times each week . on his daily tour , nissen maintains radio contact with his wife so he knows what jobs are waiting for him on shore and also for safety purposes .
additionally , he has a high-frequency marine radio with him , so that he can reach other ships in an emergency . nissen heads towards the island oland where he leaves letters and packages in a small postal box below a thatched roof house .
nissen is responsible for getting the mail to the islands , but not for actually delivering it .
he takes the outgoing mail under his arm and heads in the direction of the island langeness . it 's a cool spring morning .
the air smells of sea spray and on the horizon you can see the island dwellings that have been built on stilts to protect them from flooding . after two hours , we arrive at langeness , where nissen lives .
postal carrier liv schladenhaufen waits for him at the landing .
the 100 pieces of mail are sorted in an old milking parlor while sheep bleat outside .
for nissen , the day has only begun .
the letter carrier works on his parents ' farm .
he rents out holiday homes and is also involved in an acting group . staying connected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unusual cargo these days , the mail arrives more quickly than to many large german cities .
the german postal service , deutsche post , does n't charge extra to send letters to the islands .
it also does n't matter if the islands lack street names or house numbers . officially , there are house numbers . " companies had problems with their computers when someone ordered something but did n't have a house number , " schladenhaufen said .
" so most people have a zero or a one .
eventually house numbers were allotted . " with or without house numbers , there 's been mail delivery by boat to the islands for around 200 years .
if it 's up to lageness mayor boy andresen , it 'll stay that way .
even with e-mail and fax services . " when there 's mail , it will be delivered .
with the postal services here , we 're very happy .
it ca n't get any better , " he said . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's deutsche post wants europe to open markets deutsche post 's monopoly on letter delivery will end next year .

german motorists bent on revenge have begun setting speed cameras mounted on poles on fire .
some have even taken to shooting at them with guns , pelting them with rocks or sawing them off their poles . the fury of a german driver caught speeding knows no bounds .
and the roadside devices used in germany to catch speeders may just be in for some harsh treatment as a result . some speed demons get so angry , they 'll do anything to avoid prosecution , as police in the harz mountains town of osterode discovered recently . in order to avoid being charged , one speeding driver stopped his car long enough to rip out all the speed limit signs he could find along a stretch of road and tossed them into a nearby ditch .

" it 's not the first person to make saber-rattling comments , " said beckett .
" i do n't think it 's helpful , " she added . a diplomatic note from iran to british authorities released friday condemned the " illegal act " by british naval staff in the gulf but did not call for an apology . beckett said : " i think everyone regrets that this position has arisen .
what we want is a way out of it , we want it peacefully and we want it as soon as possible .
we would like to be told where our personnel are ; we would like to be given access to them ; but we want it resolved , " beckett added . she said , however , she feared the current holiday period in iran might delay the diplomatic proceedings .
iran remains steadfast iran has so far refused to bow to mounting international pressure to release the naval personnel , who are being held in a secret location and are occasionally shown on television allegedly confessing to having entered iranian waters .

" we did hope that something might have happened during the night on the basis of bilateral relations between the united kingdom and iran but it did not happen , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier had hoped for movement friday night steinmeier added that a solution must be found " before the sailors and marines are sentenced , because that is what could happen to them , " he said .
iranian ambassador denies comments however , the iranian ambassador reported to have made the comments , gholam reza ansari , told iran 's state news agency irna that he was misquoted by russian television when he said tehran might put them on trial . " the network has made a mistake in translating the comments about detained british personnel and has reported the possibility of their trial , " he said , referring to an interview he had given on friday to vesti-24 television . iran on saturday again warned britain against politicizing the seizure of its 15 navy personnel , saying it could complicate efforts to resolve the escalating crisis . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu tells iran to release british sailors " immediately " eu foreign ministers , meeting in germany , sent a message of solidarity with britain over iran 's detention of 15 british naval personnel .

" it 's not the first person to make saber-rattling comments , " said beckett .
" i do n't think it 's helpful , " she added . a diplomatic note from iran to british authorities released friday condemned the " illegal act " by british naval staff in the gulf but did not call for an apology . beckett said : " i think everyone regrets that this position has arisen .
what we want is a way out of it , we want it peacefully and we want it as soon as possible .
we would like to be told where our personnel are ; we would like to be given access to them ; but we want it resolved , " beckett added . she said , however , she feared the current holiday period in iran might delay the diplomatic proceedings .
iran remains steadfast iran has so far refused to bow to mounting international pressure to release the naval personnel , who are being held in a secret location and are occasionally shown on television allegedly confessing to having entered iranian waters .

" we did hope that something might have happened during the night on the basis of bilateral relations between the united kingdom and iran but it did not happen , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier had hoped for movement friday night steinmeier added that a solution must be found " before the sailors and marines are sentenced , because that is what could happen to them , " he said .
iranian ambassador denies comments however , the iranian ambassador reported to have made the comments , gholam reza ansari , told iran 's state news agency irna that he was misquoted by russian television when he said tehran might put them on trial . " the network has made a mistake in translating the comments about detained british personnel and has reported the possibility of their trial , " he said , referring to an interview he had given on friday to vesti-24 television . iran on saturday again warned britain against politicizing the seizure of its 15 navy personnel , saying it could complicate efforts to resolve the escalating crisis . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu tells iran to release british sailors " immediately " eu foreign ministers , meeting in germany , sent a message of solidarity with britain over iran 's detention of 15 british naval personnel .

german motorists bent on revenge have begun setting speed cameras mounted on poles on fire .
some have even taken to shooting at them with guns , pelting them with rocks or sawing them off their poles . the fury of a german driver caught speeding knows no bounds .
and the roadside devices used in germany to catch speeders may just be in for some harsh treatment as a result . some speed demons get so angry , they 'll do anything to avoid prosecution , as police in the harz mountains town of osterode discovered recently . in order to avoid being charged , one speeding driver stopped his car long enough to rip out all the speed limit signs he could find along a stretch of road and tossed them into a nearby ditch .
officers came across them several days later . " it was probably someone caught by a camera while speeding on the b 243 highway , " a police spokesman said , pointing out that countless other speeding motorists had probably slipped through the net in the days that followed since they could rightly claim that no speed limit signs were visible . the fury of a speeder scorned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some speed limit signs land in the graveyard after speeders ' antics police have not given up hope of catching the sign-destroyers who will face heavy fines once caught - just like the one handed down to a 75-year-old pensioner convicted recently by a court in the city of goslar . despite a previous conviction for firing bullets at a radar speed trap in fulda , the elderly man hurled stones at a pole-mounted camera after it had snapped a picture of him while speeding .
unfortunately for him , the outburst was recorded on film , too . meanwhile , an unknown driver destroyed a speed camera in the harz region by dousing it with petrol and setting it alight . the culprits behind these acts of highway vandalism are still at large , such as is the man in göttingen whose method of avoiding a speeding prosecution was exceptionally thorough .
he dismantled an entire surveillance camera system installed at a traffic light and took the device worth 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 27,000 -rrb- away with him . a 22-year-old man from the peine area had to wave goodbye to his driving license and was fined heavily after repeatedly hurtling past a speed camera while making an obscene gesture with his middle finger .
the motorist had taped over the car 's registration plate in a bid to escape identification and it was only after he was involved in an accident that police managed to track him down . following the dna trail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speeding motorists can get rude a speed trap installation on the a 44 highway near kassel also became a hate object for a number of motorists .
the first device was stolen by traffic rowdies , while a 19-year-old took an axe to its replacement .
police found the perpetrator by matching the dna of blood traces left at the scene of the crime . many drivers do not actually view the cameras as a deterrent to speeding but as a way for local authorities to stuff their pockets . indeed , fining motorists for driving too fast is a lucrative source of income .
in the german state of hesse , for example it brings in more than a million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- a year . the speed traps also pay for themselves quickly .
one camera near the small town of hildesheim registered more than 5,000 speeding motorists during its first two months on the job - triggering an income of 45,000 euros in fines . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany skeptical about environmental speed limits german politicians scoffed at the idea that speed limits on the country 's autobahns would prevent global warming .
yet the recent european interest in climate change has the german auto industry worried about its image .

instead of using a car or bike , nissen sets off each day in a boat .
the 57-year old brings mail to the northern german halligen islands . it 's around 9 a.m. and like almost every morning for the past 30 years , fide nissen can be found with his cargo at the ferry station in northern german schlüttsiel .
his job is to deliver mail to approximately 160 residents of the halligen islands . everything - letters , newspapers and packages - gets stashed each morning in the boat 's waterproof cabin for its journey from the mainland .
the group of 10 small islands , unprotected by dykes , sit off the north friesland coast near denmark . there 's not much about the operation that looks like a traditional postal service - least of all its captain .
nissen looks more like a fisherman , with his beard , the waterproof clothes and the captain 's hat . happily afloat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mail delivery ship jobs are hard to come by on the small islands , which are often flooded by storms .
when he got the offer to be a mail captain in 1977 , he did n't hesitate .
he 's been an aquatic postman ever since . " since i love to be on the water and fish , i 've got my hobby and my job tied together , and of course that 's a fine thing .
naturally , summer days are nicer than winter ones , but you get through it , " nissen said . nissen commandeers an eight-meter-long -lrb- 26-feet -rrb- rescue cruiser with a 40-horsepower motor .
weather permitting , he heads out six times each week . on his daily tour , nissen maintains radio contact with his wife so he knows what jobs are waiting for him on shore and also for safety purposes .
additionally , he has a high-frequency marine radio with him , so that he can reach other ships in an emergency . nissen heads towards the island oland where he leaves letters and packages in a small postal box below a thatched roof house .
nissen is responsible for getting the mail to the islands , but not for actually delivering it .
he takes the outgoing mail under his arm and heads in the direction of the island langeness . it 's a cool spring morning .
the air smells of sea spray and on the horizon you can see the island dwellings that have been built on stilts to protect them from flooding . after two hours , we arrive at langeness , where nissen lives .
postal carrier liv schladenhaufen waits for him at the landing .
the 100 pieces of mail are sorted in an old milking parlor while sheep bleat outside .
for nissen , the day has only begun .
the letter carrier works on his parents ' farm .
he rents out holiday homes and is also involved in an acting group . staying connected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unusual cargo these days , the mail arrives more quickly than to many large german cities .
the german postal service , deutsche post , does n't charge extra to send letters to the islands .
it also does n't matter if the islands lack street names or house numbers . officially , there are house numbers . " companies had problems with their computers when someone ordered something but did n't have a house number , " schladenhaufen said .
" so most people have a zero or a one .
eventually house numbers were allotted . " with or without house numbers , there 's been mail delivery by boat to the islands for around 200 years .
if it 's up to lageness mayor boy andresen , it 'll stay that way .
even with e-mail and fax services . " when there 's mail , it will be delivered .
with the postal services here , we 're very happy .
it ca n't get any better , " he said . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's deutsche post wants europe to open markets deutsche post 's monopoly on letter delivery will end next year .

" with nine points difference between us and schalke 04 , we need a miracle if we are to be crowned champions , especially with just eight matches remaining , " makaay told the club web site .
" we have three teams ahead of us , and aside from that we also have the champions league quarter-final . " makaay , who has scored 74 times including 12 this season for bayern in the bundesliga since he signed for 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.6 million -rrb- in 2003 , admitted that they needed to pull something out of what has been a generally disappointing season by their high standards .

the holder of 29 croatian caps was due to make a decision on his playing career based on the operation 's success .
with the operation going well , bremen will hope to retain his services . " the transplantation was successful , my body has accepted my father 's kidney " he told the croatian jutarnji list daily .
" i did not want to go public with the new surgery before the doctors were sure that my body has accepted the new organ , " he added . " thank god everything is okay now .

german motorists bent on revenge have begun setting speed cameras mounted on poles on fire .
some have even taken to shooting at them with guns , pelting them with rocks or sawing them off their poles . the fury of a german driver caught speeding knows no bounds .
and the roadside devices used in germany to catch speeders may just be in for some harsh treatment as a result . some speed demons get so angry , they 'll do anything to avoid prosecution , as police in the harz mountains town of osterode discovered recently . in order to avoid being charged , one speeding driver stopped his car long enough to rip out all the speed limit signs he could find along a stretch of road and tossed them into a nearby ditch .
officers came across them several days later . " it was probably someone caught by a camera while speeding on the b 243 highway , " a police spokesman said , pointing out that countless other speeding motorists had probably slipped through the net in the days that followed since they could rightly claim that no speed limit signs were visible . the fury of a speeder scorned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some speed limit signs land in the graveyard after speeders ' antics police have not given up hope of catching the sign-destroyers who will face heavy fines once caught - just like the one handed down to a 75-year-old pensioner convicted recently by a court in the city of goslar . despite a previous conviction for firing bullets at a radar speed trap in fulda , the elderly man hurled stones at a pole-mounted camera after it had snapped a picture of him while speeding .
unfortunately for him , the outburst was recorded on film , too . meanwhile , an unknown driver destroyed a speed camera in the harz region by dousing it with petrol and setting it alight . the culprits behind these acts of highway vandalism are still at large , such as is the man in göttingen whose method of avoiding a speeding prosecution was exceptionally thorough .
he dismantled an entire surveillance camera system installed at a traffic light and took the device worth 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 27,000 -rrb- away with him . a 22-year-old man from the peine area had to wave goodbye to his driving license and was fined heavily after repeatedly hurtling past a speed camera while making an obscene gesture with his middle finger .
the motorist had taped over the car 's registration plate in a bid to escape identification and it was only after he was involved in an accident that police managed to track him down . following the dna trail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speeding motorists can get rude a speed trap installation on the a 44 highway near kassel also became a hate object for a number of motorists .
the first device was stolen by traffic rowdies , while a 19-year-old took an axe to its replacement .
police found the perpetrator by matching the dna of blood traces left at the scene of the crime . many drivers do not actually view the cameras as a deterrent to speeding but as a way for local authorities to stuff their pockets . indeed , fining motorists for driving too fast is a lucrative source of income .

instead of using a car or bike , nissen sets off each day in a boat .
the 57-year old brings mail to the northern german halligen islands . it 's around 9 a.m. and like almost every morning for the past 30 years , fide nissen can be found with his cargo at the ferry station in northern german schlüttsiel .
his job is to deliver mail to approximately 160 residents of the halligen islands . everything - letters , newspapers and packages - gets stashed each morning in the boat 's waterproof cabin for its journey from the mainland .
the group of 10 small islands , unprotected by dykes , sit off the north friesland coast near denmark . there 's not much about the operation that looks like a traditional postal service - least of all its captain .
nissen looks more like a fisherman , with his beard , the waterproof clothes and the captain 's hat . happily afloat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mail delivery ship jobs are hard to come by on the small islands , which are often flooded by storms .
when he got the offer to be a mail captain in 1977 , he did n't hesitate .
he 's been an aquatic postman ever since . " since i love to be on the water and fish , i 've got my hobby and my job tied together , and of course that 's a fine thing .
naturally , summer days are nicer than winter ones , but you get through it , " nissen said . nissen commandeers an eight-meter-long -lrb- 26-feet -rrb- rescue cruiser with a 40-horsepower motor .
weather permitting , he heads out six times each week . on his daily tour , nissen maintains radio contact with his wife so he knows what jobs are waiting for him on shore and also for safety purposes .
additionally , he has a high-frequency marine radio with him , so that he can reach other ships in an emergency . nissen heads towards the island oland where he leaves letters and packages in a small postal box below a thatched roof house .
nissen is responsible for getting the mail to the islands , but not for actually delivering it .
he takes the outgoing mail under his arm and heads in the direction of the island langeness . it 's a cool spring morning .
the air smells of sea spray and on the horizon you can see the island dwellings that have been built on stilts to protect them from flooding . after two hours , we arrive at langeness , where nissen lives .
postal carrier liv schladenhaufen waits for him at the landing .
the 100 pieces of mail are sorted in an old milking parlor while sheep bleat outside .
for nissen , the day has only begun .
the letter carrier works on his parents ' farm .
he rents out holiday homes and is also involved in an acting group . staying connected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unusual cargo these days , the mail arrives more quickly than to many large german cities .
the german postal service , deutsche post , does n't charge extra to send letters to the islands .
it also does n't matter if the islands lack street names or house numbers . officially , there are house numbers . " companies had problems with their computers when someone ordered something but did n't have a house number , " schladenhaufen said .
" so most people have a zero or a one .
eventually house numbers were allotted . " with or without house numbers , there 's been mail delivery by boat to the islands for around 200 years .
if it 's up to lageness mayor boy andresen , it 'll stay that way .
even with e-mail and fax services . " when there 's mail , it will be delivered .
with the postal services here , we 're very happy .
it ca n't get any better , " he said . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's deutsche post wants europe to open markets deutsche post 's monopoly on letter delivery will end next year .

german motorists bent on revenge have begun setting speed cameras mounted on poles on fire .
some have even taken to shooting at them with guns , pelting them with rocks or sawing them off their poles . the fury of a german driver caught speeding knows no bounds .
and the roadside devices used in germany to catch speeders may just be in for some harsh treatment as a result . some speed demons get so angry , they 'll do anything to avoid prosecution , as police in the harz mountains town of osterode discovered recently . in order to avoid being charged , one speeding driver stopped his car long enough to rip out all the speed limit signs he could find along a stretch of road and tossed them into a nearby ditch .
officers came across them several days later . " it was probably someone caught by a camera while speeding on the b 243 highway , " a police spokesman said , pointing out that countless other speeding motorists had probably slipped through the net in the days that followed since they could rightly claim that no speed limit signs were visible . the fury of a speeder scorned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some speed limit signs land in the graveyard after speeders ' antics police have not given up hope of catching the sign-destroyers who will face heavy fines once caught - just like the one handed down to a 75-year-old pensioner convicted recently by a court in the city of goslar . despite a previous conviction for firing bullets at a radar speed trap in fulda , the elderly man hurled stones at a pole-mounted camera after it had snapped a picture of him while speeding .
unfortunately for him , the outburst was recorded on film , too . meanwhile , an unknown driver destroyed a speed camera in the harz region by dousing it with petrol and setting it alight . the culprits behind these acts of highway vandalism are still at large , such as is the man in göttingen whose method of avoiding a speeding prosecution was exceptionally thorough .
he dismantled an entire surveillance camera system installed at a traffic light and took the device worth 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 27,000 -rrb- away with him . a 22-year-old man from the peine area had to wave goodbye to his driving license and was fined heavily after repeatedly hurtling past a speed camera while making an obscene gesture with his middle finger .
the motorist had taped over the car 's registration plate in a bid to escape identification and it was only after he was involved in an accident that police managed to track him down . following the dna trail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speeding motorists can get rude a speed trap installation on the a 44 highway near kassel also became a hate object for a number of motorists .
the first device was stolen by traffic rowdies , while a 19-year-old took an axe to its replacement .
police found the perpetrator by matching the dna of blood traces left at the scene of the crime . many drivers do not actually view the cameras as a deterrent to speeding but as a way for local authorities to stuff their pockets . indeed , fining motorists for driving too fast is a lucrative source of income .
in the german state of hesse , for example it brings in more than a million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- a year . the speed traps also pay for themselves quickly .
one camera near the small town of hildesheim registered more than 5,000 speeding motorists during its first two months on the job - triggering an income of 45,000 euros in fines . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany skeptical about environmental speed limits german politicians scoffed at the idea that speed limits on the country 's autobahns would prevent global warming .
yet the recent european interest in climate change has the german auto industry worried about its image .
-lrb- 12.03.2007 -rrb- pedal to the metal ?
the richer , the faster a new survey out shows motorists ' speeds on german freeways is largely in line with their bank balances .
those earning more tend to push the speedometer to the red line .

instead of using a car or bike , nissen sets off each day in a boat .
the 57-year old brings mail to the northern german halligen islands . it 's around 9 a.m. and like almost every morning for the past 30 years , fide nissen can be found with his cargo at the ferry station in northern german schlüttsiel .
his job is to deliver mail to approximately 160 residents of the halligen islands . everything - letters , newspapers and packages - gets stashed each morning in the boat 's waterproof cabin for its journey from the mainland .
the group of 10 small islands , unprotected by dykes , sit off the north friesland coast near denmark . there 's not much about the operation that looks like a traditional postal service - least of all its captain .
nissen looks more like a fisherman , with his beard , the waterproof clothes and the captain 's hat . happily afloat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mail delivery ship jobs are hard to come by on the small islands , which are often flooded by storms .
when he got the offer to be a mail captain in 1977 , he did n't hesitate .
he 's been an aquatic postman ever since . " since i love to be on the water and fish , i 've got my hobby and my job tied together , and of course that 's a fine thing .
naturally , summer days are nicer than winter ones , but you get through it , " nissen said . nissen commandeers an eight-meter-long -lrb- 26-feet -rrb- rescue cruiser with a 40-horsepower motor .
weather permitting , he heads out six times each week . on his daily tour , nissen maintains radio contact with his wife so he knows what jobs are waiting for him on shore and also for safety purposes .
additionally , he has a high-frequency marine radio with him , so that he can reach other ships in an emergency . nissen heads towards the island oland where he leaves letters and packages in a small postal box below a thatched roof house .
nissen is responsible for getting the mail to the islands , but not for actually delivering it .
he takes the outgoing mail under his arm and heads in the direction of the island langeness . it 's a cool spring morning .
the air smells of sea spray and on the horizon you can see the island dwellings that have been built on stilts to protect them from flooding . after two hours , we arrive at langeness , where nissen lives .
postal carrier liv schladenhaufen waits for him at the landing .
the 100 pieces of mail are sorted in an old milking parlor while sheep bleat outside .
for nissen , the day has only begun .
the letter carrier works on his parents ' farm .
he rents out holiday homes and is also involved in an acting group . staying connected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unusual cargo these days , the mail arrives more quickly than to many large german cities .
the german postal service , deutsche post , does n't charge extra to send letters to the islands .
it also does n't matter if the islands lack street names or house numbers . officially , there are house numbers . " companies had problems with their computers when someone ordered something but did n't have a house number , " schladenhaufen said .
" so most people have a zero or a one .
eventually house numbers were allotted . " with or without house numbers , there 's been mail delivery by boat to the islands for around 200 years .
if it 's up to lageness mayor boy andresen , it 'll stay that way .
even with e-mail and fax services . " when there 's mail , it will be delivered .
with the postal services here , we 're very happy .
it ca n't get any better , " he said . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's deutsche post wants europe to open markets deutsche post 's monopoly on letter delivery will end next year .

german motorists bent on revenge have begun setting speed cameras mounted on poles on fire .

the foundation behind it says the pictures are meant to provoke in order to bring the issue of hiv back into focus . in one of the campaign 's posters , a woman dressed in only black panties and high heels kneels in front of a naked man .
but in place of his penis , the barrel of a silver pistol is in her mouth .
the text accompanying the photo : " there 's only .003 mm latex between life and death .

" young people especially have lost sight of the problem . " she and many health care experts say hiv and aids have largely disappeared from the public 's consciousness .
drug therapies developed in the 1990s that have mitigated the worst effects of the disease and lengthened the lives of many have led to the widespread opinion that hiv / aids is no longer as serious as it once was .
that , in turn , has led to an increase in unsafe sexual practices that can transmit hiv infection . the campaign 's photographs have already appeared in several german newspapers and the foundation has produced an informational spot that will air on television and be shown in cinemas . growing infection rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hiv is neither pretty nor harmless medical experts in germany have been alarmed by a recent increase in new hiv infections in the country .
according to the robert koch institute , germany 's center for public health and disease control , 2,700 people in germany became infected in 2006 , a 7.4 percent increase over the previous year . that follows a 20 percent increase in new hiv infections in the first half of 2005 compared with the first half of 2004 . the institute estimates that around 56,000 people in germany are living with hiv . michael stich , who won a wimbledon title in 1991 , started his foundation 13 years ago .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.03.2007 new german hiv / aids campaign pushes the envelope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the images of the new hiv prevention campaign sometimes jar - that 's the point a new campaign to raise awareness about hiv infection uses shock tactics to get its message across .
the foundation behind it says the pictures are meant to provoke in order to bring the issue of hiv back into focus . in one of the campaign 's posters , a woman dressed in only black panties and high heels kneels in front of a naked man .
but in place of his penis , the barrel of a silver pistol is in her mouth .
the text accompanying the photo : " there 's only .003 mm latex between life and death . " the picture is one of a series of sometimes disconcerting images that have been launched by the michael stich foundation , a group founded by former tennis professional stich that focuses on hiv / aids awareness and works extensively with hiv-infected children in german-speaking countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this baby got hiv from mommy , the text says another one of the campaign 's posters shows an infant 's face in close-up with the words , " the chin is grandpa 's .
the eyes are daddy 's .
the hiv is from mommy . " " the pictures are meant to provoke , " linda von neree , an employee of the stich foundation , told the online site of the daily die welt .
" young people especially have lost sight of the problem . " she and many health care experts say hiv and aids have largely disappeared from the public 's consciousness .
drug therapies developed in the 1990s that have mitigated the worst effects of the disease and lengthened the lives of many have led to the widespread opinion that hiv / aids is no longer as serious as it once was .
that , in turn , has led to an increase in unsafe sexual practices that can transmit hiv infection . the campaign 's photographs have already appeared in several german newspapers and the foundation has produced an informational spot that will air on television and be shown in cinemas . growing infection rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hiv is neither pretty nor harmless medical experts in germany have been alarmed by a recent increase in new hiv infections in the country .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.03.2007 new german hiv / aids campaign pushes the envelope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the images of the new hiv prevention campaign sometimes jar - that 's the point a new campaign to raise awareness about hiv infection uses shock tactics to get its message across .
the foundation behind it says the pictures are meant to provoke in order to bring the issue of hiv back into focus . in one of the campaign 's posters , a woman dressed in only black panties and high heels kneels in front of a naked man .
but in place of his penis , the barrel of a silver pistol is in her mouth .
the text accompanying the photo : " there 's only .003 mm latex between life and death . " the picture is one of a series of sometimes disconcerting images that have been launched by the michael stich foundation , a group founded by former tennis professional stich that focuses on hiv / aids awareness and works extensively with hiv-infected children in german-speaking countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this baby got hiv from mommy , the text says another one of the campaign 's posters shows an infant 's face in close-up with the words , " the chin is grandpa 's .
the eyes are daddy 's .
the hiv is from mommy . " " the pictures are meant to provoke , " linda von neree , an employee of the stich foundation , told the online site of the daily die welt .
" young people especially have lost sight of the problem . " she and many health care experts say hiv and aids have largely disappeared from the public 's consciousness .
drug therapies developed in the 1990s that have mitigated the worst effects of the disease and lengthened the lives of many have led to the widespread opinion that hiv / aids is no longer as serious as it once was .
that , in turn , has led to an increase in unsafe sexual practices that can transmit hiv infection . the campaign 's photographs have already appeared in several german newspapers and the foundation has produced an informational spot that will air on television and be shown in cinemas . growing infection rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hiv is neither pretty nor harmless medical experts in germany have been alarmed by a recent increase in new hiv infections in the country .
according to the robert koch institute , germany 's center for public health and disease control , 2,700 people in germany became infected in 2006 , a 7.4 percent increase over the previous year . that follows a 20 percent increase in new hiv infections in the first half of 2005 compared with the first half of 2004 . the institute estimates that around 56,000 people in germany are living with hiv . michael stich , who won a wimbledon title in 1991 , started his foundation 13 years ago .
in addition to the current print and television campaign , the group is running an educational program in schools to teach kids about hiv prevention . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german aids action plan aims to revive awareness the german cabinet approved a national action plan against the spread of hiv and aids , which focuses on increased preventive measures and research into new strains of drug-resistant viruses .
-lrb- 08.03.2007 -rrb- " we are all equally responsible for containing this disease " dr. luis carlos escobar pinzon is nearing his first anniversary at the head of german umbrella group deutsche aidshilfe -lrb- dah -rrb- .

the foundation behind it says the pictures are meant to provoke in order to bring the issue of hiv back into focus . in one of the campaign 's posters , a woman dressed in only black panties and high heels kneels in front of a naked man .
but in place of his penis , the barrel of a silver pistol is in her mouth .
the text accompanying the photo : " there 's only .003 mm latex between life and death .

german motorists bent on revenge have begun setting speed cameras mounted on poles on fire .
some have even taken to shooting at them with guns , pelting them with rocks or sawing them off their poles . the fury of a german driver caught speeding knows no bounds .
and the roadside devices used in germany to catch speeders may just be in for some harsh treatment as a result . some speed demons get so angry , they 'll do anything to avoid prosecution , as police in the harz mountains town of osterode discovered recently . in order to avoid being charged , one speeding driver stopped his car long enough to rip out all the speed limit signs he could find along a stretch of road and tossed them into a nearby ditch .
officers came across them several days later . " it was probably someone caught by a camera while speeding on the b 243 highway , " a police spokesman said , pointing out that countless other speeding motorists had probably slipped through the net in the days that followed since they could rightly claim that no speed limit signs were visible . the fury of a speeder scorned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some speed limit signs land in the graveyard after speeders ' antics police have not given up hope of catching the sign-destroyers who will face heavy fines once caught - just like the one handed down to a 75-year-old pensioner convicted recently by a court in the city of goslar . despite a previous conviction for firing bullets at a radar speed trap in fulda , the elderly man hurled stones at a pole-mounted camera after it had snapped a picture of him while speeding .
unfortunately for him , the outburst was recorded on film , too . meanwhile , an unknown driver destroyed a speed camera in the harz region by dousing it with petrol and setting it alight . the culprits behind these acts of highway vandalism are still at large , such as is the man in göttingen whose method of avoiding a speeding prosecution was exceptionally thorough .
he dismantled an entire surveillance camera system installed at a traffic light and took the device worth 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 27,000 -rrb- away with him . a 22-year-old man from the peine area had to wave goodbye to his driving license and was fined heavily after repeatedly hurtling past a speed camera while making an obscene gesture with his middle finger .
the motorist had taped over the car 's registration plate in a bid to escape identification and it was only after he was involved in an accident that police managed to track him down . following the dna trail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speeding motorists can get rude a speed trap installation on the a 44 highway near kassel also became a hate object for a number of motorists .
the first device was stolen by traffic rowdies , while a 19-year-old took an axe to its replacement .
police found the perpetrator by matching the dna of blood traces left at the scene of the crime . many drivers do not actually view the cameras as a deterrent to speeding but as a way for local authorities to stuff their pockets . indeed , fining motorists for driving too fast is a lucrative source of income .
in the german state of hesse , for example it brings in more than a million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- a year . the speed traps also pay for themselves quickly .
one camera near the small town of hildesheim registered more than 5,000 speeding motorists during its first two months on the job - triggering an income of 45,000 euros in fines . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany skeptical about environmental speed limits german politicians scoffed at the idea that speed limits on the country 's autobahns would prevent global warming .

instead of using a car or bike , nissen sets off each day in a boat .
the 57-year old brings mail to the northern german halligen islands . it 's around 9 a.m. and like almost every morning for the past 30 years , fide nissen can be found with his cargo at the ferry station in northern german schlüttsiel .
his job is to deliver mail to approximately 160 residents of the halligen islands . everything - letters , newspapers and packages - gets stashed each morning in the boat 's waterproof cabin for its journey from the mainland .
the group of 10 small islands , unprotected by dykes , sit off the north friesland coast near denmark . there 's not much about the operation that looks like a traditional postal service - least of all its captain .
nissen looks more like a fisherman , with his beard , the waterproof clothes and the captain 's hat . happily afloat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mail delivery ship jobs are hard to come by on the small islands , which are often flooded by storms .
when he got the offer to be a mail captain in 1977 , he did n't hesitate .
he 's been an aquatic postman ever since . " since i love to be on the water and fish , i 've got my hobby and my job tied together , and of course that 's a fine thing .
naturally , summer days are nicer than winter ones , but you get through it , " nissen said . nissen commandeers an eight-meter-long -lrb- 26-feet -rrb- rescue cruiser with a 40-horsepower motor .
weather permitting , he heads out six times each week . on his daily tour , nissen maintains radio contact with his wife so he knows what jobs are waiting for him on shore and also for safety purposes .
additionally , he has a high-frequency marine radio with him , so that he can reach other ships in an emergency . nissen heads towards the island oland where he leaves letters and packages in a small postal box below a thatched roof house .
nissen is responsible for getting the mail to the islands , but not for actually delivering it .
he takes the outgoing mail under his arm and heads in the direction of the island langeness . it 's a cool spring morning .
the air smells of sea spray and on the horizon you can see the island dwellings that have been built on stilts to protect them from flooding . after two hours , we arrive at langeness , where nissen lives .
postal carrier liv schladenhaufen waits for him at the landing .
the 100 pieces of mail are sorted in an old milking parlor while sheep bleat outside .
for nissen , the day has only begun .
the letter carrier works on his parents ' farm .
he rents out holiday homes and is also involved in an acting group . staying connected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unusual cargo these days , the mail arrives more quickly than to many large german cities .
the german postal service , deutsche post , does n't charge extra to send letters to the islands .
it also does n't matter if the islands lack street names or house numbers . officially , there are house numbers . " companies had problems with their computers when someone ordered something but did n't have a house number , " schladenhaufen said .
" so most people have a zero or a one .
eventually house numbers were allotted . " with or without house numbers , there 's been mail delivery by boat to the islands for around 200 years .
if it 's up to lageness mayor boy andresen , it 'll stay that way .
even with e-mail and fax services . " when there 's mail , it will be delivered .
with the postal services here , we 're very happy .
it ca n't get any better , " he said . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's deutsche post wants europe to open markets deutsche post 's monopoly on letter delivery will end next year .

instead of using a car or bike , nissen sets off each day in a boat .
the 57-year old brings mail to the northern german halligen islands . it 's around 9 a.m. and like almost every morning for the past 30 years , fide nissen can be found with his cargo at the ferry station in northern german schlüttsiel .
his job is to deliver mail to approximately 160 residents of the halligen islands . everything - letters , newspapers and packages - gets stashed each morning in the boat 's waterproof cabin for its journey from the mainland .
the group of 10 small islands , unprotected by dykes , sit off the north friesland coast near denmark . there 's not much about the operation that looks like a traditional postal service - least of all its captain .
nissen looks more like a fisherman , with his beard , the waterproof clothes and the captain 's hat . happily afloat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mail delivery ship jobs are hard to come by on the small islands , which are often flooded by storms .
when he got the offer to be a mail captain in 1977 , he did n't hesitate .
he 's been an aquatic postman ever since . " since i love to be on the water and fish , i 've got my hobby and my job tied together , and of course that 's a fine thing .
naturally , summer days are nicer than winter ones , but you get through it , " nissen said . nissen commandeers an eight-meter-long -lrb- 26-feet -rrb- rescue cruiser with a 40-horsepower motor .
weather permitting , he heads out six times each week . on his daily tour , nissen maintains radio contact with his wife so he knows what jobs are waiting for him on shore and also for safety purposes .
additionally , he has a high-frequency marine radio with him , so that he can reach other ships in an emergency . nissen heads towards the island oland where he leaves letters and packages in a small postal box below a thatched roof house .
nissen is responsible for getting the mail to the islands , but not for actually delivering it .
he takes the outgoing mail under his arm and heads in the direction of the island langeness . it 's a cool spring morning .
the air smells of sea spray and on the horizon you can see the island dwellings that have been built on stilts to protect them from flooding . after two hours , we arrive at langeness , where nissen lives .
postal carrier liv schladenhaufen waits for him at the landing .
the 100 pieces of mail are sorted in an old milking parlor while sheep bleat outside .
for nissen , the day has only begun .
the letter carrier works on his parents ' farm .
he rents out holiday homes and is also involved in an acting group . staying connected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unusual cargo these days , the mail arrives more quickly than to many large german cities .

coach hitzfeld wants longer training camps to get his players ' heads right before crucial games . german champions bayern munich face the biggest game of their domestic season so far when they meet league leaders schalke 04 on saturday .
but ottmar hitzfeld 's fourth-placed team have injury and motivational problems ahead of the match which could do much to determine the destination of the title . bayern will be hoping bastian schweinsteiger 's thigh injury , sustained during germany 's 2-1 victory against the czech republic in a euro 2008 qualifier in prague last saturday , will heal in time for the influential midfielder to feature in the game . hitzfeld said on munich 's web site that the midfielder " is doubtful " for the crucial league match with schalke , which munich need to win if they want to defend their title . hitzfeld prescribes extra training bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzfeld wants his team to spend more time together hitzfeld has planned longer pre-match training camps in a bid to make his players more dedicated in the crucial final weeks of the bundesliga season , the sport bild weekly reported on wednesday . the coach was left fuming after the bavarian giants ' latest setback , the 1-0 defeat at lowly eintracht frankfurt last saturday and wants to address what he said was " a lack of determination in front of the goal and not enough creativity in midfield . " munich have to finish at least third in order to make qualifying for the european champions league a possibility , and hitzfeld is planning camps 48 hours ahead of the games and not 24 hours in a bid to push his players further . " i am thinking about starting the training camps ahead of the matches a day earlier .

" with nine points difference between us and schalke 04 , we need a miracle if we are to be crowned champions , especially with just eight matches remaining , " makaay told the club web site .
" we have three teams ahead of us , and aside from that we also have the champions league quarter-final . " makaay , who has scored 74 times including 12 this season for bayern in the bundesliga since he signed for 20 million euros -lrb- $ 26.6 million -rrb- in 2003 , admitted that they needed to pull something out of what has been a generally disappointing season by their high standards .

the holder of 29 croatian caps was due to make a decision on his playing career based on the operation 's success .
with the operation going well , bremen will hope to retain his services . " the transplantation was successful , my body has accepted my father 's kidney " he told the croatian jutarnji list daily .
" i did not want to go public with the new surgery before the doctors were sure that my body has accepted the new organ , " he added . " thank god everything is okay now .

german motorists bent on revenge have begun setting speed cameras mounted on poles on fire .
some have even taken to shooting at them with guns , pelting them with rocks or sawing them off their poles . the fury of a german driver caught speeding knows no bounds .
and the roadside devices used in germany to catch speeders may just be in for some harsh treatment as a result . some speed demons get so angry , they 'll do anything to avoid prosecution , as police in the harz mountains town of osterode discovered recently . in order to avoid being charged , one speeding driver stopped his car long enough to rip out all the speed limit signs he could find along a stretch of road and tossed them into a nearby ditch .
officers came across them several days later . " it was probably someone caught by a camera while speeding on the b 243 highway , " a police spokesman said , pointing out that countless other speeding motorists had probably slipped through the net in the days that followed since they could rightly claim that no speed limit signs were visible . the fury of a speeder scorned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some speed limit signs land in the graveyard after speeders ' antics police have not given up hope of catching the sign-destroyers who will face heavy fines once caught - just like the one handed down to a 75-year-old pensioner convicted recently by a court in the city of goslar . despite a previous conviction for firing bullets at a radar speed trap in fulda , the elderly man hurled stones at a pole-mounted camera after it had snapped a picture of him while speeding .
unfortunately for him , the outburst was recorded on film , too . meanwhile , an unknown driver destroyed a speed camera in the harz region by dousing it with petrol and setting it alight . the culprits behind these acts of highway vandalism are still at large , such as is the man in göttingen whose method of avoiding a speeding prosecution was exceptionally thorough .
he dismantled an entire surveillance camera system installed at a traffic light and took the device worth 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 27,000 -rrb- away with him . a 22-year-old man from the peine area had to wave goodbye to his driving license and was fined heavily after repeatedly hurtling past a speed camera while making an obscene gesture with his middle finger .
the motorist had taped over the car 's registration plate in a bid to escape identification and it was only after he was involved in an accident that police managed to track him down . following the dna trail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speeding motorists can get rude a speed trap installation on the a 44 highway near kassel also became a hate object for a number of motorists .
the first device was stolen by traffic rowdies , while a 19-year-old took an axe to its replacement .
police found the perpetrator by matching the dna of blood traces left at the scene of the crime . many drivers do not actually view the cameras as a deterrent to speeding but as a way for local authorities to stuff their pockets . indeed , fining motorists for driving too fast is a lucrative source of income .
in the german state of hesse , for example it brings in more than a million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- a year . the speed traps also pay for themselves quickly .
one camera near the small town of hildesheim registered more than 5,000 speeding motorists during its first two months on the job - triggering an income of 45,000 euros in fines . dw staff / dpa -lrb- als -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany skeptical about environmental speed limits german politicians scoffed at the idea that speed limits on the country 's autobahns would prevent global warming .
yet the recent european interest in climate change has the german auto industry worried about its image .

but ottmar hitzfeld 's fourth-placed team have injury and motivational problems ahead of the match which could do much to determine the destination of the title . bayern will be hoping bastian schweinsteiger 's thigh injury , sustained during germany 's 2-1 victory against the czech republic in a euro 2008 qualifier in prague last saturday , will heal in time for the influential midfielder to feature in the game . hitzfeld said on munich 's web site that the midfielder " is doubtful " for the crucial league match with schalke , which munich need to win if they want to defend their title . hitzfeld prescribes extra training bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hitzfeld wants his team to spend more time together hitzfeld has planned longer pre-match training camps in a bid to make his players more dedicated in the crucial final weeks of the bundesliga season , the sport bild weekly reported on wednesday . the coach was left fuming after the bavarian giants ' latest setback , the 1-0 defeat at lowly eintracht frankfurt last saturday and wants to address what he said was " a lack of determination in front of the goal and not enough creativity in midfield . " munich have to finish at least third in order to make qualifying for the european champions league a possibility , and hitzfeld is planning camps 48 hours ahead of the games and not 24 hours in a bid to push his players further . " i am thinking about starting the training camps ahead of the matches a day earlier .

" it 's not the first person to make saber-rattling comments , " said beckett .
" i do n't think it 's helpful , " she added . a diplomatic note from iran to british authorities released friday condemned the " illegal act " by british naval staff in the gulf but did not call for an apology . beckett said : " i think everyone regrets that this position has arisen .
what we want is a way out of it , we want it peacefully and we want it as soon as possible .
we would like to be told where our personnel are ; we would like to be given access to them ; but we want it resolved , " beckett added . she said , however , she feared the current holiday period in iran might delay the diplomatic proceedings .
iran remains steadfast iran has so far refused to bow to mounting international pressure to release the naval personnel , who are being held in a secret location and are occasionally shown on television allegedly confessing to having entered iranian waters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somme iranians have called for drastic measures against the sailors britain insists they were in iraqi waters when they were seized . beckett said there had been contact with the iranian side but gave no details . " i 'm sure that at some point our ambassador will have been in contact , " she said , stressing britain 's willingness " to engage in dialogue and discussion " . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told the post eu-meeting press conference that he had hoped a solution would have come from british-iran contacts overnight friday . " we did hope that something might have happened during the night on the basis of bilateral relations between the united kingdom and iran but it did not happen , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier had hoped for movement friday night steinmeier added that a solution must be found " before the sailors and marines are sentenced , because that is what could happen to them , " he said .
iranian ambassador denies comments however , the iranian ambassador reported to have made the comments , gholam reza ansari , told iran 's state news agency irna that he was misquoted by russian television when he said tehran might put them on trial . " the network has made a mistake in translating the comments about detained british personnel and has reported the possibility of their trial , " he said , referring to an interview he had given on friday to vesti-24 television . iran on saturday again warned britain against politicizing the seizure of its 15 navy personnel , saying it could complicate efforts to resolve the escalating crisis . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu tells iran to release british sailors " immediately " eu foreign ministers , meeting in germany , sent a message of solidarity with britain over iran 's detention of 15 british naval personnel .

hope for future peace the arab blueprint offers israel full normalization of relations if it withdraws from all land occupied in the 1967 war and allows the creation of a palestinian state and the return of palestinian refugees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert appears to see the possibility of peace though israel rejected the plan , prime minister ehud olmert said in interviews published friday that the jewish state could clinch global peace with its enemies within five years . on the final day of their meeting , the eu ministers were briefed by solana on his discussions at the arab league summit . the eu ministers also discussed how to deal with the new palestinian government , which includes ministers from the militant muslim hamas and the moderate fatah groups . so far the unity government has not accepted the conditions fixed by the international quartet for full renewed engagement - renunciation of violence , recognition of israel and abiding by past agreements .
eu deals with non-hamas officials solana , who hailed a " new arab consensus , " set the tone for relations with the palestinian unity government by talking in riyadh to the non-hamas president , mahmud abbas , and foreign minister , ziad abu amr , but not the hamas prime minister , ismail haniya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu will deal with abbas -lrb- right -rrb- , but not haniyah -lrb- left -rrb- his spokeswoman said the eu had agreed it would work " with the members of the government which are not hamas , in particular abbas , abu amr and the finance minister . " like the united states , the eu considers hamas a terrorist organization and boycotted the hamas-led palestinian administration which preceded the unity government . the eu ministers will also be discussing how to continue sending aid to the palestinians without dealing directly with hamas as well as a possible restructuring of the temporary mechanism to aid " institution building " in the palestinian territories rather than simple social welfare aid .
refugee issue remains as the ministers met , german chancellor angela merkel began a trip to jordan , israel , lebanon and the palestinian territories . she said the arab league agreement had " created a lot of movement . " however , eu diplomats warn that the palestinian refugee issue remains one serious stumbling block to peace . almost 4.5 million palestinian refugees and their descendants live today in dozens of refugee camps across the middle east in precarious conditions . israel vehemently rejects any suggestions of the refugees being allowed to return , arguing that the influx would effectively erase the jewish character of the state . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel embarks on middle east visit amid signs of hope angela merkel leaves saturday on a mideast trip and plans to visit jordan , israel , the palestinian territories and lebanon .

german motorists bent on revenge have begun setting speed cameras mounted on poles on fire .
some have even taken to shooting at them with guns , pelting them with rocks or sawing them off their poles . the fury of a german driver caught speeding knows no bounds .
and the roadside devices used in germany to catch speeders may just be in for some harsh treatment as a result . some speed demons get so angry , they 'll do anything to avoid prosecution , as police in the harz mountains town of osterode discovered recently . in order to avoid being charged , one speeding driver stopped his car long enough to rip out all the speed limit signs he could find along a stretch of road and tossed them into a nearby ditch .
officers came across them several days later . " it was probably someone caught by a camera while speeding on the b 243 highway , " a police spokesman said , pointing out that countless other speeding motorists had probably slipped through the net in the days that followed since they could rightly claim that no speed limit signs were visible . the fury of a speeder scorned bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : some speed limit signs land in the graveyard after speeders ' antics police have not given up hope of catching the sign-destroyers who will face heavy fines once caught - just like the one handed down to a 75-year-old pensioner convicted recently by a court in the city of goslar . despite a previous conviction for firing bullets at a radar speed trap in fulda , the elderly man hurled stones at a pole-mounted camera after it had snapped a picture of him while speeding .
unfortunately for him , the outburst was recorded on film , too . meanwhile , an unknown driver destroyed a speed camera in the harz region by dousing it with petrol and setting it alight . the culprits behind these acts of highway vandalism are still at large , such as is the man in göttingen whose method of avoiding a speeding prosecution was exceptionally thorough .
he dismantled an entire surveillance camera system installed at a traffic light and took the device worth 20,000 euros -lrb- $ 27,000 -rrb- away with him . a 22-year-old man from the peine area had to wave goodbye to his driving license and was fined heavily after repeatedly hurtling past a speed camera while making an obscene gesture with his middle finger .
the motorist had taped over the car 's registration plate in a bid to escape identification and it was only after he was involved in an accident that police managed to track him down . following the dna trail bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : speeding motorists can get rude a speed trap installation on the a 44 highway near kassel also became a hate object for a number of motorists .
the first device was stolen by traffic rowdies , while a 19-year-old took an axe to its replacement .
police found the perpetrator by matching the dna of blood traces left at the scene of the crime . many drivers do not actually view the cameras as a deterrent to speeding but as a way for local authorities to stuff their pockets . indeed , fining motorists for driving too fast is a lucrative source of income .
in the german state of hesse , for example it brings in more than a million euros -lrb- $ 1.3 million -rrb- a year . the speed traps also pay for themselves quickly .

instead of using a car or bike , nissen sets off each day in a boat .
the 57-year old brings mail to the northern german halligen islands . it 's around 9 a.m. and like almost every morning for the past 30 years , fide nissen can be found with his cargo at the ferry station in northern german schlüttsiel .
his job is to deliver mail to approximately 160 residents of the halligen islands . everything - letters , newspapers and packages - gets stashed each morning in the boat 's waterproof cabin for its journey from the mainland .
the group of 10 small islands , unprotected by dykes , sit off the north friesland coast near denmark . there 's not much about the operation that looks like a traditional postal service - least of all its captain .
nissen looks more like a fisherman , with his beard , the waterproof clothes and the captain 's hat . happily afloat bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : mail delivery ship jobs are hard to come by on the small islands , which are often flooded by storms .
when he got the offer to be a mail captain in 1977 , he did n't hesitate .
he 's been an aquatic postman ever since . " since i love to be on the water and fish , i 've got my hobby and my job tied together , and of course that 's a fine thing .
naturally , summer days are nicer than winter ones , but you get through it , " nissen said . nissen commandeers an eight-meter-long -lrb- 26-feet -rrb- rescue cruiser with a 40-horsepower motor .
weather permitting , he heads out six times each week . on his daily tour , nissen maintains radio contact with his wife so he knows what jobs are waiting for him on shore and also for safety purposes .
additionally , he has a high-frequency marine radio with him , so that he can reach other ships in an emergency . nissen heads towards the island oland where he leaves letters and packages in a small postal box below a thatched roof house .
nissen is responsible for getting the mail to the islands , but not for actually delivering it .
he takes the outgoing mail under his arm and heads in the direction of the island langeness . it 's a cool spring morning .
the air smells of sea spray and on the horizon you can see the island dwellings that have been built on stilts to protect them from flooding . after two hours , we arrive at langeness , where nissen lives .
postal carrier liv schladenhaufen waits for him at the landing .
the 100 pieces of mail are sorted in an old milking parlor while sheep bleat outside .
for nissen , the day has only begun .
the letter carrier works on his parents ' farm .
he rents out holiday homes and is also involved in an acting group . staying connected bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : unusual cargo these days , the mail arrives more quickly than to many large german cities .
the german postal service , deutsche post , does n't charge extra to send letters to the islands .
it also does n't matter if the islands lack street names or house numbers . officially , there are house numbers . " companies had problems with their computers when someone ordered something but did n't have a house number , " schladenhaufen said .
" so most people have a zero or a one .
eventually house numbers were allotted . " with or without house numbers , there 's been mail delivery by boat to the islands for around 200 years .
if it 's up to lageness mayor boy andresen , it 'll stay that way .
even with e-mail and fax services . " when there 's mail , it will be delivered .
with the postal services here , we 're very happy .
it ca n't get any better , " he said . daniel scheschkewitz -lrb- th -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de germany 's deutsche post wants europe to open markets deutsche post 's monopoly on letter delivery will end next year .

" there is full support for the riyadh consensus , " said a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana , referring to the agreement reached by the arab league in saudi arabia this week to revive a five-year-old middle east peace plan . " the eu will continue to be extremely proactive to ensure that this window of opportunity is not missed . " the ministers meeting in bremen , germany , also supported a call by solana to organize meetings between the international quartet on the middle east - the eu , un , us and russia - and the arab quartet of egypt , saudi arabia , the united arab emirates and jordan , the spokeswoman said . ministers voiced optimism at their first get-together since the riyadh deal , which has been rejected by israel in its current form . " i take some confidence from the fact that the meeting of the arab league not only took place and showed some result but was also received with a cautious response on the part of the israeli government , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , presiding over the bremen meeting , told reporters . luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn said the arab initiative and the formation of the palestinian unity government were positive moves which lent the possibility of encouraging israel " to take seriously the hand extended by the arabs . "
hope for future peace the arab blueprint offers israel full normalization of relations if it withdraws from all land occupied in the 1967 war and allows the creation of a palestinian state and the return of palestinian refugees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert appears to see the possibility of peace though israel rejected the plan , prime minister ehud olmert said in interviews published friday that the jewish state could clinch global peace with its enemies within five years . on the final day of their meeting , the eu ministers were briefed by solana on his discussions at the arab league summit . the eu ministers also discussed how to deal with the new palestinian government , which includes ministers from the militant muslim hamas and the moderate fatah groups . so far the unity government has not accepted the conditions fixed by the international quartet for full renewed engagement - renunciation of violence , recognition of israel and abiding by past agreements .
eu deals with non-hamas officials solana , who hailed a " new arab consensus , " set the tone for relations with the palestinian unity government by talking in riyadh to the non-hamas president , mahmud abbas , and foreign minister , ziad abu amr , but not the hamas prime minister , ismail haniya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu will deal with abbas -lrb- right -rrb- , but not haniyah -lrb- left -rrb- his spokeswoman said the eu had agreed it would work " with the members of the government which are not hamas , in particular abbas , abu amr and the finance minister . " like the united states , the eu considers hamas a terrorist organization and boycotted the hamas-led palestinian administration which preceded the unity government . the eu ministers will also be discussing how to continue sending aid to the palestinians without dealing directly with hamas as well as a possible restructuring of the temporary mechanism to aid " institution building " in the palestinian territories rather than simple social welfare aid .
refugee issue remains as the ministers met , german chancellor angela merkel began a trip to jordan , israel , lebanon and the palestinian territories . she said the arab league agreement had " created a lot of movement . " however , eu diplomats warn that the palestinian refugee issue remains one serious stumbling block to peace . almost 4.5 million palestinian refugees and their descendants live today in dozens of refugee camps across the middle east in precarious conditions . israel vehemently rejects any suggestions of the refugees being allowed to return , arguing that the influx would effectively erase the jewish character of the state . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de merkel embarks on middle east visit amid signs of hope angela merkel leaves saturday on a mideast trip and plans to visit jordan , israel , the palestinian territories and lebanon .
she hopes to encourage israelis and palestinians to intensify their recently restarted dialog .

bildunterschrift : salihamidzic puts in bayern 's second goal despite larsen 's efforts for schalke stuttgart powers on at home to alemannia aachen , third-placed stuttgart vfb took an early lead when swiss striker marco streller powered his header just past the despairing finger tips of diving goalkeeper stephan straub after 29 minutes . aachen got back on level terms after the break when zambian defender moses sichone put his header just out of reach of stuttgart 's goalkeeper timo hildebrand to make it 1-1 on 59 minutes .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : lauth -lrb- center -rrb- celebrates next to sami khedira , after scoring but stuttgart made sure of the win as benjamin lauth chipped the keeper on 75 minutes before brazilian striker cacau scored an almost identical goal in the 84th minute to seal the 3-1 win . the win leaves them just two points behind bremen and four points away from schalke . closer to safety eintracht frankfurt defender sotirios kyrgiakos gave his side an early 1-0 lead over bottom-side borussia mönchengladbach after 11 minutes , but battling borussia picked up a priceless point thanks to federico insua . the draw keeps them bottom , but they are now only four points from safety . czech midfielder tomas galasek volleyed nuremberg into an early lead at home to hertha berlin in the 15th minute , and the home side extended their lead when midfielder marco engelhardt drove home his shot eight meters out on the hour . berlin gave themselves a life-line when argentinian striker christian gimenez scored on 69 minutes , but still went down 2-1 . two quick goals fired bayer leverkusen into an early 2-0 lead away at mainz 05 .

the foundation behind it says the pictures are meant to provoke in order to bring the issue of hiv back into focus . in one of the campaign 's posters , a woman dressed in only black panties and high heels kneels in front of a naked man .
but in place of his penis , the barrel of a silver pistol is in her mouth .
the text accompanying the photo : " there 's only .003 mm latex between life and death . " the picture is one of a series of sometimes disconcerting images that have been launched by the michael stich foundation , a group founded by former tennis professional stich that focuses on hiv / aids awareness and works extensively with hiv-infected children in german-speaking countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this baby got hiv from mommy , the text says another one of the campaign 's posters shows an infant 's face in close-up with the words , " the chin is grandpa 's .
the eyes are daddy 's .
the hiv is from mommy . " " the pictures are meant to provoke , " linda von neree , an employee of the stich foundation , told the online site of the daily die welt .
" young people especially have lost sight of the problem . " she and many health care experts say hiv and aids have largely disappeared from the public 's consciousness .
drug therapies developed in the 1990s that have mitigated the worst effects of the disease and lengthened the lives of many have led to the widespread opinion that hiv / aids is no longer as serious as it once was .
that , in turn , has led to an increase in unsafe sexual practices that can transmit hiv infection . the campaign 's photographs have already appeared in several german newspapers and the foundation has produced an informational spot that will air on television and be shown in cinemas . growing infection rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hiv is neither pretty nor harmless medical experts in germany have been alarmed by a recent increase in new hiv infections in the country .
according to the robert koch institute , germany 's center for public health and disease control , 2,700 people in germany became infected in 2006 , a 7.4 percent increase over the previous year . that follows a 20 percent increase in new hiv infections in the first half of 2005 compared with the first half of 2004 . the institute estimates that around 56,000 people in germany are living with hiv . michael stich , who won a wimbledon title in 1991 , started his foundation 13 years ago .
in addition to the current print and television campaign , the group is running an educational program in schools to teach kids about hiv prevention . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german aids action plan aims to revive awareness the german cabinet approved a national action plan against the spread of hiv and aids , which focuses on increased preventive measures and research into new strains of drug-resistant viruses .

program guide programs video on demand reception about dw-tv interactive reader response newsletters web tools and services podcasting mobile about dw-world.de germany -pipe- 31.03.2007 new german hiv / aids campaign pushes the envelope großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the images of the new hiv prevention campaign sometimes jar - that 's the point a new campaign to raise awareness about hiv infection uses shock tactics to get its message across .
the foundation behind it says the pictures are meant to provoke in order to bring the issue of hiv back into focus . in one of the campaign 's posters , a woman dressed in only black panties and high heels kneels in front of a naked man .
but in place of his penis , the barrel of a silver pistol is in her mouth .
the text accompanying the photo : " there 's only .003 mm latex between life and death . " the picture is one of a series of sometimes disconcerting images that have been launched by the michael stich foundation , a group founded by former tennis professional stich that focuses on hiv / aids awareness and works extensively with hiv-infected children in german-speaking countries . bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : this baby got hiv from mommy , the text says another one of the campaign 's posters shows an infant 's face in close-up with the words , " the chin is grandpa 's .
the eyes are daddy 's .
the hiv is from mommy . " " the pictures are meant to provoke , " linda von neree , an employee of the stich foundation , told the online site of the daily die welt .
" young people especially have lost sight of the problem . " she and many health care experts say hiv and aids have largely disappeared from the public 's consciousness .
drug therapies developed in the 1990s that have mitigated the worst effects of the disease and lengthened the lives of many have led to the widespread opinion that hiv / aids is no longer as serious as it once was .
that , in turn , has led to an increase in unsafe sexual practices that can transmit hiv infection . the campaign 's photographs have already appeared in several german newspapers and the foundation has produced an informational spot that will air on television and be shown in cinemas . growing infection rates bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : hiv is neither pretty nor harmless medical experts in germany have been alarmed by a recent increase in new hiv infections in the country .
according to the robert koch institute , germany 's center for public health and disease control , 2,700 people in germany became infected in 2006 , a 7.4 percent increase over the previous year . that follows a 20 percent increase in new hiv infections in the first half of 2005 compared with the first half of 2004 . the institute estimates that around 56,000 people in germany are living with hiv . michael stich , who won a wimbledon title in 1991 , started his foundation 13 years ago .
in addition to the current print and television campaign , the group is running an educational program in schools to teach kids about hiv prevention . dw staff -lrb- jam -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de german aids action plan aims to revive awareness the german cabinet approved a national action plan against the spread of hiv and aids , which focuses on increased preventive measures and research into new strains of drug-resistant viruses .

" it 's not the first person to make saber-rattling comments , " said beckett .
" i do n't think it 's helpful , " she added . a diplomatic note from iran to british authorities released friday condemned the " illegal act " by british naval staff in the gulf but did not call for an apology . beckett said : " i think everyone regrets that this position has arisen .
what we want is a way out of it , we want it peacefully and we want it as soon as possible .
we would like to be told where our personnel are ; we would like to be given access to them ; but we want it resolved , " beckett added . she said , however , she feared the current holiday period in iran might delay the diplomatic proceedings .
iran remains steadfast iran has so far refused to bow to mounting international pressure to release the naval personnel , who are being held in a secret location and are occasionally shown on television allegedly confessing to having entered iranian waters .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : somme iranians have called for drastic measures against the sailors britain insists they were in iraqi waters when they were seized . beckett said there had been contact with the iranian side but gave no details . " i 'm sure that at some point our ambassador will have been in contact , " she said , stressing britain 's willingness " to engage in dialogue and discussion " . german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier told the post eu-meeting press conference that he had hoped a solution would have come from british-iran contacts overnight friday . " we did hope that something might have happened during the night on the basis of bilateral relations between the united kingdom and iran but it did not happen , " he said .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : steinmeier had hoped for movement friday night steinmeier added that a solution must be found " before the sailors and marines are sentenced , because that is what could happen to them , " he said .
iranian ambassador denies comments however , the iranian ambassador reported to have made the comments , gholam reza ansari , told iran 's state news agency irna that he was misquoted by russian television when he said tehran might put them on trial . " the network has made a mistake in translating the comments about detained british personnel and has reported the possibility of their trial , " he said , referring to an interview he had given on friday to vesti-24 television . iran on saturday again warned britain against politicizing the seizure of its 15 navy personnel , saying it could complicate efforts to resolve the escalating crisis . dw staff / afp -lrb- ncy -rrb- send us an e-mail » -pipe- send » -pipe- print » more on the topic dw-world.de eu tells iran to release british sailors " immediately " eu foreign ministers , meeting in germany , sent a message of solidarity with britain over iran 's detention of 15 british naval personnel .

" there is full support for the riyadh consensus , " said a spokeswoman for eu foreign policy chief javier solana , referring to the agreement reached by the arab league in saudi arabia this week to revive a five-year-old middle east peace plan . " the eu will continue to be extremely proactive to ensure that this window of opportunity is not missed . " the ministers meeting in bremen , germany , also supported a call by solana to organize meetings between the international quartet on the middle east - the eu , un , us and russia - and the arab quartet of egypt , saudi arabia , the united arab emirates and jordan , the spokeswoman said . ministers voiced optimism at their first get-together since the riyadh deal , which has been rejected by israel in its current form . " i take some confidence from the fact that the meeting of the arab league not only took place and showed some result but was also received with a cautious response on the part of the israeli government , " german foreign minister frank-walter steinmeier , presiding over the bremen meeting , told reporters . luxembourg foreign minister jean asselborn said the arab initiative and the formation of the palestinian unity government were positive moves which lent the possibility of encouraging israel " to take seriously the hand extended by the arabs . "
hope for future peace the arab blueprint offers israel full normalization of relations if it withdraws from all land occupied in the 1967 war and allows the creation of a palestinian state and the return of palestinian refugees .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : olmert appears to see the possibility of peace though israel rejected the plan , prime minister ehud olmert said in interviews published friday that the jewish state could clinch global peace with its enemies within five years . on the final day of their meeting , the eu ministers were briefed by solana on his discussions at the arab league summit . the eu ministers also discussed how to deal with the new palestinian government , which includes ministers from the militant muslim hamas and the moderate fatah groups . so far the unity government has not accepted the conditions fixed by the international quartet for full renewed engagement - renunciation of violence , recognition of israel and abiding by past agreements .
eu deals with non-hamas officials solana , who hailed a " new arab consensus , " set the tone for relations with the palestinian unity government by talking in riyadh to the non-hamas president , mahmud abbas , and foreign minister , ziad abu amr , but not the hamas prime minister , ismail haniya .
bildunterschrift : großansicht des bildes mit der bildunterschrift : the eu will deal with abbas -lrb- right -rrb- , but not haniyah -lrb- left -rrb- his spokeswoman said the eu had agreed it would work " with the members of the government which are not hamas , in particular abbas , abu amr and the finance minister . " like the united states , the eu considers hamas a terrorist organization and boycotted the hamas-led palestinian administration which preceded the unity government . the eu ministers will also be discussing how to continue sending aid to the palestinians without dealing directly with hamas as well as a possible restructuring of the temporary mechanism to aid " institution building " in the palestinian territories rather than simple social welfare aid .

indigenous leaders say the tribes have already suffered untold deaths from diseases contracted from outsiders .
the inter-american commission on human rights judged the risk to these isolated communities so great that it bypassed all the usual procedures .
peru has been given two weeks to take steps to protect the isolated tribes .
if it fails to do so it could ultimately be subject to economic sanctions .
profitable business the pan-american human rights body says that although peru has created reserves for the indigenous communities who live in voluntary isolation , it does nothing to protect them from gangs of illegal loggers who are chopping down the mahogany-rich forests in which they live .
indigenous leaders say several loggers have been killed in confrontations with the tribes in the last few years .
but they fear many more of the jungle dwellers have died through enslavement , violence or from contracting illnesses from which they have no immunity .
the steady advance of logging has forced the isolated groups , among them the mashco-piro and yora tribes , deeper into peru 's jungle frontier with brazil and bolivia .
the hugely profitable but illicit business sees most of the tropical hardwoods exported to the united states .
this has forced the peruvian state to take notice .
the democrat-controlled us congress has said it can not ratify a free trade agreement with peru until makes certain changes , among them adopting and enforcing laws on logging mahogany .
earlier this week , the peruvian president alan garcia provoked criticism from environmentalists when he said the quantity of mahogany which left the country , legally or not , was insignificant .
to many human rights workers the president 's statement confirmed their suspicion that there is little political will to tackle the illegal trade and the isolated people 's reserves might not be worth the paper they are written on .

files released following freedom of information requests show officials warned of the effects of abolishing dividend tax credits , the times says .
the conservatives said mr brown had shown contempt for pensioners .
but treasury minister ed balls said mr brown had scrapped the credits on the " best advice " of civil servants .
losers the papers include advice from officials prior to the chancellor 's decision to scrap tax relief on pension funds in 1997 .
one document , from the inland revenue to the chancellor , concludes : " so , the general message is that the big employer pension schemes will be able to cope at some cost to employers . "
what these papers show is that from the early 1990s , the treasury recognised that dividend tax credits were an anomaly in the tax system " treasury spokesperson " but members of money purchase schemes would all be potential losers .
" outside the pension field there will be small but vocal losers among the holders of tax exempt life insurance policies sold by friendly societies . "
later , it adds : " we agree that abolishing tax credits would make a big hole in pensions scheme finances . "
a separate financial institutions division paper suggests that the pension schemes " should be able to cope " after the reform but warns that there are " risks " .
it adds that future pension benefits would be reduced , share prices could fall by up to 20 % and those on low incomes would be worst affected .
' beggars belief ' bbc personal finance reporter richard scott said the documents made " pretty nasty reading for gordon brown " , adding : " they are going to be extremely damning for him . "
shadow work and pensions secretary philip hammond said they showed mr brown had been " conning the country " .
he added : " it beggars belief that in the face of those clear warnings , gordon brown went ahead with the move that has devastated british pensions and has contributed to the collapse of the savings rate . "
but mr balls , the economic secretary to the treasury , told bbc radio 4 's today programme : " we decided on the basis of civil service advice to go ahead because this was the best thing for the long-term investment of the uk economy . "
" the suggestion that the decisions were made not on the basis of the best civil service advice ... is not true , " mr balls , a long-time ally of the chancellor , added .
a treasury spokesman blamed pension schemes ' recent funding problems on the dotcom crash , pension holidays in the 1980s and 1990s and a rise in life expectancy .
he continued : " the times ' analysis is abject nonsense and a complete travesty of the information they have received .
" what these papers show is that , from the early 1990s , the treasury recognised that dividend tax credits were an anomaly in the tax system which distorted business decisions and discouraged long-term investment .
" they show that we were right to complete the phasing out of dividend tax credits in 1997 , coupled with the reductions in corporation tax which have created the conditions for a 50 % increase in business investment over the last 10 years .
" they show that we were right in the decisions we recommended , and that we never advised against them . "
the documents were produced following the treasury 's withdrawal of an appeal against the information commissioner 's ruling that they should be released .

he continued : " the times ' analysis is abject nonsense and a complete travesty of the information they have received .
" what these papers show is that , from the early 1990s , the treasury recognised that dividend tax credits were an anomaly in the tax system which distorted business decisions and discouraged long-term investment .
" they show that we were right to complete the phasing out of dividend tax credits in 1997 , coupled with the reductions in corporation tax which have created the conditions for a 50 % increase in business investment over the last 10 years .
" they show that we were right in the decisions we recommended , and that we never advised against them . "
the documents were produced following the treasury 's withdrawal of an appeal against the information commissioner 's ruling that they should be released .

the ' bod pod ' measures the air displaced inside the chamber .
photo : pat dalton , university of ulster i regretted suggesting a visit to an obesity clinic almost as soon as the words had left my lips .
but my colleague , bbc producer ed butler , immediately seized upon it as an excellent way of illustrating the increasingly important issue of global obesity .
so i found myself at addenbrooke 's hospital , in the east of england , in the company of dr nick finer , a senior medical consultant on obesity .
dr finer told me to take my shoes off and clamber inside a sort of sealed air chamber called a ' bod pod ' .
" you just climb in there , mark , and i 'll be able to measure how much of your body is fat . "
i climbed in ; the machine started whirring away .
more people in the world are now overweight than underweight it was around eight years ago that the number of overweight people in the world began exceeding the number of underweight people - many of them seriously undernourished .
the figures switched because , contrary to popular prejudice , it 's not just americans and belgians who now tend to be fat .
citizens of the developing world - from mexico , for example , egypt and south africa - are also tipping the scales as overweight .
poverty reduced " since the turn of the century , " said barry popkin , professor of nutrition at the university of north carolina , " we 've seen big reductions in poverty , particularly in india and china . "
" so we 've had large reductions in the number of people who are underweight .
at the same time we 've had far faster increases in the numbers of those overweight . " . between 1.3 billion and 1.6 billion are overweight professor barry popkin , university of north carolina " in every country in the world , the rate of increase in the number becoming overweight and obese has accelerated . "
" so today we have reached a point where we have , depending on the estimates , between 1.3bn and 1.6bn overweight people in the world , but fewer , between 700m and 800m , who are underweight . "
the reasons why more people than ever before are putting on weight are , on the face of it , simple enough ; they eat too many fatty or sweet foods , and do n't do enough exercise .
least healthy but behind that truism are several complex processes .
barry popkin says the way we have organised agriculture is a key factor : " over the past century we have worked very hard to produce cheap beef .
the global price of beef has gone down to about a quarter of its cost in the 1950s .
millions more around the globe can now afford to eat beef " this makes it that much easier for poor people to consume beef , and the same has occurred for edible oils and sugars . "
" these products are the least healthy in terms of producing diabetes , cancer and obesity . "
in contrast to meat , oils and sugars , professor popkin concludes , " we have in global budgetary terms probably invested one thousandth of 1 % in encouraging the consumption of fruit and vegetables . "
back at the controls of ' bod pod ' , dr nick finer was doing calculations about my body mass .
since i know i am a little overweight i was n't overly keen to get the results .
so i tried to distract him with some questions about why we often eat food that is not good for us .
inappropriate messages " in the past , when we were hunter-gatherers , our bodies were programmed to eat what we could when we could , " said dr finer .
" we needed to store food because we did n't know where the next meal would come from . "
but now that agriculture has delivered plenty , the messages our brains give to our bodies may no longer be appropriate .
" the human brain is very good at telling us we are hungry and need food .
but the problem now is that there is always plenty available and the brain is not so good at telling us we have had enough . "
pursuing my diversionary tactics further , i asked dr finer if that meant human beings were therefore predisposed to getting ever fatter and fatter .
" in a world of ever-expanding food supply " , replied dr finer , " and where we do n't expend enough energy through exercise , the answer to that is ' yes ' . "
then he told me my body was about 35 % fat when it should , ideally , be between 25 % and 28 % fat .
so there was no escaping my result .
and the world may not ultimately be able to escape the consequences of the patterns of consumption we have come to demand .

so i tried to distract him with some questions about why we often eat food that is not good for us .
inappropriate messages " in the past , when we were hunter-gatherers , our bodies were programmed to eat what we could when we could , " said dr finer .
" we needed to store food because we did n't know where the next meal would come from . "
but now that agriculture has delivered plenty , the messages our brains give to our bodies may no longer be appropriate .
" the human brain is very good at telling us we are hungry and need food .
but the problem now is that there is always plenty available and the brain is not so good at telling us we have had enough . "
pursuing my diversionary tactics further , i asked dr finer if that meant human beings were therefore predisposed to getting ever fatter and fatter .
" in a world of ever-expanding food supply " , replied dr finer , " and where we do n't expend enough energy through exercise , the answer to that is ' yes ' . "
then he told me my body was about 35 % fat when it should , ideally , be between 25 % and 28 % fat .
so there was no escaping my result .
and the world may not ultimately be able to escape the consequences of the patterns of consumption we have come to demand .

the ' bod pod ' measures the air displaced inside the chamber .
photo : pat dalton , university of ulster i regretted suggesting a visit to an obesity clinic almost as soon as the words had left my lips .
but my colleague , bbc producer ed butler , immediately seized upon it as an excellent way of illustrating the increasingly important issue of global obesity .
so i found myself at addenbrooke 's hospital , in the east of england , in the company of dr nick finer , a senior medical consultant on obesity .
dr finer told me to take my shoes off and clamber inside a sort of sealed air chamber called a ' bod pod ' .
" you just climb in there , mark , and i 'll be able to measure how much of your body is fat . "
i climbed in ; the machine started whirring away .
more people in the world are now overweight than underweight it was around eight years ago that the number of overweight people in the world began exceeding the number of underweight people - many of them seriously undernourished .
the figures switched because , contrary to popular prejudice , it 's not just americans and belgians who now tend to be fat .
citizens of the developing world - from mexico , for example , egypt and south africa - are also tipping the scales as overweight .
poverty reduced " since the turn of the century , " said barry popkin , professor of nutrition at the university of north carolina , " we 've seen big reductions in poverty , particularly in india and china . "
" so we 've had large reductions in the number of people who are underweight .
at the same time we 've had far faster increases in the numbers of those overweight . " . between 1.3 billion and 1.6 billion are overweight professor barry popkin , university of north carolina " in every country in the world , the rate of increase in the number becoming overweight and obese has accelerated . "
" so today we have reached a point where we have , depending on the estimates , between 1.3bn and 1.6bn overweight people in the world , but fewer , between 700m and 800m , who are underweight . "
the reasons why more people than ever before are putting on weight are , on the face of it , simple enough ; they eat too many fatty or sweet foods , and do n't do enough exercise .
least healthy but behind that truism are several complex processes .
barry popkin says the way we have organised agriculture is a key factor : " over the past century we have worked very hard to produce cheap beef .
the global price of beef has gone down to about a quarter of its cost in the 1950s .
millions more around the globe can now afford to eat beef " this makes it that much easier for poor people to consume beef , and the same has occurred for edible oils and sugars . "
" these products are the least healthy in terms of producing diabetes , cancer and obesity . "
in contrast to meat , oils and sugars , professor popkin concludes , " we have in global budgetary terms probably invested one thousandth of 1 % in encouraging the consumption of fruit and vegetables . "

officers from scotland yard will fly out next week , jamaican deputy police chief mark shields told the bbc .
mr woolmer was found strangled in his hotel room on 18 march , the day after pakistan 's surprise defeat to ireland .
pakistan captain inzamam ul-haq has denied his team was guilty of match-fixing in the west indies .
police say they do not yet have any suspects in the case and have appealed for witnesses to come forward .
speaking for the first time since mr woolmer 's murder , inzamam said that none of his team mates were involved in the criminal investigations into the death .
he described the last two weeks as the worst in his life and he said he had been deeply hurt by allegations in the pakistan press about match-fixing .
he blamed the defeat to ireland on a bad pitch .
the pakistan cricket board is to hold a public memorial service for mr woolmer in lahore 's sacred heart cathedral on sunday while a second public memorial service will later be held in cape town , south africa , where mr woolmer had lived with his family .
complex case mr shields said the aim of the small team of scotland yard detectives would be to review the investigation .
mr shields has urged visitors to mr woolmer 's hotel to contact police they will also look at scientific evidence , work with the woolmer family and help guide the jamaican force through what has become a complex case .
scotland yard had offered its help from the beginning of the investigation .
that offer was accepted after a letter from the jamaican government .
reports that police were seeking three pakistani men , said to have fled the caribbean on the day of the murder , have been denied by the jamaican force .
police are still reviewing cctv footage from the hotel and examining the hard drive of mr woolmer 's computer .
detectives believe mr woolmer probably knew his killer - or killers - as there were no signs of forced entry into his room and none of his belongings had been stolen .

better veterinary techniques mean that more dogs than ever are surviving traumatic amputations after accidents .
many dogs who lost a limb may had in the past been put down but advances in surgery , anaesthetics and infection control have saved their lives .
experts said a three-legged dog could cope as well as one with four legs .
the scottish spca 's dog and cat home in cardonald , glasgow , currently has three dogs who have a leg missing who is wants to rehome .
the picture is reported to be the same across the country .
officials said that some owners still turn canine amputees out in favour of new pets . "
people have got to stop thinking ' four legs good , three legs bad " ' anna o 'donnell glasgow dog and cat home in a recent case , a young three-legged mongrel bitch called keisha was dumped in the reception area of the cardonald dog home by a man who said the animal 's owner could no longer look after her .
he fled when asked to bring in a form signed by the owner , releasing the dog for adoption .
as a result , keisha has been treated by the shelter as a stray and will be available for re-homing in a few days .
anna o 'donnell , assistant manager of the glasgow dog and cat home , said : " keisha was dumped in front reception by this guy who then just drove off .
" she 's a sweet wee tan-coloured bitch .
the surgery that 's been done on her leg has been done only about six weeks ago .
" she 's either been in a road traffic accident or she 's had a problem with her limb and it 's had to be removed .
" so she 's gone through all this surgery and now ended up abandoned .
we 've got three three-legged dogs here at the moment .
new start " another of them was found wandering on the railway line just behind us .
we think somebody might actually have dumped it on the line .
" clearly it could have been killed . "
easter is traditionally a busy time for animal shelters , as owners who have bought pets for christmas , against all advice , dump them on the streets when they realise they are getting in the way of their holidays .
officials from the scottish spca are hoping they can quickly re-home keisha and the other two three-legged friends they have at present - a year-old dobermann bitch kim , and eight-year-old mongrel pod , the dog found on the railway - to make room for new arrivals .
ms o 'donnell said : " at one time the three-legged dog used to get the sympathy vote .
" people would come in and take them and we 'd home them on pretty quickly .
they had a rarity value .
" but now through advances in surgery , better anaesthetics and better infection control , there are so many of them surviving when at one time they 'd have been put to sleep .
" we 've got so many in the centres that we struggle to re-home them .
the tragedy is that a dog will manage absolutely fine on three legs .
" they get along on three legs as well as get along on four legs .
people have got to stop thinking ' four legs good , three legs bad ' . "
sspca communications manager doreen graham said : " these dogs have already suffered so much .
they really deserve a new start . "

people have got to stop thinking ' four legs good , three legs bad ' anna o 'donnell glasgow dog and cat home in a recent case , a young three-legged mongrel bitch called keisha was dumped in the reception area of the cardonald dog home by a man who said the animal 's owner could no longer look after her .
he fled when asked to bring in a form signed by the owner , releasing the dog for adoption .
as a result , keisha has been treated by the shelter as a stray and will be available for re-homing in a few days .
anna o 'donnell , assistant manager of the glasgow dog and cat home , said : " keisha was dumped in front reception by this guy who then just drove off .
" she 's a sweet wee tan-coloured bitch .
the surgery that 's been done on her leg has been done only about six weeks ago .
" she 's either been in a road traffic accident or she 's had a problem with her limb and it 's had to be removed .
" so she 's gone through all this surgery and now ended up abandoned .
we 've got three three-legged dogs here at the moment .
new start " another of them was found wandering on the railway line just behind us .
we think somebody might actually have dumped it on the line .
" clearly it could have been killed . "
easter is traditionally a busy time for animal shelters , as owners who have bought pets for christmas , against all advice , dump them on the streets when they realise they are getting in the way of their holidays .
officials from the scottish spca are hoping they can quickly re-home keisha and the other two three-legged friends they have at present - a year-old dobermann bitch kim , and eight-year-old mongrel pod , the dog found on the railway - to make room for new arrivals .
ms o 'donnell said : " at one time the three-legged dog used to get the sympathy vote .
" people would come in and take them and we 'd home them on pretty quickly .
they had a rarity value .
" but now through advances in surgery , better anaesthetics and better infection control , there are so many of them surviving when at one time they 'd have been put to sleep .
" we 've got so many in the centres that we struggle to re-home them .
the tragedy is that a dog will manage absolutely fine on three legs .
" they get along on three legs as well as get along on four legs .
people have got to stop thinking ' four legs good , three legs bad ' . "
sspca communications manager doreen graham said : " these dogs have already suffered so much .
they really deserve a new start . "

at 1930 -lrb- 0930 gmt -rrb- the city 's skyline dimmed and normally bright landmarks like the opera house and the harbour bridge went dark .
the so-called earth hour is supported by the new south wales government , environmental groups and businesses .
sydney hopes the event will make a very big statement on climate change .
the city of four million people is aiming to become the first anywhere to achieve a blackout on this scale .
the bbc 's phil mercer , in sydney , says by and large sydney had never been this dark .
he says lights were off in the majority of the central business district 's office blocks and large parts of the suburbs were also in darkness .
co-operation greg bourne of environmental group wwf , one of the driving forces behind earth hour , said the big switch off took months to plan .
" the logistics is really quite amazing in the sense every tower block is owned by one company , maybe leased by another company , have 10 tenants in and a manager and working through all of these people has been fantastic . "
many restaurants signed up and planned to serve diners by candlelight .
the owner of the newtown hotel , which says it is australia 's oldest gay bar , told the bbc before the blackout that they would have fun while trying to send a serious message .
" sometimes drag queens -lsb- female impersonators -rsb- do look better in the dark anyway , " said roger zee .
" it 's up to the patrons .
they 'll actually have their own torches so they 'll be able to light up the drag queens on the stage themselves . "
organisers want to encourage australians to conserve energy and to think carefully about what they can do to cut pollution .
every day millions of lights and computers are left on in deserted office blocks as well as in apartments and houses .
campaigners have said that simply switching them off could reduce sydney 's greenhouse gas emissions by 5 % over the next year .
australia is one of the world 's largest per capita producers of carbon dioxide and other gases that many scientists believe are helping to warm the earth 's atmosphere .
a selection of your comments we turned our household lights off for earth hour , although realistically it did n't make any difference to the amount of greenhouse gases generated .
i think most sydneysiders saw earth hour as a way of expressing our growing awareness of the need to do something about the factors contributing to climate change rather than a ' fix ' for any part of the problem .
to that extent , it was a success .
phil keeffe , sydney , australia why does n't john howard and his premiers sign up to kyoto instead of pulling off publicity stunts .
perhaps this will get the residents of australia to think and put pressure on their ' leaders ' to do so .
andrew , brisbane -lrb- soon to be edinburgh -rrb- have we already forgotten that paris tried this too on the occasion of the international panel on climate change conference just a month ago ?

what for sydney ?

hong kong made a similar attempt last year but unlike its counterpart in new south wales , the government refused to participate in the campaign , claiming that it would give " adverse publicity to hong kong as an international metropolis " .
let 's hope that the precedent set by sydney will help persuade other cities , and their governments , to follow suit .
c. chan , hong kong it 's true .
sydney has never been so dark .
fantastic !
thank you to wwf for organising such an event .
australian 's are cyring out for ways to get involved and make a difference .
kath eggleston , sydney i live in sydney and i can assure you that the ' blackout ' did n't happen .
the lights on the bridge and opera house were turned off but the publicity stunt was completely ignored by the vast majority of ordinary people here .
the vast majority of people here did not turn off their lights .
nick mallory , sydney amazing !
very glad to hear of something like this happening .
mr. mallory , even if most people did n't turn of their lights , i 'm sure you would agree that the ' stunt ' at least got the world talking and citizens of other large cities wanting / working towards something similar .
